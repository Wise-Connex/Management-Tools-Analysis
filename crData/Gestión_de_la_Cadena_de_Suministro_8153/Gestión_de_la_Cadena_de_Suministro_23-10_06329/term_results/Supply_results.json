      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Modern food supply chains—infused with scientific and engineering innovations—have made food increasingly more affordable and accessible. Yet there is growing concern about the long‐term sustainability of our food system. Over time, the inputs (e.g., water, fertile soil, fossil fuels, and chemicals) and working resources (e.g., land and labor) required for industrial food production and its associated supply chain structure have become more scarce and hence more expensive. At the same time, the by‐products of these farming and supply chain activities (e.g., farm runoff and greenhouse gas emissions) have often created negative externalities on the environment and human health. To improve the sustainability of food production, research from the life sciences recommends adoption of transformative farming methods that incorporate ecological principles in a sustainable approach to farming. Operationally, this approach leverages <jats:italic>economies of scope</jats:italic>. In order to maintain strategic alignment, changing food production methods should be complemented with appropriate changes in the rest of the supply chain, including consumption habits. We propose a research agenda informed by findings from the life sciences, which integrates approaches from supply chain management as well as food and agricultural economics, to align all food supply chain partners with sustainable food production.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\nIndustry 4.0 provides businesses with the tools they need to meet difficulties such as fluctuating demand and unstable markets. Additionally, Industry 4.0 refers to the connectivity of computers, various materials, and artificial intelligence (AI) with minimum involvement from humans in the decision-making process. Although Industry 4.0 has a significant potential for the expansion of the industrial sector, it faces several hurdles, including integration of technology, problems with human resources, problems with supply chains, and data security concerns. The human-centered approach that Industry 5.0 took meant that many of the problems that plagued Industry 4.0 could finally be solved. In the previous generation, known as Industry 4.0, the emphasis was placed on scalability and volume of production; however, in the next generation, known as Industry 5.0, human centricity is the key focus. We have included a list of the different technical improvements that are part of Industry 5.0 as well as the technological advancements that are part of Industry 4.0. The problems that plagued Industry 4.0 have been addressed head-on in Industry 5.0, including concerns over data protection and the integration of new technologies. This study would serve as a foundation for academics and companies to learn about the technologies of Industry 4.0, their obstacles, the technical advancements, and the methods by which Industry 5.0 addressed the issues of Industry 4.0. Also, we constructed an appraiser model to appraise manufacturers as partners in the supply chain. We selected manufacturers that are interested in deploying Industry 5.0 in their operations. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) are contributed to construct an appraiser model under the authority of uncertainty theory entailed in single value neutrosophic sets (SVNSs) to support AHP and COPRAS in ambiguity situations.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article provides new insights into behavioral implications based on biases and heuristics in SCRM. It is argued that biases and heuristics will play an even greater role in SCRM as the rising complexity of risk management systems has increasingly overstrained the cognitive abilities of decision-makers. The main contribution and central finding of the article is the presentation of a wide array of behavioral implications of the selected biases and heuristics for SCRM. It is differentiated between four major SCRM processes: risk identification, risk assessment, risk treatment, and risk monitoring. Focusing on each process individually allows for a dedicated and in-depth presentation of the behavioral implications in SCRM. It is stated that risk identification, where biases and heuristics such as confirmation bias and the availability heuristics can lead to a skewed identification of risks, resulting in omitted risks or the selection of irrelevant risks. In risk assessment, the behavioral implications can be equally severe with the consequence of incorrectly assessing the impact and probability of risks as caused for example through the availability heuristic or representative heuristic. The risk treatment is equally prone to biases and heuristics, as for example loss aversion or planning fallacy can lead to over- or underinvesting in risk treatments as well as wrong estimates about the required costs and effort. The risk monitoring is impacted through biases and heuristics such as the anchoring and adjustment heuristic or the confirmation bias, due to which risk managers carry out insufficient or unnecessary adjustments regarding their risk management system.</jats:p>"

Those who have been diagnosed as infertile have opportunities through reproductive technology to have a child. Invitro fertilization has been marked as one of the most sufficient assisted reproductive technologies. Many infertile couples seek this treatment to increase their chances of conceiving. With any treatment comes the possibility of poor outcomes. This paper is to explore the factors that can alter the success rate of in-vitro fertilization. With conception women already have challenging times, with reproductive technology it gives women an option to have a better success rate of conception. Elective oocyte freezing, fertility preservation, and preimplantation genetic screening of embryos to stop transmission of severe genetic abnormalities are further justifications for using assisted reproductive technology. With recent studies, it is shown that with assisted reproductive technology is constantly advancing with new methods to ensure that women are able to have a high success rate with their conception. It is shown throughout this review, that reproductive technology has advanced, and will be an option to women to have a high success rate with conceiving.</jats:p>"

However, this integration cannot be effective unless the various risks that could adversely affect the sustainability of the SC are managed. Indeed, managing these risks involves first identifying and classifying them, then assessing them, and subsequently suggesting the measures needed to mitigate them. To provide practitioners with a roadmap of supply chain sustainability risks (SCSRs), numerous articles have been published in the literature focusing on the identification, categorization, and assessment of SCSRs. This study carried out a systematic literature review, based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, to systematically analyze these articles. The review highlighted different areas in which SCSRs were identified, classified, and assessed. It also presented various SCSR evaluation frameworks developed in the literature.

The research findings reveal that visibility significantly influences supply chain resilience; while the hypotheses of a positive impact of supply chain visibility and supply chain resilience on firm performance have been rejected. Interestingly, these findings underscore the significant influence of indirect relationships mediated by factors, such as supply chain resilience and supply chain performance.

Environmental problems, the historical layer destruction and social effect of the populated areas flooding were not taken into account. Water is taken from the Kakhovka Reservoir by the North-Crimean Canal, by the Kakhovka Irrigation Canal, and by the North Rogachyn, Upper-Tarasivka, and Nikopol irrigation systems. The total irrigated area of the more than 1.0 million ha was supplied from the Kakhovka Reservoir in the south of Ukraine including the Crimea. The Kakhovka Reservoir is the source of drinking water supply for the large cities of Nikopol, Marganets, Pokrov, Kryvyi Rih, Energodar, as well as the number of rural settlements in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and Crimea. The Kakhovka irrigation system is the largest automated irrigation system in Europe. The Kakhovka canal is the of water supply source for the Syirogozy, Chaplinka, and Pryazov irrigation systems. The canal provides centralized water supply of the Ivanivka group water supply system (20 rural settlements of the Kherson region with the total population of 26.8 thousand people), the Western group water supply system (water supply of the 492 thousand residents of Yakymivka, Melitopol, Pryazovske and Berdiansk districts, Kyrylivka and Pryazovske settlements, Berdiansk city, Prymorsk). The North Crimean Canal supplies water for the irrigation area of approximately 400,000 ha and to the water supply systems of Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia, Kerch and other Crimean settlements. The 7 reservoirs were built to regulate water storage in Crimea. The North Rohachyn irrigation system supplies water to 81,800 ha of agricultural fields. The Dnipro–Kryvyi Rih Canal is designed to provide water to the Kryvyi Rih industrial district and to water 14,700 ha of the Nikopol irrigation system. Nearby is the water intake of the Sofiivka group water supply system, which supplies water to 34 settlements in the Apostolove, Nikopol and Sofiivka districts. The consequences of the Kakhovka Reservoir destruction for water supply and irrigation in the south of Ukraine are significant: the decrease of irrigated land, agriculture damage; decline of river ports; water supply restrictions for industrial enterprises and population of southern Ukraine and Crimea; limitation of the electricity loads; the new decision for cooling system of the ZNPP; ecological changes in the Dnipro delta, salinization of the Dnipro-Bug estuary. Kakhovka Reservoir restoration is necessary condition for the development of southern Ukraine, which will require significant financial and human resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain environmental risks are pivotal situational factors that significantly influence the intricate relationship between a business’s supply chain agility, supply chain resilience, and its ultimate supply chain performance. This study aims to explore the interplay between supply chain agility, supply chain resilience, and supply chain performance, while also investigating the moderating effect of supply chain environmental risks. Data analysis was conducted using hierarchical regression based on a questionnaire survey involving 416 companies in Taiwan’s manufacturing supply chain. The findings reveal several key insights. Firstly, supply chain agility has a positive influence on supply chain resilience, highlighting the importance of a flexible and responsive supply chain to handle challenges effectively. Secondly, supply chain resilience plays a vital role in determining supply chain performance, underscoring its significance in maintaining operational efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, the study identifies that supply chain environmental risks can act as a positive moderator in the relationship between supply chain agility and supply chain resilience. In other words, when faced with environmental risks, companies with higher supply chain agility can leverage this capability to reinforce their supply chain resilience, leading to improved supply chain performance. Additionally, the results shed light on the mediating role of supply chain resilience between supply chain agility and supply chain performance. This suggests that a resilient supply chain acts as an intermediary mechanism through which the positive effects of supply chain agility translate into enhanced overall performance. Given the uncertain and turbulent market environment today, these findings emphasize the importance of adopting supply chain agility and supply chain resilience as indispensable business strategies. Therefore, enterprise leaders and managers should proactively implement measures to enhance these aspects of their supply chain to effectively navigate and overcome environmental risks, ultimately driving supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Calculations of internal ring networks of buildings have always been, are and will be an urgent task. The schemes of internal hot water supply systems change, the number of floors of buildings changes, the location of heating points from which hot water begins its journey to the consumer changes, the definition of water consumption changes, and finally the calculations themselves change, but it is undoubtedly the calculation methods for centralised hot water supply systems that are a key part of creating reliable and economical hot water supply networks in buildings. Modern methods consist of three different calculations: the supply part of the system, the circulation part with the determination of pressure losses in the entire system, and the thermal disinfection mode of the system. The circulation flow rate methodology widely used in Ukraine is based on a 1985 regulatory document and borrowed part of the calculation from the 1992 Polish regulations. As a result, questions arise that are not answered in the DBN. In terms of determining the heat losses of individual sections of the hot water system, not everything is perfect either. A building is designed for a lifespan of 50 years or more with daily, round-the-clock use of heat energy, and the heat consumption for preparation and transportation of hot water is the largest in the building and requires a detailed calculation. The DBN \"Internal Water Supply and Sewerage\" provides two figures for all cases: 11 and 7 W/m (specific heat losses by pipes of the internal hot water supply network). The calculated surface temperature of the pipes in different parts of the network varies, the air temperature in the premises through which the pipes pass varies, and the diameters of the pipes in certain areas change, but the two figures remain unchanged. Moreover, it is recommended that, regardless of the insulation material used for pipe insulation, the insulation thickness should be at least 10 mm. This may have been appropriate in 1985, when there were no computer programs for calculations and fewer thermal insulation materials, but now it is 2023 and the situation is completely different. The article, after analysing the regulatory documents, proposes a methodology for determining the circulation flow rate and calculating the hot water supply network in the mode of passing this flow rate.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The agricultural sector throughout the world has seen shifting significantly by suitably using e-technology. A good number of studies have been conducted on agriculture and food security. The growth rate of world organic farming or business increases to more than the growth rate of traditional agriculture. In Bangladesh the pace of growth of organic agriculture is insignificant. The organic agriculture or organic supply chain in Bangladesh was scarcely studied. Hence, an intensive study is needed for the organic agriculture industry to pursue the organic supply chain that leads to a promising growth of organic business.  A great deal of research has been conducted to explore the factors that may influence the organic supply chain and growth of the organic business. Several theories such as the diffusion of innovation theory, theory of planned behavior, marketing system and price of organic products, and quality function deployment have been studied and proposed to enhance the understanding of the issue. The integration of all these literature and theories has attracted the researcher’s attention. Thus, this study aims to explore the influence of information systems, e-technology, and the dynamics of the actors (consumer, retailer, intermediaries, transporter, farmer, and basic suppliers) on the organic supply chain enhancing the growth of the organic business. By adopting secondary data with collected data (primary data) using self-administrated questionnaires the research work was evaluated. A total of 389 responses from the organic agriculture industrial actors, consumers, and transporters were collected using stratified random sampling methods. To inspect and analyze data, Path Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) techniques were used with AMOS. The results of the study indicated that the proposed model provided a good understanding of the factors influencing the organic supply chain.  From the result, it was also revealed that the organic supply chain has a significant impact on the growth of organic farming and organic consumers and the performance of organic businesses. The research objectives of this study were accomplished and all research hypotheses were supported. This study theoretically offers useful information and collected data might help to further research relevant to the organic supply chain. In addition, the study finds a way to foster a better understanding and knowledge of the organic supply chain. It is encouraged to do future research to study the factors and information and impact of the organic supply chain from various aspects.Keywords: organic supply chain, e-technology, organic agriculture, growth of organic business, SEM, AMOS</jats:p>"

The framework improves the precision of demand forecasts while maintaining data integrity and openness through the use of machine learning algorithms and blockchain technologies. Demand data is collected and preprocessed, machine learning models are applied, and blockchain is used to validate and secure the data. Results from experiments show that the framework is useful, with significant gains in accuracy and recall compared to more conventional methods. The results show the promise of merging machine learning with blockchain in demand forecasting, giving supply chain professionals a potent instrument with which to enhance the effectiveness of inventory management and overall operations. To fully reap the benefits of this approach, more study into scalability and implementation difficulties is necessary.</jats:p>",

However, challenges such as data quality and compatibility, organizational resistance to change, and lack of trust in AI technology were identified as barriers to successful implementation. These findings contribute to the understanding of the current state and future direction of AI in SCM, and provide practical implications for managers seeking to use AI-based solutions in their supply chain operations.</jats:p>",

The novelty of this research is applying the SCOR model to holistically measure the blood supply chain's performance and determine the leading causes of low performance. The total value of supply chain performance is 77.78, which is a good category. The results show that Five matrices fall into the low-performance process on the Production attribute (28.24), Capacity Utilization Screening (37.50), Capacity Utilization of Blood Quarantine Storage Cabinets (39.01), Capacity Utilization of Healthy Blood (44.44), and Capacity Utilization Crossmatch (33.3).

Coupled with the size of supply chains and availability of vast amounts of data, efforts towards tackling such challenges have led to an increasing interest towards the application of machine learning methods in many aspects of supply chains. Compared to other solution methods, machine learning methods particularly perform better in making predictions based on a set of observations and approximating optimal solutions faster. Machine learning methods are called for analyzing very large datasets. This paper presents an automated machine learning framework to enhance the supply chain security such as detection of fraudulent activities, prediction of maintenance needs, and material backorder prediction. Results indicate that many factors affect the performance of ML methods such as sampling method, encoding categorical values, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization for different algorithms. In general, the number of variables poses a limit for mathematical programming models to performance on large-scale problem. The automated machine learning framework streamlines the processes including data processing, models construction, hyperparameter optimization and inference deployment. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge on supply chain security by developing an automated machine learning framework to detect fraud and to predict supply chain maintenance needs and material backorder.</p>"

A facility-based cross- sectional study was conducted across 27 selected health facilities in the state. Facilities were selected using a stratified random sampling technique. Data was collected using a combination of a semi-structured questionnaire and observational checklists adapted from a previous study and the Logistics Indicators Assessment Tool (LIAT). Data obtained were analyzed using SPSS software (version 23). A total number of 44 focal personnel managing the HIV/AIDS supply chain in 17 secondary health centres (SHCs) and 10 primary health centres (PHCs) participated in the study. Tenofovir/Lamivudine/Dolutegravir (300/300/50mg) and Nevirapine 10mg/ml oral suspension were the two most available drugs at 85.19% and 78% respectively whereas Determine and Uni-Gold were the most available non- drug commodities at 92.59%, and 81.48% respectively during the lockdown period. The Stat-Pak test kit was stocked out in 30% of the facilities during the lockdown with emergency orders of at least one HIV commodity recorded in 37% of the facilities during this period. Expired products were recorded in 48% of the health facilities and this amounted to a loss of USD 4,027.25. The COVID-19 crisis exposed vulnerabilities in Anambra State's HIV/AIDS commodity supply chain. Instances of emergency orders, stock-outs, and wastage highlight the need for a more resilient system. Investing in an agile supply chain is crucial for ensuring uninterrupted access to essential healthcare commodities during disruptions.</jats:p>"

Although a growing body of research has been dedicated to addressing this challenge, the role of purchasing and supply management (PSM) in sustainable supply network development remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the literature on the role of PSM in the diffusion of sustainability in supply networks. We analysed 133 peer‐reviewed papers published in 21 journals in the field of PSM. We scrutinized the theories, methods and levels of analysis used in sustainable PSM research, classified the practices for diffusing sustainability in supply networks and identified the role of PSM in the diffusion of sustainability. Accordingly, we put forward a set of propositions that link diffusion practices—and the role of PSM in these practices—with embedded and peripheral sustainability and suggest future research directions.</jats:p>",

Despite SCM's recognition as a key factor in enhancing healthcare efficiency, widespread adoption remains in its infancy. Hospitals, a crucial element of the healthcare supply chain (HSC), have failed to fulfill the primary goals of lowering costs and providing high-quality treatment due to their inadequate knowledge of supply chain management (SCM). This research was conducted to fill in the blanks in the current HSC literature. Achieving the healthcare supply chain's goal of reducing costs will be greatly aided by the thorough literature study completed for this report. This review of healthcare supply chain management can quantify the benefits of supply chain initiatives and identify opportunities for improvement. Healthcare institutions can make informed decisions on optimizing their supply chains by understanding customer and supplier needs. This includes making strategic decisions on how to improve inventory management, streamline processes and reduce costs. The focus of this study is on the relationship between supply chain practices, the efficiency of supply chain performance, and the financial outcomes for healthcare organizations. By highlighting certain key research issues that are shared by supply chain management and healthcare management, this article contributes to the literature in both areas.</ns3:p>"

This innovative approach leverages technology and data-driven decision-making to optimize every stage of the supply chain, from animal production to consumption. This abstract provides an overview of the key themes discussed in the comprehensive paper.In the first section, we offer an in-depth look at the principles of PLF in global food supply chains, covering the entire continuum from production to consumption. The adoption of PLF practices enhances efficiency, transparency, and sustainability in the industry.The second section delves into the diverse applications of PLF, highlighting its role in improving production efficiency, product quality, supply chain transparency, sustainability metrics, and offering consumer-centric products to meet individual preferences.The paper then examines the advantages of PLF, including resource efficiency, improved product quality, enhanced supply chain resilience, and the establishment of consumer trust and loyalty. These benefits contribute to the sustainable and transparent growth of the food supply chain.In the fourth section, we address the challenges and considerations associated with integrating PLF. These encompass technology adoption hurdles, data security and privacy concerns, the necessity of education and awareness, and the importance of regulatory compliance.Lastly, the future directions of PLF in the global food supply chain are explored. This includes the potential for widespread global adoption, the increasing role of advanced analytics, the integration of blockchain technology for transparency, and the role of PLF in reducing the environmental footprint of the industry.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of the current research was to explore the relationship between supply chain integration and supply chain responsiveness in the electronics manufacturing industry in Guangdong, China. The research model conceptualized supply chain integration (comprising business process integration, system integration, and activity integration) as a key resource impacting the capability of firms to respond efficiently to changing consumer demands and market conditions. This research utilized the questionnaire to gathered data from 420 supply chain management professionals from electronics manufacturers in China. The gathered data was analyzed using PLS-SEM, which allowed us to examine the relationships between supply chain responsiveness, business process integration, activity integration and systems integration. The results obtained were interpreted and discussed in the context of previous literature and theories. The study findings reveal a positive correlation between the three aspects of supply chain integration and supply chain responsiveness. Respondents agreed that business process integration (mean = 4.822, standard deviation = 1.825), system integration (mean = 4.965, standard deviation = 1.809), and activity integration (mean = 5.243, standard deviation = 1.792) were essential determinants in developing supply chain responsiveness. This indicates that a higher level of integration in these areas can significantly enhance a firm’s ability to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the market. These findings are consistent with prior research, suggesting that these forms of integration are critical for supply chain performance. In the context of the electronics manufacturing industry in China, this research further validates the importance of these variables. Business process integration is first investigated as the determinant of supply chain responsiveness, especially in the electronics manufacturing companies of China. This study is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, one of the first to investigate the link between business process integration and supply chain responsiveness. Meanwhile, it is also seen as the new test of examining the influence of system and activity integration on supply chain responsiveness in the current business environment. The truth from the data analysis illustrated that even in the new business environment, both integration constructs (system integration and system integration) could affect the supply chain’s responsiveness. The study’s results provide valuable insights for practitioners and policy-makers in the electronics manufacturing industry. By focusing on enhancing business process integration, system integration, and activity integration, firms can increase their responsiveness to the dynamic market environment, thus improving overall performance. </jats:p>",

To examine their correlations, a survey was administered among professionals in supply chain-related departments in South Korea. Subsequently, we tested hypotheses through structural equation modeling using SPSS 18.0 and AMOS 18.0.\r\nFindings - We found that all the components of the triangular theory of love—intimacy, passion, and commitment—significantly positively impacted information sharing. Moreover, we confirmed that information sharing significantly positively impacts logistics performance, which can represent supply chain performance.\r\nResearch Implications - Based on these results, the following conclusions can be drawn: To form new business relationships and measure performance, fundamental human relationships between supply chain participants are crucial, as is the development of tools to quantitatively measure these relationships. For quantitative performance, information sharing based on human relationships is necessary. Therefore, as qualitative relationships and quantitative performance are increasing proportionally, supply chain participants must recognize their importance.</jats:p>",

Individual is a micro-order having economic and non-economic factors, shadows of scenario, and it works and takes decisions in the combined system of soul, body, and instruments of activity. Welfare is a macro concept, but it can be achieved by the aggregate behavior of a micro unit, which is an individual. The micro approach reveals that the decision to embody the spirit of sacrifice and selfless service without disregarding one’s own integrates the cause of life and livelihood both for oneself and others. Welfare, peace, and happiness can be secured through action or work, which is the supply-side behavior of an individual. Such microfoundations for welfare highlight the importance of supplyside behavior from all stakeholders in society. Supply-side economics is a different concept that is based on economic rationality. Here, the supply-side behavior is normative in nature. The approach calls for taking care of the welfare of others besides our own. Indian economic thoughts and ancient literature all have this broader outlook. The paper is divided into four sections: introduction, individual as micro-order, background basis, different concepts and dimensions of supply-side behavior, and conclusion.

This is particularly relevant given the ongoing debate on the proposal for a regulation on substances of human origin (SoHO). Data indicated that when donors are remunerated and therefore donate very frequently, the safety of the patients receiving these donations and the donors themselves is at risk. Moreover, when donations were VNRD compared to remunerated, PDMP prices increased less between 2018 and 2023 and were therefore more cost-effective for patients and healthcare systems. Lastly, the supply of plasma was found to be more resilient during the COVID-19 pandemic when donors were non-remunerated compared to when they were remunerated. In addition, once countries implement remuneration, it cannot be reversed without risking the supply. We strongly urge policy makers to rely on empirical evidence as a basis for decision-making regarding the proposal for a regulation on SoHO.</p>"

Nowadays during the post pandemic period (2021-2022), some industries slowed down significantly, while some sectors moved up. In this period, logistics performance gains more importance and the implemented supply chain strategy plays a significant role for companies. Therefore, the study's objective is to determine the impact of supply chain strategies on logistics performance in production companies operating in Gaziantep industrial zone. The covid-19 pandemic brought a lot of uncertainties to all industries which caused supply chain disruptions. These disruptions could be controlled with lean supply chain (LSC) and agile supply chain (ASC) strategies which are also considered as independent variables of this study. Logistics performances that are expected to be affected by these two supply chain strategies are considered in four dimensions such as quality, flexibility, cost, and speed and reliability. Data were collected from 154 businesses by surveys and analyzes were made. The results of the analysis showed that an ASC strategy affects all logistics performance dimensions (quality, flexibility, cost, and speed and reliability). But the LSC strategy did not affect any of these dimensions. It has been concluded that manufacturers should adopt an ASC strategy, which aims to respond more quickly to environmental changes, instead of a LSC strategy, in order to achieve higher logistics performance during periods of intense supply chain disruptions and uncertainties, such as after the post Covid-19 pandemic.</jats:p>"

Recent anomalies in the global supply chain have negatively influenced the performance of institutions throughout the globe. It is therefore advantageous to examine various antecedents of firm performance through the spectrum of supply chain management. To achieve this, an SOR framework was utilized for this study.\r\nDesign/Methodology/Approach - A hypothesized model was developed to examine the relationship between the study constructs. The sample for this research comprised of 200 South Korean firms. Data were analyzed using Smart PLS-SEM analysis. All the constructs were analyzed through a SOR framework.\r\nFindings - Supply chain alliance orientation and supply chain resilience had a significantly positive effect on market performance. Likewise, it was found that supply chain dynamism encouraged supply chain alliance orientation in a supply chain. Further, the mediating effects of alliance orientation showed a positive effect on supply chain resilience and market performance. Similarly, supply chain resilience had a favorable mediating relationship between supply chain alliance orientation and market performance.\r\nResearch Implications - The SOR framework can be used as model for understanding organizational behavior in the context of supply chain management. Also, the study findings suggest the importance of developing alliances to strengthen organizational operations during periods of supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dumai City is a significant economic hub in Riau Province and a vital location for food distribution. Although it's an urban area, there is still a small amount of rice produced in Dumai City. However, most of the rice supply comes from various suppliers outside the region to meet the high demand. Due to this diverse supply chain, this study aims to analyze the structure, mechanisms, and performance of the marketing in the premium rice supply chain at each level of the marketing institution. This research was conducted using a survey method among marketing actors at each level of marketing institutions selected purposively. To analyze the structure and mechanism of the rice supply chain, qualitative analysis is used. Quantitative analysis is used to analyze marketing performance in the rice supply chain. The research method used was a survey of rice marketing institutions in Dumai City, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods. The results show that three marketing institutions are involved in marketing rice in Dumai City, each with a unique supply chain. Upon analyzing the marketing performance of the premium rice supply chain, it was found that all marketing channels utilized by wholesalers and retailers are efficient. Among these channels, channel 3, supplier-wholesaler-end consumer, has the smallest margin value, while channel 2, out-of-town distributor-traditional retailer-end consumer, has the highest profit-cost ratio value of 125.67. This marketing channel offers the lowest price for premium rice at the end consumer level, thereby ensuring greater access to food for the community and promoting urban food resilience. Among these channels, channel 2 of retailers that were out-of-town distributor-traditional retailer-end consumers had the best marketing efficiency value (0,09%) and the highest profit-cost ratio value of 125.67. Based on the results of this research, it is a challenge for the development of local rice agro-industry in creating efficient marketing performance to strengthen regional food security.</jats:p>",

Food loss is defined as the loss of a portion of food that is still raw but cannot be processed into a food product because the resulting material does not meet the desired quality. Food loss occurs in livestock production, and one focus is the milk supply chain. Food loss in milking usually occurs due to activities carried out during the harvest, post-harvest, and distribution processes. Food loss in the milk supply chain is caused by decreased milk quality and the farmer's attitude. Problems regarding the attitude of farmers that often occur are farmers' low attitude of responsibility to conduct something. This study aims to determine the effect of farmer attitudes to food loss in the milk supply chain. The method used was quantitative by collecting data from a survey of 46 milk farmers in Bayumas. Then, data were analyzed using the ANOVA approach. The results showed that demographics significantly affect farmers’ attitudes toward food loss in the milk supply chain. The food loss is due to farmers' treatments, including feeding, filtering milk into milk cans, and depositing milk in the shelter. Most farmers are over 50 and need more attention and knowledge about food loss in the milk supply chain. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct regular counseling programs for farmers in the supply chain regarding food loss mitigation. The stakeholders can provide the program to add new insights related to food loss. There should be intervention from the deposit shelter and cooperative in helping to increase farmers' awareness of food loss in quantity and quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains – a web of organisations and actors from raw material to consumption – are no longer linear; they instead make up a network of interconnected and overlapping global suppliers. Simultaneously, climate change has become one of, if not the greatest challenge of the modern world, materialised by increasing temperatures and sea levels, and intensified extreme weather events. This era of increased turbulence needs new ways of thinking to build resilience strategies in the face of such disruptions. Supply chain resilience (SCR) strategies have typically been based on an equilibrium-seeking system whereby the goal is to bounce back to the pre-disruption state or bounce forward to a better state. This research borrows the Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) perspective which acknowledges the environment as a continuously evolving system that responds to multiscale interactions and feedback between different actors. This CAS perspective of SCR seeks to maintain the core functionality by adapting, evolving, and transforming to the dynamic environment. This research aims to explore the interrelationship between SCR and climate change across multiple temporal and spatial scales through multiple case studies. In this presentation, I will display initial findings from the pilot study focusing on three cases of New Zealand multinationals. These findings are formed exclusively through secondary data collected from case study, company reports and documents, press releases and databases, which will later be used to complement interviews and focus groups with companies’ executives. I will demonstrate how increased collaboration and agility along the supply chain is needed in the face of increasing climate related disruptions. Given that supply chain interactions are a major contributor to climate change, this presentation also intends to explore ways in which supply chains can operate more sustainability as part of a continuously evolving process of resiliency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>The rural handicrafts industry is a highly fragmented industry with many small-scale businesses. Despite its cultural and economic importance, this industry encounters challenges like intermediary exploitation, restricted market entry, and lack of a credible product authentication system, making it susceptible to competition from cheaper machine-made alternatives. It can lead to loss of sales and reputational damage endangering both the artisans' livelihoods and the craft's sustainability. To address these challenges, establishing end-to-end visibility within the rural handicrafts supply chain offers enhanced transparency, traceability, and authentication. This fosters trust among the various participants in the supply chain. However, ensuring the integrity of the supply chain data is essential, necessitating a mechanism to secure production process information, verify product and artisan authenticity, and enable transparent transactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-enabled crafts supply chain for rural artisans and presents an innovative implementation approach using the real data (artisan and product profiles) from rural kantha artisans in Birbhum district, West Bengal. By leveraging the decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature of blockchain, our approach provides a practical framework that could be adapted to other similar contexts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain financing has become a vital tool for businesses to enhance their operational efficiency and competitiveness in today's dynamic market environment. This research aims to explore the impact of supply chain financing on business efficiency and competitiveness. The study examines how supply chain financing can improve cash flow management, optimize inventory management, and foster collaboration among supply chain partners. By providing timely access to working capital, supply chain financing helps businesses optimize their cash flow, reduce receivables collection time, and minimize the need for costly short-term borrowing. This enhances financial stability and enables companies to meet their financial obligations promptly. Furthermore, supply chain financing offers flexible financing options, such as inventory financing and vendor-managed inventory programs, which enable companies to optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and lower holding costs. This allows businesses to respond quickly to market demands, reduce lead times, and improve overall supply chain efficiency.In addition, supply chain financing platforms facilitate the sharing of financial information and streamline payment processes, enhancing transparency and trust among supply chain partners.

The results indicate that: i) if the PB-producer or NEV-manufacturer hold shares in one direction, it only changes its decision variables, but not affects the decision variables of supply chain partners, while if the cross-shareholding is made, the decision level of the firm is higher than that in the one-way shareholding and firms without shareholdings; ii) any shareholding strategies increase the low-carbon goodwill, and if the cross-shareholding is made, the goodwill is the highest; iii) one-way shareholding promotes the profit of the shareholder, and if the marginal profit of the stakeholder is small, the overall profit of the stakeholder will be lower; iv) there exist certain conditions that make the firm’s profit under the cross-shareholding strategy is higher than that under the unidirectional shareholding strategy; v) the variation of emission reduction level, low carbon goodwill and firm’s profits converge to the steady state level over time, and the steady state values are independent of their initial values, which are related to the shareholding strategy in the power battery supply chain. This paper providers management implications for choosing shareholding strategies to improve emission reduction level, low carbon goodwill, and firm’s profits in the power battery supply chain.</jats:p>"

The ecological degradation functions for rivers and wetlands were developed using a fuzzy approach and data-driven model. The net farming revenue was considered as the economic index to maximize benefits. The root mean square error (RMSE) and the Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) were applied to evaluate ecological models. According to the results, the optimal cropping pattern simultaneously minimizes environmental impacts due to irrigation supply and maximizes farmers’ benefits. The optimal cropping pattern provides more than 50% of the ideal net revenue on the catchment scale, which means that ecological degradations due to reductions in inflow in rivers and wetlands, as well as farmers’ revenue losses, are minimized simultaneously. Furthermore, the results indicate that cropping patterns should be dynamic, which means that changing the cropping pattern annually based on the available water is essential to mitigating ecological impacts. This study demonstrates that the linking of cropping pattern optimization and environmental flow simulation in freshwater bodies should be considered in land-use policies due to the impact of cropping patterns on environmental degradation in wetland catchments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In supply chain management (SCM), goods and services flow from the raw materials stage to the end user with complexities and uncertainty at each stage. Computer modeling and simulation is a particularly useful method to examine supply chain operational issues because it can solve operational complexities that are challenging and time consuming to analyze. Manufacturing companies fear losing valuable time and assets during the manufacturing process; the inaccurate estimation of raw materials, human capital, or physical infrastructure not only leads to monetary loss for the manufacturing unit, but also has a detrimental effect on the environment. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that system dynamics modeling (SDM) in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) can be applied to apparel manufacturing to optimize materials, labor, and equipment usage. Utilizing system dynamics (SD), the manufacturing unit can improve sustainability by reducing materials, labor, and equipment usage, which in turn reduces energy use. In our literature review, we did not identify any study addressing supply chain simulation of the manufacturing of shirts using SDM. We chose shirt manufacturing to demonstrate the model because of its relatively simple manufacturing process. In our study, we conclude that SDM simulation is an efficient way to optimize materials, labor, and equipment in apparel manufacturing. This leads to a more sustainable manufacturing process, as the model simulates different manufacturing supply chain scenarios in a risk-free environment, thereby minimizing waste and resources. Further, the outputs from the STELLA® model can be used as inputs into a subsequent life cycle assessment (LCA) model to determine the quantitative environmental impacts.</jats:p>"

From the point of view of agriculture, this issue is closely related to ecological balance, economic development and social stability. Therefore, fair, efficient and sustainable allocation of water resources for users and decision-making is essential. This paper presents a dynamic stochastic programming model that predicts soil moisture content in a growing season based on data collected from an experimental farm. The model included three types of loam soil, silt loam and clay loam with three treatments of irrigation intervals of 3, 7, 10 and 14 days and three amounts of water allocation with three replications. The proposed framework was evaluated with two criteria of spatial and temporal equity, and the optimal water allocation was analyzed based on this criterion. The results showed that the criterion of temporal equity for loam soil with 7-day irrigation intervals is more than twice that of 14-day irrigation intervals. In addition, the depth of irrigation has had the greatest impact on the fluctuations of the criterion of equity in water allocation in the growing season.</jats:p>",

An integer programming model is therefore established, aiming to minimize the total energy consumption for executing all pickup tasks and the total penalty costs imposed on early and late deliveries. The epsilon constraint method is utilized to verify the validity of the proposed model. To solve this problem which is inherently NP-hard, a Quantum-Levy and variable neighborhood-enhanced multi-objective honey badger algorithm (QLVNMHBA) is proposed. Taking advantages of both Quantum behavior and Levy flight, the Quantum-Levy strategy is presented to enhance the exploration. Simultaneously, the adaptive variable neighborhood search including three innovative neighborhood operators is designed to enhance the exploitation and fasten the convergence speed. Furthermore, the convex lens imaging opposition-based learning is applied to initialize the population. Finally, computational experiments reveal that the QLVNMHBA outperforms the other four state-of-the-art algorithms in both solution quality and convergence speed, and the use of heterogeneous fleet could achieve significant reductions in energy consumption over a homogeneous one. Moreover, a specific case is applied to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model and algorithm.</p>"

Proactive risk reduction is essential for achieving this agility. To facilitate real-time risk prevention and improve agility, this research study proposes an innovative strategy that makes use of machine learning as well as predictive analytics approaches. Traditional supply chain risk management frequently uses post-event analysis as well as historical data, which restricts its ability to address real-time interruptions. This research, on the other hand, promotes a futuristic methodology that uses predictive analytics to foresee possible disruptions. Based on contextual and historical data, machine learning models can be trained to find patterns and correlations as well as anomalies that point to imminent dangers. Organizations can identify risks as they arise and take preventative measures by incorporating these models into a real-time monitoring system. This study examines numerous predictive analytics methods, showing how they can be used to spot supply chain risks. These methods include time series analysis and anomaly detection as well as natural language processing. Additionally, risk assessment models are continuously improved and optimized using machine learning algorithms, assuring their accuracy and adaptability in changing contexts. This research clarifies the symbiotic relationship among predictive analytics and machine learning as well as supply chain agility using a synthesis of theoretical discourse and practical evidence. Case studies from various sectors highlight the usefulness and advantages of the suggested strategy. The advantages of this novel technique include improved risk visibility and quicker response times as well as the capacity to quickly modify operations. The development of a holistic framework that incorporates predictive analytics and machine learning into risk management procedures, setting the path for real-time risk identification as well as mitigation, is one of the theoretical contributions. On the practical side, the case studies offered in this paper show the actual benefits as well as the adaptability of the proposed approach across a wide range of businesses.</jats:p>"

The VIM vulnerability factors considered encompass the failure rate, chemical stability of water, and issues related to water corrosion properties in water distribution subsystems. The obtained risk assessment includes parameters such as the probability of hazard occurrence, the consequences of these hazards, and vulnerability to them. This concept was evaluated using real operational data from the water distribution subsystem. The estimated risk level, under the given operating conditions, indicates its acceptability.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to find the most appropriate algorithm(s) with minimum prediction errors to predict the costs of the BT-enabled PSC model. This paper also aims to determine the importance and cost of each component of the multi-function model. To reach these goals, we combined four Supervised Learning algorithms (KNN, DT, SVM, and NB) with two Evolutionary Computation algorithms (HS and PSO) after data generation. Each component of the multi-function model has its own importance, and we applied the Feature Weighting approach to analyse their importance. Next, four performance metrics evaluated the multi-function model, and the Total Ranking Score determined predictive algorithms with high reliability. The results indicate the HS-NB and PSO-NB algorithms perform better than the other six algorithms in predicting the costs of the multi-function model with small errors. The findings also show that the Raw Materials cost has a stronger influence on the model than the other components. This study also introduces the components of the multi-function BT-enabled PSC model.</jats:p>"

This study took advantage of a period of unprecedented levels of awareness about water security in order to investigate households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for reliable water supply and their WTP to avoid environmental damages in securing this supply. Increasing the supply of water from dams and groundwater will ultimately impact on aquatic ecosystems, but alternatives are more expensive. We surveyed 248 households from 105 suburbs and used contingent valuation methods to investigate WTP for both secure and less damaging or ‘greener’ ways of supplying water. Depending on income level, households were willing to pay 63–127% more for their normal levels of consumption in order to have security of supply, and a further 35–68% more to ensure its environmental sustainability.  Based on the relationship between WTP for 7 income categories, the overall WTP for secure water supply under non-drought conditions amounted to some 2.8 billion ZAR/year, which is about 90% higher than pre-drought revenues.  Aggregate WTP for securing this supply using options that ensured the protection of the region’s rivers and estuaries was 3.3 billion ZAR. These results have an important bearing on water investment and pricing decisions over the longer term.</jats:p>"

Water transfer is one of the options of water management, which is done to allocate water to the agricultural, domestic and industrial sectors and reduces the ecosystem's share of natural water resources. Food supply, industrial development and population growth are the phenomena of the present condition, which are opposed to the ecosystem services that the future generation needs. This study has been carried out in order to develop an optimal control model for the allocation of a natural water resource considering irreversibility. This method is inspired by the Krutilla–Fisher model, which was developed in the form of the possibility of improving agricultural water management. The results showed that by applying optimal management in 25% of agricultural water use, it is possible to provide 100 and 65% of the ecosystem's water requirements in winter and summer, respectively. It showed that the allocation of river water for different uses in the current situation does not follow an optimal policy. In fact, it exacerbates environmental irreversibility in the ecosystem.</jats:p>",

Its two major themes are improving the energy efficiency of devices (appliances and processes) and changing people’s behaviour towards using less energy. In our analysis of a nation’s energy security, we treat Demand Reduction as an additional fuel which delivers ‘negafuel’, allowing a particular level of energy services to be met at a lower volume of supply than would be possible in its absence. In common with other fuels, negafuel is delivered by a supply chain with linked stages, all encountering risks of various types. A comprehensive survey of these risks in a case study of the UK shows that Demand Reduction belongs to a middle-ranking group of fuels in terms of overall risk. High-level risks encountered include the difficulty of assessing and delivering potential energy savings, the rate of building construction at the highest energy efficiency standards, optimism bias, changing policy and regulation, and operational failure (both of technology and policy). Assessing the risk of Demand Reduction as a supplied negafuel focuses attention on specific risks requiring mitigation, facilitating design of better policy, and more effective commercial products.</jats:p>",

One of the effective ways to improve the efficiency of these systems is to evaluate the role of flow estimation in improving performance indicators such as reliability and vulnerability. In the correlation of water, energy and food, the purpose of decision-making is to achieve a balance between water extraction and energy consumption, which will lead to a reduction in the risk of supplying the water needed by the plant during periods of drought stress. In this article, a decision-making method using discrete wavelet transform and primal-dual algorithm is introduced to estimate the amount of monthly groundwater extraction. The proposed model has been evaluated by the Nash–Sutcliffe method and the mean squared error and optimized to increase the reliability of agricultural water supply. The results indicate the strong role of the accuracy of the proposed method in the efficiency of the aforementioned policies, as it has shown an 8% increase in reliability.</jats:p>",

We apply the concept of sustainable supplier development in an agri-food context in a developing economy. The study aims to create a theoretical framework that explains how initiatives by buyers (often processors in the agri-food industry) to develop farmers can result in sustainable farmer performance. Collectively, the propositions derived by us via a literature synthesis propose that farmer development leads to farmer capability development and improved relationships (with the buyer), enabling the farmer to achieve sustainable performance (i.e., performance in economic, social, and environmental domains). The importance of the study from a theory building perspective is that the study attempts to reconcile the supply chain management literature on supplier development in tangible goods manufacturing with the agribusiness literature in developing economies whether or not the farmer occupies the bottom of the income pyramid. The study is also important to academia and policymakers because it acts as a forerunner for the further development of the theoretical model and its testing with a large sample of data to interpret what the results imply from practical and theoretical standpoints.</jats:p>"

An efficient and stable supply chain of medical equipment (masks, goggles, protective coveralls, etc.) enables medical workers and first responders to effectively and safely fight against this highly contagious disease. In my research, I design and investigate two agents based on the traditional (s,Q) policy and the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm and apply them respectively to optimize a two-echelon medical equipment supply chain where one distribution center and multiple retailers are involved. To my knowledge, this is the first implementation of DRL algorithm for medical supply chain optimization. I implement the DRL algorithm in Python using Ray and RLlib packages and conduct experiments using Google Colab with GPU support. To maximize the DRL algorithm’s potential, I optimize the reward function and the hyperparameters of this algorithm. By testing the agents in different environment initializations, I find that the DRL algorithm outperforms the static (s, Q) agent, which is one of the most commonly used methods in many inventory optimization systems, by returning a 17.33% greater cumulative reward on average. Additionally, the relative standard deviation of baseline (s,Q) Policy is 1.97% and that of DRL is 2.49% based on ten repeated trials. Thus, the DRL approach is not only stable but can also significantly improve the retailer’s profit. My DRL model can be further applied to more complicated multi-echelon supply chain systems and lays a solid foundation for optimizing large-scale medical supply chains [TF18].</jats:p>"

Those consequences include natural disasters, i.e., landslides, which can cause destruction of water infrastructure, causing distress for water users, cascading effects to other critical infrastructures and environmental impacts. Vulnerability analyses represent a key point in international risk management programs for protecting critical infrastructure, especially in the context of climate change. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to evaluate crucial water supply infrastructure vulnerabilities based on multiple indicators. A learning-from-experience approach is applied to establish specific indicators for vulnerability assessment. Eight different indicators are identified, divided into four categories, regarding land characteristics, service inefficiencies for users due to infrastructure failure, pipeline route characteristics, and physical characteristics of the aqueduct pipe. Along with the indicators, a graphical representation is proposed using the Kiviat chart, producing a vulnerability chart that represents a useful tool to identify the main vulnerability factors in existing water supply infrastructure, in the management of interventions, in the planning and design processes of new infrastructure, and for comparing different design solutions.</jats:p>",

The ways in which domestic entrepreneurs in Brazil enter different segments of the agribusiness industry were assessed with specific attention to implications for the development of local agro-industrial capabilities. Methods: We assessed the current market share of domestic companies in relation to foreign multinationals in various segments of the sugar and ethanol supply chain in Brazil. Results: Foreign multinationals are market leaders in the fertilizers, machinery and trading segments (domestic companies market share is 20.3%, 33.3% and 42.9% in those segments respectively). However, Brazilian companies have achieved higher market share in segments such as plant breeding, sugarcane processing and farming (domestic market share is 93.2%, 67.4% and 75.5% respectively). Plant breeding, farming and trading benefit from governmental support in research, subsidized credits and market policies respectively. Conclusions: By investing in agro-industrial sectors developing countries can benefit from agribusiness expansion for their economic growth. Investments in science and technology and domestic regulatory actions can help to build country capabilities, although the impacts are sometimes limited to the agro-industrial sectors where domestic companies are more competitive. These lessons can help other developing countries to assess their opportunities and challenges for agro-industrial development.</jats:p>"

After all, the healthcare system is going to undergo a huge data revolution, with Artificial Intelligence (AI), predictive analytics, and business intelligence ready to increase efficiency and enhance health outcomes. Thus, developing data analytics mechanisms and capabilities play a crucial role for successful implementation of a committed demand program. Limited health supply chain analytics practice, low supply chain planning performance and frequent disruptions in managing vital pharmaceuticals of committed demand programs reducing the health outcomes of patient’s public health facilities in Ethiopia.\nObjective: to provide new insights on demand planning practices of vital pharmaceuticals under the committed demand program in 13 federal and university hospitals in Ethiopia.\nMethod: A quantitative, descriptive, and explanatory systematic analysis of 46 vital pharmaceuticals consumed in 13 federal and university hospitals across the country as part of the committed demand program between 2017-2022. Predictive modeling approach used to foresee future occurrences or outcomes, as well as to predict future trends, by searching for patterns that have occurred in the past or by analyzing historical data. Key informant interview was done to identify challenges. Lewis MAPE scale of judgment for forecast errors was used to determine the forecast accuracy.\nResult: The results of the study showed that there was considerable variation in the number of SKUs issued and the cost of issuance over the years. Specifically, 2019 had the highest number of SKUs issued, while 2018 had the highest cost incurred. The top five pharmaceutical items issued were Sodium Chloride (Normal Saline) 0.009 infusion, Ceftriaxone 1gm injection, Vancomycin 1gm infusion, Carbamazepine 200mg tablet, and Anti-Rho (D) Immune Globulin 300mcg in 2ml injection, which accounted for a significant proportion of the total quantity and cost issued. These findings suggest that certain pharmaceutical items are more commonly issued than others, and that the dosage form and cost can vary considerably between items.\nThe study also found that only 14 out of the 46 pharmaceuticals had a MAPE value less than 50%, which is considered accurate according to the Lewis MAPE scale. Furthermore, the 2, 3, and 4-year moving averages showed that the number of pharmaceuticals with a MAPE less than 50% varied between 14 and 17, indicating that accuracy in forecasting SKUs may be difficult to achieve consistently over time.\nConclusion:<jats:bold> </jats:bold>Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the patterns and challenges of pharmaceutical SKU forecasting and management. These findings can inform healthcare organizations in their efforts to improve inventory management and reduce unnecessary costs. Further research is needed to develop more effective forecasting methods for pharmaceutical SKUs and to identify factors that contribute to the variability in SKU issuance and cost.</jats:p>"

Rivers are the primary source of freshwater supply. However, over the past few decades, challenges concerning the sustainability of rivers and maintaining their water quality have become countless. Due to rapid and unrestrained advancements, the river ecosystem becomes imbalanced. To assess and predict water quality from the real data collected, it becomes necessary to devise ways to interpret and analyze the data efficiently. The present work deals with the development of a water quality index based on a fuzzy approach for predicting the water quality of the river Yamuna. The most contaminated stretch of the river through Delhi has been taken up for this study. The proposed methodology is elementary, simple, effective, and flexible in assimilating uncertainties involved in complex water management problems. The suggested index involves the most dominant parameters and can act as a practical tool for routine water quality assessment. The outcomes of the study give pronounced facts to water authorities about the awful condition of the river Yamuna in Delhi.</jats:p>",

After all, the healthcare system is going to undergo a huge data revolution, with Artificial Intelligence (AI), predictive analytics, and business intelligence ready to increase efficiency and enhance health outcomes. Thus, developing data analytics mechanisms and capabilities play a crucial role for successful implementation of a committed demand program. Limited health supply chain analytics practice, low supply chain planning performance and frequent disruptions in managing vital pharmaceuticals of committed demand programs reducing the health outcomes of patient’s public health facilities in Ethiopia. Objective: to provide new insights on demand planning practices of vital pharmaceuticals under the committed demand program in 13 federal and university hospitals in Ethiopia. Method: A quantitative, descriptive, and explanatory systematic analysis of 46 vital pharmaceuticals consumed in 13 federal and university hospitals across the country as part of the committed demand program between 2017–2022. Predictive modeling approach used to foresee future occurrences or outcomes, as well as to predict future trends, by searching for patterns that have occurred in the past or by analyzing historical data. Key informant interview was done to identify challenges. Lewis MAPE scale of judgment for forecast errors was used to determine the forecast accuracy. Result: The results of the study showed that there was considerable variation in the number of SKUs issued and the cost of issuance over the years. Specifically, 2019 had the highest number of SKUs issued, while 2018 had the highest cost incurred. The top five pharmaceutical items issued were Sodium Chloride (Normal Saline) 0.009 infusion, Ceftriaxone 1gm injection, Vancomycin 1gm infusion, Carbamazepine 200mg tablet, and Anti-Rho (D) Immune Globulin 300mcg in 2ml injection, which accounted for a significant proportion of the total quantity and cost issued.

Using a sample of 87 MSMEs, data was collected through questionnaires distributed to various MSMEs in the West Java region, using a Likert scale for response evaluation. Data analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) through the Smart PLS program.The results of this study indicate that both competitive strategy and GSCM have a significant influence on MSME performance. Competitive strategy, which includes product differentiation, cost leadership, and market focus, has improved the operational efficiency, market responsiveness, and competitive advantage of MSMEs. Meanwhile, the implementation of GSCM, which emphasizes environmentally friendly operations and sustainable resource management, not only improves compliance with environmental regulations but also strengthens the reputation and legitimacy of MSMEs in the eyes of stakeholders and consumers. These findings confirm the importance of adopting and integrating innovative and sustainable business practices to improve MSME performance. Consequently, this study suggests the need for more strategic policy interventions and support for MSMEs to develop their capacity in competitive strategy and GSCM, thereby strengthening their position in the market and their contribution to the regional economy and environmental sustainability</jats:p>"

It considers the ethical and aesthetic problems posed by the fact that the daily lives of people living in consumer societies in the Global North are deeply dependent on material networks that sustain violent relations between people and with earth’s ecologies. How can we be ethical global citizens when we are already material global subjects? The paper considers how literature confronts this ethical‐representational challenge, and asks whether literature might help us take responsibility over the material economic networks that structure our everyday lives. I examine two novels that make use of strikingly similar techniques for narrating their characters’ immersion in globalized economies: Ben Lerner’s <jats:italic>10:04</jats:italic> (2014) and Ling Ma’s <jats:italic>Severance</jats:italic> (2018). Both novels strive to represent the incomprehensible global economy by calling attention to their inability to represent it. I argue that this technique—which I call the “supply chain sublime”—ultimately reflects the incapacity of current forms of collective political agency to manage our material lives.</jats:p>",

To address these challenges, all supply chains need to collaborate using data to optimize and prioritize needs and build resiliency. In this presentation, we are highlighting the collaboration between a Vessel Owner and and leading NOC to improve fleet operations and deliver more efficient and effective support for production operations. The Vessel Owner operates a large fleet of offshore support vessels in the Gulf region. For these operations, they have three main objectives: 1) maximize compliance with client requirements which recently included access to real-time operational data, 2) maximize operational excellence including fleet availability and cost, and 3) be fully in control of our fuel consumption and emissions in all phases of operations. Grappling with the agile nature of their client requirements evolving over time and their fleet not being uniformed nor standardized, it was necessary for them to find ways to make the management and reporting of their operations uniform, scalable, and agile across the entire fleet and engage all internal and external stakeholders in the digital transformation process.</jats:p>",

The present paper focuses on these challenges and recommends an integrated approach incorporating service market fundamentals, commodity fundamentals, cost inflation, and sensitivity analysis to better plan asset development and capital deployment via service cost modeling. Successful oil and gas operations require the sourcing of a variety of complex goods and services. Each of these may have similar or different market factors impacting their pricing performance. The present paper tackles this challenge by leveraging a multivariate regression modeling approach. This modeling technique establishes relationships between raw cost drivers like the WTI Prices, steel cost, labor, etc. and cost of oilfield materials, goods, and services. These costs are sourced as aggregated information of transactional prices to maximize accuracy. We then present quantitative forecasts for these prices and how they impact the overall well and asset cost.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The resulting model provides critical insights into key oil and gas operational goods and services and their correlation with key market factors. By incorporating time-based optimization, the lags between market drivers and their impact on cost can also be understood. The models all showed significant predictability with R-squared values greater than 0.75. The authors find that this approach will help companies make informed decisions about contract and procurement strategies to improve their bottom line. The paper presents a novel approach to asset planning capital allocation by incorporating market and commodity fundamentals, cost inflation, and sensitivity analysis into a multivariate regression modeling framework for service cost forecasting. The resulting model provides valuable insights into the key operational commodities and their correlation with key market factors, enabling companies to make more informed decisions about asset planning.</jats:p>",

The researchers employ a comparative analysis methodology between squids, military ships, startup firms in the defense industry and strategic supply chains using these analogies and novel ERP model as an analytical framework. Comparing the cases yields general principles of strategic design that potentially extend to other entities that function in hostile environments. These principles primarily relate to the relative significance of threats, the importance of ERP factors, the nature of interrelationships among the ERP factors, and the tradeoffs involved while taking actions to improve survivability.

In this research, in addition to using the SWAT and MLP models, an optimized algorithm called Mutated SunFlower Optimization (MSFO) algorithm has been proposed to predict better runoff, which improves the results of prediction runoff by decreasing the error percentage in the MLP model. For this purpose, first, runoff modeling is used to assess the efficiency of the SWAT system. The model's verification and calibration have been performed using data from the previous 30 years of statistics. Then, the flow stream simulated by the SWAT method is evaluated with the observational data and applied as the inputs to the MLP model, and finally, runoff is predicted through the MLP model, and MSFO is used in the MLP model to obtain better results for runoff prediction. The results show that the values of statistical indices R2, RMSE, NSE, and RE give satisfying agreement for runoff forecast in the SWAT–MLP/MSFO model with values of 0.83, 1.68, 0.51, and −0.1.</jats:p>",

Identifying and prioritizing measures to revive the Qanat can be a critical factor in managing this challenge. This study identified and prioritized the measures of the revival of the Qanat by using questionnaires, interviews with experts, and the entropy–VIKOR method. The results showed that among the 10 measures identified, reducing the extraction of water and changing the cultivation pattern were the top two priorities, and other measures were placed next. By implementing these measures, it is possible to partially respond to the demands of the natives while preventing further deterioration of the consequences that endanger the plain. Furthermore, considering the fact that the implementation of any measure can be beneficial, they should be determined based on region characteristics and then implemented in order of priority to obtain more favorable results.</jats:p>",

A great emphasis is placed on minimising environmental consequences, eliminating waste, conserving energy, and sourcing materials responsibly in the production, distribution, and disposal of electric vehicles. Electric vehicle manufacturers must prioritise sustainability to ensure that their products contribute significantly to a brighter future while also meeting the ethical and environmental demands of consumers as well as regulatory bodies. Green supply chain management (GSCM) incorporates environmentally friendly practises to reduce environmental effects. This study incorporates fuzzy TOPSIS for analysing and rating GSCM practises, assisting decision-makers in prioritising sustainability in the supply chains of electric vehicle manufacturers. We develop a multi-criteria decision-making framework to evaluate GSCM criteria while accounting for inherent uncertainty. Fuzzy TOPSIS handles linguistic problems as well as ambiguity while providing a precise GSCM representation. Real-world case studies from various sectors demonstrate the applicability and benefits of our approach to finding improvement areas and expediting GSCM assessments. This research presents a systematic, quantitative way for evaluating GSCM practises, allowing supply chain alignment with sustainability goals.

The super-efficiency model and quantitative analysis method were used based on the time series data of the ICT industry in Shenzhen from 2005 to 2020. In order to better investigate the impact of supply chain finance on industrial efficiency, this study categorized industrial efficiency into operational efficiency and innovation efficiency to reflect the durability and virtuousness of the industry development. Results indicate that supply chain finance has an inverted U-shaped nonlinear effect on industrial efficiency. Even though the long-term effect on operational efficiency is positive, the effect on innovation efficiency reveals an inverted U-shape, mainly due to the mediating effect of industrial concentration. Theoretically, this study sheds light on the intricate effects of supply chain finance at the industrial level, and also provides valuable insights into the potential inhibition mechanism, which enriches and deepens the related research on the supply chain finance from the nonlinear perspective, make the research findings more consistent with the fact of industrial development and avoid the linear stereotypes of the existing theory consensus. Practically, it is conductive to an objective understanding for managers and policymakers, so that supply chain finance can facilitate both operational and innovation efficiencies and realize the effective integration of supply chain finance and industrial development. </jats:p>",

The inherent complexity of such systems can introduce impurities including inaccurate information, lack of transparency and limited data provenance. Counterfeit drugs is one consequence of such limitations within existing supply chains which not only has serious adverse impact on human health but also causes severe economic loss to the healthcare industry. Consequently, existing studies have emphasized the need for a robust, end-to-end track and trace system for pharmaceutical supply chains. Therein, an end-to-end product tracking system across the pharmaceutical supply chain is paramount to ensuring product safety and eliminating counterfeits. Most existing track and trace systems are centralized leading to data privacy, transparency and authenticity issues in healthcare supply chains. In this article, we present an Ethereum blockchain-based approach leveraging smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage for efficient product traceability in the healthcare supply chain. The smart contract guarantees data provenance, eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides a secure, immutable history of transactions to all stakeholders. We present the system architecture and detailed algorithms that govern the working principles of our proposed solution. We perform testing and validation, and present cost and security analysis of the system to evaluate its effectiveness to enhance traceability within pharmaceutical supply chains.</jats:p>"

Thus, genetic and environmental factors such as water availability influence those differences. West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) is one of Indonesia’s provinces with local glutinous rice strains cultivated by farmers. Local glutinous rice is grown on a field scale which depends on rainfall in this region. Therefore, plant growth rate and yield might decrease caused by inadequate amount of water during plant growth and development. Hence it is essential to find out the response of several strains of glutinous rice due to different water supplies, in addition to obtain adaptive glutinous rice strains under water deficit. This research was a factorial experiment with a randomized group design that contained two factors. The first factor was glutinous rice varieties, consisting of three local glutinous rice types: Me’e, Kala, Samada, and one National variety, Paketih. The second factor was the field capacity condition implemented by the amount of water supply: 2,250 ml (50 percent FC), 3,375 ml (75 percent FC), 4,500 ml (100 percent FC), and 5,625 ml (125 percent FC). Data were analyzed using a 5 percent analysis of variance, then proceeded with DMRT. The results showed that glutinous rice strains and water supply interacted with weight grains per clump. Meanwhile, there was no interaction on plant length, number of leaves, and weight of 100 grains. Samada variety showed adaptive behavior under limited water, presented on yield variable compared to the other varieties.</jats:p>"

However, limited studies have investigated the influence of multiple factors on the risk of water yield service. This study proposes an evaluation framework for the supply and demand risk of water yield service considering the combined effects of inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) and land use/cover change (LUCC). This study takes the Fen River Basin as an example to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of the risk under multiple influencing factors. Results show that by 2030, the demand for water yield service in the Fen River Basin will increase significantly due to the occupation of farmland by artificial land. Without considering IBWT, by 2030, the artificial land area is mostly in a state of level III and level II extremely endangered in terms of water supply and demand risk. Considering IBWT, by 2030, the artificial land will be transformed into a level IV danger state, and a large number of dispersed areas of level IV danger in the plain region will be transformed into a level V shortage of supply state. Overall, the water supply and demand risk show a downward trend. The results of the geodetector analysis shows that under the influence of IBWT, the explanatory power of influencing factors such as LUCC for the risk have been significantly improved.</jats:p>"

This paper considered both FC and CSR, established four Stackelberg game models, and obtained the effects of FC and CSR on bilateral quality efforts in APSC through comparative analysis and numerical analysis. We prove that the supermarket’s FC can take the role of “profit distribution mechanism”, but it is not conducive to improving all bilateral quality efforts, the utility of the whole supply chain system, and consumer surplus. Additionally, APSC members sharing CSR can not only both improve the quality of agricultural products and promote the expansion of market demand, but they also can improve both the profit of all members and the supply chain. The CSR shared by both members has a greater impact on bilateral quality efforts than the supermarket’s FC, and thus the positive effect of CSR can overcome the negative effect of the supermarket’s FC.</jats:p>"

Within this context, we focus on two channels that drive blockchain adoption by the manufacturer: manufacturer risk aversion and consumer information asymmetry. Regarding the first channel, blockchain enables efficient tracing of defective products so that the manufacturer can selectively recall defective products rather than conducting a full recall. This tracing ability reduces the risk involved in the manufacturer purchasing from multiple suppliers and thereby leads the manufacturer to endogenously diversify across suppliers when blockchain is adopted. The diversification enhances the manufacturer’s welfare due to the manufacturer’s risk aversion and thus drives the manufacturer to adopt blockchain. With regard to the second channel, blockchain stores details from the manufacturing process and reveals them to consumers, thereby ameliorating consumer information asymmetry. This reduction in information asymmetry improves consumer decision making that, in isolation, would enhance consumer welfare. However, the manufacturer responds by increasing the consumer price, thereby transferring potential consumer welfare gains to the manufacturer, and consequently serving as a second channel to drive blockchain adoption by the manufacturer. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Lin William Cong, finance. </jats:p>"

The results show that public services supply, livelihood capital, and livelihood strategies significantly correlate with subjective poverty. Physical capital and social capital have the greatest effects on the occurrence of subjective poverty. The probability of subjective poverty decreases by 0.149 and 0.107 for each unit change in physical and social capital, respectively. What’s more, public services supply, physical capital, financial capital, and human capital affect the subjective poverty of urban and rural residents at different significance levels.

Firstly, according to the incentive mechanism of rural teachers, quantitative and qualitative research on the incentive mechanism of teachers in rural areas using the fuzzy evaluation method is proposed. In the fuzzy judgment matrix, each level is determined based on the decomposition of the previous level, and the results of the previous level are determined based on the calculation results of the next level. Then, using the relevant motivation theory and questionnaires, the principal and teachers of the school were investigated to understand the current situation and main problems of the construction of teachers’ motivation mechanism in the junior high school of Un Dong Town, Duyun City. Using the fuzzy evaluation method to analyze the difference between the actual feeling and expected demand of teachers’ motivation, the result shows that the difference between salary and promotion is 1.22 and 1.19, which means that the difference between salary and promotion is bigger in the motivation mechanism of rural teachers, and we should focus on reforming the salary scheme and implementing the promotion training mechanism of rural teachers. This study confronts the problem of rural teachers’ incentive mechanism, which has good theoretical and practical guidance for improving education quality and so on.</jats:p>",

In contrast to hard skills which are teachable typically through formal education, soft skills are non-technical and interpersonal, allowing individuals to be able to find and succeed in their studies, jobs, and professional life. Despite the increasing emphasis on soft skills, many university students are either unaware of or neglect enhancing them. Soft skills deficiency among university students has become a significant concern for employers, educators, and policymakers, as it negatively affects students' academic performance and future employment prospects. The purpose of this study is to investigate students’ perceptions of the demand for soft skills and the possibility and availability of learning opportunities. The expected outcomes intend to provide insights about awareness of soft skills among students and pathways to reduce the soft skills gap through training provisions in higher education settings. Furthermore, it aims to find out how the young generation (mainly Generation Z) would perceive digitalisation and specifically gamification as a solution to facilitate soft skills training. This is a mixed method study, in which, an open survey was the data collection media. The survey was conducted during the spring semester of 2023 and analysed using visualisation and summarisation methods. Based on the outcome of 66 master’s and bachelor's students attending the digitalisation courses in two classes in Sweden, over 50% of the students perceived a lack of soft skills in their curricula. They were also positive toward the use of gamification as an effective digital strategy, recognising it as a powerful tool to facilitate training and developing soft skills as a part of formal learning in higher education. As a suggested approach, gamifying soft skills training potentially creates simulations that mimic real-world situations to allow students to practice and develop their soft skills in a safe and low-stakes training environment. This facilitates training soft skills for better communication and collaboration during their academic journey and after their graduation and to prepare students for successful careers.</jats:p>"

This study was conducted in order to evaluate the contrast between economic criteria and food security in the exploitation of water resources in Lu'an city in Anhui province of China. Probabilistic modeling based on the prediction of uncertain values using the Latin hypercube technique was used for hydrological variables and water resources. The method of data mining and trend analysis of dependent variables was also simulated to estimate economic values in the water cycle. Statistical information of 32 years from 1991 to 2022 has been collected and used as an annual average per population. The results showed that the economic value of water consumption in the tourism industry has increased compared to agriculture. The total water provided for food security is equal to 6.5 m3 per person, the excess of which can be allocated to other uses through weighting indicators based on ecosystem and quality.</jats:p>",

The TBI included hybrid poplars <jats:italic>(Populus deltoides</jats:italic> × <jats:italic>P. nigra)</jats:italic> planted alternately with high-value hardwoods in the rows. In each experimental block (n = 3), the TBI system and control were divided into two treatments: without root-pruning <jats:italic>vs</jats:italic> with (75 cm depth using a sub-soiler). In 2022, NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> supply rates near tree rows (0 and 4 m) were lower than alley centres (12 and 20 m) and controls. A first structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> supply rates were mostly modulated by indirect effects of tree row distance and soil clay content through volumetric water content (VWC).

P, K, Ca and Mg supplies within cultivated alleys werer generally similar among distances (4, 12, and 20 m) and did not differ from controls. An unexpected lack of effect of tree root pruning was observed regarding soil nutrient supply and N leaching. Clay content was a major driver of soil nutrient supply and N leaching. The role of TBI systems in determining soil nutrient dynamics depended upon the soil nutrient and sampling period that was measured, with greater effects beneath the trees and at the tree-crop interface.</jats:p>"

The model has been applied to two companies operating in the construction industry. This study contributes to the existing literature by quantitatively assessing the adoption of blockchain technology on two real case studies – company Alpha and company Beta – to limit supply chain risk in the construction sector. The dimensions considered in the analysis are company data, payments, materials, supply chain structure and information and document flow. According to the findings, the model suggests that for company Alpha blockchain technology is recommended but not useful to mitigate risks and so improving supply chain performance. On the contrary, results show that for company Beta the implementation of blockchain technology is useful.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sediment supply variations are often overlooked when interpreting depositional sequences, which tend to emphasize changes in accommodation. Here, we focus on a temporally well-constrained shallow-marine succession in the South Pyrenean Foreland Basin to test the control of sediment supply on the development of deltaic sequences during the Early Eocene. We analyzed the paleoenvironmental record (sedimentary facies and δ13Corg values) of the Morillo Limestone and the Castigaleu Formation (52.2 to 50.3 Ma). During this period, a series of hyperthermal events occurred, globally recorded as negative carbon isotopic excursions (CIEs). The major progradation of the deltaic system is marked by the abrupt appearance of thick delta-front sandstones and coincides with the first recorded negative CIE. Subsequent phases of progradation/aggradation align with subsequent negative CIEs. Conversely, positive CIEs correspond to finer-grained, more distal prodelta and offshore deposits. We therefore suggest that during deposition of this Early Eocene shallow-marine succession, the primary trigger behind sequence generation was the high-frequency climate-induced variation in sediment supply, specifically the hyperthermal events, rather than changes in accommodation. This linkage underscores the complex interactions between climate dynamics and sedimentary responses, shaping the stratigraphic architecture of shallow-marine settings.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, climatic information was collected in the last 20 years, and the values of the standard precipitation index (SPI) and reconnaissance drought index (RDI) were determined. Examining the indicators indicates that the indicators are high in all the years under review in dry areas. In the semi-arid region, there was a significant decrease in the average value of the indices in July and August in the years 2017–2022. Drought indicators did not show a critical situation in humid and semi-humid areas, and there was sufficient moisture for plants throughout the year. The results showed that there was a high correlation between the SPI and the RDI in all the identified areas. In addition to rainfall, the RDI also includes transpiration and is more sensitive, especially in dry areas where transpiration is higher than rainfall.</jats:p>",

First of all, some new type of supply chains has appeared beside the traditional supply chains. The growing level of pollution, the decreasing level of non-renewable sources indicate changes in the business life. Companies find some alternate solutions to protect the environment – use renewable sources, integrate recycling processes, use the inverse logistics etc. So companies are getting to be eco-conscious, we are called them as ‘green companies’. If these green companies are in one supply chain, we are called as ‘green supply chain’. The coordination of supply chains – whether if traditional or green– is one of the most important research topics in this century. The number of chain members is growing; the cooperation is getting to be more difficult. That is why contracts could be a good solution for this problem, because they define a framework for the parties to manage their relationships. Contracts work well, if the right type is chosen according to the nature of the relationship. But in the case of a green supply chain, there are other influencing factors. Green companies are able to accept higher prices to get higher quality products. In the paper, we analyse how these factors influence the decision-makers to choose between the contracts; we use the AHP decision-making method.</jats:p>",

We find that dissent is less (more) frequent when demand (supply) shocks are the predominant source of inflation fluctuations. In addition, supply shocks are found to raise private sector forecasting uncertainty about the path of interest rates. Since supply shocks impose a trade-off between inflation and output stabilization while demand shocks do not, our findings are consistent with heterogeneous preferences over the dual mandate among FOMC members as a driver of policy disagreement.</jats:p>"

This study presents a comprehensive review of the interplay between blockchain technology and SCM. By analyzing an extensive dataset of 943 articles, our exploration utilizes the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to delve deep into the thematic structure of the discourse. This investigation revealed ten central topics ranging from blockchain’s transformative role in supply chain finance and e-commerce operations to its application in specialized areas, such as the halal food supply chain and humanitarian contexts. Particularly pronounced were discussions on the challenges and transformations of blockchain integration in supply chains and its impact on pricing strategies and decision-making. Visualization tools, including PyLDAvis, further illuminated the interconnectedness of these themes, highlighting the intertwined nature of blockchain adoption challenges with aspects such as traceability and pricing. Despite the breadth of topics covered, the paper acknowledges its limitations due to the fast-evolving nature of blockchain developments during and after our analysis period. Ultimately, this review provides a holistic academic snapshot, emphasizing both well-developed and nascent research areas and guiding future research in the evolving domain of blockchain in SCM.</jats:p>"

The hydraulic design of a submain unit pipeline with multiple outlets is a very important concern for the proper hydraulic performance of irrigation water distribution systems. The operating inlet pressure head, H0I, is a main hydraulic component for the proper hydraulically efficient design and evaluation of pressure head distribution along the line. The energy-gradient ratio (EGR) approach is a useful tool to identify first which type of pressure profile occurs for a given uniform design slope with other hydraulic variables initially known and then, comprehensively evaluate its definite hydraulic characteristics along the line. Knowing the hydraulic properties of any type of pressure profile regarded enables the design engineer to evaluate pressure parameters through the line sections in a simple way. The procedure is simplified by regarding the localized head loss along the pipe but neglecting the change in kinetic head. The present analytical technique performs sufficiently accurately in comparison with the computer-aided software design technique, for all performed simulations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A literature review was conducted to develop an experimental stand for testing pumps. It was established that frequency regulation is one of the quantitative energy-saving methods of controlling the operation of the pumping unit. At the same time, the influence on the pump unit is carried out by changing the operating point by means of variable pump curve. The hydraulic schemes for experimental study of frequency-controlled pumps presented in the article have certain disadvantages: 1) the location of the pump relative to the tank is ambiguous regarding the operation of the pump under flooded suсtion; 2) pressure regulation is provided only in the direction of its decrease; 3) refers rather to the automation of pumping installations. On the designed and manufactured experimental stand, it is possible to study the operation of the pump with the use of a frequency converter and without it, through a bypass line. When testing the pump for systems that operate according to the fluid level in the suction tank, use either a valve on the discharge pipeline (with the use of a frequency converter) or a ball valve on the discharge pipeline from the discharge tank (without the use of a frequency converter). In addition, pump testing using a frequency converter can be performed for pressure-operated systems. The installed frequency converter is a regulator of the flow of the working fluid, which allows adjusting of the pump discherge. The pump designed on the experimental stand is a self-suction jet that does not need to be installed under flooded suсtion. The discharge tank is located higher than the suction tank, which ensures the circulation of the working fluid by gravity. The working fluid will be water. The preliminary results, performed on the experimental stand, confirm the possibility of frequency regulation of the pump using a frequency converter.</jats:p>"

The research on IDB is at the early development stage. This study contributes to the Supply Chain Control Tower (SCCT) by developing a conceptual model of IDB, identifying its implementation requirements, and exploring its impacts on the supply chain performance. The causal loops and stock/flow diagrams are used to investigate how several efficiency indicators like the number of cancellations, planning time, utilization of space for loading and unloading, and the duration of processing trucks at distribution centers can be improved. Further, real-time data integration, operational preconditions, automated scheduling, dynamic responsiveness, and interdepartmental integration are identified as the key implementation requirements. The findings provide a foundation for implementing IDB systems in SCCTs.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to identify and analyze the key factors that influence supply chain agility and subsequently impact healthcare service delivery and overall performance in public hospitals in Nimba County, Liberia. Drawing on a comprehensive review of existing literature, this research synthesizes the multifaceted determinants that shape supply chain agility in the unique setting of public institutions (Hospitals) and healthcare preference in Nimba County, Liberia. The regression model with the independent variables (Inventory control, Procurement, Information Technology and Warehouse management) showed a strong positive correlation with the dependent variable. These predictors explained about 60.41% of the variance in the dependent variables, with addition of these predictors have significantly improved the model's performance, as indicated by the low p-value (0.000) for the F Change statistic. The research recommends the management of the public hospitals in Nimba County and Liberia at large, to enhance its implementation to realize its impact at higher levels. Among these practices to put more emphasis on skills development, supportive supervision and performance review. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing supply chain agility in public institutions and their subsequent impact on healthcare performance in Nimba County, Liberia.</jats:p>"

The article follows three objectives: 1) to identify the drivers and motivations for successful local water governance; 2) to assess the robustness of water commons in terms of current and future challenges; 3) to identify the benefits of water commons. The key elements for the functioning of the two local communities under examination are shared interests, as well as a strong commitment to effective management. In addition to the material benefits (i.e. drinking water supply), non-material ones are also important. Community building and identity are particularly noteworthy.

E-traceability drivers in the agri-food supply chain encompass diverse factors motivating companies to adopt electronic systems for product tracking, aiming to enhance visibility, minimize risk, ensure compliance, and promote safety, sustainability, and efficiency through clear and verifiable records of product origins, quality, and sustainability, building consumer trust and loyalty. By identifying the main drivers of e-traceability, this research aims to shed light on the factors that motivate companies to implement electronic systems for tracking and monitoring products. For solving this problem of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), this study proposes a hybrid MCDM model. The model combines “Factor Relationship” (FARE) and “Axial Distance-based Aggregated Measurement” (ADAM) methods in the fuzzy environment. The results indicate that the most important drivers are supply chain efficiency, technology development and sustainability. These drivers are critical and they significantly impact the successful implementation and adoption of e-traceability strategies in the agri-food sector.</jats:p>"

Cement is the second most consumed material in the world, has a fast supply chain in the global market. This has driven the authors to study the supply chain risks for this sector.Design/methodology/approach: Through a detailed literature review and interaction with industry experts, 19 risk elements have been identified that may disrupt the supply chain activities. Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) is used to prioritize these risk elements based on the risk priority number (RPN). RPN is derived from the severity, occurrence, and detectability of these risk elements in various process functions of the supply chain. 10 risk elements are selected from this analysis that have higher priority number. Further, these elements have been fed to the Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) that derived the contextual interrelationship among these elements. Further MICMAC analysis has been implemented on the risk elements based on their driving and dependency power.Findings: Unpredicted heavy rainfall and energy shortages have been identified as the root causes of other risk elements.  Increasing turnaround time in logistics and fleet adjustment during heavy demand, having the highest dependence power, are considered as the most important risk elements in the cement industry supply chain.  Originality/value: This is the first study in the domain of supply chain risks which has analyzed and modelled risks for cement industry. This work would provide the decision-makers of cement industry to focus on the specific risk elements for reducing disruptions in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

And the traditional GERT is improved by constructing a grey parametric GERT network with restricted output results, taking into account the fact that the duration, product quality and product cost of each supplier in a complex product supply chain are interval values rather than definite values, and that customers have restrictions on the duration, product quality and product cost of the final product. The functional relationship between product quality, product cost and duration is analysed, and two satisfaction functions for duration and cost are constructed in order to quantify the multi-objective requirements of shortening duration, saving product cost and guaranteeing product quality for complex products under emergency situations. Then, a duration-cost-quality model for complex product supply chains in contingency situations is constructed to obtain the better duration, product cost and product quality of each supplier by optimising the indicator parameters in the network. Finally, the scientific validity and effectiveness of the model and method are verified by means of arithmetic example. The results show that the method is able to analyse the optimal duration, product quality and product cost of each supplier, and the main manufacturer can obtain an optimised combination of duration, cost and quality for a complex product supply chain in different contingency situation. To further promote the sustainable and secure development of complex product supply chains, this paper also suggests the integration of data sharing and blockchain technology with complex product supply chains to develop dynamic supply chain feedback management systems.</jats:p>"

The results showed that linear semi-natural landscape elements contribute positively to the landscape’s multifunctionality. Small changes have been identified for water flow regulation, whereas, considering both spatial extent and magnitude of the changes, the greatest changes have been found with respect to the supply of pollination and nutrient regulation.

Each system has different specificities and contribution percentages to the total agriculture income. In the market, farmers mobilize conventional and alternative markets. The first was mainly used to commercialize of products such as commodities. Alternative channels were used to sell alternatively and/or traditionally produced food. Alternative systems and/or short channels allowed the elimination and appropriation of a higher percentage of generated wealth, contributing to the viability of smallholder farmers. A striking feature of the production systems analyzed was the diversification in production and sales. Although the product plays the greatest role in the income generated, other activities are important and contribute to the production unit’s productivity and economic stability.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a precipitation prediction model based on the empirical mode decomposition–variational mode decomposition–long short-term memory (EMD–VMD–LSTM) is proposed. This model is coupled with EMD, VMD, and LSTM to improve the accuracy and reliability of precipitation prediction by using the characteristics of EMD for noise removal, VMD for trend extraction, and LSTM for long-term memory. The monthly precipitation data from 2000 to 2019 in Luoyang City, Henan Province, China, are selected as the research object. This model is compared with the standalone LSTM model, EMD–LSTM coupled model, and VMD–LSTM coupled model. The research results show that the maximum relative error and minimum relative error of the precipitation prediction using the EMD–VMD–LSTM neural network coupled model are 9.64 and −7.52%, respectively, with a 100% prediction accuracy. This coupled model has better accuracy than the other three models in predicting precipitation in Luoyang City. In summary, the proposed EMD–VMD–LSTM precipitation prediction model combines the advantages of multiple methods and provides an effective way to predict precipitation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Partial vertical ownership describes a situation in which a firm holds financial shares in either its supplier (referred to as partial backward integration) or its customer (partial forward integration). We study the effect of such financial interconnectedness on two operational decisions: capacity investment and information exchange. In our model, a retailer, who has superior information about the future market demand, has passive financial holdings in the supplier. Although this passive financial investment does not enable the retailer to directly influence the supplier’s operational decisions, it does affect the market equilibrium. Specifically, financial interconnectedness between the firms can result in the retailer financing the entire capacity in the market. In addition, we characterize the conditions that ensure that information between the retailer and the supplier can be exchanged via cheap-talk communication. Interestingly, a high level of information asymmetry facilitates the exchange of information via cheap talk in the presence of these financial links. When cheap talk is not possible, we study the separating equilibrium that is achieved through the retailer’s commitment to order in advance. In this case, the separating quantity can either increase or decrease with the level partial vertical ownership, and this trend does not depend the actual level of the financial holdings. We further analyze the incentive of the retailer to conceal demand information by choosing a pooling equilibrium and conclude with discussing the effect of the financial interconnectedness on the parties’ operational payoffs. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: N.

This poses considerable challenge in the improvement of the seashell business development in Zanzibar. This study examined the entire seashell business supply chain, the current status of the business and challenges hindering the growth of the business in Zanzibar. The study was qualitative in nature with a case study design. Data were collected from 45 participants who were purposively and conveniently sampled. Data were collected through in-depth interviews (IDI), document review and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). Data obtained were analyzed by content analysis done manually. Findings reveal that currently; the status of seashell business is described differently by different people. While others consider it valuable others see it invaluable. Findings further reveal that government restrictions on seashell export and limited research on the business hinder its growth. Thus, the study recommends to the government to invest massively in research so as to unveil more opportunities presented by the seashell. These opportunities may open room for more development ventures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global cotton and fashion industries are complex, inherently opaque and environmentally and socially exploitative. This is because of a long history of colonial practices founded in the cotton industry and a current fashion industry that is dominated by bottom-line focused large brands. Fashion supply chain transparency is needed to address the myriad of issues plaguing the fashion industry. As a tool for reaching a fair, just and sustainable fashion industry, transparency is a necessary step in reaching an accountable supply chain from the raw material level all the way to the retailer. The goal of this study is to identify the most impactful methods for increasing transparency throughout the entire fashion supply chain. Through in-depth, qualitative interviews with industry experts, six key areas were identified as methods for increasing transparency to the raw material (tier 4 or 5 level) and reducing risk within the fashion supply chain. These include restructuring of the cotton commodity market, the need for technology, increasing brand investment, trust and honesty, the need for policy, reduction of cotton certification reliance and the intervention of cotton advocacy organizations. Additionally, this research also brings to light a lack of real progress towards large-scale change within the industry and found that there is a need for complete structural change to both the cotton commodity market and the fashion supply chain if the goal of reaching a fair, just and sustainable fashion industry is to be possible.</jats:p>",

Considering the minimization of economic cost and carbon emission, a multi-objective multi-period multi-product mixed integer linear programming model with fixed and flexible facility capacity is constructed respectively. The robust optimization method is applied to deal with the uncertain environment of demand, recycled product quality, and recycling rate faced by the CLSC, and the robust models under six uncertain sets are constructed respectively. For model solving, the designed algorithm uses the augmented ϵ-constraint method to handle multi-objective problems and introduces a three-stage method on top of the Benders decomposition algorithm to accelerate the efficiency of solving the main problem. Finally, through numerical cases, a CSLC with a flexible supply strategy can manage economic and environmental costs to cope with the negative impacts of an uncertain environment, while this paper verifies the effectiveness of the government subsidy strategy under different conditions and analyzes the potential limitations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technology has emerged as a disruptive force across various industries, and its integration with the Internet of Things (IoT) has unlocked new avenues for supply chain management. The conventional supply chain systems often encounter challenges related to privacy, security, and data integrity. In contrast, blockchain's decentralized and tamper-proof nature ensures a secure, auditable, and transparent record of product movement within the supply chain. By leveraging the immutable properties of blockchain, the system enhances product traceability, authenticity, and accountability while significantly reducing operational costs. IoT devices are vulnerable to attack as due to low processing power, storage limitations etc.  Blockchain integrated with IoT provides a solution faced by the several industries. Blockchains and smart contracts are technology that has gained massive attention. The integration of blockchain addresses these shortcomings by providing robust data security and integrity, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or alteration. This paper presents a system that helps the industrialist to have an access to agricultural data and supply of crops data to farmer. As industries continue to embrace digitization and connectivity, the presented system offers a significant step towards a more streamlined and secure future for agricultural information sharing. This system will be effective for the supply chain management for the trusted delivery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The paradigm of global energy development is the priority of renewable energy sources (RES), namely, wind (WPP) and solar (SPP) power plants. This process has been evolving despite the fact that these renewable energy sources, by their physical nature, are unable to provide either a stable frequency of generated energy or a guaranteed power.Problem Statement. The current threatening situation in the Integrated Power System (IPS) and in the energy market of Ukraine is caused by the hypertrophied development of SPP and WPP in the structure of Ukraine’s IPS and excessive preferences given to RES by the “green” laws.Purpose. The purpose of this research is to create a fundamentally new structure and basis of the electric-heat system operation, which unite the IPS of Ukraine and the system of centralized heat supply (CHS), by electrifying the CHS through the use of autonomous RES energy and the capacities of nuclear power plants (NPP), in order to ensure the profitability ofUkraine’s energy market and the guaranteed profitability of RES.Material and Methods. Information of NEC Ukrenergo for 2021 and periodic energy publications; system analysis for established electrical, hydraulic, and temperature modes of joint operation of IPS, CHS, WPP, and SPP for a fundamentally new organization of their interaction.Results. Management based on the “green” tariff laws has led to a significant unprofitability of the Ukraine’s energy market. The greenhouse gas emissions during the use of RES in the IPS have increased several times, as compared with such emissions, in the case of the structure of the IPS without RES. The new principle of interrelationships between IPS, CHS, WPP, and SPP ensures high manufacturability, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and environmental friendliness of each component.Conclusions. The combination of IPS and CHS structures solves several problems of the national importance: the problem of frequency and power stabilization in the IPS automatically solves; the energy market of Ukraine gets rid of USD 15 billion loss anually; it allows saving 7.28 billion m3 natural gas and reducing the carbon dioxide emissions by 98 million tons in CO2 equivalent.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While prior research has consistently established a significant link between production and operations management (POM) practices and organizational financial performance (OFP) across various contexts, the mechanisms driving this connection remain unclear. This study addresses this gap by examining the mediating role of supply chain management (SCM) integration in the relationship between POM practices and OFP within manufacturing firms. Drawing on established theories and concepts such as the resource-based view (RBV) of firm and operation strategies, this study employed a quantitative research design. Survey data were collected from 209 managers in Jordanian manufacturing firms and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results confirmed a positive and significant association between POM practices and both SCM integration and OFP. Furthermore, SCM integration partially mediated the impact of POM practices on OFP, thereby underscoring its role in transmitting positive effects to financial performance. This research contributes to the field by integrating POM practices with SCM integration and by elucidating the mechanisms through which these practices influence financial performance in Jordanian manufacturing firms. Through this, our understanding of these relationships for practitioners and researchers alike is enhanced.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Block chains are now firmly established as a digital technology that combines cryptographic, data management, networking, and incentive mechanisms to support the verification, execution, and recording of transactions between parties. While block chain technologies were originally intended to support new forms of digital currency for easier and secure payments, they now hold great promise as a new foundation for all forms of transactions. Agribusiness stands to become a key beneficiary of this technology as a platform to execute ‘smart contracts’ for transactions, particularly for high-value produce. First it is important to distinguish between private digital currencies and the distributed ledger and block chain technologies that underlie them. The distributed and cross-border nature of digital currencies like Bit coin means that regulation of the core protocols of these systems by central banks is unlikely to be effective. Monetary authorities are focused more on understanding ‘on-ramps’ and ‘off-ramps’ that constitute the links to the traditional payments system rather than being able to monitor and regulate the currency itself. In contrast to the digital currency feature of block chain, the distributed ledger feature has the potential for widespread use in agribusiness and trade financing, especially where workflows involve many different parties with no trusted central entity.</jats:p>"

The enterprise management theories are considered, focusing on the process approach based on the methodological basis of managing the organization as a set of business processes. The latter was studied from the point of view of critical characteristics that concentratedly reflect the purpose of business processes, their systemic connection, target orientation, measurability, the interdependence of \"inputs\" and \"outputs,\" and managerial aspects of coordination. The advantages of the process approach to the organization and management of business processes have been identified. Based on the analysis of foreign and domestic scientific literature, a conclusion was made about the shift in the long-term orientation of business entities towards the formation of common advantages through the implementation of methodological concepts of management of logistics supply chains, which are implemented in three levels - as a management philosophy, as a set of measures at the tactical level, as a set of operational layer tools. The elements of the relationship between business process management and logistics supply chain management are revealed, including strategic coordination, information technologies involving external IT interfaces, process orientation reflecting the flow of value creation, and employee empowerment. The supply chain is presented in terms of a business process that connects different enterprises. The algorithm for ensuring emergencyness based on implementing a process-oriented management system with a reflection of the flow of value creation has been studied. The reengineering of business processes, which is a response to the challenges of the external environment, is disclosed in the context of considering the key characteristics of the essence of the business process and the need for integration within the framework of logistics supply chains, including integrity, communicability, autonomy, orderliness, stability, manageability.\nKeywords: analysis, management, logistics supply chain, strategic development, business processes.</jats:p>",

One example is the pharmaceutical industry, which is responsible for providing medicinal products. The pharmaceutical supply chain assumes a crucial position within the pharmaceutical industry as it enables the secure, streamlined, and dependable transportation of medications from producers to individuals in need. The issue of prioritizing digital transformation within the pharmaceutical supply chain has emerged as a significant problem for hospitals and pharmaceutical businesses. Integrating different components inside the system is effectively supported by the substantial function fulfilled by Enterprise Architecture in this specific context. The objective is to minimize errors, enhance inventory management, optimize product distribution, and guarantee the safety and quality of pharmaceuticals. However, the process of adequately monitoring and verifying data has its challenges. However, these challenges can be efficiently addressed through implementing blockchain technology. In addition to this, Blockchain technology has the potential to enhance industrial efficiency. Utilizing blockchain technology enables the facilitation of transparency, immutability, and data integrity across the entirety of the supply chain. Integrating Enterprise Architecture electronic automation with Blockchain technology enables pharmaceutical enterprises to establish robust systems facilitated by Smart Contracts. The use of this system is expected to significantly enhance automation and regulatory adherence within supply chain processes, leading to notable advancements in operational efficiency, security, and data accuracy.

Studies have suggested, an improved Supply Chain Management (SCM) towards Sustainable Supply Chain (SSCM) could help in this regard, however there are barriers observed to its implementation in the construction industry. Building Information Modelling (BIM) too is considered a positive disrupter in the construction industry due to the potential in its applications, and one of such potential is improving the SCM. However, similar to SCM, adoption of BIM faces several barriers. Preliminary review suggests that some of its barriers could be resolved by integrating with Blockchain, another disruptor stemming from Industry 4.0. Hence, this paper attempts to assess how the synergy of BIM and blockchain would improve the SCM of the construction industry. For that purpose, through a systematic literature review, the paper structures the barriers of SCM, and barriers and benefits of BIM and blockchain in construction industry across the dimensions of Socio-technical, Industrial, Organizational, Financial, Legal and Institutional, and Sustainability, and conceptually maps the barriers and benefits to identify their collective impact on SCM.  From this study it was found that with the help of Blockchain integration, there are a number of potential synergies that may solve critical inherent issues in both BIM and SCM, such as reluctance of information sharing and trust, sustainability concerns and safety, leading to positive cumulative impact on SCM. However, it was also recognized that there can be negative as well as neutral cumulative impacts on areas such as cost, and lack of personnel, knowledge and institutional support that can lead to an opposite impact.</jats:p>",

Transportation being one of the major contributors to environmental pollution because of incessant burning of fossil fuels. EVs are being considered to be the best possible solution to alleviate vehicular pollution. However, proliferation of EVs create additional burden on the power grids. The consumption of electrical power is steadily rising because of even-growing population and the demand is particularly higher during summer months due to higher use of air conditioners. To ease this pressure on the grid the novel vehicle-to-grid or V2G technology is being employed whereby idle electric vehicles can be put to use as giant batteries that can send power back to the grid to supplement its output. With the wide scale adoption of electrical buses is schools this turns out to be a feasible option. Battery driven school buses are best suited for this. These vehicles remain idle for major portion of the day and also during summer months and can be effectively utilized for generating electricity using their batteries. However, there are challenges involved in the implementation of this strategy. Besides lack of charging infrastructure and limited knowledge of owners about the nature and benefits of the implementation there are also problems of rapid battery degradation, lack of control on the vehicle and the process and high costs involved. Nevertheless, using literature review this article explains the rationale behind adoption of the technology and highlights, the strategies that can be adopted to effectively exploit this novel technology to make the most out of idle electric school buses to support public utilities. To an extent electric school buses and the v2g technology can be potentially helpful for stabilizing supply of electricity during peak hours and improve efficiency of supply chain management of several industries including the power sector.</jats:p>"

Using a difference‐in‐differences estimator, we show that a negative supply shock to first‐lien mortgages has little impact on the volume of purchases financed with a mortgage, but significantly reduces the average first‐lien loan balance. Much of this reduction in loan balances is the result of increased bunching at the conforming loan limit that is achieved through a combination of greater second mortgage utilization and larger downpayments. Importantly, we find significant heterogeneity in the response to the mortgage supply shock across borrower characteristics and house price levels. Home purchase volume does decline after the shock for less creditworthy borrowers and in expensive locations. The reduction in first‐lien balances is fairly uniform across borrower types, however, the effect is slightly more acute in less expensive areas. Our results suggest that financial market frictions (e.g., downpayment constraints, imperfect credit) play an important role in determining how credit supply shocks impact housing purchases and borrowing behavior.</jats:p>",

This is in line with the primary objective of supply chain management, which is to enable and deliver high-level customer service with lower costs, reduce lead time, and improve the quality of products/services. The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model based on KPI metrics enables an increase in the quality of products/services by monitoring and digitalising involved processes. The current paper suggests the structure of the SCOR database for Supply Chain process improvement by applying the best practices of the SCOR for Business Processes improvement. We recommend the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) methods to estimate the influence of these improvements on Supply Chain efficiency through key performance indicators before implementation. Integrating the methods proposed in this article focuses on an approach that minimises supply chain failures, decreases failure elimination time, understands consumer needs, and offers more accurate price proposals and lead times to improve customer satisfaction. Accordingly, the integrated SCOR-based Business Process Modelling (BPM) was not previously combined with BBN to identify the most efficient ways to improve the reliability of a Supply Chain by applying best practices, which impacts the entire supply chain. Our research is limited to SME companies in electronics manufacturing, but our ambition is to develop a universal framework suitable for broader areas. The study aims to analyse how the customers see the company by combining the CDA (Customer Delivery Accuracy) and Customer Complaints measures and find the optimal way to improve business processes by applying best practices. Still, it is limited to SCOR reliability performance metrics.</jats:p>"

This manuscript examines the problem of cooperation decisions between members of the new energy vehicle supply chain, namely a battery manufacturer and vehicle producer. The benefits of the two members are analyzed by constructing two models, one with non-incentives and the other with government incentives. The model uses the triangular fuzzy number (TFN) instead of parameters in numerical calculations, taking complete account of the influence of uncertain environmental factors and using the triangular structured element method. The numerical examples result that government incentives positively promote cooperation between the two players, but the incentives should be as equal as possible. Finally, we aim to encourage supply chain members to cooperate and promote the development of the new energy vehicle industry.

RFID is not a new technology but still Bangladesh can’t utilize of this technology and even RFID based distribution system. RFID technology could make business value in different levels of supply chain management. Many world-famous brands established their production house in Bangladesh mainly readymade garments, leather goods, textile, and energy-related companies, for the low production and low labor cost.  Bangladesh is a late candidate in the e-commerce industry, and it is getting tremendous popularity within a short period. Bangladesh is a growing technological nation and trying to implement innovative technology in every sector. RFID technology has an excellent opportunity to explore Bangladesh's business industry, especially for e-commerce based supply chain networks. All this literature examined the structure of RFID and its related factors. I this chapter, exiting literature associated with the factors affecting RFID adoption in e-commerce supply chain management in Bangladesh has been presented. Key elements such as technological, organizational, and environmental factors that influence RFID adoption are highlighted. The benefits and advantages of this technology implementation in the supply chain network in Bangladesh are also explained.</jats:p>"

We focus on residential mortgage backed securities, resMBS, which were at the heart of the 2008 US financial crisis. These securities are contained within a prospectus and have a complex waterfall payoff structure. Multiple financial institutions form a supply chain to create the prospectuses. To model this supply chain, we use unsupervised probabilistic methods, particularly dynamic topics models (DTM), to extract a set of features reflecting community (topic) formation and temporal evolution along the chain. We then provide insight into the performance of the resMBS securities and the impact of the supply chain communities through a series of increasingly comprehensive models. First, models at the security level directly identify salient features of resMBS securities that impact their performance. We then extend the model to include prospectus level features and demonstrate that the composition of the prospectus is significant. Our model also shows that communities along the supply chain that are associated with the generation of the prospectuses and securities have an impact on performance. We are the first to show that toxic communities that are closely linked to financial institutions that played a key role in the subprime crisis can increase the risk of failure of resMBS securities.</jats:p><jats:p>History: Olivia Sheng served as the senior editor for this article.</jats:p><jats:p>Funding: This research was partially supported by National Science Foundation [Grant CNS1305368] and National Institute of Standards and Technology [Grant 70NANB15H194].</jats:p><jats:p>Data Ethics &amp; Reproducibility Note: No data ethics considerations are foreseen related to this article.

This study was conducted in the Jodhpur district of Western Rajasthan, India, which has a hot semi-arid climate and faces an acute shortage of good-quality water for irrigation. As a result, municipal wastewater is being used in agricultural fields in urban and peri-urban areas of Jodhpur. This study evaluates the suitability of municipal wastewater for irrigation in agriculture. Samples were collected from the Basni Bedan drainage area during December, 2022 and were analysed for various physico-chemical and biological parameters. The SAR value and EC were observed as 13 + 0.20 Meq/L and 1352.5 + 20.11 μS cm−1. BOD, DO, and COD values were obtained 56 + 2.57, 365 + 7.64, and 3.55 + 0.13 mg/L, respectively, which were above the Indian Standard permissible levels. High levels of total coliform counts, 177.5 + 4.86 MPN/100mL, were found. Statistical analysis reveals a positive correlation for pairs chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (R=0.98) and a negative correlation for pairs BOD and dissolved oxygen (DO) (R=0.99). It was concluded that the studied wastewater is polluted and may cause potential health risks. There is a need for proper planning and strategies to develop an economical viable treatment system for sustainable agricultural management.</jats:p>",

Collaboration among enterprises has become crucial for enhancing core competitiveness, with the concept of the supply chain playing a key role. However, the complex and vulnerable nature of the supply chain operation environment poses various risks, hampering effective cooperative relationships between enterprises. This article proposed integrating the partial least-squares-artificial neural network (PLS-ANN) method to address this issue and optimize collaborative enterprise practices. The study examined enterprise collaboration optimization. This article uses used artificial neural network (ANN) to classify various complex data, implement an intelligent algorithm model for synchronous processing, and combine partial least squares (PLS) to classify and process the data information generated by collaborative networks to find the best match, minimizing the negative impact of multiple correlations of variables on enterprise collaboration. An empirical analysis was conducted in 2022, focusing on a manufacturing enterprise's supply chain and external cooperation management. The analysis examined two aspects: the supply chain's risk resistance level and the effectiveness of enterprise cooperation. Results showed that after implementing the PLS-ANN model, the average trust index between the enterprise and eight cooperative partners increased to approximately 0.652, compared to the initial average trust index of only 0.528. Detailed data analysis indicated that the PLS-ANN method effectively improved the supply chain's risk resistance capability while optimizing the cooperative relationships among all participating enterprises.</p>",

Considering the cost structure of the life cycle of pumping equipment, the main costs should include investment costs, electricity costs during operation, and costs of repairing pumping equipment. Considering the growing cost of electricity in the world, the cost of manufacturing pumping equipment is significantly increasing, which in turn causes an increase in its price. The key factor in increasing the competitiveness of such equipment on the market is its modernization with the achievement of a higher level of energy efficiency with a simultaneous reduction in cost due to a reduction in weight and dimension parameters. In the research, a significant increase in the head from 15 m to 65 m of the submersible pump stage was achieved by increasing the rotation frequency from 3000 rpm to 6000 rpm and designing the pump for this rotation frequency. As a result, the pump head, created by the flowing part with the basic stage (eight pieces), can be provided by the pump using only two designed stages. It creates the prerequisites for reducing the mass of the pump from 200 kg to 45 kg, or by 77.5%. Also, in designing the pump, energy efficiency was increased from 74.6% (for the existing pump) to 79.4% (by 5% for the developed pump). The research results made it possible to significantly contribute to reducing the cost of the life cycle of the submersible pump installation.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, accumulation patterns of zinc and the harm of excessive zinc on sweet potato have not been well explored. In present research, two genotypes sweet potato varieties with different accumulation patterns of zinc were selected for analyzing the effects of excessive zinc on sweet potato via hydroponic and field cultivation experiments. The results indicated that transfer coefficient was closely related to zinc concentration in storage root of sweet potato. Excessive zinc inhibited the growth of sweet potato plants by causing imbalanced mineral concentration, destroying the cellular structure and reducing photosynthesis. Further, a total of 17,945 differentially expressed genes were identified in in the two genotypes under zinc stress by transcriptomic analysis. And differentially expressed genes involved in absorption and transport of zinc, defense network and transcription factors played important roles in responding to zinc stress. In conclusion, this study provides a reference for the selection of sweet potato varieties in zinc contaminated soil and lays a foundation of investigating the tolerance of sweet potato for excessive zinc, which is meaningful for environmental safety and human health.</jats:p>"

The share of freight and insurance costs on grain and fertilizer imports by Kenya from Russia and Ukraine in total freight and insurance costs on grain and fertilizer from world have also been used. After controlling for sensitivity and incorporating depreciation of the exchange rate and a dummy on drought as covariates, the results indicate the war has had insignificant impact on imports of grain and fertilizer by Kenya though the impact is negative for grain but positive for fertilizer. The findings have policy implications touching on need for African countries to diversify import sources for grain and fertilizer, enhance productive capacities through investment on irrigation, strengthen diplomatic ties with existing import sources for grain and fertilizer, and invest in climate action to tackle drought incidences.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this research is to identify the relation ties between EU countries in order to clarify the characteristics of the network, such as its crucial actors, vulnerabilities, structural holes, etc., to help achieve some proposals for a more sustainable and secure energy supply. This will help identify the underlying causes of recurring energy crises in the EU and provide insight into developing management strategies for further studies. Following this purpose, we examined the trade network density to clarify typical characteristics of the network, applied degree centrality measures to identify the most central importer and exporter countries, and found the dominance and critical vulnerabilities of actors in the network by using domestic import data of the EU countries. Finally, we recommend some policies and management strategies according to the obtained results and previous literature for further discussion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, the sustainability supply chain is one of the hottest discussions in the world among practitioners, academicians, and governments. Therefore, Indonesia is a developing country that also pays more attention to involvement. Indonesia has the most significant coconut production in the world, followed by India and the Philippines. However, based on previous research, the sustainability of the coconut in Indonesia is under threat to supply chain operation. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the crucial indicators of sustainable practices to measure the performance of a sustainable supply chain system. This study aims to assess an instrument's content validity and inter-rater reliability to determine a set of crucial key performance indicators (KPIs) for the sustainable supply chain coconut industry. Initially, this study reviewed the existing sustainable supply chain indicators and developed a list of indicators suitable for the coconut supply chain. Then, the indicators were assessed and validated by a group of five experts. The validity test was analyzed using Aiken's V indexes and interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The validity test showed that the percentage of Aiken V, 60.78% (31 indicators) were valid, and 39.22% (22 hands) were invalid. In the inter-correlation coefficients test using a 95% confidence level, the ICC value obtained for the economic dimension is .743, categorized as moderate reliability; the environmental dimension is .684 (moderate); and the social dimension is .845, categorized as good reliability, and the average measure of the ICC value was .76 (good reliability). In conclusion, Aiken’s V index was used to determine the number of indicators. Only 31 could be further used as an instrument to determine the critical indicators for coconut supply chain sustainability in Riau Province-Indonesia.</jats:p>"

However, the insulin supply chain faces multifaceted challenges that can disrupt access to this essential medication. In the realm of diabetes management, a novel and devastating occurrence has emerged—a severe shortage of insulin. This case report revolves around a singular clinical encounter that showcases a series of remarkable and uncommon aspects, which can enrich the knowledge of healthcare professionals. The patient’s condition presented several unique features, providing a learning opportunity that transcends the typical clinical scenarios seen in diabetes management. The findings surrounding the unavailability of insulin, the dire consequences it has on patients, and the clinical course and prognosis of an individual patient closely related to previous challenges. The shortage of insulin, though not a new challenge, has now reached unparalleled levels, resulting in life-threatening situations for those dependent on this vital hormone. This case report delves into a unique scenario where an individual patient’s health dramatically deteriorated due to the insulin scarcity, highlighting the urgency for comprehensive solutions and international cooperation to ensure access to this life-saving medication. This case report manuscript reviews the importance of enhancing the resistance and resilience of the insulin supply chain to ensure uninterrupted access to insulin for people with diabetes. We discuss the current challenges, their impact on diabetes management, and propose strategies to mitigate these issues. Strengthening the insulin supply chain is essential for the well-being of those living with diabetes, highlighting its significance for healthcare systems globally.</jats:p>"

The literature tends to treat inherent and adaptive resilience as somewhat separate constructs. Thus, this study also aims to provide some insights into the relatively underexamined area of how inherent resilience synergistically works with adaptive resilience to maintain flows for food supply chains in a developing economy context. To address the research aim, two supply chain wide case studies were used to investigate the contribution of logistic activities toward the resilience of foods supply chains in two different South Asian regions. This context was selected as these regions are prone to frequent natural disruptions and other disruptions, and these food supply chains also play a crucial role in economy and providing relief supplies to their communities. Logistics operations play a key role in achieving overall supply chain resilience. The sources of inherent resilience are the network structure, buffer capacity, and strong social connections among the actors. Adaptive resilience is derived from transportation flows, storage, information sharing, and demand management processes. Surprisingly, resilience in this context is achieved despite the relatively low level of integration, an unsophisticated technological landscape and compromised logistics infrastructure. Still, resilience can be enhanced further. This study contributes to the sparse literature that examines logistics activities that influence the resilience of food supply chains in the context of natural disasters and other disruptions. Furthermore, uncovering the substructure of logistics resilience activities, and surprisingly, the synergies between inherent and adaptive resilience, adds to the emerging body of literature.</jats:p>",

Chiro town's population is increasing, and the community is affected by water and excreta-borne diseases as a result of a lack of proper sanitation facilities and a water supply system. In this study, billed data from Chiro Town water supply service enterprise customers have been used to assess the performance of the water distribution network over ten years (2011-2020). The findings show that the Town's water coverage is 62.9%, the water demand is 8,121.6m3/day, and the computed annual water production is 4,222.3m3/day. Residents of the town have complained about a lack of access to improved drinking water supplies, low water consumption, and sanitation facilities, particularly in the community of those who live in the town's borders and practice open defecation. For all domestic use, 16.32% and 83.68% of respondents used unprotected and protected water sources, respectively. This study suggested that strong sectoral coordination, community involvement, and sufficient financial resources were required to identify the root causes and provide an efficient water supply system in the study area.</jats:p>",

In Kenya, floricultural firms are exposed to varied disruptions, bottlenecks and delays in their supply chain ecosystem, and this was worsened by the global Covid-19 pandemic. It is therefore crucial for firms to employ the right resilience strategies to prepare for such disruptions in responding and recovering faster to continue operating and improve performance. However whether, how and which resilience strategies affect performance in floricultural firms is a topic that remain under-explored. Using the Complex Adaptive System, Relational, Contingency and Agency theories together with the empirical literature, the study sheds light on the relationship between resilience strategies and firm performance. The specific objectives were to establish: the effects of supply chain collaboration, flexibility, agility and risk management strategies on the performance of floricultural firms in Nakuru County, Kenya. The study adopted descriptive and correlation research design. Target population was 101 flower firms. Primary data was collected using questionnaires. Using SPSS, descriptive and inferential statistics were carried out using ordinal multiple regression and correlation analysis. The study findings will guide the various businesses that are rethinking their business model and finding solutions to survive business disruptions affecting supply chains, by providing information on how to develop the right resilience strategies to deal with unforeseen disruptions and improve their performance.\nKEY WORDS: Supply Chain Collaboration, Supply Chain Flexibility, Supply Chain Agility, Supply Chain Risk Management, Performance Kenya.</jats:p>"

Supply chain processes that include several parties, such as production, processing, and delivery, interacting with one another. Lack of transparency in the agricultural supply chain is a major contributor to the incidence of fraud in this industry. A lack of openness on the part of organisations leads to worries about potential financial losses, diminishing customer trust, and dwindling brand value. Several fundamental changes to the existing supply chain architecture are required to foster the development of an effective and reliable trade environment. It is widely recognised that blockchain technology has the potential to increase visibility across agricultural and food supply chains. Businesses are using blockchain and IoT to implement more egalitarian, sustainable, and consumer-friendly methods of food production. Based on what we learned, blockchain technology may be useful in the push for a more transparent and responsible food supply chain. The primary goal of this study is to create a decentralised application framework called AgriBlock that can be used for managing the supply chains of agricultural products using blockchain technology. The developed work AgriBlock will aid in making the supply chain process more open and clear to every participant involved.</jats:p>"

Researchers recruit 45 respondents through snowball and purposive techniques. To obtain the required data, researchers make use of In-Depth Interviews (IDI), focus group Discussions (FGD) and document review. Through tables created manually, researchers code and analyse data content wise. Findings show that the supply chain of seaweed just like other crops involve activities like farming and harvesting, storage and preservation, value and quality addition well as marketing. However, seaweed farmers were confronted by challenges include low price, lack of proper storage facilities, farming and harvesting facilities, climatic changes among others. Thus, based on the observed findings, researchers recommend the establishment of well facilitated drying and storage centres, sufficing farmers with adequate information regarding seaweed market and prices worldwide and establishment of seaweed processing industries which will help in minimizing the act of selling raw seaweed abroad.</jats:p>"

The commonly used indicators of the uniformity of water distribution in sprinkler systems are Christiansen's uniformity (CU) and distribution uniformity (DU) coefficients. A more comprehensive analysis of water distribution is essential in situations where the reliability of these coefficients as indicators of water distribution patterns is limited. In the present research, distribution maps of water depth were prepared from water application profiles using catch cans experiments that were carried out in the research farm of the Agriculture and Natural Resources Faculty of the University of Tehran, which is located in Alborz province. In this way, water application profile data were obtained at different operating pressures (200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 kPa). By using this data, 2D and 3D distribution maps of water depth were created due to the overlapping of sprinklers in different arrangements, spacing, and pressures. In addition, CU and DU coefficients in square, rectangular, and triangular arrangements with different spacing and pressures from 200 to 400 kPa. A total of 11,250 different simulations were calculated and analyzed. Distribution maps of water depth contribute to advancing the understanding of sprinkler irrigation system performance and aid in the optimization of water management practices.</jats:p>",

Such agreements are typically expected to create trade flows and increase supply of relatively low‐priced products in Canada. Industry groups representing Canadian producers and processors of supply‐managed products negotiated to receive approximately C$5 billion in payments from the federal government as compensation for the prospects of facing more international competition and reduced domestic sales. We discuss partial‐equilibrium simulation models that are commonly used by academics and governments to project market effects of new trade agreements, and conceptually illustrate how different assumptions about import supply conditions generate different projected market outcomes. We focus on the quota fill rates of new access commitments—most studies, including those used to inform government policies on compensation payments, assume imports increase in an amount equal to new commitments. This is often not the case, including with recent Canadian trade agreements. We apply a conceptual framework to Canada's supply‐management industry by re‐simulating a quantitative model of the Canadian dairy industry with updated information on implementation and quota fill rates. Projected market effects of trade agreements under the assumption of full import quotas are markedly different from projections that account for unfilled quotas. We discuss the political economy and welfare implications of compensation payments in light of our analysis.</jats:p>",

The manuscript begins with a literature review in the fields of both marketing and supply chain, resulting in a framework that defines a systematic process to deliver customer value by creating synergy between the two fields. This framework is then validated through empirical activities at Company Beta. Regarding the findings, it appears that the application of the conceptual framework, endorsing the importance of closed-loop customer feedback, highlights the role that a supply chain-marketing interface plays in delivering customer value. Nonetheless, there are some necessary prerequisites and contextual variables that must be taken into consideration to ensure a successful implementation of the framework. Since the framework validation is based on a single case study, results cannot be generalized. The preliminary results suggest that a contingent approach is necessary to adapt the framework to different company contexts, paving the way for future research. Existing studies address ways in which companies should restructure to support the integration of marketing and supply chains, and researchers are in harmony that the integration can contribute to company success. As of yet, there is no comprehensive guide for the inter-functional activities needed to leverage the supply chain-marketing interface towards customer-centricity and customer value creation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bioplastics have the potential to fill the role of conventional plastics but with lowered environmental and ecological impacts. But bioplastic production suffers from high production costs and as an immature technology, it proves less competitive than its petrol-based counterpart. Debates about the social versus private benefits of bioplastics are also cited. The literature argues that various bio-feedstock sources can produce high-quality drop-in plastics and that scaling up bioplastic production will provide the cost competitiveness needed to transition away from petroplastics. However, the market remains uncoordinated and lacks a strategic and comprehensive plan for the plastic transition. Moreover, the science-to-policy literature on bioplastics is very limited, providing scarce evidence or analysis to policymakers attempting to argue for bioplastics industrialization and integration. In this study we highlight this missing link particularly in the North American context in order to encourage further inquiry on these matters. Using Stern’s policy framework gap analysis approach, our evaluation identifies gaps in existing policy frameworks pertinent to bioplastics supply chains. On this basis we identify and prioritize five pointed areas for policy focus to advance bioplastics sector growth and integration. These are developing a strategy to sustainably coordinate and promote biomass production; incentivizing bioplastic investments and production; incentivizing bioplastic substitution; and enhancing the end-use management. Additionally, research is needed to support the technical performance of bioplastics, industrialization methods, supply chain integration, and the impact of exogenous factors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many consumers depend on the contemporaneous growth of their food resources. For example, <jats:italic>Tanytarsus gracilentus</jats:italic> midges feed on algae, and because midge generation time is much longer than that of algae, individual midges benefit not just from the standing stock but also from the growth of algae during their lifespans. This implies that an intermediate consumption rate maximizes midge somatic growth: low consumption rates constrain midge growth because they do not fully utilize the available food, whereas high consumption rates suppress algal biomass growth and consequently limit future food availability. An experiment manipulating midge presence and initial algal abundance showed that midges can suppress algal growth, as measured by changes in algal gross primary production (GPP). We also found a positive relationship between GPP and midge growth. A consumer–resource model fit to the experimental data showed a hump‐shaped relationship between midge consumption rates and their somatic growth. In the model, predicted midge somatic growth rates were only positively associated with GPP when their consumption rate was below the value that optimized midge growth. Therefore, midges did not overexploit algae in the experiment. This work highlights the balance that consumers which depend on contemporaneous resource growth might have to strike between short‐term growth and future food availability, and the benefits for consumers when they ‘manage' their resources well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a subset simulation-based approach is proposed to tackle the network reliability analysis problem in supply chain risk assessment. The reliability of the supply chain is essential for seamless operations in modern businesses. Network reliability analysis evaluates the continuity and reliability of business operations in the event of failures occurring in nodes and paths within the supply chain system. Traditional methods for network reliability analysis often rely on computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulation due to the complexities and high-dimensional input space of supply chain systems. To overcome this challenge, a subset simulation-based approach is proposed in this paper. Subset simulation is an efficient method which employs importance sampling and Bayesian inference to accurately estimate the probability of extreme events. To implement the approach, the supply chain system is modeled as a network and sample uncertainties associated with input parameters. Subsequently, subset simulation techniques are utilized to generate a set of samples and evaluate the reliability of the supply chain system and assess potential risks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a real-world supply chain system. The results demonstrate that the approach achieves superior computational efficiency compared to traditional Monte Carlo simulation methods, while accurately assessing risks within the supply chain system.</jats:p>",

Having rich natural resources, the republic cannot fully provide the local population with the necessary food. The region’s provision level with meat is still below 30%, with milk and vegetables - below 60%. This is due to several factors affecting agriculture in the region and insufficient funding from the state. Scientific studies show a reduction in the number of cattle over the past 20 years from 289.7 to 180.9 thousand heads, or by 37.56%, due to a decrease in the forage base in the context of a reduction in pasture and hayfield areas. The territorial location of the Republic in the northern regions of Russia, the sharply continental climate, the peculiar way of life, the high level of urbanisation and the outflow of residents to the other areas of the country dictate the need for priority state support. Currently, the region is managed based on targeted programs. However, state support funds are inconsistent and unstable, which causes the need to develop organisational and economic measures for the sustainable development of the region’s industry and improve the current state support mechanism with an emphasis on the conservation and reproduction of local animal breeds (Yakut breed of cattle), the development of gene pool farms in the region, the preservation of traditional industries and the rural way of life.</jats:p>"

Water scarcity poses a formidable challenge in various countries, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. Among the potential solutions, the adoption of water harvesting technologies stands out for capturing and storing rainwater to address water shortages. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these structures hinge significantly on their precise placement. To address this issue, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework that integrates multiple criteria, encompassing rainfall intensity, land slope, soil type, and land use, to discern the most suitable locations for water harvesting structures. A practical application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study conducted in the Sabarmati river basin. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying highly suitable locations for water harvesting structures, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of water security in the region.</jats:p>",

A key element of optimizing the financial flow of these complex networks is to pay attention to the financial aspects of these complex networks since they are becoming more and more complex and expanding. This study aims to investigate the supply chain of a pharmaceutical company’s holding company and its subsidiaries while using internal resource valuation to develop a new strategy for financing the company’s operations. There is a process of money circulation through the chain, which consists of passing through two treasuries (primary and secondary), which provide liquidity to compensate the deficits of some institutions with the excess liquidity of other institutions. In this article, we present three simulation-based models based on a case study conducted at Shafa Darou Investment Company in Tehran-Iran, a leading pharmaceutical investment company in the country, to examine the impact of implementing this idea in the real world. Considering the study’s results, it has been shown that the supply chain as a whole has improved in terms of its working capital. Using a set of local treasuries is generally associated with reducing risks and a greater level of stability when relying on the excess liquidity of chain members provided that financial independence from external institutions, such as banks, is maintained. In addition, if the members’ excess liquidity is deposited in a set of local treasuries rather than a bank, the profit and internal financial flow within the chain will be circulated throughout the chain, and more added value will be generated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to evaluate the environmental impact of various sustainable strategies implemented within the food supply chain, utilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a core methodology. The paper begins by identifying critical points in the food supply chain where sustainability practices can be integrated, ranging from agricultural production to processing, distribution, consumption, and waste management. Through a comprehensive review and application of LCA, the research quantifies the environmental benefits and trade-offs of adopting practices such as reduced use of chemical inputs, implementation of circular economy principles, and enhancement of logistics and packaging solutions. The findings demonstrate that strategic interventions in the supply chain can significantly reduce carbon footprints, water usage, and waste generation, contributing to the overall sustainability of the food system. The study further discusses the implications of these strategies for stakeholders, including policymakers, producers, retailers, and consumers, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts in achieving sustainable outcomes. Additionally, the paper explores the challenges and opportunities in scaling these practices, considering technological, economic, and social factors. The research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable food systems and offers practical insights for implementing LCA in evaluating and improving environmental performance in the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

A blockchain does not require a central authority to control all data, reducing organizations’ need to disclose their proprietary information. All supply chain participants share only the data essential for a specific record or transaction. In this study, peer-reviewed journal articles were used as secondary data sources for data collection regarding blockchain usage in the food sector. After analyzing the collected data, key findings were organized into relevant themes to address the study’s objectives using content analysis. Organizations can adopt a cost-benefit analysis in the food industry when traceability technology is combined with blockchain. Transparency increases revenue and profitability, especially in segments where consumers are willing to pay. However, several risks and challenges must be addressed, including vulnerabilities, piracy, contractual disputes, and hacking. Using smart contracts, blockchain automates production processes and facilitates real-time order settlement. Even the most secure cryptocurrencies on the blockchain can be traced to varying degrees, emphasizing the importance of blockchain transaction reliability. To address privacy concerns and enable data-sharing capabilities, food companies should integrate blockchain with the Internet of Things (IoT). Using blockchain technology in food supply chain and packaging operations can also enhance transparency and traceability by enabling consumers to scan product codes using a mobile app.</jats:p>"

The present paper reports a case study on the demonstration of a `smart graded-water supply grid' on the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, India. The paper describes the transformation of ∼13 km long water distribution network that supplies drinking water to ∼5,000 inhabitants into smart supply grid by deploying sensors and establishing an IoT-enabled real-time monitoring platform. The data sets of water flow and pressure collected from sensor nodes are analyzed to understand the characteristic diurnal water usage profiles unique to student hostels on the campus.

The peer takes an Indigenous harm reduction approach and is focused on meeting the needs of the whole person. The peer has regular contact with approximately 50 clients and navigates medication delivery and appointments for approximately 10–15 people each day. Clients have been retained on the medication, and experienced improvement in other outcomes, including securing housing, employment and managing acute and chronic health conditions. The peer has established contact with clients since March 2020 to support engagement with health care and continuity of medication access. This program highlights the importance and value of peer-led work and need for further investments in peer-led programs to respond to the unregulated drug poisoning crisis.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This peer-led intervention is a promising approach to engaging people who remain disconnected from health services in care in a rural community.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of this research is to define a lunar-orbiting system that provides power to the lunar surface through wireless power transmission. To meet the power demand of a lunar base, a constellation of satellites placed in stable orbits is used. Each satellite of this constellation consists of solar arrays and batteries that supply a power transmission system. This system is composed of a laser that transmits power to receivers on the lunar surface. The receivers are photonic power converters, photovoltaic cells optimized for the laser’s monochromatic light. The outputs of this work will cover the architecture of the system by studying different orbits, specifically analyzing some subsystems such as the laser, the battery pack and the receiver placed on the lunar ground. The study is conducted considering two different energy demands and thus two different receivers location: first, at the strategic location of the Artemis missions’ landing site, the Shackleton Crater near the lunar south pole; second, on the lunar equator, in anticipation of future and new explorations. The goal is to evaluate the possible configurations to satisfy the power required for a lunar base, estimated at approximately 100 kW. To do this, several cases were analyzed: three different orbits, one polar, one frozen and one equatorial (Earth–Moon distant retrograde orbit) with different numbers of satellites and different angles of the receiver’s cone of transmission. The main objective of this paper is to perform a comprehensive feasibility study of the aforementioned system, with specific emphasis placed on selected subsystems. While thermal control, laser targeting, and attitude control subsystems are briefly introduced and discussed, further investigation is required to delve deeper into these areas and gain a more comprehensive understanding of their implementation and performance within the system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The inverter module serves as a critical component in the conversion of electrical energy within arc plasma power sources, exerting a profound influence on the overall performance and stability of the power supply. Consequently, the meticulous design and precise control of the inverter module are of paramount importance in ensuring the effective operation and application of arc plasma power sources. This paper introduces a dual-closed-loop control system, integrating a voltage outer loop with a current inner loop, as the cornerstone of its inverter module design. It also undertook a comprehensive comparative analysis of various voltage-control strategies, encompassing four control methods (PI, PID, PR, QPR) and two modulation techniques (bipolar modulation and unipolar, carrier-based modulation) under diverse operating conditions. Additionally, simulation experiments were conducted on a prototype 10 kW inverter module using the Matlab/Simulink simulation platform, with evaluation criteria including waveform tracking performance, voltage waveform distortion rate, and steady-state error. The results indicate that in low-frequency operating conditions, the voltage-control strategy employing QPR control plus unipolar, carrier-based modulation, and in high-frequency operating conditions, the voltage-control strategy utilizing PI control plus unipolar, carrier-based modulation exhibited superior waveform tracking performance. The waveform distortion rates were measured at below 0.47% and 4.2%, respectively, aligning perfectly with the stringent standards of IEEE 519. This research provides valuable theoretical support and practical guidance for future engineering endeavors in the field of inverters.</jats:p>"

This research develops theoretical aspects of understanding digitalization in Indonesia, which consists of supply chain capability variables mediating between digitalization and digital connectivity. Additionally, the study explores the roles of digital culture and technological turbulence as moderators influencing operational performance. Then, there is digital connectivity that will affect operational performance. This study uses a quantitative method with data sources derived from surveys through the distribution of online questionnaires to 48 Employees in the Logistics Department. The data analysis technique used is SEM-PLS and IPMA Analysis using SmartPLS software. Digitalization exhibits the greatest impact on operational performance in the presence of a mediating variable, which is the supply chain capability of PT. As supported by the IPMA analysis, KAI (Persero) at the Head Office indicates that digitalization holds the highest performance value compared to other variables—the management of PT. KAI must focus on digital culture, supply chain capability, and technological turbulence in conjunction with digitalization. This approach is crucial to ensure the company implements the Rapid Apps and maintains operational performance consistently. The study is the first study conducted to analyze the factors that influence operational performance in PT. KAI, so that it can be a reference and additional reference on academic knowledge and managerial aspects.\n </jats:p>"

Working in Walther Spielmeyer’s Munich laboratory (1925–1927), Uchimura sought evidence for a vascular theory of Ammon’s horn sclerosis (AHS). He described an artery supplying the vulnerable sector of the hippocampus, where pathognomonic changes of AHS were noted, and characterized the artery as particularly susceptible to circulatory disturbances. Discovery of this artery led to new concepts and new terminology pertaining to the hippocampus. In addition to having a distinguished career in psychiatry and academia (including a position as University of Tokyo dean), Uchimura was, before attending medical school, one of Japan’s best baseball pitchers; he was eventually named Nippon Professional Baseball Organization commissioner and inducted into the Japan Baseball Hall of Fame. Uchimura’s description of hippocampal vasculature, which is still subject to debate after nearly a century, brought international attention to AHS and epilepsy and showed the hippocampal vasculature to be variable and vulnerable; important considerations for later neurosurgeons in the development of selective mesial temporal surgery. Prominent figures in neurosurgery have since developed classification systems for the hippocampal vasculature in which the artery of Uchimura remains central. Perhaps no other brain artery has been the nexus for such intense investigation and debate about its association to structure, function, disease, and treatment methodology.</jats:p>",

The aims of this review are to ascertain current state of the art in GSCM practices, to critically examine the role of industry 4.0 technologies in GSCM adoption, to examine sustainability and supply chain issues within the renewable energy sector, and to critically discuss tackling these issues using industry 4.0 driven GSCM. A total of 215 review and empirical papers from 2004 to 2023 gathered from three databases (ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science) were reviewed. This research found several GSCM practices and succinctly categorized those based on their respective positions along any given value chain. The practices were categorized as related to: procurement and sourcing, product design, corporate relationship, organizational structure/strategy, logistics and transportation, waste and pollution management and manufacturing. We have found that the ten most mentioned GSCM practices are: Green purchasing, Eco-design, Cooperation with customers, Internal Environmental Management, Reverse logistics, Investment recovery, Green manufacturing, Green design, Collaboration with suppliers and Remanufacturing. Various Industry 4.0 technologies including blockchain, Internet of Things, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence were identified and their role in successful GSCM implementation is highlighted. Sustainability and supply chain related challenges within the renewable energy supply chain were found that include material sourcing and end-of-life management challenges. Finally, a perspective is given on the role of Industry 4.0 driven GSCM in tackling the renewable energy supply chain and sustainability challenges. This article concludes with a presentation of managerial implications and future research directions for managers within different sectors, especially the renewable energy industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Due to increased globalization and its subsequent rise in competitiveness, the role of supply chain services (3PL) in managing logistics, reducing operational and non-operational costs, and managing customer and supplier relationships, have become of utmost importance. Customer-centric production has led to the development of a close relationship between production processes. Amidst all this, the demand for logistic services has dramatically increased, thus putting more pressure on firms for enhanced operational results, and leading to the outsourcing of their internal and external logistic activities. On the other hand, supply chain firms that provide 3PL services seek to enhance their sustainability and predict their customers’ demand. Methods: The authors collected quantitative data from 81 firms that operate in various industrial sectors in Greece. A questionnaire was sent for completion, in which firms could rate and evaluate various aspects that were discerned as important for deciding to cooperate with a 3PL service provider and maintain this cooperation in the long run. To extract the required outcomes, statistical analyses like categorical regression (CATREG) and MANOVA were utilized. Results: The demand for 3PL services was affected by 3PL service providers’ operational performance based on accuracy, reputation, and IT capabilities, while the customer firms’ intention for maintaining cooperation with 3PL service providers was affected by their reliability level, improved service efficiency, and trustworthiness. Conclusions: 3PL service providers should seek to improve the reputation, IT infrastructure, and accuracy of their firm's operations to have a continuous demand for their services. Apart from that, 3PL service providers to maintain the cooperation with their customers, need to enhance the levels of their services reliability and efficiency, while also creating a bond of trust with their existing customers.</jats:p>"

Accurate forecasting helps farmers manage water according to crop needs. This information is critical to maximizing agricultural productivity. This article examines the rainfall forecasting method by analysing key parameters such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, maximum humidity, minimum humidity, evaporation, average wind speed, and wind direction for Pune district, Maharashtra. Furthermore, it takes into account the water requirements of commonly cultivated crops. This holistic analysis informs the decision-making process regarding crop irrigation, determining both the necessity and the appropriate volume of water allocation to the crops</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Manufacturers increasingly recycle end-of-life products to realize residual economic value and mitigate environmental impacts on the economic system. Concurrently, with the burgeoning growth of the product-service system, leasing models offer an alternative method to complete the material loop without direct collection. While prior research has delved into recycling channels, incentive mechanisms, and remanufacturing within closed-loop supply chain management, a comparative analysis between recycling and leasing strategies remains under-explored. This study seeks to bridge this gap by elucidating the manufacturer’s strategic decision-making process, factoring in consumers’ product ownership perceptions. We propose a manufacturer decision model anchored on consumer choices and segment it into three scenarios based on varying ownership perceptions. Our analysis contrasts market demand and profit outcomes across these scenarios. Notably, we discern that a hybrid strategy is optimal when ownership perception is low; however, when such perception is heightened, a dedicated recycling strategy proves more advantageous. Importantly, introducing a leasing option does not entirely overshadow the conventional sales market but is susceptible to being overshadowed itself. From a managerial standpoint, while integrating a leasing program might augment revenue streams, sole reliance on it is inadvisable. Furthermore, reshaping consumption paradigms to emphasize product functionality over ownership can pave the way for more expansive leasing strategies, optimizing revenue generation within a closed-loop framework. </jats:p>",

Notably, there has been a disconnect between the industry and local communities, with fisheries largely producing commodities for wide‐ranging and often distant markets. In response, short food supply chains (SFSCs) are often an important element of the local development strategies of Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs), being regarded as a possible mechanism for increasing added value and (re‐)localising the sector to aid territorial development. This article examines the conditions that lead to SFSCs having a higher market share in a FLAG area. Drawing on social capital theory, we employ a novel <jats:italic>fuzzy‐set</jats:italic> qualitative comparative analysis approach using survey data from FLAG managers from across Europe, in what is a first empirical attempt to apply the method in the context of community‐led local development. The analysis pays particular attention to the three dimensions of social capital—structural, normative‐cognitive and network governance—and finds that while different combinations of social capital can lead to a stronger presence of SFSCs, certain types of social capital are more conducive to SFSCs depending on the nature of territorial factors.</jats:p>",

Such a description is indispensable for assessing the scope of pollution of marine water areas and calculation of the damage inflicted on the marine ecosystem and its natural resources, adjustment and verification of mathematical models which will further be used to prognosticate the consequences of the dam destruction for the marine ecosystem. According to the data published in open sources, development of the environmental, sanitary and microbiological situation in the coastal zone of the city of Odesa over June 2023 is described, the dynamics of some indices of the sea water quality are shown, and the pollutants the concentration of which exceeded the maximum permissible concentrations set for them, as well as sanitary and microbiological indices, according to which the population is forbidden from swimming in the sea, are indicated. In addition, as a consequence of the abnormal desalination of sea waters and the inflow of a large amount of nutrients and organic matter into the sea, the phenomenon of algal bloom is described, and a qualitative forecast of its consequences is provided. It is concluded that owing to the accumulated reserves of organic matter in the bottom sediment probability of hypoxic conditions and suffocation of hydrobionts in the summer periods will increase in the years to follow. It is in view of the accumulation of pollutants in bottom sediments and the expected secondary pollution of sea water that the biological diversity of the marine ecosystem within the Odesa region will degrade and the quality of its biological resources will deteriorate.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to evaluate the hydrochemical properties and water quality of the vital groundwater in the study area, determine effective utilisation methods, and make recommendations for sustainable use. From the data obtained as a result of these analyses, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and sodium percentage (%Na) values were calculated and compared with WHO (World Health Organization) and TS-266 (Turkish Standards) quality standards to determine the characteristics of water for human consumption and irrigation for agricultural purposes. Based on these values, Wilcox diagrams and US Salinity Laboratory diagrams were used. According to these evaluations, it was found that sample SMP1 is not suitable for use as drinking water according to the basic parameters in the reference standards, while the other samples are suitable for drinking and human consumption. Electrical conductivity, %Na, SAR values, US Salinity Laboratory, and Wilcox diagrams were used to evaluate the use of water resources for irrigation purposes. According to the results obtained, all samples except sample SMP1 were found to be suitable for use as irrigation water.</jats:p>",

A comprehensive understanding of drought patterns is imperative to manage these risks and enhance resilience effectively. Precipitation from 18 pluviometer stations was employed to analyze meteorological drought using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) from 1980 to 2018. Additionally, agricultural drought is quantified using three remote sensing-driven indices: vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature conditions index (TCI), and vegetation health index (VHI) from 2000 to 2018. These indices are correlated with SPI to evaluate their performance and gauge vegetation sensitivity to meteorological drought. The Mann–Kendall test assesses trends in drought events and their severity. The results demonstrated that SPI, VCI, TCI, and VHI experienced alternating dry and wet periods with an overall upward trend, especially in mountainous areas, plateau zones, and Haouz plain of the MS region. The correlation analysis establishes a significant relationship between remote sensing-based indices and SPI-6, with mean correlation coefficients exceeding 0.6. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple time scales to comprehensively assess climate's impact on vegetation. Seasonal drought trends analysis indicates no significant negative trends in winter and spring but positive trends in autumn.</jats:p>",

This study was conducted within the manufacturing industry, specifically targeting employees from the automobile sector in Karachi, Pakistan. Data was collected through online Google Forms, utilizing a closed-ended questionnaire deployed on a Likert scale, to explore various independent variables and their impact on supply chain performance. Survey responses indicate that the variables—supply chain flexibility, supply chain agility, research and development, role of MIS, leadership style, and big data analytics—predominantly influence supply chain performance, albeit with one insignificant relationship noted between leadership style and supply chain performance. The research also affirms the significant mediating impact of supply chain performance indicators on organizational performance. The research may confront limitations related to its generalizability across varied industries and regions due to potential disparities in technological adoption and regulatory frameworks, and the exclusive focus on supply chain performance as the sole mediator might overlook alternative pathways through which the independent variables could influence organizational performance. The insights derived from this research could serve as a guide for managers and manufacturing organizations to comprehend the transformations invoked by Industry 4.0, offering a lens through which to perceive shifts in supply chain performance and activities. The study offers a pivotal examination of the evolution in supply chain practices induced by Industry 4.0 and Big Data Analytics within the context of Pakistan’s manufacturing arena, thereby providing a valuable resource for practitioners and academicians to understand and navigate the landscape of digitally transformed supply chains.</jats:p>"

Digitalization is mainly expressed through the utilization of big data that originate from various sources. Blockchain technology has led to the extended adoption of capitalization of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) services, such as cryptocurrency trade platforms. Supply chain firms, in their quest to exploit any means and collaborations available to promote their services, could place advertisements on DeFi’s social media profiles to boost their financial performance. Social media analytics, as a part of the big data family, are an emerging tool for promoting a firm’s digital transformation, based on the plethora of customer behavioral data they provide. This study aims to examine whether the social media analytics of DeFi platforms are capable of affecting their website visibility, as well as the financial performance of supply chain firms. To do so, the authors collected data from the social media profiles of the most-known DeFi platforms and web analytics from the most significant supply chain firms’ websites. For this purpose, proper statistical analysis, Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping, Hybrid Modeling, and Cognitive Neuromarketing models were adopted. Throughout the present research, it has been discerned that from an increase in the social media analytics of DeFi platforms, their website visibility increases, while the organic and paid traffic costs of supply chain firms decrease. Supply chain firms’ website customers tend to increase at the same time.</jats:p>"

Such certificates are increasingly used to claim and prove responsible use of green energy, and there is a strong need for transparency and public verifiability. While the proposed solution is designed for handling electricity it applies to different types of energy as well and the concepts may also be applied to other domains. Transmission System Operators are trusted to record consumption and production of electricity. The movement from volume-based MWh yearly certificates to spot-market aligned hourly or 15 min time-volume based intervals, creates challenges in relation to handling large amounts of data and subsequent transactions. Small discrete intervals gives the certification increased accuracy of energy consumption, as a means to prevent greenwashing, with the cost of higher amounts of transactional data and complexity. To ensure trust in the certification, these certificates must in addition be unique and publicly verifiable. This paper describes how blockchain technology can be used to create the required transparency and public verifiability. We show how large amounts of data can be efficiently handled on blockchains and how confidential data such as the amount of used energy in the certificates can be protected, ensuring privacy and correctness of the certificates.</jats:p>"

The government of each region needs to strive for clean water for the community. Efforts to provide clean water can be realized with the Water Supply System. Water Supply System sustainability indicators need to fulfill three aspects of quality, quantity, and continuity. The aim of this research was to assess the sustainability of the ‘Sugio’ Water Supply System in Lamongan Regency, which served three villages, namely Sugio, Lebakadi, and Sekarbagus. The aspect of water quality, seen from the results of the analysis of the quality of production water, met the quality standards for drinking water. The aspect of water quantity was calculated to meet water needs for the next 20 years. The calculation showed that the daily average debit requirement was 17 L/s and the daily maximum debit was 19 L/s, while the existing debit was 15 L/s. The aspect of water continuity was calculated by the ability to distribute water during an emergency. The calculation showed that the distribution of clean water when there was no source of electrical energy could only be carried out in a maximum of 1 hour, 13 minutes, and 48 seconds. The conclusion obtained was that the sustainability of the ‘Sugio’ Water Supply System from the perspective of water quantity and continuity needed to be improved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water demand management adopts economic and non-economic measures to reduce human water use. However, it is argued in this study that water use changes may cause idle water supply facilities and revenue losses, thereby challenging the sustainability of water supply systems in the context of climate change. A co-governance framework was established to inspire practical strategies of sustaining water supply systems by re-evaluating the long-term impacts of water demand changes. This framework integrates the political, financial, and consumptive needs of the government, the market, and the users through a collaborative strategy coupling both supply-side and demand-side solutions. The proposed framework was applied to the analysis of the sustainability of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project. It is found that the South-to-North Water Diversion Project is not a simple water supply infrastructure but rather a synthesis of supply-side and demand-side water management solutions. Actively releasing water for ecological and cultural purposes is suggested in this study to maintain the socioecological benefits of the project in the context of human water use decline. The economic cost of the water supply could be recovered by ongoing revenues that include not only the water fees charged to users but also the benefits gained from cooperative investment in broader water-related businesses by both the state-owned water-transfer company and local governments in water-receiving areas. The proposed framework and strategies are valuable for other water utilities around the world, especially those challenged by reduced water demand caused by climate change, high water prices, and economic depression.\n                        </jats:p>"

The research used a descriptive method, while the data collection was carried out using a survey technique, the data was analyzed descriptively using the Food Supply Chain Network (FSCN) and Supply Chain Operating Reference (SCOR) analysis framework. The results showed that: (1) The cocoa bean supply chain network in Narmada District, West Lombok NTB, namely: (a) The ultimate goal of the cocoa bean supply chain is within and outside the island of Lombok (Bali and Java), while the development objectives are to pay attention to the level of content, the cut of one of the actors in the supply chain and the uniformity of prices; (b) Supply chain management is about selecting partners that are determined based on factors such as proximity of location, size of purchasing scale, and ease of trade of cocoa beans. The agreements that occur between links are made informally (orally) with cash transactions. Lack of government assistance for cocoa bean supply chain actors; (c) The supply chain structure includes 2 channels, namely channel I (farmers, village collectors, village collectors’ traders, sub-district collectors, wholesalers, inter-island traders) and channel II (farmers, village collectors, wholesalers, off-island traders) Lombok) where each supply chain has a different role. The supply of cocoa beans from the Lombok Island region has not been able to meet the demands of the processing industry; (d) Supply chain resources consist of different physical resources for each member of the chain according to the activities they perform, technological resources still use simple equipment, human resources use labor within and outside the family and capital resources are still limited by the use of own capital and loans; (e) The supply chain business process consists of 3 flows, namely product flows, funds flows and information flows, which are distributed evenly and smoothly. The risks faced by each link in the chain are related to price fluctuations, production damage and market congestion, and the way to build trust is to seamlessly communicate and sell to the same players. (2) The performance of the cocoa bean supply chain, which is in a superior position that must be maintained, namely perfect order fulfilment, delivery performance and asset management (channels I and II), supply cycle order fulfilment and flexibility. The performance that must be improved again to a higher position is the order fulfilment cycle (parity) and flexibility (advantage) in channel II, with the costs incurred by channel I being greater than those of channel II.</jats:p>",

Using the latest CMIP6 climate projections, we focused on Rabi and Kharif crop seasons, which are crucial for the growth of major crops in Pakistan. An empirical climate-crop and a hydrological model based on the Budyko theory were modified and forced to project future CWR changes and the potential widening of the water demand-supply gap until 2,100. Our results indicate a significant rise in mean annual CWR across all zones and emissions scenarios, with increasing rates at 2.30–2.57 mm/yr under SSP585 and 1.0–1.26 mm/yr under SSP245. Both Rabi and Kharif seasons show rising CWR, notably more under SSP585 (Kharif: 8%–14%, Rabi: 12%–15%) than SSP245 (Kharif: 4%–7%, Rabi: 6%–8%). The demand-supply gap is expected to grow notably, with arid and semi-arid zones being the most affected. Compared to 2015–2025, by 2091–2,100, the gap increased by 7%–15% (SSP245) and 15%–28% (SSP585) for Kharif and 7%–13% (SSP245) and 13%–32% (SSP585) for Rabi. To address these challenges, we recommend strategies like enhancing irrigation efficiency, adjusting crop patterns, and developing heat-resilient crops. Our insights aim to inform policy decisions on agriculture and water management in Pakistan under future climate change.</jats:p>"

Whereas this change in emphasis made public accounting more prestigious as a professional pursuit, the increased barriers to entry and the onset of WW2 led to a shortage of qualified individuals entering the profession. The Institute established a committee addressing this shortage through the development of aptitude tests administered to undergraduate students. Based on previously unexamined empirical evidence from the University of Illinois Archives, this study is the first to investigate this historical episode and, in so doing, contribute to our understanding of the development of the American accounting profession, the curious case of testing for aptitude in accounting, and the prevailing separation between the profession and universities in the training of students that seek to enter public accounting. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the author focuses on theoretical aspects and numerical simulations to analyse the possibilities and limitations of the application of the selected electromagnetic method, i.e., the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) method for the aforementioned purpose. Various measurement techniques are used in the GPR method but in the paper the author refers to the most commonly used technique known as short-offset reflection profiling (SORP). As demonstrated in the paper, the detection of water leakages into a homogeneous and isotropic geological medium using the GPR method is a simple matter. However, the detection of leakages occurring in heterogeneous ground subjected to strong anthropopression and with the presence of electromagnetic interference becomes a difficult task, and interpretation may be difficult or even impossible. An important issue analysed in the paper was the phenomenon of the scattering of electromagnetic waves on underground anthropogenic objects, which very often occurs in urbanised areas. The results of the numerical modelling carried out for various scenarios of water leakages into typical ground allowed the possibilities and limitations of using the GPR method for the detection of leakages from water supply networks to be determined.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a new resonant converter based on inductive multiplexing of LLC and LCL-T is studied to reduce the switching frequency range by using the inherent output characteristics of the converter. During the constant voltage charging phase, the LLC resonant tank operates as a constant voltage source to provide a stable charging voltage. In the LLC resonant tank, the resonant inductor is equated to the secondary side, and this resonant inductor is reused to develop the LCL-T resonant tank for the constant current charging stage, which is equivalent to a constant current source to provide a stable charging current. The resonant converter in this paper has lower losses and higher efficiency compared to other LLC resonant converters. A prototype with 3.3 kW is created to test the theoretical analysis.</jats:p>",

The usual scientific, technical and technological developments to ensure reliable corrosion-mechanical resistance and durability of water pipelines are not sufficiently systematic, so there is no need to report the reasons, minds and mechanisms of corrosion-mechanical servicing. Laboratory and experimental investigations were carried out in relation to the operation of structural steels on the structure and instead of schoolhouses. The causes and mechanisms of degradation of metal structures due to routine operation in chemically aggressive technological media were studied. X-ray diffraction studies have established that, with increasing service life of pipes, the surface metal balls adsorb a significant amount of gases. It manifests itself especially strongly in the area of corrosion defects (stains, pittings). During regular operation, the metal walls of the pipes are heavily flooded, which leads to a hardening, increased hardness and decreased ductility. There is a significant change in the mass fraction of cementite in the metal, which indicates a decrease in the value of the material and a decrease in its resistance to corrosion-mechanical damage. Such research is a pioneer in the corrosion-mechanical resistance of metal and its degradation during heavy use in the presence of significant pressures and in the immediate presence of aggressive media.</jats:p>"

Today’s supply chain management is very complex, with countless partners distributed in different regions, and this intertwined trade ecosystem is unprecedented. The chain reaction of epidemic control in early 2020 has triggered a strong interest in supply chain resilience among many scholars. At the 20th National Congress in 2022, General Secretary Xi clearly pointed out that “efforts should be made to enhance the supply chain resilience and security of the industrial chain”, raising supply chain resilience to the level of national strategy for the first time. The emergence of digital control tower concept provides a new management idea to improve the supply chain resilience. So what exactly is digital control tower? How does digital control tower improve supply chain resilience? This paper investigates the mechanism of digital control tower in Leader Harvest plant with the help of dynamic capability theory, and explores an innovative path to improve supply chain resilience, which can provide reference for other enterprises’ supply chain management development.</jats:p>",

To solve the problems of poor adaptability, high investment risk, and incomplete functionality of the supply chain integrated information management (IM) platform in logistics parks, it is necessary to use Internet of Things (IoT) technology to improve the supply chain integrated IM platform, improve the timely interaction of logistics information and reduce logistics costs. This article analyzed the factors that affect the integrated management of logistics park supply chain, analyzed the architecture of logistics park supply chain, integrated IM under the IoT, and implemented the platform architecture using relevant technologies. In the experiment, the resource allocation, resource scheduling, and resource monitoring effects of the supply chain integrated IM platform were analyzed. The results showed that the supply chain IM platform of logistics parks under the IoT has improved infrastructure by 0.14 compared to traditional platform, resource allocation by 0.16, logistics service level by 0.14, and industrial layout by 0.14. The IoT can effectively enhance the resource allocation and industrial layout rationality of logistics parks and has important significance in improving logistics information security and information exchange.</jats:p>",

Based on the 1,482 higher vocational education institutions recognized by the Ministry of Education of China in 2021 as the research objects, the development of higher vocational education in China was explored from the perspective of supply and demand using the entropy weight TOPSIS method and coupling coordination degree model. It was found that China’s higher vocational institutions were mainly located in provincial capitals, representing a point distribution pattern. From a comprehensive evaluation of the supply level, areas such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta, and central Henan Province have become the catchment areas for the development of higher vocational education, laying the foundation for regional network cooperation. From the perspective of educational equality, the higher vocational education in China was found to be sufficient to match the supply and demand, and a balance between supply and demand was apparent in provincial capitals. The coupling degree between supply and demand exhibited an “olive-type” spatial structure pattern, indicating that the development of higher vocational education in most cities in China is still in the transformation stage. The results provide a scientific basis for optimizing resources in the provision of higher vocational education.</jats:p>"

We utilize a survey of 139 respondents from SMEs in a single industry – the printing industry.

This study intends to research how supply chain performance influences the logistics performance and company performance of PT. Sriboga Marugame Indonesia as an F&amp;B company. This study uses a quantitative approach with an explanatory design with PT Sriboga Marugame Indonesia employees as the population. The saturated sample technique was used as the population of 97 respondents was limited and could be reached by the researcher. The data analysis method uses PLS-SEM with Smart PLS program version 3.2.9. The research finds that both supply chain management and logistic performance have a significant effect on organizational performance. Moreover, information technology moderates the relationship between supply chain management and organizational performance. However, the impact of logistic performance on organizational performance was unaffected by information technology. The outcome of this study will help PT Sriboga Marugame Indonesia management to enlighten more about the benefit of Information Technology advancement, especially in supply chain management and logistics.</jats:p>"

Moreover, through the rigorous application of Granger Causality Tests, the research demonstrates that the relationship between the BI Rate and Money Supply (M2) is bidirectional. This bidirectional relationship implies that changes in the interest rate influence the money supply and vice versa.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Motivated by interactions with a major player in the aerospace industry, we consider the relationship between a supplier of specialty material forgings and a buyer that manufactures airplane components by extensively machining down these forgings as per component design specifications. Due to high material removal costs, the buyer prefers these forgings to be as similar in geometry and size to the component as possible, that is, near‐net‐shape. The supplier, by default, is unable to deliver such near‐net‐shape forgings as per technological constraints, but can utilize costly effort and/or invest in the required technologies to achieve such capabilities. By taking into account uncertainty regarding the correspondence between supplier's effort and resulting forging size, we assess the implications of two innovative approaches for improving supply chain performance: (i) input material reduction incentives via contracting and (ii) scrap material recycling. We characterize the optimal decisions with respect to final component geometry, various costs, and which party in the supply chain controls the strategic recycling decision. We find that the supply chain should utilize both approaches in a complementary way for components with complex geometry, yet deliberately limit recycling and eliminate contracting for components with simple geometry—a strategy the buyer always implements when controlling the recycling decision. Furthermore, we show these contracting and recycling strategies to be robust by considering linear, expected cost sharing, and nonlinear contract alternatives. Finally, we study supply chain inefficiencies that result from decentralizing the recycling and/or contracting decisions, and highlight whether expected cost sharing and nonlinear contracts can outperform linear contracts. </jats:p>",

Using geographical information systems (GIS) and the two-step floating catchment area method with the street as research unit, we found that there is an over-supply of medical resources in the centre of the city with weaker support in the peripheral areas as manifested by less supply in relation to popular demand of medical services. The spatial distribution of hospitals at all levels and their resources was found to be uneven: 82.4% of the residents can reach a tertiary hospital (a hospital offering advanced specialized medical and health services to multiple regions) within a 15-minute drive; 50.6% can reach a secondary hospital (a hospital offering comprehensive medical and health services to various communities) within a 10-minute drive; and 77.6% can reach a primary hospital (a hospital directly delivering prevention, medical treatment, healthcare, and rehabilitation services to the community of a certain population) within a 15- minute walk. It was noted that the supply/demand balance of medical resources in the tertiary hospitals decreases from the centre to the periphery, while the secondary hospitals show a dual-centre pattern and the primary hospitals a more uneven distribution, with oversupply in the East and the opposite in the Centre.

In this paper, an iterative short-term demand supply matching (STDSM) algorithm based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is proposed. This approach repromises orders taking into account the finite capacity of the shop floor. Decomposition is used to obtain computationally tractable subproblems. The STDSM approach is applied together with master planning and allocation planning in a rolling horizon setting. A simulation model of a simplified semiconductor supply chain is used for the rolling horizon experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed STDSM scheme outperforms conventional business rule-based heuristics with respect to several delivery performance-related measures and with respect to stability.</jats:p>",

Schools of architecture play a crucial role because the transition towards a circular economy implies the necessary development of new professional figures with wide-ranging skills that may pave the way for new directions in R&amp;D. This article describes three different learning experiences developed at Politecnico di Torino, which have in common the prospect of supply chains in transition. In particular, it discusses the following: the transition of waste from the agrifood chain to the design sector through the experimentation of panels for furniture; the integration of local supply chains for cork, sheep wool, and soil through the design of insulation blocks and panels; and the ‘as-is’ transition of an element originally used as packaging from the agrifood supply chain to the building envelope component sector. These experiences show the possibility of hybridization between sectors that are only apparently distant from one other. Above all, they can be considered ‘exercises’ to train future architects in the experimentation and transformation of matter, systemic design, and divergent and lateral thinking for the development of new building materials and components.</jats:p>"

The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the global economy and led to a global increase in material prices. This has had a significant impact on production costs and the competitiveness of companies. In order to maintain competitiveness, companies need to implement the appropriate supply chain management strategies. This research utilizes the SCOR Framework and BPMN to evaluate and enhance the supply chain operations performance in Car Manufacturing companies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the current supply chain performance and provide recommendations for the appropriate supply chain business processes in addressing the phenomenon of global material price increases. This research is conducted through qualitative and exploratory quantitative methods using the SCOR framework and BPMN. The research findings indicate that the supply chain performance is still lacking in the procurement area. Therefore, business process re-engineering needs to be conducted by transforming the current supplier-led raw material purchasing into self-purchase by the Car Manufacturer. The recommendation for the new business process is for the Car Manufacturer to directly purchase the raw materials for the supplier's needs, thereby eliminating the handling fee charged by the supplier.</jats:p>"

The justification for the shortening of the long supply chains can be argued from the perspectives of supply security and sustainability. Furthermore, the economic validation of sustainability considerations is receiving increasing attention in professional discourse, sparking public debate. One of the primary tensions underlying these polemics is the conflict between short-term economic interests and long-term sustainability and environmental considerations. These interests often contradict each other, and the ongoing professional debate surrounding the shortening of supply chains provides relevant insight into these conflicts. However, the supply disruptions resulting from COVID-19 have re-emphasized the importance of supply security, prompting many economic actors to reconsider their supply strategies. The growing significance of supply security is evident in surveys, expert analyses, and economic strategic documents. The energy challenges posed by the Russian-Ukrainian war have, in turn, prompted EU policymakers to reform the energy strategy. The risks associated with energy security highlighted the vulnerabilities stemming from dependency on external fossil-based energy sources. This article aims to answer the question of how short-term economic interests and longer-term sustainability goals can be reconciled in light of the supply disruptions experienced during COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukrainian war. It does this through a literature review of professional debates and relevant expert analyses, strategic EU documents, and by examining key indicators of the EU's energy dependence. The restructuring of the EU's energy policy demonstrates the feasibility of rapidly implementing major transformations in complex systems when necessary. Beyond facilitating professional discourse, the experiences from these events can also boost the European green transition, as a green Europe built on its renewable resources can be more resilient against challenges of the future. This is in line with both economic and environmental objectives. The main conclusion of the research is that the EU's successful transition to renewable energy sources, in addition to achieving environmental goals, can contribute to reducing external risks through the alleviation of energy dependence. Furthermore, energy security provided by its own energy sources facilitates the growth of the real economy and underpins the EU's geopolitical position.</jats:p>"

This research uses a quantitative approach with survey methods and questionnaires distributed to managers and supply chain staff. Secondary data was obtained from literature, financial reports and company documents. Analysis uses SmartPLS 3.2.9 with variance-based structural equation analysis, measuring and modeling data simultaneously. Samples were taken using a saturated sampling technique. The results show that innovation has no significant positive effect on supply chain performance, while proactiveness and risk taking have a significant positive impact. Exogenous variables (innovation, proactiveness, risk taking) explain 53.1% of supply chain performance, the rest is influenced by other factors. The implications of this research provide guidance for companies to increase supply chain efficiency in competitive and dynamic markets.</jats:p>"

For arc-based hydrogen plasma generation, a pulsed power supply that delivers 2 ms-long constant current pulse has been developed. This pulsed power supply employs a high frequency buck converter topology with a nonlinear filter inductor. This paper describes the development and testing of a constant current pulsed power supply that operates at 50 A and 550 V with a pulse width of 2 ms and a pulse repetition rate of 2 Hz. By changing the arc current, the arc impedance and the positive hydrogen ion current were also measured. The extraction of positive hydrogen ions was carried out using a three-electrode extraction design, which results in a current of 80 mA of positive hydrogen ions at an energy of 50 keV.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring the availability and sustainability of clean water is a key focus of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and has emerged as a significant concern for both central and local governments in Indonesia. In the Kapongan District of Situbondo Regency, the government's PAMSIMAS Programme is a proactive initiative designed to secure safe access to drinking water for the community. Within this district, two villages, Landangan and Pokaan, have successfully implemented community-based drinking water provision. The ongoing sustainability of these water supply systems in these villages is pivotal for meeting the continuous drinking water needs of the community, necessitating a comprehensive investigation into its sustainability. The primary objective of this study is to assess the sustainability status of community-based drinking water provision within the ongoing PAMSIMAS program in Kapongan District. The dimensions under consideration encompass environmental, social, economic, technological, and institutional aspects. Employing a quantitative approach, the research utilizes the Rap-SPAM analysis method, a modification of Rapfish, with primary data collected through surveys, observations, and interviews. Additionally, secondary data is acquired through an extensive literature review and consultation with various related agencies. The assessment results reveal a sustainability index of 58.92, classifying it as reasonably sustainable. The Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) model produced Stress values ranging from 0.15 to 0.18 and R2 values between 0.93 to 0.94. The variance between the MDS index and Monte Carlo analysis is less than 5%. In conclusion, this study finds that the community-based water supply facilitated by the PAMSIMAS program in Kapongan District demonstrates a reasonably sustainable status. To enhance its sustainability, there is a need to prioritize and improve dimensions with lower sustainability index values in a holistic manner.</jats:p>",

Using the Publish or Perish 8 application, there are 71 articles that meet the inclusion criteria and keyword search requirements according to Kitchenham's systematic review methodology. The findings can be grouped into three broad groupings of disease outbreaks, each of which uses machine learning algorithms to predict the spread of disease outbreaks. The use of parameters for prediction with machine learning has a correlation with drug supply management in the coronavirus disease case.

Based on the experience of domestic and foreign scientists in the direction of managing the economic security of the enterprise, the principles on which the concept of economic security should be based are highlighted. The authors identified the elements of the enterprise security management system. In the concept of the mechanism for managing the economic security of the enterprise, the main requirement is an indicative analysis that allows detecting changes in indicators, their integration in the functioning of the subject of market relations. To increase the economic security of the enterprise, a step-by-step approach to monitoring the state and dynamics of the enterprise's development is proposed in order to identify threats and prevent them.Prospects for further research consist in substantiating the assessment of the scope and quality of the formation and implementation of the economic security management mechanism of enterprises in Ukraine, taking into account modern globalization challenges.</jats:p>"

The role of government subsidies in supply chain collaboration, collaborative advantage, and firm performance remains unclear. In this study, we explored how supply chain collaboration can enhance firm performance and the roles of collaborative advantage and government subsidies in that process. Firstly, we reviewed the related literature and proposed our hypotheses. Secondly, we formulated an innovative theoretical framework and issued our questionnaire after a pilot study. After collecting and evaluating the sample data, we utilized structural equation modeling to comprehensively examine those relationships in a supply chain, unlike the previous studies on trust, firm size, etc. Lastly, in the context of government interventions, this study addresses the question: “To what extent do government subsidies influence the relationships among supply chain collaboration, collaborative advantage, and firm performance?” Our findings indicate that supply chain collaboration is fundamental in shaping collaborative advantage and firm performance, while collaborative advantage is crucial in enhancing firm performance. Additionally, government support in the form of subsidies acts as a catalyst, further enhancing the positive outcomes of supply chain collaboration and ultimately benefiting firm performance. This research underscores the strategic significance of supply chain collaboration and government subsidies in promoting overall business success. By illuminating the roles of collaborative advantage and government subsidies in this context, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the dynamic capability involved in achieving improved firm performance through effective supply chain collaboration.</jats:p>"

This paper studied the variation of water quality parameters in different seasons and their relationship with land use and climate factors in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan Province from 2001 to 2019. The results show that the factors restricting water environment in different seasons are different, but basically close. The water quality parameters of multiple water quality monitoring stations in different seasons showed a decreasing or insignificant trend. In the rainy season, the temperature and precipitation were positively correlated with most water quality parameters, while the driving effect of climate factors was not significant in the dry season. Different land types have different effects on water quality indexes in different seasons. The water quality score was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. The scores of water quality stations in the south and middle of Dianchi Lake are higher than those in the north. In this study, the relationship between climate, land, and water quality is established, which provides a way for the research of water quality parameters.</jats:p>",

This study, therefore, sought to find out the effect of supply chain information systems on service delivery in the public health care sector in the county governments of the western region. The study was anchored on the theory of human service delivery and health network metrics. The study adopted a positivist research philosophy and a descriptive survey research design, and the target population was 284 respondents from the four level 5 county hospitals in the western region. Questionnaires and interview schedules were used for data collection and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The data was presented using tables. 258 respondents participated in the study, and preliminary data checking, screening, and cleaning were done. Validity and reliability statistics were done, and they indicated that the research instruments were adequate for their purpose. Regression analysis shows that supply chain information systems had a significant effect on service delivery in the public health care sector in the county governments of Western Region, Kenya (t = 6.442, p&lt;0.050). The supply chain information system accounted for 14.0% of the changes in service delivery. The study recommended that in the selection of a hospital information system, it should be cost-effective, integrative, high-performance, reliable, responsive, fast, and sustainable. Beyond the infrastructure for information systems, they should invest time and resources in the training of their staff members.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this research was to investigate the effectiveness of various resilience strategies adopted by American businesses and to derive insights that can inform future supply chain management practices. The problem addressed in this study was the increasing vulnerability of supply chains to disruptions, including natural disasters, global pandemics, and geopolitical tensions. These disruptions could result in significant economic losses and operational challenges for businesses. Understanding how U.S. companies tackled these challenges in the past provides valuable lessons for enhancing supply chain resilience. To achieve these objectives, a mixed-methods research approach was employed. Quantitative data were collected through surveys distributed to a diverse sample of U.S. companies across different industries. Qualitative data were obtained through in-depth interviews with supply chain and operations managers from a subset of these companies. The study analyzed historical cases of supply chain disruptions and the corresponding strategies used to mitigate their impact. Findings from this research indicate that U.S. companies employed a combination of strategies to enhance supply chain resilience, including diversifying suppliers, leveraging technology for real-time visibility, and implementing risk management frameworks. Companies that had robust business continuity plans in place were better equipped to respond to disruptions effectively. In conclusion, this study highlights the critical importance of proactive supply chain resilience strategies in mitigating the impact of disruptions. The lessons learned from past disruptions provide valuable insights for companies seeking to build more resilient supply chains in the future. Recommendations include the development and regular testing of robust business continuity plans, the adoption of digital technologies for enhanced visibility, and a proactive approach to risk management. By drawing from past experiences, U.S. companies can better prepare for and respond to future disruptions, ultimately ensuring the continuity of their operations and safeguarding their competitiveness in an ever-changing business landscape.

Our survey results demonstrate a concerning lack of adoption of SSCM in business curriculum and reveal several major challenges faced by educators when teaching SSCM, including a scarcity of available teaching resources, a need for cross‐disciplinary knowledge, and a lack of industry experience among students. These findings lead to our exploration of SSCM application in various supply chain and operations functions (e.g., product design, sourcing and procurement, production, quality management, warehouse management and distribution, delivery, and supply chain risk management) during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Drawing on our analysis, we conclude by offering several recommendations for promoting SSCM in business education.</jats:p>",

In this study, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) signal decomposition technique is combined with cascade forward backpropagation neural network (CFBNN) and feed-forward backpropagation neural network (FFBNN) machine learning (ML) techniques to model 2014 floods in Ankara, Mera River. The data are split in order to avoid the underfitting and overfitting problems of the algorithm. While establishing the algorithm, 70% of the data were divided into training, 15% testing and 15% validation. Graphical indicators and statistical parameters were used for the analysis of model performance. As a result, the EMD signal decomposition technique has been found to improve the performance of ML models. In addition, the EMD-FFBNN hybrid model showed the most accurate estimation results in the flood routing calculation. The study's outputs can assist in designing flood control structures such as levees and dams to help reduce flood risk.</jats:p>",

Exchange rates are related to the policy chosen by the Central Bank of Iraq in managing the foreign exchange market and in the rentier nature of the Iraqi economy. The research uses a quantitative method in estimating the levels of the impact of exchange rate shocks on some economic variables. Several methods are conducted to achieve the goals, including the VAR model, variance decomposition and Impulse Response Functions. The results showed that exchange rate variance reached 100% in the same variable in the first year and decrease to 97% at the end of the period, and the same in the impulse response. It was an internal reaction that predicts what can be called the self-wave of an exchange rate rise, while both the variation and the response to the money supply shock in Iraq were dependent on the policy of the Central Bank and compatible with what was happening in the exchange rate, as the analysis of variance in the first year reached 38.98% for the same variable and 61% of it is due to the exchange rate. The results also showed that agricultural output was weakly affected by the exchange rate shock and money supply.</jats:p>"

Finally, from the perspective of cooperation between drug suppliers and public hospitals, the specialized coordination contract was designed to maximize overall social welfare. This study found an anomalous but meaningful conclusion: in the background of the zero-markup drug policy, a higher public benefit of hospitals could increase the drug prices, but it could reduce the medical service prices further to cut down on the overall treatment fees for the patients. The novel coordination contract can optimize the pharmaceutical supply chain and achieve a win-win situation for the drug suppliers, public hospitals, and patients. When the public benefit of hospitals is higher, the profit of a decentralized decision-making supply chain is greater than a centralized one, while the pharmaceutical supply chain will not coordinate itself.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the United States, food banks play an important role in helping to reduce the rate of food insecurity by distributing donated food among the population in need. One of the challenges that food banks face is to equitably distribute food donations among their clients such that, ideally, each recipient receives the same amount of food. They aim to do so while minimizing waste that occurs due to spoilage and capacity limitations. Perishable food items present specific challenges since they are susceptible to spoilage and need to be distributed before their expiry dates. Based on our longstanding partnership with a large food bank located in the southeastern United States, we present a capacitated, multiperiod, multiproduct network flow model to help them equitably and effectively distribute perishable food donations among the food‐insecure population in their service region. The model is applied within the context of a case study and reveals managerial insights that would be useful to practitioners. Our findings show that although equity is one of the food bank's highest priorities, inequities cannot be eliminated completely. Given the inevitability of inequitable food allocations in practice, this paper provides food banks guidance on how to strategically control inequities using two approaches: ( i) by increasing the number of periods for which equity should be satisfied or ([Formula: see text]) by allowing deviations from a perfectly equitable distribution. The results show that modest deviations from perfect equity using either approach can lead to significant improvements in both the quality and quantity of food distributed and can also reduce food waste. While approach ([Formula: see text]) is preferable, the most desirable outcomes occur when both are applied simultaneously. We also find that county capacities inhibit a food bank's ability to achieve balance between equity and effectiveness when distributing perishables. Our framework provides food banks the flexibility to balance the trade‐off between effectiveness and equity based on their preferences. </jats:p>",

Heat dissipation becomes an important factor in the design process in improving case performance and miniaturization requirements. The design of existing small electronic thermal methods ignores high-temperature and high-load environment tests without automation control. To solve these problems, a heat dissipation case is designed with a magnesium and aluminum alloy, for intelligent temperature control based on a high-power and high-density power supply array. Based on the extreme miniaturization design principle, a composite heat dissipation mode is adopted based on conduction and supplemented by forced air cooling. The results show that the heat dissipation design in this article can work normally in high-temperature and high-load environment tests. Finally, the existing cooling designs are compared and analyzed. The cooling performance parameters in this article are better than those in the existing case.

This study evaluates how tomato plants adapt to varying water levels (100%, 50% of crop evapotranspiration, and non-irrigated control) over two growing seasons in 2020 and 2021. Root images were captured weekly during an 8-week monitoring period in 2020 and 6 weeks in 2021 using a non-destructive CI-600 in-situ root imager at depths between 10 and 70 cm. Under water stress, plants developed deeper, more extensive root systems to maximize water uptake, consistent with prior research. Root depth and architecture varied with soil depth and the severity of water stress. Year-to-year variations were also found, likely due to changes in irrigation levels and environmental conditions such as temperature. SPAD values were higher under control conditions, especially in the 2021 growing season, suggesting reduced chlorophyll degradation, while no significant differences were observed in chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) between treatments, suggesting stable photosynthetic efficiency under varied water stress conditions. These findings contribute to our understanding of root zone optimization and drought-resilient cultivar breeding, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.</jats:p>"

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals, and restriction cubic spline was uesd to explore nonlinear relationships of dietary protein energy supply ratio and obesity in children and adolescents. Results:In the adjusted logistic regression model, for every 1% increase in dietary protein energy ratio in children and adolescents, the increased risk of obesity was 4% (OR=1.04,95%CI:1.01-1.08). The restrictive cubic spline showed a nonlinear relationship between dietary protein energy ratio and obesity in children aged 6-11 years (P &amp;lt;0.05). The dietary protein energy supply ratio was included in the logistic regression model after converting to quartiles into categorical variables.

The sample size was 60 respondents, namely coffee shop business actors spread across six sub-districts in West Aceh Regency. The findings demonstrated a strong direct correlation between innovation factors and the success of coffee shops in the West Aceh Regency. However, innovation has no indirect impact on business performance when lean supply chain factors are used as a mediator. However, when supply chain mediation is used, there is a sizable indirect impact of innovation on corporate success. Given how competitive the coffee industry is becoming in West Aceh Regency, this research is anticipated to advance knowledge significantly and offer insight into creating supply chain strategies and innovation. Moreover, this study might be used as a guide for future supply chain-related investigations.</jats:p>"

However, the specific energy density of hydrocarbon fuels cannot ensure efficient operation of power systems for such multi-environmental vehicles. A promising solution to this problem involves the utilization of boron-containing metallized fuels through the creation of specialized fuel supply systems. Based on a general method of optimization synthesis for technical objects, new fuel supply systems were synthesized with different levels of process control and degrees of automation, as well as an adjustable hybrid fuel delivery system that allows the application of components in varying aggregate states. During testing, operational characteristics were determined primarily for the implemented metallic hybrid transformer fuel delivery system. In our view, it holds the greatest potential for the utilization of metallized fuels, as it provides an expanded range of applications, increased functions, and structures. This is also linked to the possibility of employing boron in the α-modification, where atomic-level processes ensure maximum combustion efficiency. Thus, the new fuel supply system offers functionality across diverse environments, creating genuine prerequisites for the efficient operation of power systems for multi-environmental modes of transportation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

As a developing nation, Indonesia is also severely affected by the diversion of significant resources to combat Covid-19. On the other hand, Indonesia is committed to reducing emissions in the energy sector, which includes implementing renewable energy technologies to provide electricity. This article examines the effect of the post-covid-19 pandemic situation on the implementation of renewable energy in the electricity supply. The case study examined is the electricity supply in the province of Yogyakarta, which obtains its electricity from outside the province but has multiple forms of renewable energy that can be optimized in the electricity supply. There are three scenarios discussed: the current target scenario, the lower target scenario, and the supply security scenario. The current target scenario includes predetermined renewable energy goals. The lower target scenario is used to characterize Covid-19's impact on the implementation of renewable energy. The supply security scenario is the most optimistic, as it optimizes the use of renewable energy in the electricity supply while ignoring the impact of the co-19 pandemic. The current target scenario is used as a benchmark against which the other two scenarios are compared. Comparing the lower target scenario to the current target scenario, the lower target scenario results in 9.6% lower capital costs and 4.1% higher greenhouse gas emissions. The least greenhouse gas emissions are produced by the supply security scenario, but the capacity costs are the highest.</jats:p>"

The water allocated in each irrigation event was defined as the decision variable in this structure. Two objective functions include the following: (1) maximizing and minimizing the water allocation and (2) minimizing conflicts between beneficiaries in the Hebei Plain. Conflicts between beneficiaries were formulated based on the ratio between the crop area and water allocation and were defined by an inertia weight to increase its effect on the final iterations of the process. The Whale Optimization Algorithm was included as a bi-objective algorithm in the decision-making process. The number of decision variables and feasible domains in each decision model is different and creates a crowding distance for competition between operators. The results showed that the water allocation planning structure based on the evaluation index had the best solution front.</jats:p>",

The Holocene evolution of the Bega River estuary and Tathra Beach coastal barrier was examined integrating existing sediment cores and radiocarbon dating, airborne terrestrial and marine Lidar and OSL dating. Sediment coring reveals the Bega River estuary began infilling with fluvial sand once sea levels stabilised at or near their present elevation. Radiocarbon dating suggests a prograding fluvial delta reached the coast approximately 4000–2250 years BP. Barrier deposition commenced ~3200 years ago coinciding with the arrival of fluvial sand at the coast. Shoreline progradation of the Tathra barrier occurred at 0.15 m/year from ~3200 years to present forming a sequence of ~17 foredune ridges which were each active for an average of ~190 years. In the past ~500 years, a sand spit has restricted the entrance of the Bega River estuary to the northern end of the embayment. The infill of the Bega River estuary over the Holocene represents an internal morphodynamic threshold or tipping point, which then enabled coastal barrier deposition as fluvial sand reached the coast. The coastal system approaches another threshold as the Tathra embayment infills, and sediment may be transported northward out of the embayment. At Tathra Beach, the positive sediment budget which resulted in barrier progradation is approximately 0.55 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/m/year. This signal is masked on the yearly to decadal scale by fluctuations in beach volume an order of magnitude greater (5–20 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/m/year depending on the timeframe examined). Thus longer-term datasets of beach change or reconstructions from the geological record are needed to underpin management decisions which will impact shorelines decades or centuries into the future. </jats:p>",

The AMCCS sorbent coating contained mostly amorphous oxides of aluminum, magnesium, and calcium. The adsorption of fluoride occurred in less than an hour, while fluoride adsorption followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The favorable adsorption of fluoride onto the AMCCS sorbent occurred according to the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption equations, whereas the physical adsorption of fluoride onto the AMCCS sorbent occurred based on the Dubinin–Radushkevich adsorption equation. The adsorption of fluoride occurred over a broad pH range from 2 to 10.5 with a decrease in adsorption at pH above 10.5, indicative of the adsorption of fluoride onto the positively charged surface of AMCCS sorbent at pH below the AMCCS sorbent pHPZC of 10.4. The AMCCS sorbent was able to remove fluoride from natural waters with appreciable alkalinity, total hardness and total dissolved solids, indicative of AMCCS sorbent selectivity for fluoride adsorption. The AMCCS sorbent was re-coated and reused after several adsorption cycles, rendering the AMCCS sorbent a recyclable and sustainable adsorbent for effective and rapid removal of fluoride from water.</jats:p>",

Traditional machine-learning models struggle with large-scale datasets and complex relationships. This research introduces a novel methodological framework for supply chain backorder prediction, addressing the challenge of collecting large real-world datasets with 90% accuracy. Our proposed model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in predicting backorders on short and imbalanced datasets. We capture intricate patterns and dependencies by leveraging quantum-inspired techniques within the quantum-classical neural network QAmplifyNet. Experimental evaluations on a benchmark dataset establish QAmplifyNet’s superiority over eight classical models, three classically stacked quantum ensembles, five quantum neural networks, and a deep reinforcement learning model. Its ability to handle short, imbalanced datasets makes it ideal for supply chain management. We evaluate seven preprocessing techniques, selecting the best one based on logistic regression’s performance on each preprocessed dataset. The model’s interpretability is enhanced using Explainable artificial intelligence techniques. Practical implications include improved inventory control, reduced backorders, and enhanced operational efficiency. QAmplifyNet also achieved the highest F1-score of 94% for predicting “Not Backorder” and 75% for predicting “backorder,” outperforming all other models. It also exhibited the highest AUC-ROC score of 79.85%, further validating its superior predictive capabilities. QAmplifyNet seamlessly integrates into real-world supply chain management systems, empowering proactive decision-making and efficient resource allocation. Future work involves exploring additional quantum-inspired techniques, expanding the dataset, and investigating other supply chain applications. This research unlocks the potential of quantum computing in supply chain optimization and paves the way for further exploration of quantum-inspired machine learning models in supply chain management. Our framework and QAmplifyNet model offer a breakthrough approach to supply chain backorder prediction, offering superior performance and opening new avenues for leveraging quantum-inspired techniques in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

To enable part feeding in line with the just-in-time (JIT) principle, a new mixed-integer mathematical model from nonlinearity to linearity and a novel artificial immune genetic algorithm-based heuristic are proposed. Both methods can provide reasonable solutions compared by minimizing the route length and inventory level in terms of speed, and the genetic algorithm shows better performance on a large scale.</jats:p>"

The interpretative structural modelling (ISM) approach is applied for analyzing the CSFs. In India, the unorganized fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) retail sector occupies a sizable amount of space and makes a significant GDP contribution. A total of 13 CSFs are analyzed, and to determine their driving and dependency power, MICMAC analysis is carried out. The outcome demonstrates that unorganized retailing suffers a variety of difficulties, like, the arrival of new competitors, product substitution, supplier problems, buyer threats, an increase in organized retailers, and co-manufacturer threats, in developing country settings. The factors with the highest positive impact are service quality in FMCG retail, time management at stores, product quality, and spoilage adjustment in retail. The factors, service quality in retail, time management at stores, and product quality have resulted in the highest driving power and lowest dependence power to attain the desired performance of UORSCM. The study’s findings also indicate that by focusing on these factors, unorganized retailers can efficiently handle customers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, regions were affected by a combination of economic crises: weak demand and constrained supply. Several studies have sought to analyse the heterogeneous effects of supply and demand shocks on the labour market, economic growth, and the environment. This study has a different focus, estimating both direct and indirect effects of demand and supply shocks adopted during the pandemic in Brazil and Chile. Afterwards, the paper compares the degree of regional absorption (leakage) of income resulting from each of these shocks, applying an interregional input–output model for each country. The results of this study show that income absorption by the poorest regions is relatively greater in the case of a supply shock. It can be said, therefore, that this type of shock improves the retention of income generated in the poorest regions, favouring the development of these localities and the reduction in regional inequalities. The main reason for this result is that supply policies have restricted essential sectors to a lesser extent, and these sectors are generally less concentrated in large urban centres in both Brazil and Chile. In other words, much of the interregional leakage is driven by the demand for non-essential products, mainly in the richest urban economy centres. Finally, the geographical dimension of regional inequalities leads to the economic benefit of prosperous areas in the country when shocks occur in vulnerable regions, highlighting the centre–periphery pattern in both countries.</jats:p>"

However, with the development of the economy, traditional supply chain finance is gradually unable to meet the financing needs of enterprises. Enterprise financing pursues simplified processing time and process, simple operation methods and procedures. At the same time, the rapid development of information technology and the emergence and prosperity of new technologies such as e-commerce, big data, cloud computing also continue to promote the breeding of new models. Based on this background, a new type of supply chain finance has emerged – Internet supply chain finance. The risk assessment of internet supply chain finance is a classical multiple-attributed decision making (MADM) problems. In this paper, the cross-entropy method under type-2 neutrosophic numbers (T2NNs) is built based on the traditional cross-entropy method. Firstly, the T2NN is introduced. Then, combine the traditional fuzzy cross-entropy method with T2NNs information, the type-2 neutrosophic number cross-entropy (T2NN-CE) method is established for MADM under T2NNs. Finally, a numerical example for risk assessment of internet supply chain finance has been given and some comparisons is used to illustrate advantages of T2NN-CE method with T2NNs.</jats:p>",

The main patterns of composition and distribution of zooplankton and production of organic matter by zooplankton are determined. High values and turnover rate of production are noted for the non-predatory zooplankton (mainly copepods and euphausiids) in the eastern Anadyr Bay, the area at Cape Navarin, the shelf of Koryak coast, and the continental slope of Olyutorsky Bay. High production of predatory zooplankton (mainly hyperiids) is found on the slope of Karaginsky Bay, presumably because of these species transport from the southern areas with later stage of the seasonal succession. In autumn 2020, walleye pollock and paciﬁc herring consumed from 15 to 55 % of the copepod, euphausiid and hyperiid production. This level of consumption did not affect their food supply because of very high turnover rate of these taxonomic groups of plankton. In the deep-water areas, salmons did not use more than 3 % of their food resource. Thus, the survey data indicate a good food supply for the most abundant nekton species in the western Bering Sea in the fall season.</jats:p>"

However, the current literature on reverse logistics, green logistics and sustainability are scattered. Therefore, in this article we aim to review the state of recent literature (2018 - 2021), with a focus on applications in different industrial sectors. It was observed that although the application of reverse logistics, green logistics principles are sustainable, there are barriers to their implementation among which include lack of top management commitment, lack of strategic plan to implement reverse and green logistics activities, lack of marketing strategy for remanufactured products and secondary market.

This system seamlessly integrates a wind farm, photovoltaic power station, solar thermal power station, and hydrogen energy network at the power grid level. Central to the study is the introduction of a bi-level collaborative optimization model—an innovative algorithmic framework specifically tailored for complex multi-energy systems. This model co-optimizes both the capacity planning of essential system components and their annual load distribution, adeptly navigating the complexities of optimizing capacity and annual load distribution under uncertain energy sources and load conditions. A layered methodology synergistically combines linear programming with an advanced version of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. When applied to a real-world case study in Zhangbei, China, this approach identifies an optimal system capacity, leading to annual green power generation of 201.56 GW and a substantial reduction of over 173,703 tons of CO2 emissions. An economic analysis further reveals that each 1% reduction in CO2 emissions corresponds to a modest 1.7% increase in the system’s levelized cost of energy. Moreover, a comprehensive exploration of the impacts of various capacity parameters on the WSH-MES system’s performance is conducted. These insights offer invaluable guidance for the large-scale advancement of efficient renewable energy utilization and the attainment of decarbonization targets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Gray markets are infamous for unauthorized diversion of authentic products at lower prices to harm the manufacturer's authorized distribution channel. Hence, manufacturers are becoming more proactive in shaping strategies that can counter gray markets. By considering the risk of unauthorized selling through gray markets, we analyze the manufacturer's strategic channel choice and product upgrade decision. We analytically explore the provision of granting flexibility to the legitimate retailer to adjust price during the selling season as a strategy to cope with gray market. We find that unauthorized selling through gray markets has a severe negative impact on the manufacturer's profitability depending on the degree of channel differentiation and product brand equity. We counter‐intuitively reveal that the overall decentralized supply chain can be better‐off, owing to higher product leakage, especially because the legitimate retailer gains an increased sales volume through product diversion to the gray market. However, the manufacturer's loss is more severe in such a decentralized supply chain. We show that the manufacturer can eliminate unauthorized sales through gray market by offering price adjustment flexibility to the retailer. Another compelling finding exhibits that the manufacturer's decision to launch an upgraded product can intensify the diversion of an existing product. However, unfair competition from the unauthorized channel cannibalizes the sales of an upgraded product, thereby making the manufacturer worse‐off. Interestingly, despite the cannibalization of upgraded product sales, the manufacturer can be better‐off in terms of overall profitability via price adjustment flexibility if both the degree of upgrade and brand equity are higher. Overall, in addition to deploying monitoring mechanisms for supervising legitimate retailers, price adjustment flexibility can reduce product diversion if the degree of upgrade is moderate and channel differentiation is higher.</jats:p>",

In January 2023, a T&amp;O compound was detected in the water system using sensory analysis with a threshold odor number (TON) of 3, guiding further analytical testing to identify for musty compounds. The unknown was confirmed to be 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (2,4,6-TBA) at a maximum of 9.86 ng/L. Its point of origin for production was tracked to a raw water line using chlorine dioxide as a primary disinfectant. Jar tests were performed to confirm that the mode of production was excess free chlorine from the generation of chlorine dioxide in the presence of bromide in raw water. The event was mitigated using powdered activated carbon in clarifiers to adsorb and settle out the compound, resulting in a non-detectable level (a TON of 1 and &amp;lt;5.00 ng/L for 2,4,6-TBA). This paper discusses the unique generation pathway within a full-scale treatment plant and how a monitoring and response program can be used to help detect a T&amp;O event in early stages and aid mitigation processes.</jats:p>",

Blockchain technology offered a more effective, secure, and convenient mode of transaction and management to the construction industry because it was a decentralized, safe, and reliable information transmission and management tool. Blockchain technology could be applied to the construction industry's supply chain to achieve traceability and supervision, enhancing the transparency and dependability of transactions. At the same time, blockchain technology could be applied to the management of the construction supply chain to achieve rapid information sharing and verification, lowering transaction costs, and increasing transaction efficiency. However, the previous study on the use of blockchain technology in the building sector was still in its infancy and required more investigation and study. This study aimed to investigate how blockchain technology could be used in supply chain management for the construction sector to address present issues. The study's goals were to examine how blockchain technology could speed up transactions and improve supply chain management for the construction industry, as well as to examine how it could lower transaction costs and increase data sharing and information transparency. This study used a semi-structured interviewing technique for the purpose of gathering and analysing data. The researcher learned more about professionals and industry experts' thoughts and experiences with blockchain technology in construction supply chain management through in-person or remote interviews with them. The advancement of the construction industry's digital transformation and information upgrading reflected the significance of this study. This study would help the supply chain management in the construction sector in enhancing the effectiveness of supply chain transactions in the construction industry and reducing the transaction cycle; lowering the price of supply chain transactions in the construction industry and boosting the industry's competitiveness; strengthening the security and reliability of supply chain transactions in the construction industry and reducing data compromise and transaction risks.</jats:p>"

However, current forest inventory trends from the Central Hardwood Forest Region (CHFR) reveal a sustainability threat from declining white oak regeneration and recruitment leading to a disproportionate inventory structure. Using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data together with the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS), we performed a base run analysis of projected inventory levels of white oak sawlogs to better understand whether the inventory level is sustainable to support the current harvest level of white oak in the future. The projections were further examined by tree grades to provide a general outlook on the quality of white oak timber growing in Kentucky’s forests in posterity. By doing so, we generated results that indicate that projected inventory levels of white oak sawlogs cannot be considered sustainable to support current harvest levels from 2058 onwards. In addition, the long-term trends in inventory levels of high-quality white oak sawlogs would be continuously declining whereas that of low-quality sawlogs would be steadily increasing. On the brink of these significant inventory shifts, our study calls for proactive forest management approaches to stabilize the white oak timber resource supply in Kentucky and beyond.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy feedback system (EFS) is widely accepted to utilize the regenerative braking energy (RBE) in an urban rail traction power supply system (TPSS). However, the sharing relationship of RBE between EFS, traction trains and on-board braking resistors is not clear. In addition, the impact of EFS operation on the sharing of RBE has been rarely studied. This paper proposed a hierarchical operation optimization method for improving the utilization of shared RBE in TPSS through the EFS. An optimizing model for the dynamic start-up voltage threshold of EFS is established, with the objective of minimizing TPSS power consumption. A fast prediction model of train operation information is developed to analyze the steady-state power flow in advance. The optimal solution is searched using a salp swarm algorithm (SSA) on a per second basis. A microsystem of three traction stations and two trains is analyzed. Compared to the conventional constant voltage operation scheme, the optimal solution achieves a maximum additional energy-saving efficiency improvement of 2.44%. Efficient sharing of RBE is identified as the key to achieving energy savings. Regarding the local control part, system stability analysis is verified. Real-time simulation results indicate that the dynamic operating mode of EFS efficiently distributes RBE.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the leakage phenomenon of transmission lines in the HVDC power supply system of a 5G communication base station is studied. To address the issue of multi-branch line leakage diagnosis and line selection in the 240 V DC system, a new distributed DC insulation monitoring and fault line selection technology and system are proposed. The distributed DC insulation monitoring line selection technology is used to collect the leakage current of each branch by setting a unique single-core DC leakage transformer and process the signal primarily. In addition, a high-resistance bridge switchgear is added to the bus bar. According to different leakage currents caused by the imbalance of the bridge before and after the switch, the insulation resistance of electrodes to the ground is calculated accurately, which solves the problem that the current technology cannot judge the fault of the positive and negative electrodes to the ground at the same time. Through both simulation and prototype experiments, the feasibility of this technology and system device in line insulation monitoring and line selection of the HVDC communication base station power supply system is verified.</jats:p>"

However, the increase of the ohmic resistance in the electrolyte remains a challenge for the electrolytic technique. In the present work, we study the transition from grey hydrogen to green hydrogen using alkaline electrolysis (25% w/w KOH solution electrolysis). We compare hydrogen production efficiency using a voltage source simulating the conventional DC generator, and a current source simulating the PV power supply. Water electrolysis was coupled to an indirect ultrasound source in order to investigate its effect on hydrogen production process in both cases of power supply. The question was tackled experimentally using an H-cell electrolyzer and an ultrasonic bath, and numerically using a MatLab code. Energy conversion efficiency and hydrogen production rate were determined both experimentally and through simulation. It was demonstrated that the integration of sonication reduces the ohmic resistance within the electrolyzer and thus decreases the cell voltage for the same current, which enhances the energy efficiency in the case of current source for the same hydrogen production rate. For instance, an enhancement of 1% was recorded in the energy efficiency using a current source of energy, while is equals 2.68% in the case of voltage source. Therefore, the coupled of sono-electrolysis process to solar PV seems to be a promising pathway for an environmentally friendly hydrogen production technique from an energetic perspective.</jats:p>"

Integrated supply chains result in a mutual-dependence between firms that can be exploited by cyber-criminals. For instance, we show that by targeting one firm in the network the criminals can potentially hold multiple firms to ransom. Overlapping security systems may also allow the criminals to strike at weak points in the network. For instance, it may be optimal for the attacker to target a supplier in order to ransom a large producer at the heart of the production network. We introduce a game theoretic model of an attack on a supply chain and solve for two types of Nash equilibria. We then study a hub and spoke example before providing simulation results for a general case. We find that the total ransom the criminals can demand is increasing in the average path length of the network. Thus, the ransom is lowest for a hub and spoke network and highest for a line network.

This research evaluates the quality of public road transport service in Nigeria, focusing on three key factors which are time, comfort and safety. Transport operators only focus on making profits and not on the satisfaction of the consumers. A statistical analysis was performed using the Reliability statistics test and opinions and attitudes were grouped using a Likert scale. It was observed that for attributes measured on a scale of 1 to 4, the mean rating was below 2, for attributes measured on a scale of 1 to 5, the mean rating was below 2.5 and for the attribute measured on a scale of 1 to 3, the mean rating was below 1.5 indicating that the expectation of public transport users are not met and the services are highly unsatisfactory. It was also further discovered that in 2004 the Federal Road Safety brought forth the RTSSS (Road transport Safety Standardization Scheme), which contains the rules and regulations that should govern every public road transport company. The data acquired for this research points to the fact that, the transport company owners in Nigeria do not follow up to twenty percent (20%) of the RTSSS guidelines. After these discoveries, this research goes further to giving recommendations to enhance the quality of service provided and move the Nigerian public road transport service further</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The present study aimed to propose a theoretical framework that elucidates the impact of supply chain management (SCM) practices on the competitive advantage and performance of firms while considering the mediating effects of supply chain innovation and total quality management (TQM). This research article employed a descriptive correlational methodology based on a questionnaire, complemented by structural equation modelling. The study involved the participation of 279 individuals, including managers, assistants, and supply chain experts from small and medium-sized enterprises. The study findings suggest that SCM practices significantly influence TQM, supply chain innovation, competitive advantage, and firm performance. Additionally, TQM has a significant effect on supply chain innovation, competitive advantage, and firm performance. Similarly, supply chain innovation has a positive and significant impact on competitive advantage and firm performance. Furthermore, the positive and significant mediating role of supply chain innovation and TQM in the effect of SCM practices on competitive advantage and firm performance was observed. Therefore, it can be concluded that SCM practices enhance firm performance and competitive advantage through the improvement of supply chain innovation and TQM.</jats:p>",

Longan, a key commodity in Thailand’s national food loss index calculation, undergoes a comprehensive evaluation following FAO guidelines. This study aims to quantify quantity loss in fresh longan fruit, which pinpoints critical loss stages for targeted policy recommendations. Additionally, it seeks to establish a robust methodology for data collection and calculation, providing a model for evaluating food losses in tropical fruits. Results disclose varying loss percentages across supply chains: quantitative loss 14.07% and qualitative loss 11.02% for domestic consumption, quantitative loss 13.50% and qualitative loss 14.82% for export-bound fresh longans on-season, and quantitative loss 9.85% and qualitative loss 6.52% for export-bound fresh longans off-season. Critical loss stages are identified—particularly over-ripe longan harvesting due to labor shortages and price volatility. Further factors contributing to food losses encompass insufficient pre-harvest handling practices, which result in subsequent post-harvest losses, deficiencies in SO2 fumigation and storage processes, as well as transportation-related issues. This study’s contribution lies in its comprehensive guidance, emphasizing field survey measurements and aligning with the FAO guidelines, making it a vital tool for quantifying and addressing food loss, especially in the tropical fruit sector.</jats:p>"

Однако, несмотря на это, отрасль продолжает развиваться и приспосабливаться к новым вызовам. На основании официальных статистических данных Росстата был проведен выборочный статистический анализ промышленности строительных материалов в Российской Федерации. Анализ показал динамику производства основных строительных материалов, объемы импорта различных товаров и продукции для строительной деятельности, а также уровень использования производственных мощностей. Этот анализ выявил необходимость структурной перестройки промышленности строительных материалов. В частности, требуется активное развитие процессов импортозамещения, чтобы снизить зависимость от импорта и обеспечить национальную экономику собственными ресурсами. Также важно сосредоточиться на технологическом развитии, чтобы повысить эффективность производства и конкурентоспособность отечественных строительных материалов. Для достижения этих целей необходимо формировать новые деловые связи с хозяйствующими субъектами из дружественных экономик. Взаимовыгодное сотрудничество с иностранными партнерами может способствовать обмену опытом, передаче новых технологий и привлечению инвестиций. Кроме того, успешные инициативы на всех уровнях хозяйственной деятельности России играют важную роль в развитии промышленности строительных материалов. Поддержка государства, создание специальных программ и стимулов для отрасли, а также развитие инфраструктуры и логистики способствуют росту производства и повышению его эффективности. В целом, несмотря на сложности, промышленность строительных материалов в России имеет потенциал для развития.

Survey data (class p1) collected from households, hotels, restaurants, schools and produce markets were analysed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses for insights into the types and amounts of food waste, and respondents’ attitudes and practices towards its collection, disposal and alternative uses. Households produce the highest amounts of food waste compared to institutions (hotels, schools and restaurants) and produce markets. In a week, about 96, 72, and 93% of all the respondents in households, institutions and produce markets respectively experienced food waste at least one to three times. On average, with a solid waste collection coverage of 45%, households, institutions and markets in Kampala can respectively supply 680, 80, and 8 t of food waste daily. Moulding, poor food storage, food leftovers, food expiry and excess food produce were the major reasons for condemning food to waste. Over 90% of the respondents recognized food waste as a problem, and as a resource especially for use in livestock feed production, and were willing to consume house crickets raised on feed from food waste. Lower levels of education (none, primary and secondary levels), unemployment, and being divorced at household level were positively associated with recognizing food waste as a resource [X<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (21, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 209) = 137.77, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> =  &lt; 0.0001] and re-use for alternative purposes [X<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (21, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 209) = 47.44, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.001] by households and institutions [X<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (14, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 92) = 30.97, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> =  &lt; 0.019].

On average, 10.9 million tons of aviation kerosene per year are supplied to the domestic market of the country1. In Russia, a significant market share in the supply of aviation fuel is occupied by the leaders, among which now are Lukoil, Rosneft and Gazprom which all together are vertically integrated oil companies (VIOC). Along with the colossal volumes of production and supply of jet fuel, which include many technological operations, starting from the production stage to the direct delivery “to the wing” of the aircraft, the probability of production and supply of not only high quality, but also substandard jet fuel increases. Substandard fuel poses a rather serious threat during the operation of aviation equipment, being one of the many factors leading to failures of aviation equipment, aviation accidents and incidents, thereby reducing the level of flight safety. Oil refining companies, refueling complexes and airlines are interested in the safety of their activities, which have reliable systems and means to ensure it, but nevertheless substandard fuel takes place. One of the important reasons is the lack of a unified integrated flight safety system in terms of aviation fuel supply for air transportation, and therefore, it is necessary to search for new or implement existing adapted methods, solutions, systems and means to ensure the required level of flight safety.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, a great challenge exists in predicting and assessing the behaviour of the diverse actors within planning systems. Furthermore, the effects and impacts of human decisions and actions are normally not considered in the planning process. Moreover, uncertain events and disruptions increase the lack of planning accuracy in which traditional planning driven methods often failed resulting in major deviations between expected and actual outcomes representing a great risk. In addition, the cause of the differences is often difficult to find due to the focus on the technical ideal planning method, i.e., the risk is difficult to mitigate based on this traditional approach. Thus, the purpose of the research is to develop a conceptual model on how to bring any planning system from its theoretical and ideal perspective to a reality and human-oriented planning by integrating the human factor in the planning system. The paper presents a global planning system and a conceptual model to develop the human-oriented planning model in the supply chain. A general description of how to apply it in the different supply chain areas such as procurement, production, and distribution planning is described. Moreover, the model is applied in specific cases to close the gap by generating profiles. Therefore, the model pursues to consider the behaviour of the actors and human agents within the planning within information systems thanks to quality tools. Finally, a discussion of implications in current information systems is performed.</jats:p>"

Plants that efficiently absorb and utilize nitrogen enhance the efficiency of fertilizers, reducing their input costs and preventing ecosystem damage. Thus, an adequate nitrogen supply can significantly improve plant growth, fruit quality, and nutritional value. This research focused on evaluating the plant vegetative and productive performance and fruit quality of three short-day strawberry genotypes (“Cristina”, “Romina”, and “Sibilla”) that were fertilized with different amounts of nitrogen, in a crop that was protected under a plastic tunnel. The trial was conducted during two cultivation cycles. The nitrogen rates were 113, 90, and 68 kg/ha for the first year, and 118, 97, and 76 kg/ha for the second. Reduced nitrogen inputs did not significantly affect plant height, indicating that decreased nutritional intake does not harm plant development. The fruit sugar content value remained stable across all nitrogen supplies, as did the fruit titratable acidity. The cultivars maintained a medium fruit firmness at a 60% nitrogen supply, and the Chroma index was not affected. This study found that reducing nitrogen inputs did not have a significant negative impact on the three tested cultivars, making them suitable for cultivation with reduced nitrogen inputs to reduce the environmental impact and save growers’ inputs.</jats:p>"

Effective supply chain processes aim to distribute products efficiently and at the right time, place, and cost to meet all requirements at every level. In the cocoa supply chain, the roles of actors such as cocoa farmers, collectors, wholesalers, agro-industry, and exporters are very important. While the availability of cocoa in the upstream sector is essential for the long-term viability of the cocoa agro-industry, the uncertainty of cocoa prices for farmers can threaten its sustainability. To overcome this problem, this study aims to examine the role of each supply chain actor in the cocoa pricing system. Descriptive and qualitative research methods were used. Interviews with cocoa supply chain actors in Pasaman, West Pasaman, and Padang Pariaman Regencies provided research data sources. According to the research findings, the price-fixing method, cocoa at the farmer and trader level, has been used thus far as the value pricing method received by consumers, which means that the price is based on consumer perceptions of the value of the cocoa being sold. Agro-industry product pricing is based on markup costs for the products produced. Meanwhile, cocoa pricing for exporters is adjusted to reflect the current global cocoa price. So, it is necessary to have a government policy that regulates the role of supply chain actors in determining cocoa prices at the farm level to improve the welfare of farmers, thus ensuring the development of a sustainable cocoa agro-industry.</jats:p>"

In this article, we focus on the investment strategies of information‐provision tech and its impact on the platform‐based supply chain. To this end, we develop a general model under which the platform invests in information‐provision tech for homogenous sellers and consumers search for products on the platform. Our results show that the platform should adopt a higher investment level in information‐provision tech for the products with the unit search cost or products' information uncertainty degree being medium. Also, a more competitive environment can lead to a lower platform's investment level in information‐provision tech when the number of browsing products is sufficiently large. Interestingly, we find that for a large unit search cost or small uncertainty degree of products' information, investing in information‐provision tech can benefit the platform's and sellers' profit. In addition, if the number of browsing products is large, investing in information‐provision tech can increase the consumer surplus and social welfare. Lastly, our results hold for a broad class of distributions of products' information uncertainty value and other practical cases. Our studies can help the platform to understand the roles of information‐provision tech and provide some practical management insights.</jats:p>",

In this direction, this research looked at the supply chain of milk and dairy products by analyzing the primary production, the situation in the processing industry, and the international market’s competitiveness. Indicators of technical efficiency were used to analyze the situation on agricultural farms, while for the processing industry, the impact of various variables on profitability was evaluated using panel models. Furthermore, an examination of these products’ standings in the global market was conducted by assessing their revealed comparative advantages and integration index. The results of the research determined the level of technical efficiency of the producer, while the statistically significant influence of certain variables on profitability was determined within the processing industry. Additionally, the analysis showed modestly revealed comparative advantages in the international market but good integration with the international market. Finally, the sustainability of the milk and dairy products supply chain is highly questionable in crises, which will be a challenge for producers and policymakers.</jats:p>"

The aims of this study were to analyze the effects of growing wheat as first and second wheat after oilseed rape, as well as monoculture in a long-term field experiment over three years on (i) aboveground biomass formation, root development and nutrient acquisition during the growing season, (ii) take-all occurrence, and (iii) grain yield and yield components. Subsoil root length density of winter wheat was significantly higher after oilseed rape as pre-crop than after wheat, which was independent of take-all occurrence. Differences in wheat aboveground biomass occurred at early growth stages and were persistent until harvest. Grain yield loss correlated well with take-all disease severity in a wet year but yield differences among crop rotational positions occurred also in a dry year without visible fungal infection. Thus, an effect of the crop rotational position of wheat beyond take-all disease pressure can be assumed. Overall, wheat root length density might be the key to understand wheat biomass formation and grain yield in different crop rotational positions.</jats:p>"

To address the issue of low biogas production during winter, the implementation of a multi-energy complementary system has become essential for ensuring heating stability. To guarantee the economy, stability, and energy-saving operation of the heating system, this study proposes coupling biogas and solar energy with a phase-change energy-storage heating system. The mathematical model of the heating system was developed, taking an office building in Xilin Hot, Inner Mongolia (43.96000° N, 116.03000° E) as a case study. Additionally, the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) was employed to determine equipment selection and optimize the dynamic operation strategy, considering the minimum cost and the balance between the supply and demand of the building load. The operating economy was evaluated using metrics such as payback period, load ratio, and daily rate of return. The results demonstrate that the multi-energy complementary heating system, with a balanced supply and demand, yields significant economic benefits compared to the central heating system, with a payback period of 4.15 years and a daily return rate of 32.97% under the most unfavorable working conditions. Moreover, the development of a daily optimization strategy holds practical engineering significance, and the optimal scheduling of the multi-energy complementary system, with a balance of supply and demand, is realized.</jats:p>"

A total of ten (10) managers of conventional manufacturing firms and ten (10) managers of 3D printing firms in Free State, South Africa participated in the study through the use of a purposive sampling technique. Interview guides were used in the collection of data. Data transcriptions and thematic analysis were used to analyze data gathered from the interviews.Findings: The results of the study showed that 3D printing contributed positively in dealing with manufacturing disruptions that were encountered by manufacturing firms in Free State, South Africa through the production of components and spare parts that were broken down in manufacturing machinery/plants. From the study, the researchers recommend that 3D printing technology should be adopted by manufacturing firms because of its practicality in providing manufacturing support and production continuity even in supply chain disruptive experiences caused by pandemics such as Covid-19.  Originality/value: The study proves that due to the versatility of the 3D printing technology it could be used to minimize the effect of supply chain disruption during cries such as the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the unique contributions of the current study is the realization that additive manufacturing was not of much relevance to the generic supply chain challenges encountered in supply chain activiteis, but rather very relevant in helping to prevent disruptions of the manufacturing process by improvising spare parts at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.  </jats:p>"

This systematic literature review investigated the benefits, use, challenges, and mitigation measures related to Industry 4.0 technologies in supply chain management within thirteen “major emerging markets”. Industry 4.0 integrates technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and cloud computing, and it offers tangible benefits for manufacturing and supply chains. However, its adoption faces significant obstacles, particularly in emerging economies. This study used the PSALSAR framework and PRISMA methodology to systematically review 87 peer-reviewed research articles on Industry 4.0 in the supply chain context of thirteen major emerging economies. Findings revealed that while IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence are frequently applied, other technologies such as cloud computing and robotics are underutilized. Key challenges identified include data integration, cyber-security, high upfront investment, weak policy, and business risks. Mitigation strategies proposed include the development of supportive policies, management backing, training, and improved data security. Tangible benefits such as sustainably using resources, reducing power use, enabling collaboration among supply chain partners, incorporating asset traceability, and minimizing meat contamination were evident. This research provides useful insights into the current status of Industry 4.0 adoption in emerging markets, helping stakeholders to navigate towards a more digitized, efficient future.</jats:p>"

In power plants, it is necessary to pay attention to the reliability of the generating system in meeting the needs of a load. The reliability of the generating system can be described by the plant reliability index. To pay attention to the reliability of the generating system, an analysis is needed that is used to evaluate the reliability index of the plant, one of which is Loss of Load Probability (LOLP). This study presents the calculation of the LOLP value at the PT Pertamina EP Bunyu PLTMG in 2022. In calculating the LOLP value, namely by using Microsoft Exel and Matrix laboratory simulation. PT Pertamina EP Bunyu PLTMG has 4 generating units with each capacity having a power of 1000 KW. The duration of disruption of the generating unit affects the Forced Outage Rate (FOR) value which will be used to find the probability of each combination of generating units. From this probability value, the LOLP value is obtained. At the PT Pertamina EP Bunyu PLTMG, the LOLP value is 0.00005579646% with an outage probability of 0.0203657079 days/year. While the standard set by PT PLN (Persero) in the 2018-2027 PLN RUPTL of LOLP is smaller than 0.274% or equivalent to a probability of outage of 1 day / year, it can be said that the reliability index of the power plant at PT Pertamina EP Bunyu PLTMG in 2022 is in the reliable category.</jats:p>"

To explore the influence of fairness concerns on operational decisions in closed-loop supply chains after the formation of retail groups. In this paper, we first construct a secondary dual-channel closed-loop supply chain led by a retail group and followed by a manufacturer. Next, the corresponding game models are constructed under three scenarios, namely, fairness neutrality (FN), fairness concerns of the retail groups (FR), and fairness concerns of the manufacturer (FM), respectively. Finally, the game models are solved and analyzed. It turns out that it is easier for the manufacturer to satisfy its demands for fairness by adjusting the wholesale price. Furthermore, we find that fairness concerns do not enhance the recycling rate of used products and the greenness of remanufacturing. For retail groups, fairness concerns can hurt their profits, but appropriate fairness concerns can contribute to profitable growth in their retail business. Interestingly, the manufacturer’s fairness concerns do not affect the total profitability of the supply chain system, but the retail group’s fairness concerns do. This paper identifies dual changes in the scope of operations and power structure of retail groups in closed-loop supply chains, as well as analyzes the fairness concerns raised by these changes, which will lead to new recommendations for operational decision-making in firms.</jats:p>"

It is situated 6 kilometers from the mouth of the Timok River, which flows into the Danube River. Despite the proximity of the river, the town experienced some complications in its water supply. The purpose of the research is to to analyze and evaluate the water supply system of the town of Bregovo. The water supply in the municipality of Bregovo is taken care of by the operator \"ViK Vidin\" EOOD. The separate territory of \"ViK Vidin\" EOOD consists of a total of six different sized water supply systems (WSS), one of which is WSS Bregovo � for the town of Bregovo. The WSS Bregovo is supplied with water from two underground water sources, which receive water from one shaft well and two drilling wells. The water is pumped by means of two pumping stations through the distribution network to the water tower located above the city with a capacity of 250 m3. Data on water sources and consumption were used for the purpose of the research. The data for the resource of the water sources is based on information from the issued water permits of Danube River Basin Directorate Pleven. The data for the water demand � from the \"ViK Vidin\" EOOD and the forecast for the demand made in the regional master plans for water and waste water. Then with this data it was calculated The Water Stress Index for water supply of the town of Bregovo, which takes into account the percentage of intake water to the available water resource. In order to avoid water stress, this ratio should be under 20%, and for the town of Bregovo is around 20-22%. The water stress can even be reduced below 20% if measures will be taken to reduce the high water losses and water wastage in the distribution network, which reach up to 70%. The study shows that the quantity of water sources is sufficient for consumption of the population, but there are possible problems with the quality of drinking water. It is also calculated the Water Storage Capacity Index of the water tower, which should be within 50-100% of the average daily water demand in the serviced territory, in order to achieve an acceptable level of security of water supply. The index is insufficient, with values around 31-45%. Some recommendations have been made to improve the storage index values. Conclusions have been made in connection with the improving the performance of the WSS Bregovo. </jats:p>",

In SFDs, O-rings (ORs) restrict side leakage and increase the viscous damping while a adding a modest centering stiffness. Continuing a long-term project characterizing SFDs for aircraft engines and extending the original work (San Andrés and Rodríguez, 2021, “On the Experimental Dynamic Force Performance of a Squeeze Film Damper Supplied Through a Check Valve and Sealed With O-Rings,” ASME J. Eng. Gas Turb. Power, 143(11), p. 111011) the paper details measurements of the forced performance of an OR sealed damper (OR-SFD) with diameter D = 127 mm, land length L = 0.2 D, and radial clearance c = 0.0022 D. Lubricant ISO VG 2 supplied at 0.69 bar(g) fills an upstream oil plenum and flows into the middle of the land through a single orifice configured with a check valve. Measurements of applied single-frequency dynamic loads, along with the ensuing damper displacements and accelerations serve to identify the parameters of the test structure, ORs, and SFD. The tests encompass centered whirl motions with amplitude r = 0.05–0.45c, and a range of whirl frequencies, ω = 10–130 Hz. Note the squeeze velocity vs =  rω reaches 102 mm/s. The ORs force coefficients are nearly invariant with frequency but do depend on the orbit amplitude. The ORs' stiffness (KOR) decreases by 75% as the motion amplitude increases, r → 0.45c, likely due to the large elastic deformations and slow recovery of the ORs material. For small amplitude motions (r/c = 0.05 and 0.10), the ORs damping coefficient (COR) is ∼10% of the overall coefficient for the lubricated system (CL), while for r/c &amp;gt; 0.25, COR ∼ 0.03CL. For small amplitudes of whirl (r ≤ 0.25c), the SFD experimental viscous damping (CSFD) and added mass (MSFD) coefficients, identified over a shorter frequency range (vs&amp;lt;30 mm/s) equal theoretical magnitudes for a fully sealed damper. As the orbit size grows to r = 0.45c MSFD drops nearly by 75% and CSFD decreases by ∼40% due to the onset of both lubricant cavitation and air ingestion occurring for squeeze velocities vs ≥ 24.5 mm/s, as also seen in the recorded dynamic pressures and video recordings of a bubbly mixture leaving the damper. A comprehensive flow model predicts CSFD and MSFD about 8% and 12% larger than the experimentally identified coefficients. A novel approach enables the estimation of the gas volume fraction (GVF) generated in the damper which rapidly increases as vs grows. The simple procedure draws into a deflated balloon the material contents in the squeeze film, weighs the sample, and identifies its volume to produce an estimate of the GVF. The procedure to quantify the GFV will assist in the validation of predictive tools.</jats:p>",

The bipolar Cockcroft‐Walton voltage multiplier (BiCWVM) is a major circuit that steps up the voltage in the resonant converter. However, the diode non‐linearity in BiCWVM can introduce self‐sustained quasi‐periodic oscillations in the voltage and current waveforms, which is commonly known as the Deane and Hamill (DH) phenomenon. The oscillation can lead to higher magnetic loss and control failure, and it is more likely to present in the gallium nitride‐based converter due to the high‐frequency operation. The authors aim to investigate and mitigate the DH phenomenon systematically so that proper mitigation can be implemented. To facilitate the investigation, the circuit before the BiCWVM in the converter is derived and modelled as a voltage source <jats:italic>v</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>m</jats:italic></jats:sub> and a series inductor <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>sy</jats:sub>. Also, the reverse recovery process of the diode in the BiCWVM can be represented by a piecewise‐linear (PWL) model, with the simplified circuit and PWL model, the relationship between voltage and current under different operating conditions can be determined with ease. The relationship allows to understand the mechanism of diode reverse recovery in BiCWVM that leads to DH phenomenon. Finally, a hybrid‐/full‐silicon carbide (SiC) design is proposed to mitigate the DH phenomenon, which is verified experimentally for a 300‐kHz, 5‐W, 20‐V/1.5‐kV GaN‐based step‐up resonant converter.</jats:p>",

The result of this research is the developed laboratory bench that allows measuring the current and voltage parameters in the photodetector branch. The equivalent generator method has been used, as well as the known circuit laws with two dedicated nodes for an active two-terminal network. When analyzing the literature, the existing scientific achievements, and discoveries in the field of research, an own concept of research has been formed that is different from foreign analogs. During the experiment, the studies have been performed when the photodetector was in the short circuit, idle mode, and connected to a high-resistance load. Based on the results obtained, current-voltage characteristics (CVC) and histograms have been built using a radiation source (laser) with a power of 10 and 30 mW. The parameters and technical characteristics of the irradiated silicon crystal and the radiation source have been given. The obtained electrical power has been determined using the known laws of electrical engineering, including the Ohm law. To process the experimental data, there has been used quadratic interpolation of the function, the results of the root-mean-square approximation, and there has been carried out the regression analysis. Absolute and relative errors have been calculated. The Student coefficient has been determined with a confidence interval of 0.95. Based on the results of the study, the efficiency of the power transmission system has been determined</jats:p>"

A total of 384 participants were recruited from the community ( n = 160, 41.7%) and an Atlantic Canadian University ( n = 224, 58.3%) to complete an online survey. The majority of the sample was supportive of SSPs ( n = 316, 82.3%). Being of European origin, a younger age, identifying as female, displaying higher levels of Openness to Experience, and reporting less stigma towards people who use drugs were predictive of more positive attitudes towards SSPs. Openness to Experience mediated the relationship between stigma levels and attitudes towards SSPs.

Modern methodological approaches make it possible to assess the risk of waterborne bacterial intestinal infections, taking into account both the sanitary and hygienic conditions of water used by the population and the level of communal improvement of the territory.\r\nThe purpose of the study was to assess the degree of epidemic danger of bacterial intestinal infections associated with the conditions of centralized drinking and household water supply, using the example of the subjects of the Northwestern Federal District.\r\nMaterials and methods. The study tested the data of the federal statistical observation form No. 18 “Information on the sanitary condition of the subject”, the federal information fund of social and hygienic monitoring, and the Unified Interdepartmental Information and Statistical System. We analyzed the materials for 2022 in eleven subjects of the Northwestern Federal District. Method MR 2.1.10.0031-11 was taken as the basis for microbial risk assessment.\r\nResults. The Republic of Karelia, Vologda, Arkhangelsk, and Novgorod regions are characterized by an average degree of microbial risk in terms of the proportion of drinking water samples in the distribution network, in which generalized coliform bacteria were found; Novgorod region and the Republic of Karelia have a high degree of risk for E. coli. The lowest number of population provided with centralized water supply, corresponding to a high degree of microbial risk, was found in the Nenets Autonomous Okrug. This region is also characterized by the lowest average daily water consumption per capita.\r\nLimitations. The study tested the data on the subjects of the North-Western Federal District in 2022, the quality of drinking water was assessed only according to the results of laboratory studies conducted by the Federal Service for Supervision in Protection of the Rights of Consumer and Man Wellbeing.\r\nConclusion. Most regions of the Russian North-West are characterized by an average degree of microbial risk, except for St. Petersburg, where a low degree of risk is established. The use of an alternative variant of risk ranking by 5 degrees (low, slightly increased, increased, significantly increased, high) showed that in the Republic of Karelia, Arkhangelsk and Vologda regions, and Nenets Autonomous Okrug, there is a significantly elevated degree of microbial risk.</jats:p>",

Access to electricity remains very low, with significant disparities across urban and rural remote areas. The gap between the electricity demand and supply keeps increasing yearly, and power shortages get frequent and longer, especially during dry periods from March to June. The energy demand increase, due to of population grow and rapid urbanization (causing more use of fossil fuels resources in the energy mix) bears the unsustainability of the country’s current energy supply. The challenge for the country is then to meet this growing energy demand with a sustainable energy supply system. In the present work, Analytical Hierarchy Process technique is applied to perform Multicriteria Decision Making analysis to identify and assess the most sustainable long-term energy supply options in Mali considering technical, environmental, social, and economic dimensions. The current situation and five alternatives of energy supply based on the country’s current and future energy supply and climate change policies are proposed for assessment. Results show that the highest priority indicators by stakeholders’ survey are under economical dimension followed by the technical ones. The best scenario considers deploying renewable energy to up to 42% of the energy mix as the sustainable option for energy supply. Adopting such scenario requires measures as a strong political will to subsidize renewable energy equipment in order to make them affordable and also policies that encourage the use of renewable energy (such as lower taxes and duties). The suggested framework gives decision-makers, authorities, practitioners, and researches an effective tool for the country future energy planning.</jats:p>",

This study took northwest Hubei, China (Exibei), a national ecological function area, as a case study and predicted the land‐cover distribution in 2040 under three scenarios: natural scenario (2040NS), economic development (2040ED) and ecological protection (2040EP). And the supply–demand risks of water‐related ESs were simulated under three scenarios. Results indicated that (1) the increase in forest land (0.70%) under 2040NS, construction land (50.03%) under 2040ED and water body (15.16%) under 2040EP basically happened through the occupation of cultivated land; (2) under three scenarios, although the water yield demand in 2040 increased significantly, the supply still fully meet demand; (3) from 2020 to 2040, more than 13.50% of the areas in Exibei of water yield changed from surplus to deficit, mainly covering the north Xiangyang City and the middle Shiyan City; and (4) the change in supply and demand of soil retention from 2020 to 2040 was not obvious. This study provides assistance in water resources rational allocation in ecological function zones with rapid economic development and urban expansion.</jats:p>",

In experimental investigations in one of the needles, the air volume flow rate was constant, and in the neighbouring needle, it was changed. In the paper, the methods of data analysis: wavelet decomposition, and FFT were used. It was shown that the hydrodynamic interaction becomes stronger with the increase in air volume flow rate supply to the needle. The occurrence of hydrodynamic interaction modifies bubble growth time slightly, but it significantly modifies the bubble waiting time. In the case when the liquid penetration into the needle is repeatable, then the percentage disturbances in bubble growth time and bubble waiting time are close to each other. Moreover, it can be concluded that synchronized or alternative bubble departures from twin neighbouring needles (occurring due to hydrodynamic interaction) are possible by modifying the bubble waiting time. The modification of hydrodynamic interaction between bubbles, the bubbles themselves, and gas supply systems can be used to control the bubble departure process.</jats:p>"

Variations in the shape and thickness of the film versus the velocity, the load, and the spinning factor under fully flooded lubrication were discussed, and the effects of the inlet-starvation position and oil-supply quantity were analyzed. The results show that the symmetry for the classical horseshoe shape does not exist under both spinning–rolling and spinning–sliding EHL conditions. Different from spinning–rolling, a dimple is generated more easily under the spinning–sliding condition. The dimple is related to the load and the speed. The effects of the inlet-starvation position on spinning EHL are different. When the inlet starvation is on the low-speed side of the contact, that is, proximal to the center of rotation, the inlet-starvation position extends from the proximal side to the center of rotation to the distal side to the center of rotation, i.e., the high-speed side of the contact, which is starved easily. When the starvation happens on the high-speed side, i.e., distal to the center of rotation, the starvation at this position becomes much more severe, and lubrication failure and a risk of wear will occur. In addition, the effects of oil-supply quantity on spinning EHL are important.</jats:p>"

Herein, a bioartificial pancreas is constructed, which incorporates the “stealth effect” based on polyethylene glycol copolymers and the high oxygen‐carrying performance of fluorinated nanoparticles. Polycationic poly(<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>‐lysine)‐grafted‐poly(ethylene glycol) is successfully coated on the surface of alginate microcapsules through electrostatic interaction, which can not only resist fibrinogen adhesion and avoid excessive fibrosis around the microcapsules but also isolate the host immune system from attacking, achieving a “stealth effect” of microencapsulated islet cells. Furthermore, the coloading of fluoride‐based O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanocarriers gives them enhanced oxygen‐carrying and continuous oxygen supply capabilities, thereby effectively prolonging the survival of islet cells. The intracapsular islet cells still display similar cell viability and almost normal insulin secretion function even in long‐term culture under hypoxic conditions.

One of the problems that often occurs in the optical supply chain is inventory control. The optical store is one of the microenterprises engaged in optometric health services. The enclosed supply chain is a three-echelon model, where the store is at the second level. The process of ordering lenses at the store from suppliers is not carried out based on predicted demand. The determination of the safety stock amount and the reorder point also still has a fairly low accuracy there. This is indicated by overstock and stock-out situations that still occur frequently in this company. Overstock causes the product to be damaged because it has been stored for too long and stock out causes lost sales. To solve the problem in this research, the prediction of future demand is overcome by using several time series methods, such as cyclical models, cyclical trend models, and ARIMA models. Forecasting result validation is implemented by calculating the calculation of errors using MAPE, MAD, and MSE then it was found that the forecasting model chosen to predict the demand for the lenses is a cyclical trend model. The result of the demand forecasting and safety stock size calculation with 3 service levels are used as input to determine the reorder point. After observing the condition of the company and the targets set by the company, the calculation results with a service level of 90% is the most possible to be implemented.</jats:p>"

This paper examines environmental labeling strategies in a green supply chain. The manufacturer has the option to use either self‐labeling or external certified labeling, and consumers have different levels of trust in the two types of environmental labels. We find that under both strategies, supply chain decision makers should fully consider the impacts of consumer trust in environmental labeling, green research and development (R&amp;D) cost, and the demand share of the direct channel on the supply chain. Besides, the retailer realizes higher profit under external certified labeling. A higher green R&amp;D cost or smaller market proportion of the direct channel would dampen the motivation of the manufacturer to choose external certified labeling. Lastly, we explore the case of a risk‐averse retailer and find that the external certified environmental labeling is optimal when the risk aversion is high. Moreover, under both strategies, the risk‐averse attitude of the retailer leads to a more significant channel utility.</jats:p>",

We evaluated the short-term, external, and direct impacts of disruptions of six food commodities and three types of fertilizer supplies from Russia and Ukraine on food access for all trading partners of the two countries by applying a set of trade and socioeconomic indicators. We found that the external food supplies of 279 countries and territories were affected to varying degrees; 24 countries—especially Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Mongolia—are extremely vulnerable because they depend almost entirely on a variety of food imports from Russia and Ukraine. Access to fertilizers was affected in 136 countries and territories, particularly Estonia (potassic fertilizer), Mongolia (nitrogenous fertilizers), Kazakhstan (mixed fertilizers), and Brazil, the United States, China, and India (all types of fertilizers). An integrated assessment of countries’ import types, purchasing power parity per capita, and populations indicated that the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Pakistan are most vulnerable to such supply disruptions. Development of research into diversification and decentralization strategies for food access is needed to guide stable food supply policies.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the study was guided by the following objectives: to assess the effect of outsourcing cleaning services on organisational performance, to investigate the effect of outsourced garbage collection services on organisational performance and to assess the effect of outsourced stationery outsourcing services on organisational performance at IRUWASA. The study adopted a cross-sectional research design, where data were collected at one point in time. The targeted population of this study were all employees (48) from IRUWASA. Descriptive statistics and regression analysis were used to analyse data. Major findings from the study showed that cleaning, garbage collection and stationery outsourced services positively impacted IRUWASA performance. The results also revealed that outsourcing resulted in cost savings in all three aspects of cleaning, garbage collection and stationery outsourcing of about Tsh. 12,309,000 (56.89%); 19,520,000 (55%) and 12,309,000 (36.73%) respectively. Results from correlation and multiple linear regression showed the adjusted R2 equals 0.640, implying that the model explains about 64% variations in organisation performance, while all the independent variables were found statistically and positively significant, influencing the dependent variable. The study concludes that outsourcing services improve organisational performance. The study recommends that the government and other institutions discern the potential benefits of outsourcing services in terms of cost-effectiveness, resource allocation, and the optimisation of core functions</jats:p>"

However, Operators were often confronted with challenges of the great demand on electrical power especially fracturing operation. Fossil-energy-powered electricity and existing expensive high-voltage power grids have negative effect on Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG) initiatives and CAPEX of shale-oil developing projects.

In this paper one novel green-power supply solution based on capacity leasing and energy storage sharing with data centers was proposed due to electrical power surplus. One hybrid power network, combining 35kV grid with Multi Micro-grids (MMGs) between green-power stations and oil field pads, was planned to be constructed by operators. One ESS-based system integrating MMGs was set up in one case demonstration. Some mobile energy-storage units were used for cost-effective power supply and peak shaving on certain pads due to poor load curves. The solution feasibility was verified and compared with the traditional power supply mode. ESS-based system with MMGs is qualified for affordable green-powered well construction and sustainable development of unconventional oil fields.</jats:p>",

The SSO excited the shaft torsional vibration of thermal generators and caused trip failures, leading to economic losses and stabilization problems. However, the existing phasor-based oscillation source locating methods cannot be applied to the SSO since the power system quasi-steady-state assumption was not satisfied in the SSO scenarios. Thus, a novel locating method for SSO sources was urgently required. To fill this gap, this paper proposed an improved method for locating nonlinear sub-synchronous oscillation sources based on Energy Supply on Port (ESP) and bicoherence. The ESP was calculated with the instantaneous values of measured voltages and currents at some predefined network interfaces, i.e., the ports. The tendency of the ESP indicated the transient energy injection from a certain subsystem into the rest of the network during a designated period, which can help figure out the oscillation source of the SSO. After oscillation source localization, the nonlinear index and its threshold were proposed by defining the bicoherence coefficient in consideration of the nonlinear oscillation characteristics. According to the power-quality standard and the comparison of the bicoherence with the threshold, the nonlinearity of the oscillation source was examined. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method were proved in the case study which simulated the oscillation scene of the accident in Hami.</jats:p>",

Studies have shown that green intelligent home appliances can save electricity and reduce carbon emissions. In the context of China’s “dual-carbon” goal, this study examines the technological innovation and marketing publicity decisions of the green intelligent home appliance supply chain considering the consumer subsidy and cost-sharing contract. By constructing a three-level supply chain model that includes home appliance manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, we use the Stackelberg game method to study the decision-making models under four scenarios with and without consumer subsidy and cost-sharing contract and consider the impact of consumers’ green intelligent preference, consumers’ green marketing sensitivity, consumer subsidy and cost-sharing contract on the supply chain optimal decision. Through model solving and further numerical simulation, the results show that 1) the increase of consumers’ green intelligent preference and consumers’ green marketing sensitivity can produce positive spillover effects and promote the improvement of home appliance manufacturers’ technological innovation efforts and retailers’ marketing publicity efforts; 2) consumer subsidy is always beneficial for the green intelligent development of the supply chain, which can effectively increase the total revenue of the supply chain; 3) the reasonable cost-sharing ratio can stimulate the enthusiasm of supply chain enterprises to increase technological innovation and marketing publicity investments and increase the total profit of the supply chain. However, the excessive cost-sharing ratio frustrates the enthusiasm of home appliance retailers to participate in the coordination, which results in a decline in the overall benefit of the supply chain; 4) by considering both consumer subsidy and cost-sharing contract, a reasonable level of consumer subsidy and cost-sharing ratio have a better incentive effect on the supply chain members than in the other three scenarios. This study can provide a broader reference for the green intelligent development of China’s home appliance industry, which plays an important role in the implementation of China’s “dual carbon” goal.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Green Deal is a political milestone aiming to promote a carbon-neutral economy in the European Union. Decarbonizing the complex food sector requires the unified interaction among effective climate policies, economic instruments, and initiatives involving multiple stakeholders. Despite increasing efforts to highlight the importance of innovations and finance to achieve sustainable food supply chains (FSC), comprehensive information about related opportunities and barriers to mitigating emissions in the food sector is still under-explored. To cover this gap, this paper applies an existing industrial policy framework under the lens of the EU FSC to identify potential strategies that should help achieve the needed financial means and innovation actions, as well as to gauge political alignment across FSC stages. Methodologically, the pillars proposed in the framework are linked to multi-stakeholders’ initiatives engaged in achieving net-zero emissions. The paper highlights three main implications of the identified interlinkages. First, political directionality related to the food sector should be more comprehensively tailored to account for the specificities of all stages of the FSC. Second, research and development projects shall likewise cover all stages, instead of emphasizing only food production and agricultural systems. Finally, multiple stakeholders are crucial as promoters of technology and innovation towards a green economy. Nevertheless, initiatives should be integrated into political discussions in order to promote civil awareness, sustainable food and services demand, aligned to political guidelines.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper scrutinises the availability and effectiveness of non-revenue water management practices at Lodwar Water Supply, which serves an urban populace in Arid, Northern Kenya. The case study is representative of medium-sized water utilities serving populations in water-scarce areas within developing countries. Challenges encountered by water utilities in developing countries are unique, and their resolution requires context-specific approaches. For instance, Lodwar water supply posted an estimated 52% non-revenue water in a recent assessment by Kenya’s water services regulatory agency (WaSREB). The utility lost half of its production. This is unacceptable for a water utility serving an arid service area with 43% water coverage. This paper documents the findings of a causal study conducted to identify probable reasons for the water utility performance and develop recommendations to reverse the worsening non-revenue water trend. Four aspects were identified for scrutiny at the water utility; these were: Availability of strategies, methods, and policies for non-revenue water reduction; Employee and Consumer awareness of non-revenue water management; Techniques for enumeration of components of non-revenue water and the nexus between the foregoing and the prevailing poor non-revenue water and overall performance of the water utility. Three hundred eighty-five questionnaires were administered to consumers, randomly sampled across the selected study area. This was followed by a non-quantitative audit of non-revenue water practices by the water utility and focused group discussions with top management and technical staff at the water utility. This study established the absence of deliberate strategies for control of non-revenue water by the water utility as the critical reason for the unacceptably poor non-revenue water and overall performance of Lodwar Water Supply. Recommendations for mitigation of non-revenue water included the establishment of zone-specific, updated consumer database; DMAs with functional inflow meters; acquisition of meter testing and calibration system; institution of active leakage control initiatives and personnel capacity development</jats:p>"

The review of the literature reveals the range of factors, from the procurement of raw materials to end customer perceptions which make the supply chain green. In a simple random sampling, 125 responses were collected from Karnataka to explore the interrelations between the factors. The analysis evaluates whether the underlying structure of a green supply chain is uni-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Whether the factors have a hierarchical relationship and are factors independent or correlated, the analysis found that there are four correlated factors without any higher order.</jats:p>",

The repercussions of this extend to companies, impacting their brand reputation, revenue streams and overall profitability. Industries like agriculture, banking, electronics, and high-value deliveries uses the emergence of blockchain technology as a powerful tool to discern between authentic and counterfeit items. Its potential as a means to curtail the influx of fake products in the market is substantial. Blockchain technology, at its core, operates as a decentralized and distributed digital ledger system, meticulously recording transactions within interconnected blocks across multiple databases. The inherent security of this technology ensures the immutability of these blocks, rendering them invulnerable to alteration or hacking. By leveraging blockchain technology, consumers can independently verify the authenticity of a product, eliminating the need for reliance on third-party intermediaries. Incorporating recent technological advancements, the utilization of Quick Response (QR) codes offers a robust approach to combat the proliferation of counterfeit goods. The integration of blockchain technology with QR codes serves as a means to uphold the integrity of products. This innovative system securely stores product details and unique codes in the form of blocks,  where QR codes play a pivotal role in collecting and matching these unique codes with entries in the blockchain database. If the QR code matches with entries in the database, the user receives a confirmation of the product's authenticity; otherwise, an alert is triggered, signaling the presence of a counterfeit product.</jats:p>"

In many species, not all buds on the main shoot develop into branches despite favorable growing conditions. In petunia, basal axillary buds (buds 1–3) typically do not grow out to form branches, while more apical axillary buds (buds 6 and 7) are competent to grow.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The genetic regulation of buds was explored using transcriptome analyses of petunia axillary buds at different positions on the main stem. To suppress or promote bud outgrowth, we grew the plants in media with differing phosphate (P) levels. Using RNA-seq, we found many (&gt; 5000) differentially expressed genes between bud 6 or 7, and bud 2. In addition, more genes were differentially expressed when we transferred the plants from low P to high P medium, compared with shifting from high P to low P medium. Buds 6 and 7 had increased transcript abundance of cytokinin and auxin-related genes, whereas the basal non-growing buds (bud 2 and to a lesser extent bud 3) had higher expression of strigolactone, abscisic acid, and dormancy-related genes, suggesting the outgrowth of these basal buds was actively suppressed. Consistent with this, the expression of ABA associated genes decreased significantly in apical buds after stimulating growth by switching the medium from low P to high P. Furthermore, comparisons between our data and transcriptome data from other species suggest that the suppression of outgrowth of bud 2 was correlated with a limited supply of carbon to these axillary buds.

Of particular importance is the management of pressure and the optimization of hydraulic regimes in water-wired networks, since they directly affect the reliability of water supply and the efficient use of resources. However, the determination of the optimal parameters and methods of regulation in each specific case requires careful research and analysis.

For smooth regulation of the pressure characteristic of the pump in the conditions of the need to maintain a given pressure of the water supply network, frequency converters are widely used.

In this regard, the authors of the article set themselves the goal of studying the degree of influence of the static component of the water supply network on the change in the power consumption of the pumping unit with frequency regulation and testing the obtained dependencies on real statistics of the water and energy consumption modes of the Sozh water intake of the Gomel water utility.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>METHODS</jats:bold>. To solve the tasks, classical formulas of similarity of the pumping unit were used, reflecting the relationship between flow, pressure and power consumption. The mean squared error, the mean absolute error and the average absolute error in percentages were used as the evaluation metric for verifying the electric power supply model of the pumping unit.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS</jats:bold>. The study demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy of power consumption modeling when using a modified coefficient reflecting the degree of power change when the frequency of the supply network changes. When using this approach, the standard error is reduced more than twice, from 0.35 to 0.167, the average absolute error is reduced from 0.347 to 0.165, and the average absolute percentage error is reduced from 0.20% to 0.08%.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION</jats:bold>The conducted research confirms the effectiveness of the use of frequency control of pumping units, which provides a nonlinear change in electrical power, and demonstrates the possibility of more accurate forecasting of electricity consumption, taking into account the specifics of the water supply network. The results of this work can be useful for projects to optimize urban water supply systems, providing more accurate planning and use of resources.</jats:p>"

Providing the population with safe, clean, drinking water is one of the most important factors in the world and among them in Georgia. According to the data of the World Health Organization, almost 2 billion people around the world suffer from a shortage of safe drinking water. Today, 1 billion 200 million people around the world suffer from a lack of safe drinking water. \nThe water consumed by modern society contains hundreds of thousands of different types of pollutants. Contaminated drinking water accelerates the aging process of the body by 30%. Under drinking water, we mean such water, the consumption of which does not cause negative changes in the health of the population. Problem urgency in Georgia has become due to increment of frequency, number infectious and carcinogenic diseases of unknown origin. Presumably one of the main reasons of population low life expectancy, infants and maternal mortality high rate, women breast cancer cases increment, pregnancy interruption etc. in country is the drinking water low quality and its disinfection by chlorine.

This paper constructs a resilience evaluation index system for manufacturing enterprises from the perspective of the supply chain and uses the improved TOPSIS method to quantify the level of resilience. Taking into account that the resilience index is easily affected by nonconventional factors in the real environment, the WAWBO weakening buffer operator and the metabolism idea are introduced to improve the grey prediction method, so as to realize the dynamic prediction of the resilience index. In addition, a supply chain resilience early warning model is constructed by combining it with the quantification method of resilience. Using the data of a Chinese electronics manufacturing enterprise as a case study, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience quantification method, and the improved grey prediction method has higher prediction accuracy. The study provides a new idea for relevant enterprises to improve the early warning ability of their supply chain, thus promoting the sustainable development of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

As a result, the study sought to establish the supply chain practices affect the organizational performance of milling company listed Nairobi Stock Exchange. The specific goals will be to determine the influence of Green supply chain practices, supplier management practices, outsourcing practices, and Supply Chain Management on the organizational performance of milling company listed Nairobi Stock Exchange, as well as to determine the moderating effect of information technology on contemporary supply chain practices on the organizational performance of milling company listed Nairobi Stock Exchange. The theory of lean Contract Value, transaction cost theory, theory of supply chain constraints and resource based view theory were used in the study. A descriptive study design was used in this investigation. The study's target population was the 260 employees of the milling company listed Nairobi Stock Exchange, as defined by the Kenya Association of Manufacturers Directory, who worked in procurement, marketing, finance, security, ICT,  or similar management. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. A sample of 73 respondents was selected using Yamane (2012) formula. Descriptive statistics, inferential statistics was  used to analyze the data. A pilot study involving 8 respondents was conducted to determine the data collection tool reliability. The study instrument had Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of between 0.756 and 0.836 on all study constructs and hence fit for the field study.  Based on final results the study found that green supply chain practices, supplier management, and outsourcing positively and significantly influence the performance of large-scale flour processing firms in Kenya. Information advancement was identified as a critical moderating factor that enhances the relationship between these supply chain management practices and performance. Specifically, information advancement amplifies the effects of green supply chain, supplier management, and outsourcing on operational performance. The study also suggested that Flour processing firms in Kenya should fully embrace green supply chain practices, including waste management, efficient energy equipment, and the use of natural light where possible to improve sustainability and performance. The study also suggested that Firms should enhance supplier relations by engaging suppliers in product development, sharing information, and rewarding top-performing suppliers to foster commitment and motivation. The study also suggested that Firms should seek cost savings, efficiency, and sustainability when outsourcing services. This can be achieved through supplier performance evaluations and formal contracts. The study also suggested that regularly review information advancement strategies to optimize performance. This study contributed to supply chain management theory by confirming the relationship between supply chain practices, information advancement, and firm performance. It strengthens the theoretical framework and informs policy makers and large-scale flour processing firms about the importance of supplier management, green supply chain, and outsourcing in supply chain management policies and regulations. In practice, the study guides firms on how to enhance performance through effective supply chain management considering information advancement. The study suggested that Future research can explore the relationship between supply chain management and performance in other sectors beyond flour processing, such as agriculture, transportation, shipping, and manufacturing. Additionally, studies can investigate the impact of different moderators, such as dynamic capabilities, legal frameworks, government regulations, and competition, on the relationship between supply chain management and performance. This will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of supply chain management dynamics&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Software (Arc-GIS and Scenario Wizard) was used to prepare emergency plans and reduce casualties due to a natural disaster in Kermanshah city, Iran, as a case study. To achieve this, three phases were carried out. In the first phase, vulnerability and destruction scenarios were determined using cross-impact balance analysis based on descriptors and their interactive variables. In the second phase, risk zonation maps for drinking water supply were developed by using geographical data and superposing different layers. In the third phase, distribution maps were developed for three grades of support and supply centres, implemented for Kermanshah city with an earthquake considered as the main disruption event.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study focuses on the counties and districts of Hebei Province as the research unit. It adopts a supply-demand perspective to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of farmland utilization transformation in the province, investigate the coordination of this transformation, and explore the influencing factors. The weight of indicators is calculated using the entropy weighting method and Analytic Hierarchy Process The comprehensive evaluation model is then applied to calculate the supply-demand transformation index of farmland utilization in Hebei Province for the years 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. Furthermore, the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics are analyzed using the kernel density estimation method. The coupling coordination degree model is selected to explain the relationship between the supply-demand transformation of farmland utilization. Finally, the influencing factors are analyzed using the geographical detector model. The research findings are as follows: 1) The supply-demand transformation index of farmland utilization in Hebei Province has shown an increasing trend during the study period. The standard deviation of the supply transformation index has increased over time, while the demand transformation index has increased at a faster rate. High-density supply transformation is concentrated in the southeast, particularly in the eastern part of Shijiazhuang. Conversely, the northwest exhibits a low-density supply transformation. High-density demand transformation is observed in urban areas across the province, with a significant expansion from 2010 to 2015. 2) There is a strong correlation between the supply and demand transformation of farmland utilization. The coupling coordination degree has gradually improved from 2005 to 2015, transitioning from rapid to stable growth. The level of coupling coordination has shifted from imbalance to coordination. The mountainous areas in the northwest of Hebei Province exhibit relatively lower coupling coordination degrees, while the plains in the southeast demonstrate higher levels. 3) The supply transformation of farmland utilization is closely correlated with the natural environment, particularly elevation and topography. On the other hand, the demand transformation is closely associated with socio-economic development, with a scarcity of supply driving an increase in the demand transformation index. Industrial developed areas show a higher intensity of demand for farmland utilization. 4) To ensure the sustainable utilization of farmland while meeting food production needs, it is crucial to enhance contiguous farmland and mechanization levels, promote the integration of agriculture and tourism, establish an ecological barrier around Beijing-Tianjin, and optimize the ecological compensation mechanism for farmland. The above findings provide valuable insights into farmland utilization transformation and suggest important strategies for its sustainable development.</jats:p>"

However, food security faces threats not only from natural disasters and climate change, but also from factors like changing dietary preferences, political instability, and food fraud. This chapter provides an overview of currently available concepts related to information and communication technologies (ICTs) that can facilitate cooperative efforts, counter fraud, and enable remote monitoring. In recent years, there has been significant interest in leveraging the combined potential of the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to tap into the expertise of human professionals and enhance their work with efficient and intelligent machines. The implementation of ICTs in food systems has been comparatively restricted. This chapter aims to address this gap by demonstrating the potential of their tools in identifying and analyzing the food system.</jats:p>",

There are various clean energy sources available, and care must also be taken into which clean energy source is more prevalent in which location. Furthermore, with the multiple alternatives for such clean sources, a method has to be developed to choose the best one, and, if possible, have it optimized to produce the best performance. It is also good if the method developed only requires theories without any need of practical applications in real life (although this is strongly encouraged). This paper will show the utilization of a decision-making tool, namely the analytic hierarchy process, to decide the best energy source and which components are important and then conducts the optimization process through whale optimization algorithm. The research will then conclude with the best energy source chosen in its optimized state.

Firstly, an extensive urban building energy model is used to simulate the hourly use and geographic distribution of the heat demand for residential and commercial buildings that are to be supplied by a low-temperature district heating system. The simulated buildings are a part of a planned city district, located in Gävle, Sweden. Two building energy performance cases are studied; one where all buildings are assumed to be of Passive House standard, and one where the building energy performance is in line with conventional new-building regulations in Sweden. Secondly, one specific building is modeled in detail and simulated in the building energy simulation software IDA ICE to investigate what building heating system is best suited for low-temperature heat supply. The temperature demands of floor heating and ventilation with heat recovery are investigated and compared to conventional water-based radiators. The building’s temperature demand results can be used when designing a lowtempered district heating system which will provide the supply temperature to identify a compatible heating system technique. Varying supply temperature demand will enable optimization for choosing building heating systems and consequently, possible cost reductions. The results could be used as an example for future city district planning as well as presenting relevant heating systems for low-temperature district heating.</jats:p>"

Bu bağlamda söz konusu değişkenler arasındaki kısa ve uzun dönem ilişkisi BRIC (Brezilya, Rusya, Hindistan ve Çin) ülkeleri açısından Ağustos 2010-Aralık 2021 arası aylık veriler kullanılarak gerçekleştirilmiştir. Ampirik analizler sonucunda Çin’nin EPU endeksinin uzun ve kısa dönemde Bitcoin’i negatif etkilediğine ulaşılmıştır. Hindistan için EPU endeksinin uzun dönemde Bitcoin fiyatı üzerindeki etkisi negatif iken; kısa dönemli etkiye rastlanılamadığı görülmüştür. Rusya ve Brezilya içinse EPU endeksi Bitcoin üzerinde etkili bulunamamıştır. BRIC ülkelerinde enflasyonun Bitcoin üzerindeki etkisi uzun dönemde pozitiftir. M3’ün Bitcoin üzerindeki etkisi Hindistan için kısa dönemde pozitif, Brezilya için uzun dönemde negatif yönlü çıkmıştır. Son olarak nedensellik sonuçlarına göre Hindistan ve Brezilya’da enflasyondan Bitcoin’e doğru tek yönlü nedensellik mevcuttur. Çin içinse enflasyondan Bitcoin’e; Bitcoin’den de ekonomik politika belirsizliğine doğru nedensellik ilişkisi söz konusudur. Elde edilen bulgular Bitcoin yatırımcılarının ve politika yapıcıların M3, enflasyon ve EPU’nun etkilerini göz önünde bulundurarak girişimde bulunmalarına ve Bitcoin’le ilgili düzenlemeler geliştirmelerine katkıda bulunacaktır.</jats:p>"

Considering consumers’ preference for online review information, this paper discusses the pricing policy selection for a service-sharing platform providing vertically differentiated services in sharing economy, which is worth studying. In this paper, a platform service supply chain composed of a high-quality service provider, a low-quality service provider, and a service-sharing platform is considered. For the two pricing policies of a platform: service provider pricing and platform pricing, the profit-maximizing models are constructed, and the optimal high-quality and the low-quality service prices are obtained. This paper also analyzes the effects of online review information on the profits of service providers, platform profits, consumer surplus, and social welfare under the two policies. The results show that under the platform pricing policy, the platform can gain more profits, while the surplus of consumers and service providers may decrease. When the online review information exceeds a threshold, the high-quality service provider profit under the service provider pricing policy is larger than that under the platform pricing policy. Under the platform pricing policy, the low-quality service provider can earn more profit. We also find that the low-quality service provider is more motivated to encourage consumers to provide online reviews regardless of the pricing policy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To ensure the long-term viability of a circular bioeconomy based on native forests, it is crucial to enhance our understanding and overcome existing disparities in knowledge and application throughout the entire value chain of forest products. The objective of this article is to contribute towards this goal and facilitate the proper management of forest biomass. Firstly, a methodology is proposed for the study of biomass throughout the native forest value chain, identifying the main steps, criteria, and variables to consider. This approach is evaluated through a case study in Argentina, where over 2370 tons of biomass are wasted annually. A series of strategies for analyzing the most suitable uses and applications for this biomass are examined. Finally, some key approaches for the promotion of a circular and sustainable forest bioeconomy are identified. While it is true that there is still a long way to go before small rural economies can make a more efficient and comprehensive use of their resources (potentially including small biorefineries) with appropriate cascade use schemes, moving towards biomass energy use constitutes a practical and concrete alternative today. This proposal provides tools for accelerating this necessary ecological and energy transition.</jats:p>"

Blood culture samples are one of the most critical cultures because a blood infection may endanger the individual's life. Not only the speed and quality of the diagnosis is important, but also the efficiency in the sample’s supply chain to the laboratory and its preservation conditions. To this end, the supply circuits of blood culture samples to the microbiology laboratory play a major role in the process, being the samples from intensive care units (ICUs) among the most critical. The work presents the analysis and optimization of the ordering and supply process of blood culture samples from an intensive care unit to a microbiology laboratory using LSS methodology and tools. The process starts with the blood culture’s order generation from the intensive care unit specialist and ends with the final reception of the blood culture sample in the pre-analytical area of the microbiology laboratory. The project is structured considering DMAIC problem-solving methodology. Main lean tools used for the supply process analysis and optimization were Gemba Walk, Value Stream Analysis (VSA) and mistake proofing. After project results validation with ICU and microbiology specialists, the next steps are the pilot implementation of the process improvement measures and their impact evaluation on the key performance indicators. The development of a lean concept, eliminating the waste and increasing the added-value of the blood culture samples ordering and supply process, improves the efficiency of the blood culture diagnosis process reducing the lead-time and impacting directly on the patient.</jats:p>"

This article discusses an innovative approach to heating systems in “smart homes” based on centralized heating with the utilization of secondary energy resources using a heat pump. The proposed heating system combines the advantages of traditional centralized heating and the efficiency of heat pumps. The article presents a calculated scheme, for which a temperature chart was developed. A methodology for calculating heat loads for both the traditional heating scheme and combined heat and power (CHP) with heat pumps is also proposed, and the necessary calculations were carried out. For clarity of the obtained data, a graph depicting the total steam load required for heating as a function of ambient temperature is constructed, as well as a graph showing the steam load as a function of the duration of the ambient temperature. The analysis of the data revealed that the use of heat pumps in CHP schemes reduces electricity generation by eliminating its production in the steam flow in the condenser. This facilitates the coverage of the electricity consumption schedule during periods of low demand for the integrated energy system. Additionally, integrating a heat pump into the heating system of the centralized heating system helps reduce energy dissipation and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, making heating more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, the proposed heating system for a “smart home” demonstrates high technical and economic performance, ensuring the investment attractiveness of such a project.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold> </jats:bold></jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The principles of developing reference voltage sources (RVS) of integrated microcircuits and ways of achieving their temperature independence are considered. The existing problem of implementing a high-quality voltage source for modern microcircuits operating with a supply voltage below 1 V, the demand for which is growing rapidly recently, is noted. A typical circuit of the reference voltage source, whose temperature independence is based on the cumulative effect of using units with opposite temperature dependence, has been analyzed. Advantages and disadvantages of existing architectural solutions of reference voltage sources are considered. It is shown that the reason for the instability and nonlinearity of the output reference voltage at low values of the supply voltage is that the principle of operation of these RVSs is based on the properties of the p-n junction of the semiconductor, and depends on its so-called band gap, which for silicon is 1.25V. The temperature dependence of one \"shoulder\" of the RVS can be compensated by the opposite temperature dependence of the second \"shoulder\". But at low voltages, nonlinearities of higher orders become noticeable, which negatively affects the quality of the resulting output voltage. Another architectural solution for developing a reference voltage source using two RVSs implemented on parasitic p-n-p and n-p-n bipolar transistors, which are present in any CMOS technology, with subsequent subtraction of the generated currents using current mirrors, is proposed. As a result, it is possible to obtain a temperature-independent resulting current, and the output reference voltage released on the output resistor will have a low temperature dependence, due only to the temperature dependence of the resistance of the output resistor. In this way, it is possible to obtain a reference voltage source with low temperature dependence, capable of operating at a supply voltage equal to or below 1 V. This solution has the possibility of implementation in the standard CMOS technology of manufacturing integrated circuits. Ways for further improvement of the system are suggested.</jats:p>"

However, the question of choosing the type of heat source in centralized heat supply systems when using local fuels (LF) remains open. The commissioning of the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant and the relatively high specific cost of electricity generating capacities using local fuels tip the scales to the use of boiler houses as heat sources. However, world experience in the development and application of heating, as the most energy-efficient solution in the field of heat supply, requires a more thorough study of this problem. The paper presents an overview of the use of local fuels in Belarus and a number of European countries with developed centralized heat supply. Based on the analysis of open source data, the paper provides information on the state of use of local fuels in district heating systems of the Republic of Belarus and a number of European countries that have experience in the widespread use of solid biomass and where it constitutes a significant share in the structure of thermal and electrical energy production in relation to other fuel and energy resources. The main aspects of the energy programs of a number of European countries with the largest share of thermal and electrical energy generation using local fuels are presented. It has been revealed that the energy program of Finland is of the greatest interest for Belarus, where the share of nuclear energy in the structure of electrical energy production, just like in the Republic of Belarus, is approaching to 40 % and the energy strategy assumes an increase in the share of thermal power plants using local fuels in the structure of heat and electricity generation.</jats:p>"

In this study, we propose a mixed integer non-linear program formulation and an efficient solution approach to minimize the inequity in supply, subject to hydraulic constraints and additional constraints on hours of supply and valve operation. Further, we show that the schedule can be obtained using a data-driven approach based on flow and level measurements, which eliminates the modelling effort and uncertainty associated with the use of hydraulic models. We demonstrate the proposed approaches through simulations of a real WDN, and experiments conducted on a topologically similar laboratory-scale network.</jats:p>",

This study examines the individual behaviour of three adjacent beaches within Shoalhaven Bight, a secondary compartment on the south coast of New South Wales (NSW). The Shoalhaven River discharges intermittently into the northernmost of the beaches, and a fluvial component is detectable within beach and foredune sands. The distribution and orientation of headlands constrains dispersal of fluvial sediments, and results in lower wave-energy conditions further south, implying limited sand transport from one beach, or tertiary compartment, to another. Two years of monthly subaerial surveys across ten different profiles and modelled storm-wave conditions during the major storms, were used to compare the response of beach volume and shoreline position. The greatest changes in volume were observed near Shoalhaven Heads and the northern ends of Culburra and Warrain-Currarong beaches. Results indicate the distinct individual response of neighbouring beaches over the two-year period, in contrast to general trends in beach behavior that might be inferred from long-term regional monitoring programs. However, they also demonstrate the limitations of short-term observations in comparison to those longer-term studies. The NSW beach systems of are some of the best understood in the world in terms of regional behaviour, as a consequence of several decades of surveys on key beaches. However, more focused local monitoring programs may be needed to establish detailed coastal sand transport, and an understanding of intermittent delivery of fluvial sand and longshore inputs and outputs, within and between different compartments.</jats:p>",

In particular, the impact of the war in Ukraine on modern international supply chains and the reasons for the increase in transportation costs are analyzed. It is emphasized that the war in Ukraine due to the Russian attack led to the destruction and damage of the transport and logistics infrastructure the suspension of port operations in Ukraine, which in turn affected the efficiency of supply chains, changes in logistics routes, and as a result, the prices of goods and services. Attention is focused on the fact that the supply chain combines a set of different types of activities and is a complex business process in the combination of manufacturers and retailers at each stage of the distribution process from raw materials to delivery to the final consumer. It has been proven that the first disruptions in supply chains occurred due to the coronavirus pandemic, but military actions also had an additional impact, which ultimately created some uncertainty in the management of global supply chains and their inefficiencies. Four groups of key performance indicators of the supply chain are distinguished, namely, those related to the logistics product; with the search for information and financial sources; with transportation and pricing. It is proposed that the key performance indicators of the supply chain should be taken into account when forming a business strategy for the development of an enterprise in the context of a destabilizing environment, which will ensure success in the future. In the formation and management of supply chains, the most acute problem is uncertainty, which creates unpredictability of risks, complicates the process of their identification, assessment, development of a risk management strategy and monitoring. To support the reliability and stability of supply chains, a generalized scheme of risk management in supply chains has been developed. The implementation of such a scheme allows you to reduce risks, operational costs, increase key performance indicators of the supply chain, adhere to the environmental friendliness of business processes, and improve the level of customer service in conditions of destabilization of the business environment.</jats:p>",

The network is composed of human and non-human actors and accounts for the impact of products’ CO2 emissions and sequestration along global supply chains.  The network serves to connect people and other actors that share a CO2 indicator and allows users to visualize the level of (un-) circularity of different products through specific diagrams calculated by a CO2 estimator drawing on insights from actor-network theory. Unlike most previous circular economy accounting studies that develop some type of framework or indicator that represent measurements at micro, meso or macro levels, the circularity accounting network is not confined to a particular level of analysis but is designed to build relationships between multiple users at different levels (e.g., government, corporate or consumer actors). The paper presents the conceptual design and a preliminary test of the network using real data, helping to advance the underexplored potential of artificial intelligence in the field of circular economy accounting. The main contribution of this network is that data provided by the indicator: (i) is derived from the network itself learning from open sources, the network (ii) is not static but keeps flowing as new relationships are built within the network, moving toward self-regulating, (iii) contemplates both emissions and sequestrations along supply chains.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"es\">Este artículo propone utilizar un tipo de red de aprendizaje automático denominado redes neuronales artificiales para diseñar una red de contabilidad de la circularidad. La red está compuesta por actores humanos y no humanos y contabiliza el impacto de las emisiones y el secuestro de CO2 de los productos a lo largo de las cadenas de suministro mundiales.  La red sirve para conectar a personas y otros actores que comparten un indicador de CO2 y permite a los usuarios visualizar el nivel de (in)circularidad de diferentes productos a través de diagramas específicos calculados por un estimador de CO2 basado en conocimientos de la teoría de las redes de actores. A diferencia de la mayoría de los estudios anteriores sobre contabilidad de la economía circular que desarrollan algún tipo de marco o indicador que representa mediciones a nivel micro, meso o macro, la red de contabilidad de la circularidad no se limita a un nivel concreto de análisis, sino que está diseñada para establecer relaciones entre múltiples usuarios a diferentes niveles (por ejemplo, actores gubernamentales, corporativos o consumidores). El documento presenta el diseño conceptual y una prueba preliminar de la red utilizando datos reales, lo que contribuye a avanzar en el potencial poco explorado de la inteligencia artificial en el ámbito de la contabilidad de la economía circular. La principal aportación de esta red es que los datos proporcionados por el indicador: (i) se derivan de la propia red que aprende de fuentes abiertas; (ii) la red no es estática, sino que sigue fluyendo a medida que se construyen nuevas relaciones dentro de la red, avanzando hacia la autorregulación; (iii) contempla tanto las emisiones como los secuestros a lo largo de las cadenas de suministro.</jats:p>"

It is commonplace to find water supply infrastructure in a declining operational state in rural and some urban centers in developing countries. Maintenance issues result in unabated wastage and shortage of supply to users. This work proposes a cost-effective solution to the problem of water distribution losses using a Microcontroller-based digital control method and Machine Learning (ML) to forecast and manage portable water production and system maintenance. A fundamental concept of hydrostatic pressure equilibrium was used for the detection and control of leakages from pipeline segments. The results obtained from the analysis of collated data show a linear direct relationship between water distribution loss and production quantity; an inverse relationship between Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) and yearly failure rates, which are the key problem factors affecting water supply efficiency and availability. Results from the prototype system test show water supply efficiency of 99% as distribution loss was reduced to 1% due to Line Control Unit (LCU) installed on the prototype pipeline. Hydrostatic pressure equilibrium being used as the logic criteria for leak detection and control indeed proved potent for significant efficiency improvement in the water supply infrastructure.</jats:p>",

It explores irrigation water usage during climate-sensitive crop growth phases (i.e. vegetative and reproductive which required ~ 60% of the total seasonal (sowing to harvest) water demand), which is supposed to be crucial for long-term integrated crop water management. A hydrology vegetation model Lund Potsdam Jena Managed Land is forced with an ensemble of eight downscaled (5 arc-min) global climate model’s using the RCP (Representative concentration pathways) -SSP (Shared socio-economic pathways) framework, i.e. RCP4.5-SSP1 and RCP8.5-SSP3. To investigate phase-specific crop water projections, trend analysis is performed. It shows a significant (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt;0.001) increase in irrigation water demand during the vegetative phase of wheat (6 mm) and reproductive phase of rice (26 mm) and a decrease during the reproductive phase of wheat (13 mm) and vegetative phase of rice (11 mm) in selected study sites. The large decrease in projected irrigation demand for wheat can be explained by a shortening of the growing season length as a result of rising temperatures and increased precipitation. Whereas, an increase in irrigation demand for rice is a combined effect of higher temperatures and less precipitation during the reproductive phase in the region. At the same time, irrigation supply by surface water and groundwater is likely to change in future due to warmer and drier growing periods, causing a significant increase in groundwater irrigation, mainly for rice. Our major research findings show the importance of crop water assessments during the sensitive crop growth phases of wheat and rice which vary in space and time. Including crop phase-specific, climate impact assessments of regional and global projection will help improve the region’s existing crop-water management strategies and adaptation practices.</jats:p>",

The aim of the study is to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the food supply of the population of the federal subject (on the example of Bashkortostan) in the context of external and internal systemic challenges and restrictions. The article updates that the observed conditions for the development of the agro-food system at the national level and at the level of federal subjects are accompanied by unprecedented changes that are directly related to the emergence of new challenges, trends and threats, the active introduction of innovative and digital technologies in food of animal origin. The conceptual and theoretical and methodological basis of the study was the fundamental provisions of modern theories of the development of the agro-food market and food supply for the population, human capital, economic growth and sustainable functioning of rural territorial entities. Methods. As a means of instrumental and methodological apparatus of research, a systematic approach was used in combination with the following methods: monographic, abstraction, graphic visualization, generalization and systematization, comparative analysis. A comprehensive study of food supply for rural and urban residents of the Republic of Bashkortostan is based on the results of a content analysis of current trends, problems and strategic prospects for the development of agriculture and the agro-food market in the region. Results. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the provision of the population of the Republic of Bashkortostan with food of animal origin (meat and meat products, milk and dairy products) was carried out. The key problems hindering the development of the livestock and poultry complex of the republic are identified. The dynamics of indicators reflecting the number of livestock, the productivity of livestock and poultry in the agro-formations of the region is considered. An assessment of individual social indicators of the functioning of rural territorial entities at the regional level is given. A detailed analysis of the balance of resources (production, imports and exports) of meat and meat products, milk and dairy products, formed on a republican scale, was carried out. Practical proposals have been developed aimed at improving the criteria and parameters of self-sufficiency of the population of the federal subjects of our country with certain types of agro-food products. The scientific novelty lies in the substantiation of new provisions aimed at the effective assessment of the food supply of the population of the federal subject with food of animal origin in the face of modern challenges, threats and restrictions.</jats:p>",

This paper concerns multichannel price optimization for a closed-loop supply chain and constructs the deterministic and uncertain models. Taking a real closed-loop clothing supply chain as an example, we carry out parameter assumptions and numerical experiments and analyze the simulation results. Our analysis reveals: (1) The supply chain is more profitable under centralized policy. The company can maximize profits by expanding upstream and downstream. (2) When experienced experts give more accurate error terms, the companies can accurately predict the demand and make price decisions. (3) Raising wholesale price will not maintain manufacturer’s profits growing. Beyond the threshold, the manufacturer’s profit will decrease. (4) The channel cross-influence is beneficial to the supply chain. When other factors remain unchanged, the greater the cross price-demand sensitivity coefficient in a channel, the higher the retailing price and the total profit of the supply chain will be. Decision makers can adjust pricing in time to adapt to changes of cross-influence and uncertain demand. The findings provide theoretical guidance for each player in the closed-loop supply chain. </jats:p>",

Government subsidies emerge as a successful strategy for motivating businesses to actively participate in such eco-friendly practices. This study employs prospect theory and an evolutionary game model to analyze the transition toward carbon peaking and neutrality while promoting the expansion of highly sustainable businesses. By exploring the decision-making processes of businesses and governments regarding sustainability, we develop an evolutionary game-based decision model to assess the impact of government subsidies on businesses engaged in green supply chains. Through numerical simulation obtained via MATLAB, we examine various factors influencing the evolution of the game system between green supply chain businesses and the government. Additionally, we investigate how government incentives impact the decision-making behavior of green supply chain businesses. Our findings indicate that governmental fines can effectively encourage the adoption of green supply chains. Furthermore, moderate government subsidies incentivize enterprises to opt for sustainable supply chains, benefiting both the government and businesses. However, providing hefty government subsidies not only fails to encourage the adoption of green supply chains but also incurs costs for the government, without yielding any positive change in the businesses’ approach. By incorporating evolutionary game theory and prospect theory, this study contributes to the body of knowledge on government-supported green supply chains, offering incentive programs tailored to the real-world conditions faced by businesses while demonstrating practical application values.</jats:p>"

The anticipated research system is expected to trim down the problems of input voltage variations under overvoltage conditions in cascaded multilevel DC-AC power inverters as a result of load voltage instabilities utilizing rectified DC supply from utility supply. It is realized with the help of single-phase AC voltage supply, uncontrolled power diodes, filters, transformers and relayed-regulated logic system. It is different from the usual uncontrolled AC-DC Converter due to its relayed regulated scheme. The relayed-controlled system ensures an extreme voltage protection in the systems. The proposed research system has the following qualities: (i) it is efficient in operation. (ii) it a robust system (iii) the secondary part of the system is isolated from the supply with the aid of transformer. The following results were realized: stiff DC voltage of 72.0V across the input terminals of the cascaded inverter, THD of 4.91% that is within the IEEE standard and rectified voltage frequency of 100 Hz.

In this work, these tradeoffs are investigated through a sensitivity analysis conducted in the context of an optimization formulation of the groundwater management problem, which aims at minimizing the groundwater supply operation cost associated with groundwater pumping and desalination treatment, subject to constraints on SWI control, as quantified by the water table drawdown over the well (∆<jats:italic>s</jats:italic>), the reduction in freshwater volume (∆<jats:italic>FV</jats:italic>) in the aquifer, or the salt mass increase (∆<jats:italic>SM</jats:italic>) in the aquifer. This study focuses on a simplified two‐dimensional model of the San Salvador Island aquifer (Bahamas). Pumping strategies are characterized by the distance of the pumping system from the shoreline (<jats:italic>WL</jats:italic>), the abstraction screen depth (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic>) and overall pumping rate (<jats:italic>Q</jats:italic>), constituting the decision variables of the optimization problem.

From a financial perspective, groundwater abstraction near the island center and at shallow depths seems the most convenient strategy. However, the analysis of the optimization constraints reveals that strategies where the pumping system approaches the island center tend to cause more severe SWI, highlighting the need to trade off groundwater supply cost against SWI control.</jats:p>",

However, the existing fault location methods do not accurately locate the fault point, making it difficult for the protective device to act to cut off the fault. To address the above problems, this paper builds a dynamic simulation model of the low and medium speed magnetic levitation power supply rails to study the distribution characteristics of the fault traveling waves after a ground fault occurs in the power supply rails, and analyses the generation mechanism of the traveling wave spectrum through formula calculation. First, the difference in current between the positive and negative bus bars is analyzed to determine whether a ground fault has occurred. Second, the direction of the current difference between stations is compared to locate the faulty section. Finally, the fault distance is calculated from the frequency difference of the fault voltage at the double‐ended station. Through simulation, the method is validated to be unaffected by fault location, fault transition resistance, noise interference, and is applicable to short circuit faults caused by lightning strikes, and the ranging error always remains within 20 m. The method has strong robustness, can effectively solve the problem of protection misoperation and accurately locate the fault point. It is suitable for low and medium speed magnetic levitation transportation power supply rail ground fault.</jats:p>",

Balancing of loads in electrical networks of 0.4 kV is carried out both at the design stage of networks and during their operation. At the design stage, they try to evenly distribute the loads across the phases.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The article considers opportunities for using Environmental Performance Levels associated with Best Available Techniques (BAT-AEPL) as the supply chain criteria for the environmental and sustainability assessment of construction industry. Organisations in various countries have been using the Environmental and Sustainability Standard BES 6001 to foster greening of the construction sector for over 15 years. Key requirements of BES 6001 address major management systems of suppliers: quality management (QMS), environmental management (EMS), and occupational health and safety management (OHSMS) systems. Various researchers emphasise the importance of energy management systems (EnMS), too. Authors of this article aim to demonstrate how BAT-AEPL can be used to set auditable quantitative requirements for EMS and EnMS. These requirements cover BAT-associated resource efficiency levels, which is very important for such sectors as cement, brick and glass production. In jurisdictions where BAT concept is introduced by the national or regional legislation, these requirements cover also BAT-Associated Levels of Emissions of such pollutants as nitrogen and sulphur oxides, dust, as well as specific pollutants that might be emitted while using alternative fuel (Refuse-Derived Fuel, RDF), for example, in cement production. Finally, carbon intensity of construction materials manufacturing processed and opportunities for its reduction are discussed in the Reference Documents on Best Available Techniques (BREFs) and in some cases, sectoral benchmarking procedures are associated with the revision of BREFs. The article provides sectoral examples and recommendations for the practical use of BREFs and BAT-AEPL for setting criteria for the environmental and sustainability assessment of construction industry. </jats:p>",

This study identifies key metrics emblematic of supply chain resilience within prefabricated building projects, spanning five critical resilience dimensions: predictive prowess, absorptive potential, adaptability, inherent resilience, and growth capability. Employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and system dynamics (SD), we formulate a resilience simulation model specific to these supply chains. Utilizing the Nanchang Yinwang Village Comprehensive Housing Community Project as a case study, we forecast the trajectory of supply chain resilience over a five-year span and simulate the resilience variations in response to diverse variable magnitudes. Our findings reveal a consistent upward resilience trend over the five-year period. Moreover, the resilience stature of the prefabricated building project supply chain exhibits variability under distinct variable shifts. Of all the subsystems, the most reactive secondary factors encompass risk cognizance, logistics support level, collaboration intensity, supply chain reconfiguration aptitude, and managerial strategic decision-making prowess. Notably, amplifying the absorptive potential of resilience yields the most profound enhancement in overall resilience.</jats:p>"

Based on a monthly panel dataset, we employ seemingly unrelated difference-in-differences (SUR-DiD) to identify the distinct responses of these three outcomes both during and post eruption. We are particularly interested in examining the asymmetry in their elasticities to the shock, which serve as indicators of disaster resilience. Potential spillover effects on nearby islands are also examined. We find that the eruption resulted in significant yet asymmetrical drops in international demand, number of hotels opened, and hospitality workers hired. Our findings inform about the resilience of the tourism industry to natural disasters, offering relevant insights about heterogeneous effects depending on exposure to the event.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As one representative smart energy infrastructure in smart cities, an integrated energy system (IES) consists of several types of energy sources, thus making more complicated coupling connections between the supply and demand sides than a power grid. This will impact when allocating different energy sources to ensure the appropriate energy utilization in the IES. With this motivation, an IES energy configuration optimization strategy based on a multi-model ensemble is proposed in this paper. Firstly, one coupling model is constructed to assess the underlying collaborative relationships between two sides for a renewable-energy-connected IES. Next, the independent component analysis (ICA) method is implemented for noise reduction in massive heterogeneous input databases, which can effectively improve the computing efficiency under such high-dimensional data conditions. Also, the self-adaptive quantum genetic model (SAQGM) is built for subsequent configuration optimization. Specifically, the quantum bit representation is incorporated to reduce computation complexity in multi-states scenarios, the double-chain formation of chromosomes is deployed to diminish the uncertainty when encoding, and the dynamic adaptation quantum gate is established to successively amend parameters. Finally, an empirical case study is conducted which can demonstrate the benefits of this strategy in terms of feasibility, efficiency, and economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural extension services play an important role in promoting pesticide reduction and green production, although the mismatch between farmers’ needs and service supply in rural China seriously affects the application and promotion of biological pesticides, which has been generally ignored by existing studies. Taking 1160 rice farmers in Hubei Province, China, as an example, this study constructs a need-supply fit model of agricultural extension services from the perspectives of need and supply. We further use the logit model and propensity score matching method (PSM) to estimate the effect of service need-supply fit on farmers’ biological pesticide adoption behavior. The specific results are as follows: First, the level of need-supply fit for agricultural extension services was low for the overall sample. This indicates that the agricultural extension service supply is not consistent with the actual needs of farmers. Second, the agricultural extension service need-supply fit significantly and positively affects farmers’ biological pesticide adoption behavior. Third, there are significant differences in farmers’ biological pesticide adoption behaviors under different need-supply fit. When the level of service need-supply fit exceeds the 0.2 threshold, the positive effect of service need-supply fit on farmers’ biological pesticide adoption behavior gradually increases. Fourth, the agricultural extension service need-supply fit indirectly increases farmers’ motivation to adopt biological pesticides by regularizing biological pesticide use behavior and alleviating path dependency. Therefore, the main body of agricultural extension services should optimize the adjustment of the supply mode of agricultural extension services to fully grasp the reality of farmers’ need for biological pesticides in order to promote the application of biological pesticides.</jats:p>"

This study discusses the fairness of UGS from the perspective of supply and demand and improves the theoretical framework of supply and demand combination evaluation. First, this study analyzes the supply of UGSs through accessibility analysis and evaluates their demand from both subjective and objective dimensions. Second, the fairness of UGS is analyzed from a Gini coefficient and spatial evaluation perspective. Finally, the location optimization of UGSs is performed, which provides strategic guidance for the improvement of UGSs in Chengdu. The research results based on Chengdu City show that the travel mode directly affects the supply range of UGSs and is reflected in their fairness. At the same time, in the case of a highly dense population, UGSs in the city are in short supply; that is, the equity is negatively correlated with the population. This study provides a new perspective to evaluate UGS fairness and can be a reference for UGS optimization decisions.</jats:p>"

Attempts to mitigate risks in the absence of complete and accurate information about their likelihood and impact may constitute a significant waste of resources. Since the resources available for risk management are usually limited, firms need to know how to allocate these funds appropriately. That is, a strategy is required to determine which risks are a priority in terms of acquiring complete and accurate information. We develop a model that incorporates two conflicting terms to address this issue. The first, captured by entropy, measures the resources wasted due to risk factors for which there is inaccurate information about the probability of occurrence and impact. The second is the cost associated with the efforts expended in collecting accurate information about risk factors. To solve the model, we propose a stopping-rule algorithm. Its efficiency is verified using data gathered from a real-world pharmaceutical and generalized green supply chains. Numerous computerized experiments show that the stopping-rule algorithm prevails over the widely used risk-management Pareto rule, and that the algorithm is able to achieve the optimal solution in 94% of investigated cases.</jats:p>",

It is merely due to the huge waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from large‐scale production and complex supply chain management processes involved in manufacturing firms. Continuation of the traditional business practices during Industry 4.0 made it impossible for the manufacturing firm to commit to green environmental practices and comply with environmental SDGs. At odd, it requires novel business strategies to ensure compliance of manufacturing firms with environmental sustainable development goals (SDGs). Blockchain is an ideal technology for delivering green environmental‐related information because it offers real‐time, shareable, and entirely transparent data kept on an immutable ledger that is accessible to members of a network. These green environmental‐related information received in real‐time through blockchain technology help in the transformation of the traditional supply chain management practices into a more green supply chain management practice. This green transformation ensures business compliance with environmental SDGs and that compliance is shared with multiple stakeholders through blockchain technology in real‐time, thus approving a positive mediating role of green supply chain management practices between blockchain technology and environmental SDGs performance.

The temperature drift characteristics of the GMM, detecting performances under thermal strain caused by temperature variation in the GMM rod, are investigated by simulating the coupled fields of magnetostriction and thermal expansion with the finite-element multi-physics method to explore the temperature-drift mechanism of the ferrite–GMM current detector. The sensing characteristics of the GMM-FBG current sensor under quasi-static current excitation at various work temperatures are evaluated by simulating thermal stress between the GMM and FBG to analyze the temperature drift mechanism of the Bragg wavelength signal modulated by FBG. Even though temperature elevation suppresses GMM magnetization and thereby reduces the slopes of stress–strain curves, the steering magnetization of magnetic domains in the GMM rod tends to saturation without appreciable thermal inhibition in the high-stress region of large current excitation, while the magnetostrictive strain is still abated by the reduction in magnetic flux density caused by the thermal expansion of GMM rods. The temperature elevation can also produce thermal stress between the GMM and FBG, which will decrease the detection sensitivity and testing range of the GMM-FBG current sensor. The temperature drift characteristics of the GMM-FBG are generalized into a formula by fitting the wavelength shifting as a function of thermal strain, which will significantly facilitate designing the scale calibration for various ambient temperatures. The present researchers provide a theoretical basis and experimental guidance for developing GMM-FBG current sensors with high sensitivity and stability.</jats:p>"

In the paper, on the example of a livestock enterprise in the Nizhny Novgorod region, the modernization of the power supply system, which is powered by a centralized electrical network, is considered by integrating into it a power plant based on solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) operating on biogas. A block diagram of the power supply of an enterprise with a power plant based on SOFC and storage batteries is given. Analysis of the system operation modes is performed. For the enterprise under consideration, studies of the in uence of economic factors (tariffs for electricity and the unit cost of fuel cells) on the ef ciency of the SOFC power plant were carried out. The complex discounted costs for the power supply of the enterprise are taken as an ef ciency criterion. A methodology has been developed for selecting the optimal installed capacity of an SOFC power plant, taking into account the relationship between the characteristics of the power supply system of a livestock enterprise and the waste disposal system.

The generation and development of water hammer negative pressures were analyzed, and double one-way surge tank protection schemes were proposed. It proved that the first surge tank should be located at the initial negative pressure point, and the second surge tank should be located at the second-highest point rather than the highest point. Additionally, compared with the theoretical minimum height, there was an optimization margin for the total surge tank height, which was reduced by 21% in this study. Meanwhile, the applicability of protection schemes and the influence of the one-way surge tank number on the total height were analyzed. The total height reduced with the increase of one-way surge tank number and tended to a minimum value. By comprehensively considering the engineering investment and negative pressure protection effect, the optimal surge tank number could be determined.

Due to the complexity of urban water systems and their relevance for urban life, a holistic and integrative perspective is therefore needed to inform policymakers addressing such challenges. In this paper, Urban Water Metabolism (UWM) has been used to offer a comprehensive understanding of current water insecurity in the City of Puebla and its metropolitan area. Water inflows and outflows have been estimated using the Material Flow Analysis (MFA) method with data either obtained from official sources or simulated with the Monte Carlo method. Our findings show that the UWM configuration in the City of Puebla and its metropolitan area is effective for generating profits for service providers and water-related businesses, yet ineffective for guaranteeing citizens’ Human Right to Water and Sanitation (HRWS), a right recognized in the Constitution of Mexico. We conclude that to advance towards an inclusive and sustainable long-term provision of water, economic goals must follow socio-ecological goals, not the other way around. We consider UWM accounting useful for informing policy and decision-making processes seeking to build a new water governance based on both the best available knowledge and inclusive and vibrant social participation.</jats:p>"

Jaguar Yellow is an ornamental plant of the <jats:italic>Asteraceae</jats:italic> family. Ordinarily, farmers use expensive materials such as peat moss as a media substrate in gerbera production, in addition to application high nitrogen fertilizers. Therefore, the current study was designed to assess the yield and quality changes of gerbera flowers owing to utilizing environment-friendly inputs under unheated plastic greenhouse conditions for two seasons of 2017/18 and 2018/19. The experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates, each replicate involved 5 pots per treatment. For preparing the soil substrate mixtures, four substances were used which involved peat moss (P), sand (S), vermicompost (V), and compost (C). P + S, P + S + V and P + S + C were assembled whether with or without <jats:italic>Azotobacter</jats:italic>+<jats:italic>Azospirillum</jats:italic> as bio stimulant (Bio) addition to obtain six combinations. Results showed that P + S + V + Bio was the effective practice for enhancing gerbera plant height, leaf width, root weight plant plant-1 and leaves weight plant-1. Also, P + S + V + Bio produced the maximum values of leaf chlorophyll, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents. The differences in flowering initiation between P + S and each of P + S + V, P + S + V + Bio, P + S + C and P + S + C + Bio were not significant. P + S + V + Bio (for flowering duration and flower yield), in addition to P + S + V (for flowering duration) recorded the highest values in both seasons.</jats:p>",

A monopoly manufacturer conducts indirect online selling through retailers as well as direct offline selling. The manufacturer chooses to adopt a self-built blockchain traceability system (SBT) or a third-party blockchain traceability system (TBT). Game analysis is developed to depict the pricing decision for the manufacturer and e-retailer. The optimal pricing decisions of the supply chain between manufacturer and e-retailer for different blockchain traceability strategies are obtained. We explore the influence of consumers’ traceability awareness on the decisions of dual-channel supply chain members when adopting different blockchain traceability strategies. The main results show that when the fee paid to the blockchain service provider is low, the manufacturer will prefer to adopt TBT. Moreover, we prove that consumers’ traceability awareness, the cost of adopting TBT, the blockchain traceability technology level, and the research and development cost factor of blockchain technology could affect the decisions of supply chain members. Finally, some management suggestions are provided.</jats:p>"

Quantifying the impact of economic activities in urban agglomerations on BC and CO2 emissions is essential for finding a balance between climate change mitigation and pollution reduction. In this study, we utilized a city-level environmental extended multi-regional input–output model (EE-MRIO), integrated nexus strength (INS), and structural path analysis (SPA) to quantify the BC and CO2 footprints, nexus nodes, and supply chains of 21 cities in the Sichuan urban agglomeration (SUA) from 2012 to 2017. The results revealed that approximately 70% of the BC and CO2 footprints come from inter-city transactions, with Chengdu being the largest importing city, while the supply of other cities was greater than their consumption. The SUA has transitioned from a supply-side city cluster to a consumption-oriented city cluster in its trade with other domestic regions. The SPA analysis highlighted that the construction sector was the largest emitter of downstream BC and CO2, while the electricity supply, metal/nonmetallic manufacture, oil refining and coking, transportation, and extraction industry sectors were the main nexus nodes for BC and CO2 emissions in the SUA. Notably, the reduction in BC emissions was due to decreased indirect emissions from oil refining and coking, while the decrease in CO2 emissions was a result of reduced indirect emissions from electricity supply. This article presents, for the first time, a quantification of the heterogeneous impacts and emission supply chains of BC and CO2 emissions from economic activities in the SUA, providing valuable insights for developing climate mitigation policies tailored to different urban clusters.</jats:p>"

This study was quantitative, with a cross-sectional approach from September to November 2020. The population was 38 employees, and the sample consisted of 33 people determined purposively by considering their willingness to be respondents. We used a questionnaire as the instrument, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis and simple and multiple linear regression analysis. The results show that extrinsic motivation, including incentives, working conditions, work relationships between leaders and staff, and job security, partially affects employee performance. Intrinsic motivation, including the work itself, responsibility, work knowledge, and work performance, partially influences employee performance. Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation simultaneously influence employee performance.

Single-winner tenders receive growing criticism for concentrating on achieving low prices at the expense of the long-term maintenance of a competitive pharmaceutical industry, the security of continuous supply, and disregarding the therapeutic needs of patient populations with specific conditions. This paper aims at drafting a concept to assist the design of multi-winner tenders for medicinal products with a focus on supply and sales guarantees, price efficiency, and equity in access. The concept shall be generally applicable to all kinds of medicinal products including generics, biosimilars, and on-patent products in the out- and in-patient sector. Principles for multi-winner tenders for medicinal products are set and a number of delimitations are made in order to get rid of factors that prevent clairvoyance amid the various pricing and reimbursement systems when designing a concept. The steps to plan and implement a multi-winner tendering procedure are drafted on the basis of the defined principles. The tender should consist of planning, bidding, preparation, sales, and evaluation phases. Pharmaceutical companies shall make bids with price and quantity pairs, which shall be ranked by prices and if applicable then taking into account other factors. The tenderer shall predefine market shares to the various places of the ranking. A double ceiling shall be applicable for the sales of the winners: their sales must not exceed their quantity offer and the predefined market share applicable to their place in the ranking. The implementation of the concept will require the careful adjustment of the tender conditions to the specificities of the pharmaceutical market concerned on the one hand and to the local pricing and reimbursement system on the other hand.</jats:p>"

The analysis of trends and identification of vulnerable water supply areas is related to the River Basin Management Plans. For this end, a methodology for assessment of water resources vulnerability, developed in international projects of the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (NIMH), is adapted. The methodology is further developed by drought risk assessment. The main stages are: 1) Assessment of the climate factors and trends; 2) Evaluation of the trends in water resource alterations, under different scenarios or drought; 3) Developing a calculation scheme of the Water Management System; 4) Assessment of the water consumption and ecological flow; 5) Assessment of vulnerability of water resources and prolonged drought risk assessment. Identification of �critical areas� and the so-called �hot spots�; 6) Analysis of measures and adaptive management. The methodology is applied for Black sea region. In this report the main trends, the evaluated risks and the analyzed influence of climate change and extreme phenomena on water are represented. Emphasis is given to the assessment of the water resources and inflows to the complex and significant dams in the area. Investigations concerning the significance of trends in runoff change using the Mann- Kendall test are carried out. A trend analysis of the groundwater levels reduction according to NIMH operational monitoring data is performed. A new approach for prolonged drought assessment by integrated analysis of the indices from NIMH drought identification system (SPI, SRI and SMI), the indicators used by the Ministry of Environment and Water (reservoirs inflow and levels) and groundwater, is applied. The vulnerable areas are identified � water supply from reservoirs in cases of prolonged drought, some Natura 2000 areas, etc. </jats:p>",

A positive correlation has been established between milk yield and the level of blood supply to the udder against the background of significant variability in the values of the parameters in the works of different authors. The blood supply to the mammary gland in ruminants increases in the pre-calving period and at the beginning of lactation. An increase in the interval between milking in lactating cows and goats leads to a decrease in the volume blood flow rate in the mammary gland. Changes in the blood supply of the udder in cows and goats depending on the posture of the animal, phase of the estrous cycle, ambient temperature, time of day, and mastitis have been studied. To identify the reasons for the high variability of the measured parameters in the works of different authors, it is necessary to conduct a series of experiments with all the necessary measurements and the development of mathematical models that describe the mechanisms of regulation of the blood supply to the mammary gland. The presented version of the theoretical model, tested in experiments, qualitatively correctly explains the reactions of the mammary gland to various influences observed in the experiment and allows to study the effects of the metabolic activity of secretory cells, hemodynamics, and the level of substrates in the blood on the processes of biosynthesis of milk.</jats:p>",

In Mexico, small farms have been relatively important for national food supply due to an agrarian reform in the first half of the 20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> century, but their role has been decreasing in the last decades. The aim of this study is to quantify how much small farms produce of the Mexican agricultural supply, and with which farming practices, using the 2019 National Agricultural Survey. The results show that small farms produce 19% of the national agricultural production with similar farming practices to those of medium and large farms. When considering imports and exports, small farms produce 15% of the national agricultural supply. The production of small farms consists mainly of cash crops (e.g. sugar cane, fruits &amp; vegetables, animal products, fodder crops) and, to a lesser extent, staple crops such as maize and beans. The fact that small farms produce one fifth of the national production after decades of governmental support towards large farms suggests that they have resilient production systems. The results of this study support that stronger efforts should be made to enhance the role of small farms in achieving Mexican food sovereignty. This will not only have benefits in terms of food supply but may also have a wide range of social and environmental benefits.</jats:p>"

However, the fluvial sediment load may influence not only coastal morphodynamics but also estuarine hydrodynamics and associated saltwater intrusion. Previous studies revealed that suspended sediments influence estuarine hydrodynamics through various flow–sediment interactions. In this contribution, we systematically investigate how changes in fluvial sediment load and other climate‐change‐induced environmental change influence estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment dynamics. For this purpose, we utilize a well‐calibrated fully coupled model in which hydrodynamics, saltwater intrusion, and sediment transport interact with each other, to explore saltwater intrusion in the Yangtze Estuary in response to a decline in the sediment load, modified discharge, and sea‐level rise. Model results suggest that a 70% decline in the suspended sediment load weakens the impact of sediments on salinity‐induced stratification and thereby reducing saltwater intrusion. Sea‐level rise or discharge peak reduction increases saltwater intrusion. However, a fully coupled model accounting for sediment effects predicts a much larger increase in saltwater intrusion compared to noncoupled models. Whether this effect is important depends on estuarine sediment concentrations and therefore the potential role of sediments should be carefully investigated before applying a noncoupled model. This work highlights not only the relevance of a suspended sediment decline but also the use of fully coupled models for predicting saltwater intrusion in turbid estuaries and has broad implications for freshwater resource management in turbid estuarine systems influenced by human interventions and climate change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Self-excited thermoacoustic instability (SETAI) is an undesirable and dangerous phenomenon in combustion systems. However, its control is difficult, thus greatly limiting the development of combustion technology. Our previous works clarified how the premixed chamber length (LP) and equivalence ratio (φ) influence SETAI behavior in a symmetrical hedge premixed combustion system. On real-world sites, however, the supply structure or combustion condition in a multi-flame system could be asymmetric due to space limitations or combustion adjustment needs. This paper aims to clarify the SETAI behavior of a combustion system with an asymmetric supply structure or an asymmetric combustion condition. The results indicate that the sound pressure amplitude under strong oscillation can reach 160 dB, which is about 5% of the total pressure. The SETAI state under the asymmetric condition is determined by the coupling between the heat release oscillation and sound pressure oscillation on each side and their cooperation. The asymmetric supply structure leads to asynchronous heat release oscillations between the two sides; it may be that one promotes oscillation and that the other suppresses it, or that both have a promotion effect but with asynchronous action, thus partly canceling each other out to lower the system’s oscillation intensity. This brings an advantage for controlling SETAI, which can be achieved by only changing one side of the structure. The oscillation amplitude can be reduced by 80–90% by appropriately changing one LP only by ~20%. Under an asymmetric combustion condition with φ differing between the two sides, the heat release oscillation on each side is dependent on the local φ but not the global φ. Consequently, SETAI can also be controlled by changing the distribution but maintaining a constant fuel feeding rate and φ. The concepts identified in this paper demonstrate that SETAI can be effectively controlled by adopting an asymmetric φ distribution or an asymmetric structure of the supply system. This provides a convenient SETAI control approach without affecting the equipment’s thermal performance.</jats:p>"

Therefore, in the present study, an index called water footprint was used to investigate the link between water and bioenergy. For this purpose, information related to grain maize crops was collected in the study plains of Fujian Province in eastern China. Based on the calculations, it was found that the water footprint of maize products in the province was equal to 3,728 m3/ton on average, and the water footprint of its biomass was estimated to be 219.6 m3/ton. Moreover, the investigation of the water footprint of maize biomass energy showed that the highest and lowest water footprints per unit of energy are found in Ningde and Zhangzhou, respectively. It was also found that the plains of Zhangzhou, Ningde and Xiamen have little priority for biomass production because the water footprint of their biomass energy is less than 900 MJ/m3. On the other hand, Nanping and Putian plains with bioenergy water footprints between 1,500 and 1,800 MJ/m3 have high priority for using maize biomass for energy production.</jats:p>",

Many countries have introduced policies to support the reformulation of foods and to reduce sodium intake, mainly on a voluntary basis, but there are limited data available about the long-term efficiency of such measures. Slovenia implemented salt reduction policies for the period of 2010–2020; these policies also included the voluntary reformulation of foods with the lowering of sodium content. This study’s aim was to explore the nationally representative branded food datasets collected in the years 2011, 2015, 2017, and 2020 to investigate the changes in the sodium content in prepacked branded foods. The study was conducted with datasets collected from food labels using standard food monitoring studies and included all the major retailers. Differences in market shares were adjusted by sales weighting, which was conducted using the yearly sales data provided by the major retailers. The food categories with a major contribution to the overall sales of sodium in prepacked branded foods were processed meat and derivatives (19.0%), canned vegetables (7.1%), water (6.7%), bread (7.2%), and cheese (6.3%). Considering the available food products, a notable decreasing sodium content trend was observed in biscuits, breakfast cereals, pizza, and spreads. Year-to-year differences were much less expressed after the correction for market share differences, and neutral trends were most frequently highlighted. This indicates that sodium was less frequently reduced in market-leading products. The study results revealed that very limited progress in sodium food reformulation was achieved in the 10-year period, indicating the need for more efficient policy approaches. The study demonstrated the importance of the systematic monitoring of the food supply for the evaluation of food policies.</jats:p>"

Potential reasons of the dramatic degradation include: (a) sediment disconnectivity due to in‐channel weirs; (b) the mobilization effect on gravel of an increased sand supply as a result of earthquake‐induced landslides; and (c) sediment extraction due to intensive mining. In this paper, we study the complex interaction among the above‐mentioned factors in the Shi‐ting River, using a one‐dimensional river morphodynamic model. Simulation results show that in‐channel weirs can reduce bedload transport and lead to bed degradation that is proportional to weir height. When coupled with additional sand supply, the weirs preferentially trap gravel and deliver sand, augmenting the downstream mobility of gravel and thus the degradation. For the Shi‐ting River, the simulated bed degradation agrees well with the observation when an annual sediment mining of 16 million tons is implemented in the simulation, along with the effects of in‐channel weirs and sand supply. The contribution of sediment mining is one order of magnitude larger than the coupling effect of weirs and sand supply. Both the simulation and observation show that the largest bed degradation occurs downstream of the Renmin Weir, due to the large spatial interval between the Renmin Weir and the next grade control structure.</jats:p>",

Thus, attention has been given to urination points of ruminant urine because they contain high levels of N.

Therefore, it is crucial to know the behavior of N to boost its cycling and, consequently, minimize its impacts (environmental and economic).

During the winter 2018, the study was conducted in the Brazilian subtropics, in sandy texture soil. The application of higher doses of nitrogen fertilizer (180 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) causes an increase in the concentration of nitrogen excreted in urine and, consequently, increases nitrate and ammonium contents in the soil at the urine points. Higher nitrogen contents were observed at the urine points, since the uptake of nutrients by the forage plants was reduced due to shading of the plants, leading to a reduction in dry matter production of the pasture. The area of action/diffusion of urinary N does not exceed 25 cm from the center point of urination. No leaching of nitrate or ammonium was observed at the sampled urine points, up to a depth of 40 cm. However, the adoption of more intensified production systems (i.e., with the inclusion of grazing animals and increased nitrogen fertilization) should be conducted under conditions that provide high plant uptake of soil nutrients to reduce the risk of losses.</jats:p>"

However, less is known about the residents’ preferences and the supply–demand matching of UGS types, as well as the various ESs it provides at different spatial scales. Given this, our research establishes a research framework to reveal the heterogeneity of USG types and the supply–demand matching degree (SDM) of ESs from municipal, provincial, and national spatial scales, and examines the correlation between the influencing factors and demands of residents for UGS. This study mainly used the Gini coefficient, the Lorenz curve, Z-scores, the Jenks natural breaks classification method, Pearson correlation analysis, and spatial analysis. The main findings are that (1) the Gini coefficients are 0.433 and 0.137 at the municipal and provincial scales, respectively, indicating that the supply of UGS is more unequal at the municipal scale than provincial scale; (2) the multi-scale demand for ESs between residents has no significant difference. At the provincial scale, the area with low demand is larger than that of high demand, while at the municipal scale, the contrary is the case; (3) the SDM was in a deficit at both the provincial and municipal scales. And as the scaling-up occurred, the spatial heterogeneity of the SDM decreased; (4) the number of influencing factors that significantly affected the UGS type and ESs grew as the scale increased. Among them, the impact of age and COVID-19 on three scales deserves attention. These results identify regions with deficits and surpluses in ESs provided by UGS in China at different scales. This research also advises that attention should be paid to the distribution of UGS between cities within provinces, and future UGS planning should focus on building regional green spaces to promote the well-being of an aging society. The findings in this study would offer insights for managers to improve UGS construction and urban forestry planning in the future.</jats:p>"

Numerical simulation is utilized to analyze the effect of different variables on air supply within vertical shafts. The findings reveal that the position of the smoke front significantly influences the direction and flow rate of gases during fire development. The mass flow rate of air supply during the stable fire development stage is influenced by the geometric size and positioning of vertical shafts, with shafts closer to the fire source exhibiting higher air flow rates. To address this issue, this study introduces a predictive model for estimating air flow rates in vertical shafts. This model exhibits a high level of accuracy when compared to simulations, offering a reliable method for predicting air flow rates based on the geometric characteristics of vertical shafts. Overall, this research contributes to understanding the complexities of air supply in tunnels with multiple vertical shafts, aiding in the improvement of natural ventilation strategies during fire incidents.</jats:p>"

Despite these challenges, there is a lack of systematic reviews addressing their specific needs. This study conducts a systematic review and narrative synthesis of the existing literature on nutritional support for neuro-critical patients, focusing on amino acids that act as neurotransmitters or their precursors. We examined nutritional requirements and timing in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury, as well as energy and metabolic demands during TTM, a common therapeutic intervention in neuro-critical care. Our review aims to clarify uncertainties surrounding amino acid provision in neuro-critical patients and provide up-to-date recommendations on nutritional support for those with elevated intracranial pressure and undergoing TTM, serving as a foundation for future research and evidence-based guideline development. Key findings include the potential benefits of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) in neuro-critical care, the roles of methionine and serine, the significance of arginine in vascular constriction, the controversial role of glutamate in nutrition, and the potential benefits of selenium supplementation. We also discussed special considerations in nutritional support for neuro-critical patients, such as changes in energy demand, the influence of sedation on energy demand, and metabolism changes during TTM. Our review highlights the need for a better understanding of the unique metabolic requirements of neuro-critical patients and the development of evidence-based guidelines for optimal nutritional support in this population.</jats:p>",

Challenges in information transmission and process integration between these stages often lead to reduced query efficiency, subsequently compromising the credibility of traceability results and the flexibility of the system. In traditional traceability systems, data for multiple service recipients may be stored on a single blockchain, resulting in complex data structures and making it challenging for users to conduct effective queries and analyses. To address this issue, this paper proposes a solution: a multi-chain tracing model tailored for stakeholders in the traceability process of Agaricus bisporus. This model establishes public chains, enterprise chains, and supervision chains for consumers, enterprises, and regulatory authorities, respectively, to enhance system storage and query efficiency. Additionally, leveraging the modular design of Hyperledger Fabric, the paper optimizes and upgrades the supply chain of Agaricus bisporus. The proposed multi-chain tracing model, designed for traceability for stakeholders, undergoes rigorous validation. Analysis and application results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the query efficiency and credibility of traceability information while markedly enhancing system flexibility.</jats:p>"

These constructs were chosen since they reflect evolving SCM practices that motivate this study. Methods: We conducted a broad, structured narrative review to comprehensively address the extensive SCM literature. This approach allowed us to evaluate the current state of SCM research and offer recommendations for overcoming prevailing challenges. Results: Our findings reveal the significant impact of technological advancements on SCM operations, requiring companies to adapt and remain competitive. We envision future supply chains as dynamic networks of networks, necessitating the adoption of a value architecture concept that extends a firm’s business model to an ecosystem business model. Conclusions: Considering these changes, our study recommends exploiting uncertainty, adopting demand-driven systems, offering on-demand customized services and products, utilizing prescriptive analytics, prioritizing information flows and services, and embracing open systems with high interoperability. Summarizing these opportunities and challenges that arise with changes in SCM provides interesting venues for future research and valuable insights for practitioners.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces a novel power supply voltage adjustment strategy that can determine the optimum voltage value based on the amount of absorbed power. The novel automatic voltage adjustment technique was called inverse maximum power point tracking (iMPPT). The proposed control strategy consists of a modified maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm (more precisely the P&amp;O method). In this case, the modified MPPT technique establishes the minimum value of the input absorbed power of a consumer load served by a switched-mode power supply (SMPS). The iMPPT adjusts the input power by modifying the input voltage of the main power supply. The served loads are connected to the variable power supply via an interfacing power electronics converter that performs the automatic voltage regulation function (AVR). The optimal value of the input voltage level can be achieved when the input power of the automatic voltage regulation converter is at a minimum. In that case, the energy conversion efficiency ratio is at a maximum, and the overall losses related to the front-end power stage are at a minimum. The proposed technique can also be considered a Maximum Efficiency Tracking (MET) method. By performing the inverse operation of a maximum power point tracking algorithm on the input demanded power of a switched mode power supply (SMPS), the optimum input voltage level can be determined when the maximum energy conversion ratio (related to a given load level) is achieved. The novel proposed iMPPT method can improve the energy conversion ratio from 85% up to approximately 10% in the case of an output power level of 800 W served by a synchronous buck converter at the input voltage level of 350 V. The total amount of recovered power in this situation can be approximately 100 W.</jats:p>"

To plan sustainable forest management, it is essential to track forest resources in relation to their feasibility for wood supply. This means considering the constraints that may limit the incorporation of these resources into the forest value chain. Maps adapted to specific regional constraints and to the characteristics of specific forests are essential for performing sustainable forest management at a local scale. This study presents a methodology for the integrated analysis of geospatial data focused on classifying the land and the forest resources of a region according to their feasibility for wood supply. It produces maps of the feasibility for wood supply in an area and of the existing forest resources at a 10 m spatial resolution. This was done by integrating information about the legal and technical constraints present in the area according to decision rules. The land was classified into three classes: favorable, intermediate or unfavorable. Additionally, updated forest-oriented land cover maps were produced to analyze the feasibility for wood supply of the forest resources present in the region. It was found that 42% of the Eucalyptus spp., 48% of the conifers and 30% of the broadleaves in the study area were located in favorable areas. These maps would help in the quest for more sustainable forest management in the region and aid in boosting the competitiveness of the regional forest value chain.</jats:p>"

Conventional methods of treating iron and manganese have the disadvantage of high costs and complex control processes. A dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) water treatment system was built to remove iron and manganese from groundwater in this paper. Single-factor experiments were used to analyze the effect of discharge power, initial iron and manganese concentrations, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, initial pH, flocculant and capture agent process parameters on iron and manganese removal rates. It was found that Fe2+ removal rates can reach 97.31% and Mn2+ removal rates can reach 81.42% when the initial concentrations of Fe2+ and Mn2+ are 6 and 3 mg/L, respectively. The use of 10 mg/L NaHCO3 or 5 mg/L Ca(OH)2 increased the removal rate of Fe2+ to 99% but had no effect on the removal rate of Mn2+. It was found that the optimum treatment time for Mn2+ was different for different process parameters, mainly in the range of 9–15 min, which needs to be noted in future production applications. This work shows that DBD can effectively remove iron and manganese ions from groundwater and analyzes the removal mechanism.</jats:p>",

This trend, which is significantly transforming the labour market, is not leaving the business models of supply chain actors untouched. Today, the gig-economy model is also becoming increasingly prominent in logistics, with more and more people opting for this economic, entrepreneurial form of business and becoming freelancers. This model offers a number of advantages for workers, freelancers and employers alike. The gig-economy sheds new light on several issues - not only labour-related - but such also as: what factors play a role in the decision of the client and the contractor when they conclude an agreement to perform a service, this study deals with them. The study also explores how the benefits of the gig-economy are perceived by employers, what the keys to success might be, what competences are needed and how efficiency can be measured.</jats:p>",

The results show that: first, Bayesian optimization coupling can significantly reduce the average absolute error and root mean square error of the model and improve the overall prediction accuracy, but this algorithm is insufficient in the optimization of model extremum; Wavelet decomposition coupling can significantly reduce the outliers in model prediction and improve the accuracy of extremum, but it plays relatively weaker role in the overall optimization of the model. Second, by the prediction lengths of 1, 3, 6 and 12 h, the improved model based on the LSTM neural network and coupled with Bayesian optimization and wavelet decomposition is superior to Bayesian optimization and wavelet decomposition coupling model in overall prediction accuracy and prediction accuracy of extremum.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into modern electric grids has led to a rise in uncertain factors that must be managed to maintain voltage security during reactive power optimization (RPO). Traditional deterministic RPO methods fail to account for these uncertainties, which can result in power grid security issues such as voltage violations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven interval-based reactive power optimization method (IRPOM). The IRPOM represents the uncertainties associated with renewable power generation and load demands as intervals within the RPO problem formulation. The proposed method uses an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the RPO problem. In each iteration, the uncertain power flow is solved using the optimizing-scenarios method- (OSM-) based interval power flow (IPF) algorithm. This approach calculates the real power losses and checks whether state quantities, including voltage, power flow, and generator output, exceed their limits. Furthermore, a data-driven modeling approach is introduced to reduce the conservativeness of the IRPOM solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through detailed computational analysis on a modified IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that the proposed approach ensures economic efficiency while maintaining a low bus voltage threshold crossing probability close to zero.</jats:p>",

Objetivo: Realizar levantamento sobre os programas assistenciais para medicamentos no Brasil nos últimos três anos (2019-2021), bem como uma revisão bibliográfica sobre os aspectos éticos e regulatórios que envolvem os programas de uso compassivo, acesso expandido e fornecimento de medicamento pós-estudo. Método: Foi realizada uma revisão, utilizando-se base de dados pública, por meio do relatório de atividadesemitido pela Coordenação de Pesquisa Clínica em Medicamentos e Produtos Biológicos da Gerência-Geral de Medicamentos e Produtos Biológicos da Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, e dados fornecidos pela Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária, por meio do sistema “fale conosco” em 09 de setembro de 2022, referentes aos períodos de 2019, 2020 e 2021. Resultados: Durante o período de 2019 a 2021, observou-se que as neoplasias e doenças raras representaram a maioria dos casos envolvidos nos programas assistenciais de medicamentos no Brasil. De acordo com os resultados encontrados, os programas de fornecimento de medicamento pós-estudo e acesso expandido em oncologia possuem relação direta com os estudos clínicos aprovados pela Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária durante o período analisado. As doenças raras representaram a maioria dos casos envolvidos nos programas de uso compassivo. Apesar do voluntário participante de pesquisa clínica ter direito à continuidade do tratamento conforme previsto nas resoluções da Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária e da Comissão Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa/Conselho Nacional de Saúde, a judicialização da saúde ainda é um dos grandes desafios para o Sistema Único de Saúde no que se refere aos programas assistenciais de medicamentos. Conclusão: Atualmente existem três tipos de programas assistenciais para medicamentos no Brasil: uso compassivo, acesso expandido e fornecimento de medicamento pós-estudo. De acordo com os resultados encontrados, tais programas concentram-se em oncologia, doenças raras ou doenças ultrarraras. O Brasil não é o único país a ter algum tipo de regulamentação para garantir que o voluntário participante de pesquisa clínica receba a continuidade do tratamento após o término do estudo clínico. Apesar da inquestionável importância humanitária dos programas assistenciais de fornecimento de medicamento, existe a preocupação sobre a inviabilização da pesquisa e do desenvolvimento de medicamentos inovadores de alto custo pelo fato de que no Brasil esse fornecimento deverá ser por tempo indeterminado após finalização da pesquisa clínica e não somente até o registro do produto na Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária ou a disponibilização do medicamentono Sistema Único de Saúde. Portanto, à semelhança de outros países, torna-se importante a existência de uma lei específica que regulamente a pesquisa clínica no Brasil, de modo que se encontre o equilíbrio entre os legítimos interesses assistenciais, humanitários e comerciais que viabilizem tanto os investimentos necessários à pesquisa e ao desenvolvimento de novos medicamentos como os programas assistenciais para medicamentos.Palavras-chave: Ensaios de uso compassivo, ANVISA, Doenças raras, Pesquisa biomédica, Estudo clínico\nABSTRACT\nIntroduction: Medication assistance programs have emerged as an option for patients to have access to innovative medications that are still unregistered in the country. There are currently three types of drug assistance programs in Brazil: Compassionate Use, Expanded Access, and Post-study Drug Supply. Objective: To carry out a survey on the assistance programs for medicines in Brazil in the last three years (2019–2021), as well as a bibliographic review on the ethical and regulatory aspects involving Compassionate Use Programs, Expanded Access, and Poststudy Medicine Supply. Method: A revision was carried out using a public database, through the Activities Report issued by the Coordination of Clinical Research in Medicines and Biological Products (COPEC) of the General Management of Medicines and Biological Products (GGMED) of the National Health Agency, and data provided by Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA), through the “fale conosco” system on September 9, 2022, referring to the periods of 2019, 2020 and 2021. Results: During the period from 2019 to 2021, it was observed that neoplasms and rare diseases represented most cases involved in drug assistance programs in Brazil. According to the results found, the Post-Study Drug Supply and Expanded Access Programs in Oncology are directly related to the clinical studies approved by ANVISA during the analyzed period. Rare diseases represented most cases involved in Compassionate Use Programs. Although the volunteer participating in clinical research has the right to continue treatment as provided for in ANVISA and CONEP/CNS resolutions, the judicialization of health is still one of the great challenges for the Unified Health System (SUS) regarding programs medication assistance. Conclusion: There are currently three types of drug assistance programs in Brazil: Compassionate Use, Expanded Access, and Post-study Drug Supply. According to the results found, such programs focus on oncology, rare diseases or ultra-rare diseases. Brazil is not the only country to have some kind of regulation to guarantee that the volunteer participating in clinical research receives continuity of treatment after the end of the clinical study. Despite the unquestionable humanitarian importance of drug supply assistance programs, there is concern about the impracticability of research and development (R&amp;D) of high-cost innovative drugs due to the fact that, in Brazil, this supply should be for an indefinite period after completion of the research clinic and not only until registration of the product in ANVISA or availability of the medicine in the SUS. Therefore, similarly to other countries, it is important to have a specific law that regulates clinical research in Brazil, in order to find a balance between legitimate welfare, humanitarian and commercial interests that make both the investments necessary for the R&amp;D of new drugs, such as drug assistance programs. Keywords: Compassionate use trials, ANVISA, Rare disease, Biomedical research, Clinical study.</jats:p>"

Among the many available topologies, the push–pull converter is widely used due to its versatility, safety and efficiency. For its correct analysis, sizing, simulation and control, models that meet the characteristics of generality, accuracy and simplicity are required, especially if its control is to be optimized by means of some analytical technique. This requires models that consider the practical non-idealities intrinsic to the converter, as well as being intuitive and easy to handle analytically in a control loop. In general, the models reviewed in the scientific literature adopt simplifications in their definition that are detrimental to their accuracy. In response to the posed problem, this work presents a generalized, complete, accurate and versatile model of real (non-ideal) push–pull converters, ideal for the analysis, simulation, and control of power systems. Following the premise of general and complete converters, the proposed model includes all the practical non-idealities of the converter elements, and it is accurate because it faithfully reflects its dynamics. Furthermore, the model is versatile, as its state space formulation allows for its easy adaptability to the converter operating conditions (voltage, current and temperature) for each sampling time. Also, the model is excellent for use in model-based control techniques, as well as for making very accurate simulators. The behavior of the developed model has been contrasted with a real push–pull converter, as well as with reference models present in the scientific literature for both dynamic and steady-state response tests. The results show excellent performance in all the studied cases, with behavior faithful to the real converter and with relative errors that are much lower than those obtained for the reference models. It follows that the model behaves like a digital twin of a real push–pull converter.</jats:p>"

As the largest tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Yalong river is known for its abundant hydropower resources, and the world’s largest multi-energy complementary base has been built in the Yalong River Basin. However, prudent water resource planning is limited by the lack of long-term, detailed and reliable streamflow records over the Yalong river basin. Here, we develop an October–June streamflow reconstruction for the Yalong River, based on composite tree-ring chronology of <jats:italic>Picea likiangensis</jats:italic> from seven sampling sites. The reconstruction goes back to 1480 CE, and accounts for 46.5% of the instrumental streamflow variance during 1962–2012. This record indicates that the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation were the major contributing factors to streamflow variations. A significant and stable correlation with temperature was found over the past few centuries on the interannual scale. Projections suggest that future climate change may lead to more frequent flood disasters in the Yalong River Basin.</jats:p>",

The strains used were ABI 18/02, ABI 18/04, ABI 19/03, and ABI 11/19. An analysis of the ITS 1 + 2 regions, widely used as a fungal barcode, was performed in order to assess the genetics. The compost was packed in 35 × 50 cm plastic boxes with 10.5 kg m−2, and the inoculum was added (1% in relation to the compost weight). Before the addition of the casing layer, in half of the boxes, 25 L m−² of water was added directly to the colonized compost, resulting in the treatment of the water added to the compost. The yield, number, and weight of the mushrooms were analyzed. A phylogenetic tree for the A. bisporus strains based on ITS sequences confirms a close genetic relationship among the different collections of this species, and additional molecular markers are required to distinguish genotypes related to superior agronomic traits. The water management methods presented similar yields, except for one strain (ABI 18/04). The ABI 18/02 and 11/019 strains were more efficient when considering the method of adding water to the compost. This study suggests that the treatment of water added to the substrate is an alternative tool for reducing the application time and labor involved and as a control treatment to reduce water use.</jats:p>"

However, there is no scientific method for setting the term of water rights trading, which is generally determined through negotiation between the trading parties. In order to find a more objective method for determining the term of water rights trading, we constructed a loss–benefit model about the term of water rights trading and solved it based on the principle of comprehensive benefits greater than zero to determine the optimal term of water rights trading. First, we analyzed the benefits and losses brought by water rights trading, then constructed a loss–benefit function with trading term as the independent variable. Second, based on the graphical analysis method, we analyzed the benefits and losses of water rights trading. Finally, the optimal term for water rights trading is determined based on the loss–benefit function and combined with a graphical analysis method. In addition, this study can also help us determine the longest or shortest water rights trading term based on actual situations.</jats:p>",

This study, grounded in the platform theory and the supply chain ecosystem theory, combines the grounded theory and the DEMATEL–ISM–MICMAC model to thoroughly analyze the complex mechanisms driving sustainable development. Utilizing the grounded theory, we construct a system of driving factors comprising five primary indicators and eighteen secondary indicators. The hybrid model reveals the interrelationships, significance, system hierarchy, and dependence-driving relationships among these factors. Notably, the driving factor system is categorized into a six-level hierarchical structure, encompassing profound elements, such as policy optimization and digital empowerment, as well as surface-level factors, such as simplification of customs procedures and consumer demand forecasting. Based on the analysis results, this research proposes a set of pathways to achieve the sustainability of the supply chain. These strategies involve improving cross-border agricultural e-commerce policy frameworks, enhancing digital-driven supply–demand coordination, strengthening logistics infrastructure and transparency, and cultivating brand influence. The study’s findings not only enrich the relevant theories but also provide practical guidance for the coordinated advancement of economic, social, environmental, and resilient development. Furthermore, they are conducive to advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>"

However, the emergence of “price wars” and “free riding” between the two channels after the introduction of online channels may affect the stability of the green supply chain. This paper uses optimization theory to investigate the impact of service spillover effects and different channel structures on the optimal decision of supply chain members in a Stackelberg game. By comparing the equilibrium outcomes of the single-channel and dual-channel supply chain in a setting with and without retail services, we observe that the supplier prefers to encroach on the market when services that retail locations provide largely spillover to and benefit the direct sales channel. Contrary to popular belief, a higher degree of service spillovers is beneficial for the retailer to achieve more returns under the dual-channel structure, whereas supplier encroachment will lead to a decline in the service level if the spillover degree is relatively low. In addition, the emission reduction level of products under supplier encroachment is always higher than that employed in the single-channel structure if consumers have both low-carbon preference and a high degree of service sensitivity. Finally, we expand our discussion by introducing the carbon cap-and-trade (CCT) mechanism to compare the conditions for achieving Pareto improvement under supplier encroachment. These results can provide helpful insights for decision-makers in supply chain management to implement effective channel selection and achieve sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The present study aims to demonstrate the provision potential of regulating ecosystem services by forest remnants in the municipality of Campinas/SP, Brazil, from the analysis and weighting of geospatial indicators, considering the assumptions of supply of and demand for these ecosystem services. The potential supply of regulating ecosystem services was evaluated through the application of an artificial neural network using landscape indicators previously surveyed for the 2319 forest remnants identified in six watersheds. The findings show that the classified remnants have a “medium” to “very high” regulating potential for the provision of ecosystem services.

The diagnosis was established through a multi-pronged approach encompassing microbiological culture, mass spectrometry, and genome sequencing. The outbreak occurred in 2019 in Tatuí, São Paulo, Brazil, and the infected mare, despite displaying no clinical symptoms, had multiple miliary lesions in the liver, as well as intense catarrhal discharge in the trachea. Samples were collected from various organs and subjected to bacterial isolation, molecular detection, and identification. The strain was identified as B. mallei using PCR and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a genome size of 5.51 Mb with a GC content of 65.8%, 5871 genes (including 4 rRNA and 53 tRNA genes), and 5583 coding DNA sequences (CDSs). Additionally, 227 predicted pseudogenes were detected. In silico analysis of different genomic loci that allow for differentiation with Burkholderia pseudomallei confirmed the identity of the isolate as B. mallei, in addition to the characteristic genome size. The BAC 86/19 strain was identified as lineage 3, sublineage 2, which includes other strains from Brazil, India, and Iran. The genome sequencing of this strain provides valuable information that can be used to better understand the pathogen and its epidemiology, as well as to develop diagnostic tools for glanders.</jats:p>"

The HRAF, established by the United Nations (UN), guides state actions of signatory countries such as Brazil and makes it enforceable. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the state’s role in guaranteeing the supply and regulating rice prices, via the Minimum Price Guarantee Policy during pandemic period. To achieve this aim, data on public and private stocks from the National Supply Company (CONAB) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) were obtained and analyzed, to evaluate the management of rice supply mechanisms. It was found that state management was deficient, as the amount of rice stored in public stocks proved to be insufficient in relation to national production, not meeting intervention conditions to guarantee food security for its population. Considering this perspective, it was concluded that public machinery was not anticipated in order to avoid the shortage of a basic product such as rice, which points to a failure of the State to promote food security and guarantee the HRAF.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Ecological intensification has been embraced with great interest by the academic sector but is still rarely taken up by farmers because monitoring the state of different ecological functions is not straightforward. Modelling tools can represent a more accessible alternative of measuring ecological functions, which could help promote their use amongst farmers and other decision-makers. In the case of crop pollination, modelling has traditionally followed either a mechanistic or a data-driven approach. Mechanistic models simulate the habitat preferences and foraging behaviour of pollinators, while data-driven models associate georeferenced variables with real observations. Here, we test these two approaches to predict pollination supply and validate these predictions using data from a newly released global dataset on pollinator visitation rates to different crops. We use one of the most extensively used models for the mechanistic approach, while for the data-driven approach, we select from among a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art machine-learning models. Moreover, we explore a mixed approach, where data-derived inputs, rather than expert assessment, inform the mechanistic model. We find that, at a global scale, machine-learning models work best, offering a rank correlation coefficient between predictions and observations of pollinator visitation rates of 0.56. In turn, the mechanistic model works moderately well at a global scale for wild bees other than bumblebees. Biomes characterized by temperate or Mediterranean forests show a better agreement between mechanistic model predictions and observations, probably due to more comprehensive ecological knowledge and therefore better parameterization of input variables for these biomes. This study highlights the challenges of transferring input variables across multiple biomes, as expected given the different composition of species in different biomes. Our results provide clear guidance on which pollination supply models perform best at different spatial scales – the first step towards bridging the stakeholder–academia gap in modelling ecosystem service delivery under ecological intensification.\n                    </jats:p>"
