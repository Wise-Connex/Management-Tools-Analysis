The selected concept of the water supply system was entirely based on the system of Emperor Diocletian's Palace from 305 AD, which has not been in operation since the 7th century. The research is based on the analysis of historical data and the actual state of the water supply system of Split. The study provides a clearer insight into the process of choosing the optimum concept of water supply system, the operational characteristics of Diocletian's system and the restored UWSS. The sustainability of both the Roman UWSS and the 1880 system, which has a significant part of the aqueduct still in use today, have been confirmed. It is an example of a zero-carbon water supply system running entirely on renewable energy: gravity.</jats:p>",

However, the success of the programs depends heavily up on the immunization supply chain management including storage, transportation and handling of vaccines in a proper manner. It was therefore important to assess the immunization supply chain and logistics practice. Method: Institution-based cross sectional study was conducted from September to October 2019 in Ethiopian pharmaceuticals supply agency (EPSA) Jimma branch. Purposive sampling methods were used because the hub has completed the Woreda level vaccine transition and have better experience on vaccine management. Moreover, all staffs who directly engage on vaccine management were a respondent in this study. For the analysis of the quantitative data descriptive statistics supported by SPSS software version 20 was applied, and for qualitative data document analysis was done.Result: the study result shows that, the branch has sufficient positive storage capacity, but the available negative storage volume only covers 65% of negative storage capacity needed. Respondents were agreed on bundling practice during distribution of vaccines, Disagree on Refrigerated vehicle pre cold before loading of vaccines, whereas strongly disagree on temperature of vaccine is always monitored during transportation and availability of adequate number of vehicle for transportation of vaccines for which respondents remained neutral. The investigator has observed as continuous temperature loggers that track and record cold room, refrigerator and freezer temperature were not available to any of the storage facilities and the there is no complete set of temperature records.Conclusion: The study strongly indicates the need to improve vaccine logistics supply chain management practices, especially in the area of vaccine storage and handling and temperature monitoring. EPSA and development partners working on vaccine logistic and supply chain management should have intensify their technical and material support to improve the vaccine management practices.</jats:p>"

Many companies have yet to begin performing due diligence in their supply chains and acquiring the data they need to publish effective, meaningful stories of how their work protects their operations from modern slavery. Although many enterprise companies have leveraged best practices to deploy policies and procedures throughout their supply chains, mid-market companies often lack the resources to evaluate their own operations in the same way. This makes it difficult to provide their clients with accurate information. Solutions and best practices are emerging to help companies perform due diligence cost-effectively and efficiently. The Slavery and Trafficking Risk Template (STRT) is one such tool. It helps companies acquire streamlined data from the supply chain in a simple spreadsheet-based format, while operational best practices can be leveraged to build a comprehensive due diligence programme. Companies that provide their suppliers with compliance training and support are in a better position to create a proactive, cooperative relationship in which both organisations work together to keep their operations free of human rights violations. Data automation can allow companies that lack the resources to implement comprehensive internal programmes to mitigate risk as well as, or better than, any internally-developed solution. Supply chain data management service providers can enhance programmes, provide regulatory expertise and deliver workflow automation, allowing mid-market companies to acquire data as effectively as an enterprise, while enterprises have the opportunity to save millions on operational expenses.</jats:p>"

One of the merits of discourse analysis is the way in which it “problematizes” taken‐for‐granted aspects of organizational life, including supply chains, to show that what we assume to be natural, inevitable and beneficial is rarely quite so straightforward as it may seem. In addition, through the way in which it emphasizes the interrogation of meaning, discourse analysis can broaden conceptualizations of the supply chain to include actors that have previously been overlooked, such as employees, workers, not‐for‐profit organizations, regulators, consumers, and the media. Using examples that are familiar to SCM researchers—the discourses of lean, sustainability, modern slavery, and big data—we illustrate how discourse analysis can help to theorize SCM phenomena by problematizing established meanings and revealing how they reproduce power relations among actors. We then show how insights from discourse analysis can complement existing theories of the supply chain and, in so doing, potentially rejuvenate the field of SCM by inspiring novel theory development, opening up different empirical settings, and promoting new ways of analyzing qualitative data.</jats:p>",

Most of these studies, however, have concentrated on one or two aspects of SCV, and a comprehensive overview of SCV issues is still missing. This paper therefore attempts to address this research gap by identifying key enablers, challenges and benefits as well as empirically validating them. The paper provides evidence from the UK food sector which is scant in the literature. It also offers practitioners key insights from the UK food sector and its current level of awareness towards SCV implementation.

The perpetrator of the SME Borondong Industry is one that must be supported because it is a traditional cultural heritage which is also a superior product in West Java so that it is expected to improve the economy. Along with the growing awareness of SMEs on technology, because it is facing the millennial era, it is an opportunity for researchers to provide conceptual treats so that they can be useful for the actors of Borondong Industry SMEs. There are a number of problems that have been borne by these bourgeois SMEs, one of which is the absence of a concept that describes the condition of the supply chain of the SME industry. The aim of this study focuses on issues regarding the Borondong SME supply chain, exploring the areas that need to be improved and assessing how the supply chain performs.

Written for supply chain professionals with varying levels of experience, the paper outlines the core elements of the three phases: plan, implement and institutionalise. Key tasks in the plan phase include developing the business case, estimating ROI, overcoming objections, creating service agreements with internal customers, defining metrics and building a team and governance structure. Implementation builds on four core services essential to building a resilient supply chain: risk intelligence, risk monitoring and response, risk analysis and risk treatment. Institutionalising an SCRP requires continuous education and change management by the core supply chain team and can ultimately yield far-reaching results such as integrating resiliency into new product design and achieving significantly enhanced brand value.</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to reach the reduced carbon emission targets proposed by the Paris agreement one of the widely proposed decarbonizing strategies, referred to as negative emissions technologies (NETs), is the production and combustion of second-generation bioenergy crops in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The international research on NETs has grown rapidly and publications have ranged in scope from reviewing potential and assessing feasibility to technological maturity and discussions on deployment opportunities. However, concerns have been increasingly raised that ungrounded optimism in NETs potential could result in delayed reductions in gross CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; emission, with consequent high-risk of overshooting global temperature targets. Negative emissions as a consequence of BECCS are achieved when the CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth cycle of biomass is released in combustion and energy production and then captured and stored indefinitely. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that one ton of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; captured in the growth of biomass would equate to one ton of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; sequestered geologically- which we can regard as a carbon efficiency of 1. However, biomass crops are not carbon neutral as GHG emissions are associated with the cultivation of biomass.&amp;amp;#160; Furthermore, throughout the BECCS value chain carbon &amp;amp;#8216;leaks&amp;amp;#8217;. Some life cycle analyses of the entire value chain for a BECCS crop to final carbon storage in the ground have shown leakage of CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; to be greater than the CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; captured at the point of combustion and thus it has low carbon efficiency. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass for an active CCS industry operating at scale and a favourable policy and commercial environment to incentivise these investments. It has been suggested that the theoretical global demand for biomass for BECCS could range from 50 EJ/yr up to more than 300 EJ/yr, although the technical and economic potential will be significantly less and will be dependent on uncertain social preferences and economic forces. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. These factors are in turn determined by competing uses of land and a myriad of environmental and economic considerations. It is suggested that removing 3.3 GtC/year with BECCS could annually require between 360 and 2400 Mha of marginal land. The upper bounds correspond to 3x the world&amp;amp;#8217;s harvested land for cereal production. The conclusion is that estimates of biomass availability for the future depends on the evolution of a multitude of social, political, and economic factors including land tenure and regulation, trade, and technology. Consequently, the assumptions, in future climate scenarios, that high rates of NETs can be achieved across many countries and land types is not yet demonstrated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

We devised indices for evaluating deterioration of drinking-water distribution pipelines and maintenance management systems for the pipelines. The indices are the percentage of old pipelines, the percentage of ineffective water, change in the number of technical staff per unit length of pipe, and the repair rate of water leaks. Using these indices, the evaluation result for Japan overall was a C (Caution) in terms of deterioration and Downward in terms of maintenance management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The winner of the International Statistic of the Decade is &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;8.4 million &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8211; the number of football pitches deforested from 2000 to 2019 in the Amazon rainforest. The Royal Statistical Society selected this statistic to give a powerful visual to one of the decade&amp;amp;#8217;s worst examples of environmental degradation. Global food supply chains are the major driver behind this deforestation. As globalization has dispersed the production of goods around the world, global supply chains increasingly displace the environmental and social impacts of consumption in rich and emerging economies to distant locations. Grown predominantly in (sub)tropical ecosystems and consumed in industrialized economies, cocoa/chocolate represents the inherent transnational challenges of many of today&amp;amp;#8217;s highly prized foods. Chocolate&amp;amp;#8217;s distinct geographies of production and consumption result in forest loss and persistent poverty in places far from the immediate purview of consumers. Despite growing public awareness and media attention, most consumers of conventional cocoa/chocolate products are unable to know the precise origins of their chocolate due to its complex supply chain involving multiple intermediaries. Outside of niche chocolate products that carry significantly higher price tags, the average chocolate consumer buying a Mars bar or Reeses peanut butter cup remains in the dark about the social and environmental impacts of their purchases. In 2017, the global cocoa/chocolate industry responded by committing themselves to &amp;amp;#8220;zero deforestation cocoa,&amp;amp;#8221; whereby they aim for full supply chain traceability to ultimately end deforestation and restore forest areas in cocoa origins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The problem that this research aims to address is that despite their continued proliferation, corporate zero deforestation supply chain initiatives have thus far had only modest success in reaching their stated aims (Lambin et al. 2018). As company pledges grow in number and magnitude, deforestation continues in many commodity production areas, especially in tropical forest areas (Curtis et al. 2018). Through a systematic review of company pledges. this research brings more understanding to what precisely the global cocoa industry is committing to, and how these pledged changes are meant to be rolled out in practice. This knowledge will improve accountability by bringing clarity to questions surrounding who is meant to do what and how along the bumpy road to zero deforestation cocoa. Further, this research will shed light on the lesser known actors in the cocoa supply chain: the intermediary cocoa traders often operating informally in cocoa origins though a case study in C&amp;amp;#244;te d&amp;amp;#8217;Ivoire- the world&amp;amp;#8217;s number one cocoa exporter. As technological advancements in commodity traceability and forest monitoring reduce the perceived distance between cocoa producers and their downstream buyers, supply chain actors are forging new partnerships to reduce the climate footprint of chocolate. This research accompanies one of these innovative partnerships between cocoa farming and chocolate eating communities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;References&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Curtis et al.

The conventional, biogenic agriculture has yet failed to provide a reliable concept which circumvents its severe environmental externalities &amp;amp;#8212; such as the massive use of land area, water for irrigation, fertiliser, pesticides, herbicides, and fossil fuel. In contrast, the artificial synthesis of carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide, water, and renewable energy would allow not only for a highly reliable production without those externalities, but would also allow to increase the agricultural capacities of our planet by several orders of magnitude. All required technology is either commercially available or at least developed on a lab-scale. No directed research has, however, yet been conducted towards an industry-scale carbohydrate synthesis because the biogenic carbohydrate production was economically more competitive. Taking the environmental and socioeconomic externalities of the conventional sugar production into account, this economical narrative has to be questioned. We estimate the production costs of artificial sugar at ~1 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg. While the today&amp;amp;#8217;s spot market price for conventional sugar is about ~0.3 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg, we estimate its total costs (including external costs) at &amp;gt;0.9 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg in humid regions and &amp;gt;2 &amp;amp;#8364;/kg in semi-arid regions. Accordingly, artificial sugar appears already today to be the less expensive way of production. The artificial sugar production allows in principle also for a subsequent synthesis of other carbohydrates such as starch as well as of fats. These synthetic products could be used as a feedstock to microorganisms, fungi, insects, or livestock in order to enhance also the sustainability of the biogenic production of, e.g., proteins.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Food supply in turn depends on various types of supply rigidities in agriculture, including those due lack of modernization (despite the fall in farm size), institutional factors, adverse terms of trade effects, and lack of incentive goods in the countryside. The chapter then discusses the Kalecki dual economy model that suggests that—in a closed economy—the rigidity of food supply is a source of rising food prices and overall inflation that may frustrate Keynesian expansionary policies to reduce unemployment in a demand-constrained manufacturing sector.</p>",

The part of the plate divergence that is not accommodated by magma emplaced as gabbros or basaltic dikes is taken up by normal faults that exhume upper mantle rocks, in many instances all the way to the seafloor. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Magma is, however, more than just a material that is, or is not, available to fill the gap between two diverging plates. It is the principal carrier of heat into the axial region and as such it may contribute to thin the axial lithosphere, hence diminishing the volume of new plate material formed at each increment of plate separation. Magma as a heat carrier may also, however, if emplaced in the more permeable upper lithosphere, attract and fuel vigorous hydrothermal circulation and contribute instead to overcooling the newly formed upper plate (Cochran and Buck, JGR 2001). &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Magma is also a powerful agent for strain localization in the axial region: magma and melt-crystal mushes are weak; gabbros that crystallize from these melts are weaker than peridotites because they contain abundant plagioclase; and hydrothermally-altered gabbros, and gabbro-peridotite mixtures, are weaker than serpentinites because of minerals such as chlorite and talc. As a result, detachment-dominated ridge regions that receive very little magma probably have a stronger axial lithosphere than detachment-dominated ridge regions that receive a little more magma. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Because magma has this triple role (building material, heat carrier, and strain localization agent), and because it is highly mobile (through porosity, along permeability barriers, in fractures and dikes), it is likely that variations in magma supply to the ridge, in time and space, and variations in where this magma gets emplaced in the axial plate, cause a greater diversity of spreading modes, and of the resulting slow and ultraslow lithosphere composition and structure, than suggested by the first order dichotomy between volcanically-dominated and detachment-dominated spreading. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;In this talk I illustrate these points using results of recent studies at the Mid-Atlantic and Southwest Indian ridges.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Based on the industrial case in the area of power battery, we analyze the optimal strategies under competition, cooperation, and coordination structures separately and then investigate the influences of emission reduction effort and collection efficiency on supply chain performance. The results reveal that collection of used products can positively affect the (re-)manufacturer’s profit but has opposite impact on the new component supplier. Besides, recycling is beneficial to both low-carbon consumers’ utility and social welfare, but hurts the total profit of CLSC because of the high investment cost of collection. Therefore, the paper designs a cost-sharing contract, which is of applicability and efficiency for both economic and environmental development. Furthermore, it can also increase the profit of CLSC up to cooperation case and improve each member’s profit, eliminating double marginal effect and achieving supply chain coordination.</jats:p>",

Using both volume and sentiment of tweets, we observe significant reactions on Twitter after supply chain glitches; tweet volume increases and tweets become more negative. We also find that Twitter reactions after a glitch accentuate the relationship between supply chain glitches and stock market returns, demonstrating how social media may elevate the prominence of supply chain problems. To address concerns associated with simultaneity bias, we demonstrate that pre‐stock‐market‐open Twitter activity preempts post‐stock‐market‐open returns. Finally, we conduct post hoc analyses that explore how firms can leverage Twitter to counteract the negative stock market consequences of Twitter, and how firm proximity to the end customer may influence how tweets moderate the stock market reaction to glitches.</jats:p>",

To understand future changes in the water supply to the millions of people living downstream, a better understanding of snow dynamics at large scale is key. Using a novel snow model, forced by ERA5 climate reanalysis and calibrated by MODIS remote sensing observations, we generate daily snow water equivalent output at 0.05&amp;amp;#176; resolution covering all major river basins in Asia. We show that between 1979 and 2018 significant and spatially variable changes have occurred in snow meltwater availability and its timing, with melt peaks attenuating and/or advancing in time, and snowmelt seasons shortening. Additionally, our results reveal that snowmelt is a much more important contributor to streamflow than glacier melt in many of Asia's large river basins. In a bottom-up elasticity analysis we project strong changes in snowmelt in the future under changing temperature and precipitation. Sensitivity of snowmelt to climate change varies among basins, however, and actual losses are strongly dependent on the degree of future climate change. Limiting climate change in the current century is therefore crucial in order to sustain the role of seasonal snow packs in Asia&amp;amp;#8217;s water supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Further this study investigates the role of information technology (IT) and information sharing (IS) in manufacturing supply chain and determines its impact towards supply chain integration (SCI), supply chain performance (SCP), and manufacturing firm performance (FP) in Malaysia. The theoretical framework was proposed for the study on the basis of existing literature. The study administered a survey questionnaire to collect data from manufacturing firms in Malaysia with 112 respondents. A multiple regression analysis is conducted to establish the relationship between IT, IS, SCI, and FP. The study finds that IT and sharing has significant positive effect towards and performance. Firms that use IT and practice IS across partners in the supply chain are more likely to integrate their internal and external value chain for better performance both within and across the manufacturing firms in the supply chain. This study can be of interest to the manufacturing industry as well as other industry practitioners interested in improving the performance of the organization and supply chain in total. For supply chain practitioners, this results indicate that the firms should adopt IT and IS practices to strategically improve SCI. This in turn will also improve the supply chain network and firm’s performance. This study employs a newly developed framework which depicts the causal relationship between IT, IS, SCI, Supply Chain Performance, and FP in Malaysia. Furthermore, it closes a gap in existing literature by examining the effect IT and communication (ICT) practices toward manufacturing firms’ performance and SCP in a single setting. In addition, the current study attempted to construct a model which would estimate and interpret SCP and FP simultaneously, and to evaluate this model in an empirical fashion.</jats:p>",

The supply of micronutrients such as iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) to the ocean is now known to exert a controlling influence on net primary productivity. Fragmental volcanic material, or tephra, is enriched in such nutrients, highly reactive and regularly supplied to the upper ocean when eruptions occur. However, there are no existing estimates of the global magnitude of the volcanic supply of these (and associated) nutrients to the oceans. Here we present new data from ten volcanic provinces globally including the Aleutian Islands and Lesser Antilles to estimate depletion factors of both Fe and Mn in altered tephra. By comparing the concentration of altered tephra to unaltered protolithic compositions, we can estimate depletion factors, and thus the amount of each element supplied to the oceans via this method. Using a novel Monte Carlo approach, we estimate mean values of Fe and Mn to be on the order of 26.1 and 0.25 Gmol yr&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, respectively. These values are broadly comparable to riverine and atmospheric dust fluxes to the ocean, indicating that volcanism plays a major role in Fe and Mn ocean cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

The authors find that suitable FPIs to measure SCC for shareholders&amp;rsquo; value are return-on-assets (ROA), days-sales-outstanding (DSO), and current ratio (CR). This means that higher ROA, shortened DSO, and an appropriate level of CR could reach a sustainable supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Developments such as climate change and growing demand for drinking water threaten the sustainability of drinking water supply worldwide. To deal with this threat, adaptation of drinking water supply systems is imperative, not only on a global and national scale, but particularly on a local scale. This investigation sought to establish characteristics that describe the sustainability of local drinking water supply. We use an integrated systems approach, describing the local drinking water supply system in terms of hydrological, technical and socio-economic characteristics that determine the sustainability of a local drinking water supply system. Three cases on drinking water supply in the Netherlands are analysed. One case relates to a short-term development, that is the 2018 summer drought, and two concern long-term phenomena, that is, changes in water quality and growth in drinking water demand. The approach taken recognises that next to extreme weather events, socio-economic developments will be among the main drivers of changes in drinking water supply. Effects of pressures associated with, for example, population growth, industrial developments and land use changes, could result in limited water resource availability, deteriorated groundwater quality and growing water demand. To gain a perspective on the case study findings broader than the Dutch context, the sustainability issues identified were paired with global issues concerning sustainable drinking water supply. This resulted in a proposed set of generally applicable sustainability characteristics, each divided into five criteria describing the hydrological, technical and socio-economic sustainability of a local drinking water supply system. Elaboration of these sustainability characteristics and criteria into a sustainability assessment can provide information on the challenges and trade-offs inherent in the sustainable development and management of a local drinking water supply system.\n                        </jats:p>"

Understanding how part-time markets operate may allow better policy. Most current studies on the subject examine national markets, and emphasize demand factors motivating expansion of the part-time workforce. Although the subject of supply was once critical to discussions it has received less attention of late in part due to a faulty understanding of how part-time markets operate. Cross sectional regression analysis is performed to explore potential correlations between the number of graduating masters and doctoral students and reliance upon part-time faculty at neighboring institutions of higher education. Where previous researchers have found that institutions in more urbanized settings exhibit greater reliance upon part-time faculty, this analysis indicates that local availability of recently minted masters and PhD degrees within commuting distances of the hiring institution more closely fits staffing data. Policy actors may be able to use these results to better coordinate regional or local demand to supply, which has implications for unions and other policy actors attempting to limit reliance upon part-time faculty.</jats:p>"

We build game theory models to study the dual-channel competition between an incumbent E-tailer and other online retailers under different supply chain structures. Either the manufacturer or authorized third-party retailers can start an online store in the E-tailer’s marketplace. The results show that the transaction fee charged by the platform and the service level provided to customers play significant roles in deciding the marketplace business strategy—the E-tailer faces complicated issues when these two factors fluctuate. A pure strategy of raising the transaction fee may not always be beneficial and a competitor’s superior service level may help to enhance a rival’s sales price. In the expanded research, dual online channel competition with an unauthorized third-party retailer, which is common in the online marketplace, is also examined.</jats:p>"

Among other reasons why companies choose to go green, one major cause is that it gives the company a competitive advantage. Other reasons could be: to reduce traffic congestion, control pollution or to save transportation costs. Logistics is the backbone of globalization process but unfortunately, it takes a toll on the planet. Technological advancements have improved the cost, efficiency and reliability of transportation systems but the negative environmental impacts of transportation have generated much attention and are at the core of issues of sustainability. The term “logistics” denotes the degree of coordination and control over shipments and has become one of the most important developments in transportation. Green has become a buzz word for a range of environmental concerns. When put together, the two words point towards an eco-friendly, efficient transport and distribution system. It describes all attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities. This includes all activities of forward and reverse flows of products, information and services between the point of origin &amp; point of consumption. This paper is an attempt to look at green logistics from an industry point of view. Doing thus, it is hoped to make the industry see business sense in adopting and implementing eco-friendly measures in their colossal supply chains. A new model supported by adequate literature review has been proposed with an aim to convey to the stakeholders that there is perfect rationale in accepting modern green practices without sacrificing any of their econometric performance indicators. The method adopted is that of analysis of existing literature coupled with a proposal to enhance the efficiency ofthe existing traditional supply chain system.</jats:p>"

This study uses data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLOSA) to examine the effects of public pension on the labour supply of older people and discusses ways of preparing for this ageing problem. The study uses the Heckman sample selection model for analysing both the extensive and intensive margins of older people's labour supply. Our results show that the effects of public pensions in Korea are very different from that in other countries. It can be inferred that these differences are a consequence of the less developed social security system and limited experience from its short period of implementation. Hence, encouraging older people to work could be a way of solving the problem of relatively high poverty among the older population in a society that is likely to age even more. This is considered an optimal solution in light of increasing life expectancy, a poor social security system, and a decrease in private income transfers from children to their ageing parents.</jats:p>",

As sustainability is the key factor in production, the authors investigate global grain production, the losses along the value chain, and future solutions. Global wheat, maize, rice, and soybean production peaked at 2.102 million tons (mt) of harvested grain in 2018. Pre-harvest losses due to diseases, animal pests, weeds, and abiotic stresses and harvest destroy yearly amount to about 35% of the total possible biological product of 3.153 mt, with 1051.5 mt being lost before harvest. The losses during harvest and storage through toxin contamination are responsible for 690 mt, with a total of 1.741 mt or 83% of the total newly stored grain. Limited cooperation can be experienced between scientific research, plant breeding, plant protection, agronomy, and society, and in addition, their interdependence is badly understood. Plant breeding can help to reduce a significant part of field loss up to 300 mt (diseases, toxins, water and heat stress) and up to 220 mt during storage (toxin contamination). The direct and indirect impact of pest management on production lead to huge grain losses. The main task is to reduce grain losses during production and storage and consumption. Better harvest and storage conditions could prevent losses of 420 mt. The education of farmers by adopting the vocational school system is a key issue in the prevention of grain loss. In addition, extension services should be created to demonstrate farmers crop management in practice. A 50% reduction of grain loss and waste along the value chain seems to be achievable for the feeding 3–4 billion more people in a sustainable way without raising genetic yields of crop cultivars.</jats:p>"

Consumers want to know and consider in their decisions the environmental implications of the food they eat, and want to see profound reductions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The biogeochemical cycling of nutrient silicon (Si) in the northern high latitudes has received increasing attention over recent years. This is in large part due to the discovery of silicon limitation of diatoms over seasonal timescales, the potential role of melting glaciers in supplying a significant amount of this nutrient to the coastal ocean, and the rapid environmental changes the polar ocean is experiencing as a result of global climate warming. However, our understanding of the nutrient Si in the polar ocean is severely restricted by the lack of knowledge of the benthic Si cycling and its controlling processes, which is due to the limited number of seafloor observations in the region. In this study, we address this knowledge gap through the acquisition of sediment pore water profiles and the execution of incubation experiments on sediment cores collected from the Greenland continental margin and the Labrador Sea.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our results indicate a net (benthic) flux of dissolved silica (DSi) out of the sediment into the overlying seawater at the study sites. A new global compilation also reveals that benthic Si flux observed at our marginal sites are substantially higher than in the open ocean. This is likely because benthic flux in the open ocean is solely maintained by molecular diffusion along a concentration gradient, while there are additional processes: pore water advection and rapid dissolution of certain siliceous sponge groups, and other reactive silica phases, that contribute to the elevated benthic Si flux on the Greenland margin. This finding has important implications for existing evaluations of oceanic Si budgets, which have not accounted for any processes other than diffusion in the global estimation of benthic Si flux. Our results also suggest that strong benthic Si flux observed on the Greenland margin, combined with wind-driven coastal upwelling, could be a significant source of this nutrient to both the diverse (benthic) sponge communities and (planktonic) diatom productivity in the region. The magnitude of this benthic cycling could potentially rival the other continental inputs of Si in the northern high latitudes, as the first estimation of total benthic Si flux from the western Greenland shelf alone (0.04&amp;amp;#8211;0.27 Tmol year&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) is in the same order of magnitude as the total Si export from Greenland Ice Sheet (0.2 Tmol year&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and the pan-Arctic rivers (0.35 Tmol year&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) respectively.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

In contrast, little research has focused on the financial performance of the affiliated suppliers and customers of such supply chain leader (SCL) companies. Thus, the central purpose of this paper is to determine, from a financial perspective, whether suppliers and customers benefit or lose by participating in a SCL network (so called “financial spillover effects”). Companies that were ranked in the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 were selected as SCLs. For each selected firm, the five largest suppliers and customers were identified and compared with a control sample from the same industry. In order to elaborate on existing insights into the (financial) outcome of supply chain relationships, we applied an explorative approach with abductive reasoning, while comparing the secondary data for 224 SCL supplier (56 firms) and 168 SCL customer (42 firms) firm-years with 1940 (485 firms) and 1544 (386 firms) control firm-years, respectively. The following insights are made: First, the superior financial performance of SCLs was confirmed. Second, the financial performance of suppliers and customers showed superior liquidity and activity ratios but inferior profitability ratios.

The resultant coastal dune morphology is, in turn, key to achieve maximum efficiency of nature-based solutions that plan the construction of such aeolian features. Therefore, developing approaches that integrate key processes becomes crucial, especially in order to efficiently design and test solutions that meet the timescale requirements of coastal management. The process-based XBeach-Duna model has been developed to integrate nearshore, aeolian and ecological processes across the beach-dune profile, thus allowing long-term simulation of complex coastal features and feedbacks. Here, we explore the potential of this coupled modelling solution to simulate the morphological response of coastal dunes to changes in sediment supply and vegetation cover over decadal timescales. Simulations show the capacity of the approach to reproduce the natural response to changes in sediment supply, shifting the shoreline position and simultaneously modifying the overall shape of the dune, within a range of dimensions that are in agreement with observations. In general, narrow and low dunes are formed under high supply conditions, wide and high dunes develop if sediment supply is low and the shoreline position stable, while narrower and higher dunes are created after a relative drop in sediment supply that induces a negative budget. Denser vegetation coverage, on the other hand, favours taller dune morphologies, however the influence of sediment supply and receding shoreline positions to plant growth are non-linear and, in turn, produce feedbacks that cascade to the morphology of the dune itself. These results demonstrate the capacity of the approach to reproduce different dune states, resulting from alternative evolutionary pathways, and its potential to identify coastal dune (in)stability domains and critical morphological shifts, factors that are key to better understand the efficiency of dunes as nature-based solutions for coastal management.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This work was supported by the project PTDC/CTA-GFI/28949/2017, funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Water embedded in food and other goods consumed within cities, or the pollution caused by their production is generally not assessed as part of urban water system sustainability. However, indirect feedbacks can produce negative impacts (e.g., drought and water quality impairments) resulting from these water and ecological footprints. We therefore suggest that, within the context of nexus thinking, embedded water and ecosystem impacts should be part of urban water governance considerations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We quantify the local and global sustainability of urban water supply systems (UWSS) based on the performance of local sustainable governance and the size of global water and ecological footprints. Building on prior work on UWSS security and resilience, we develop a new framework that integrates security, resilience, and sustainability to investigate trade-offs between these three distinct and inter-related dimensions. Security refers to the level of services, resilience is the system&amp;amp;#8217;s ability to respond to and recover from shocks, and sustainability refers to the long-term viability of system services. Security and resilience are both relevant at local scale (city and surroundings), while for sustainability cross-scale and -sectoral feedbacks are important. We apply the new framework to seven cities selected from diverse hydro-climatic and socio-economic settings on four continents. We find that UWSS security, resilience, and local sustainability coevolve, while global sustainability correlates negatively with security. Approaching these interdependent goals requires governance strategies that balance the three dimensions within desirable and viable operating spaces. Cities outside these boundaries risk system failure in the short-term, due to lack of security and resilience, or face long-term consequences of unsustainable governance strategies. Our findings have strong implications for policy-making, strategic management, and for designing systems to operate sustainably at local and global scales, and across sectors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;The corresponding article was accepted for publication in Environmental Research Letters on Jan. 15, 2020.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

They are indispensable in urban hydrology, both for characterizing drinking water resources and for evaluating changes within a complex water system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Slovenia, the majority of the population is supplied with drinking water from groundwater. In Ljubljana, the capital city of Slovenia, groundwater represents the main drinking water resource. &amp;amp;#160;Therefore, the knowledge and understanding of the groundwater vulnerability is important for the protection and management of water resources. In Ljubljana, the water is supplied through the central water system (WSS), more than 1.000 km long, according to the legislation and the latest standards from five different wellfields (Kle&amp;amp;#269;e, Hrastje, Brest, Jar&amp;amp;#353;ki prod and &amp;amp;#352;entvid). Despite the established water protection areas, the water supply areas are exposed to the pressures of urbanization, industry, transport, agriculture and old environmental burdens, which are often unknown.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the past, various short-term isotopic studies have been conducted and the Ljubljansko polje and Ljubljansko barje aquifers were characterized. In addition, the sources, paths and interactions of water were determined and the obtained data were used to improve the conceptual model.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;However, isotopic studies of water circulation in the drinking water supply system (WSS), which would cover the simultaneous characterization of water sources and changes within the WSS, have not been performed so far. In order to assess the usefulness of isotopes more systematically, we performed the first more detail sampling of water from WSS of Ljubljana in autumn 2018. Sampling was carried out at 103 locations that were selected according to the type of facility in the WSS (i.e. 41 wells, 7 joint exits from water pumping station, 22 water reservoirs, 2 &amp;amp;#160;water treatment locations, 13 fountains, and 19 taps) and according to 9 different WSS areas. Additional samples were collected on River Sava, important infiltration source of groundwater, and at outflow from Ljubljana central wastewater treatment plant. This contribution focuses on presentation of changes of different parameters (i.e. temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, total alkalinity, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;H and &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;13&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C) in WSS of Ljubljana.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Majority of papers treat the issue from the hydrocarbon market perspective, but this research focuses on the coal market broken into two specific market segments: heating and electricity production. Using the case of Poland as an example, we conduct a cointegration analysis between the coal and natural gas markets. The study uses monthly data from 2011 until the beginning of 2019. Our results show that the Polish electricity sector is more connected to the international coal market than it is to the natural gas market, while the heating sector, despite using insignificant quantities of imported coal, is more connected to the natural gas market. Hence, energy security—in its price dimension—in those two market segments differs. This situation has important policy implications. First, energy policy should take this difference into account, and second, such variation implies that different market tools should be used in those market segments.</jats:p>"

I provide an analysis of the accountancy regime used by planning authorities in England to evidence a 5-year supply of housing land. Drawing on the work of Michel Callon on market framing, I assess the activities of economic agents in performing or ‘formatting’ this supply, its boundaries, externalities and rules of operation. I evidence the effect of this formatting in normalising the treatment of land as a financial asset and in orienting the statutory regulation of land supply to the provision of opportunities for the capture of increased ground rent at a cost to the delivery of new homes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Transregional Ecosystem Service (ES) flows are ubiquitous and are receiving more attention in an increasingly metacoupled world. Water has typical flow properties and is a common flow medium of Water-related Ecosystem Services (WES), such as water supply, water conservation, etc. Ningxia is in a transition zone from semi-arid to arid areas of the Yellow River basin of China. Its role in the water transfer from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the downstream city and agriculture is important in allocating the scarce water resources in (semi-)arid regions. This study described the water flow process to/from Ningxia and revealed the supply-demand balance of water in Ningxia and its adjacent basins. On the grid scale, the total dynamic residual water in Ningxia from 2000 to 2015 was 2.20&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;12&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;~6.26&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;12&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. However, there was still a dynamic water demand gap of -72.25&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; ~ -59.08&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, which could only be supplemented by manual water intake. At the regional scale, Ningxia had two sides, which was both the beneficiary of the upper Xiaheyan basin, Qingshui River - Kushui River basin, Xiaheyan - Shizuishan basin, Hexi Inland River-Shiyang River basin, Hexi Inland Rive-Hexi desert basin and internal flow area, and the supplier of the downstream Shizuishan - Hekou town, Longmen to Sanmenxia subbasin. As the benefitting district, the total net inflow water supply service in the supply area from 2000 to 2015 was 135.86&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;~ 294.22&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, among which the non-Ningxia region in the sub-basin above the Xiaheyan basin was the main source region of water supply service in Ningxia. As the supply area, the net outflow volume of water supply service in Ningxia from 2000 to 2015 was 72.83&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;~200.46&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, mainly flowing to non-Ningxia regions from Shizuishan to Hekou town. Overall, the net volume of water supply service flowing into Ningxia from 2000 to 2015 ranged from 63.03&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to 93.76&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;8&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. This study can enhance the understanding of trans-boundary telecoupling relationship of WES in Ningxia and contribute to form a foundation for interregional management and allocation of WES in (semi-)arid regions to promote equity in sustainable regional development.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background: Pharmacists as the trustee of pharmacy services must adhere to ethical principles and evaluate their professionalism. Pharmacists may sometimes show different unethical behaviors in their interactions, so it is essential to understand these behaviors. The present study aimed to determine the challenges of ethical behaviors based on a deontological approach in the area of drug supply in pharmacies.Methods: This qualitative content analysis study was conducted in Kerman in 2018. A range of key players in the field of medication supply were selected by snowball sampling to be interviewed. An effort was made to select samples with maximum variation. Exclusion criteria were; having less than 3 years of experience in pharmacy and supervision, not willing to participate in the interview, and canceling the interview for 3 times. The participants in this study consisted of pharmacy technicians (n=5), patients (n=6), pharmacists (n=8), inspectors of insurance companies (n = 4) and inspectors of food and drug administration (n = 3). Data were analyzed by MAXQDA- 10 software using guided content analysis. The principles of “Beauchamp and Childress Ethics” theory including autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice were selected as the main principles. Results: Data analysis in this study revealed 8 main categories and 26 subcategories. The main categories included; patient privacy, patient independence, communication principles, patient-centered services, drug supplier, patient harm avoidance, supervision, and distributive, procedural and interactive justice. These categories also had some subcategories, including increasing patient awareness, culturizing prescription and rational drug use, confidentiality and privacy, and pharmacist-patient relationship/communication, which were the biggest ethical challenges in the area of drug supply at pharmacies. Conclusions: According to the deontological approach, two principles of autonomy and beneficence had the greatest challenges. The emphasis of policymakers in health care system should be on patient independence, patient privacy, and patient-centered services. The results of this study can be used as a tool for introducing ethical challenges to policymakers and developing educational contents, charter of professional ethics in pharmacies, and measures of pharmacy accreditation.</jats:p>"

One of the greatest challenges of our times is unemployment. Job creation in the 21st century has been inhibited by the recent global economic meltdown, the unprecedented rise in automation and absence of a framework to reconcile labour demand with labour supply even as skills and nature of jobs undergo fast paced change.The current global scenario of growing unemployment blues poses a tremendous threat to inclusive global economic growth. Political eco-systems have shown inclination towards protectionism in major world economies, propelled by the idea that immigration reduces the number of available jobs. However, in this paper we identify skill gap, lack of industry-academia partnership and absence of life-long learning opportunities as key detriments to employment opportunities in the knowledge economy. We try to elucidate the process of disrupting unemployment in an era marked by constant change and uncertainty for most economies. We suggest re-engineering of job creation methods and restructuring of labour supply chains as two possible solutions to it.</jats:p>"

Survey data collected based on responses from 119 managers in the Sri Lankan apparel-manufacturing sector was analyzed using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. We observed that the practices conducted by apparel manufacturers ensuring the social sustainability of the human factor inside the company (Internally influencing Social Sustainability Practices-ISSP) and in society (Externally Influencing Social Sustainability Practices-ESSP) create a positive impact on the economic performance. However, the effect produced by ISSP was higher compared to the ESSP.

Although characterized by small vertical scales, these tightly wind-related phenomena corresponds to coherent structures up to the large-scale where they can impact air-sea exchanges of heat, water and chemical species. Another phenomenon that can impact global air-sea exchanges is the freshwater lenses produced by rain. Rain freshens and cools the ocean surface, as raindrops temperature is usually lower than surface temperature. The induced negative salinity anomaly enables surface cold anomalies to be sustained and further cooled down by surface fluxes after rain has ceased.

The work aims to extend the dataset provided to an Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in order to achieve a higher accuracy in anomaly detection. Thus, along with typical data provided to an IDS, such as network traffic, transmitted packets, CPU usage, etc., it is proposed to include information regarding the device’s physical state and behaviour such as its power consumption, the supply current, the emitted heat, etc. Awareness of the typical operation of a smart device in terms of operation and functionality may prove valuable, since any deviation may warn of an operational or functional anomaly. In this paper, the deviation (either increase or decrease) of the supply current is exploited for this reason. This work aimed to affect the intrusion detection process of IoT and proposes for consideration new inputs of interest with a collateral interest of study. In parallel, malfunction of the device is also detected, extending this work’s application to issues of reliability and maintainability. The results present 100% attack detection and this is the first time that a low-cost security solution suitable for every type of target devices is presented.</jats:p>"

However, ensuring a green supply is a tough task since food companies do not always have full information of their suppliers’ efforts in improving their green performance. This information asymmetry issue will lead the food producers to make poor decisions and cause a profit loss. Therefore, to fill this research gap, this study investigates a two-stage supply chain, which consists of one dominated food producer and a food supplier who has private knowledge of its green food material producing (GFMP) cost. To figure out how green performance is the major parameter that influences the decision-making of supply chain members under information asymmetry, this study first expands demand functions for both a food supplier and a producer, considering their influence on the green degree of the food products and associated consumer acceptance. It is found that under certain conditions, information sharing will improve the supplier’s green performance and increase the food producer’s profit. This study then presents the prerequisite of green cost information sharing by the food supplier. Furthermore, a newly designed menu of contracts, which combine the wholesale price contract and cost sharing contract, is proposed for the asymmetric information case to incentivize the food supplier to disclose the green effort information and improve the environmental and economic performance of the food supply chain. Numerical experiments are conducted through a case analysis to illustrate and validate the proposed models.</jats:p>"

In spite of this privilege, increased demand for improved facilities and the need for the introduction of innovative and competitive programmes, coupled with intense competition from their private counterparts have increased the pressure on these universities to either innovate or risk being crowded out from the market. The purpose of the paper is to investigate branding strategies adopted by public universities and their effects on meeting stakeholder expectations. The study analysed branding strategies of six public universities in Ghana. The findings revealed that most public universities’ branding strategies focused mainly on improvement of physical infrastructure; the provision of state-of-the-art laboratories; broad band internet services; the introduction of market driven programmes; the mounting of huge signposts and pull-up banners among others. Indeed, the research revealed that the ultimate goal of branding these institutions is to be able to appeal to prospective students and attract well-qualified and competent faculty members. However, further findings point to the fact that little attention is paid to perhaps the most important stakeholders - the students, who according to the extant literature serve as major stakeholders and brand ambassadors for these institutions. This study is significant because it brings to the fore essentials of branding and brand strategies appropriate to academic institutions and also re-orient educational authorities about the importance to rethinking the educational supply chain from the upstream through the midstream or the institutions through the downstream.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management is closely related to the application efficiency of PC, but only in the last three years has this interdisciplinary research received due attention. The prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) have not received enough attention. Especially recently, the related literature shows explosive growth. This paper adopted the method of systematic literature review through the tool of bibliometric statistics. And we reviewed 152 articles from 2001 to 2018, with the goal of understanding the current situation, trends, and gaps in PCSCM research, and a framework is proposed to promote its development. First, the study discussed the four themes of clustering, concentrating mainly on strategic research and project evaluation, PC supply chain process design and optimization, supply chain integration and management, and the application of advanced technology. Then, the research gaps and conceptual development framework to promote PCSCM were reported. Only through the coordinated development of technology, market circumstances, and decision-making level of participants, can the PCSC form an integrated whole, so as to optimize the efficiency and sustainability of prefabricated construction industry and improve its level.</jats:p>"

By backward induction and sensitivity analysis, this study analyzed optimal strategies of green supply chain under various modes, and we discuss how the government subsidy coefficient affects the optimal decision of a green supply chain. The results show that, firstly, whether the government subsidizes the manufacturers or the consumers, the wholesale price offered by the manufacturer is directly proportional to the subsidy coefficient under the two power structures. Secondly, when the government subsidizes the manufacturer, the carbon-emission level and the retail price are inversely proportional to the subsidy coefficient under the manufacturer leader; the carbon-emission level and the retail price are all directly proportional to the subsidy coefficient under the retailer leader.

The article reviews the mechanism for harmonizing the economic and social interests of various entities of the food market in the organization of food supply to the population.\nObjectives. The aim is to improve the theoretical framework and develop a scientifically sound approach to assessing the balance of food supply to the population.\nMethods. The study employs a unique approach to examining the balance of food supply from the perspective of three structural and consistently interconnected elements, i.e. a phenomenon, a process and a condition. It provides an interpretation of each element, methods of evaluation, based on structural division of indicators into the balanced, exceeding the balance, and below the specified level. These indicators are differentiated into seven functional groups (from minimal to maximum balance).\nResults. The paper gives a comparative assessment of the level of balance of food supply in the UK, France, Czech Republic, Latvia, and Russia, and the definition of priority areas for the agricultural sector development in these countries.\nConclusions. The proposed approach enables not only a refreshing perspective on the problem of achieving a balanced food supply, but it can also form a basis of the organizational and economic mechanism of changes in this area, as takes into account the impact on food supply of not only economic, but also social factors that consider the specifics of a particular State. The findings of the study can be used by agribusiness authorities to make practical decisions in the food sector and to adjust directions of its development.</jats:p>",

In particular, in the cities of developing countries, where intrusion through leaky pipes are more prevalent and the sanitation systems coverage is low, contaminated water can be a public health hazard. Although countries using intermittent water supply systems aim to change to continuous water supply systems—for example, Kampala city is targeting to change to continuous water supply by 2025 through an expansion and rehabilitation of the pipe infrastructure—it is unlikely that this transition will happen soon because of rapid urbanisation and economic feasibility challenges. Therefore, water utilities need to find ways to supply safe drinking water using existing systems until gradually changing to a continuous supply system. This study describes solutions for improving water quality in Mukono town in Uganda through a combination of water quality monitoring (e.g., identifying potential intrusion hotspots into the pipeline using field measurements) and interventions (e.g., booster chlorination). In addition to measuring and analyses of multiple chemical and microbial water quality parameters, we used EPANET 2.0 to simulate the water quality dynamics in the transport pipeline to assess the impact of interventions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Parameterization of glacier sliding-laws remains a large source of uncertainty in modeling glacier and ice-sheet flow, requiring validation with experimental and observational data. In the case of ice flowing over a till-free, step-shaped bed, theory predicts bed resistance is independent of glacier sliding speed &amp;amp;#8211; a &amp;amp;#8220;rate neutral&amp;amp;#8221; sliding-law (e.g., Iken, 1981). However, experimental simulation of this system resulted in a notable anti-correlation between sliding speeds and bed resistance &amp;amp;#8211; a &amp;amp;#8220;rate weakening&amp;amp;#8221; sliding-law &amp;amp;#8211; that may give rise to basal seismicity (Zoet &amp;amp; Iverson, 2016). To investigate this discrepancy, we conducted a seismic field campaign on Saskatchewan Glacier, which is thought to have a stepped bed like those observed in adjacent glacier forefields. The campaign included a dense, 32 seismometer deployment during the middle of the 2019 melt season, complemented by continuous meteorologic, hydrologic, and GPS observations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Visual and automated characterization of collected seismic data indicate abundant seismicity near the glacier&amp;amp;#8217;s bed. Basal seismicity clusters down-flow from an active moulin and a crevassed region likely connected to the bed. Rates of basal seismicity show a strong diurnal signal, consistently occurring 0.5-4 hours after peak surface melting and subglacial discharge, and continuous GPS data indicate temporary ice-flow acceleration during at least two diurnal seismic cycles. Spikes in seismic rate are also observed during most rain events with shorter response-times than diurnal cycles. The diurnal basal seismic cycle was interrupted by two periods of relative quiescence. The first lasted six days, initiating as mean air temperatures and peak daily subglacial discharge rose, and concluding after mean air temperatures and peak discharge declined. The second lasted one day following an abrupt drop in air temperature and was concurrent with reduced subglacial discharge.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We postulate that rapid surface water delivery to the bed strongly influences basal water pressure near delivery points, triggering bursts of seismicity on parts of Saskatchewan Glacier&amp;amp;#8217;s bed. Elevated rates of basal seismicity follow peak hydrologic flux through the subglacial drainage system, indicating that stick-slip motion likely occurs as water pressures fall from a transient. Some seismicity is accompanied by temporary acceleration of the glacier, consistent with results from Zoet &amp;amp; Iverson (2016). The six day period of relative quiescence may reflect reorganization of the subglacial hydrologic system into a more efficient drainage network in seismogenic regions, thus damping water pressure transients. Conversely, the one day quiescent period was likely the result of limited surface-water supply. We propose that temporary transitions from stable to stick-slip sliding occurred when basal water pressure exceed a critical threshold on parts of the bed, as modulated by surface-water supply and subglacial drainage efficiency.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Iken, A.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Available Soil Water Capacity (AWC) is standard data in most soil databases and expresses soil water contents in the rootzone between field capacity (FC;-33 kPa) and permanent wilting point (WP; -1500 kPa). Literature suggests that increasing the content of soil organic matter (SOM) of a given soil does not significantly increase AWC and this has important implications when estimating soil moisture supply to crops and evaluating the potential for climate mitigation. For most crops, the real FC values vary between -10 and -50 kPa in different soils and WP values between -800 and -1500 kPa. Thus standard values for AWC of FC and WP do not represent field conditions in many soils. When exploring AWC for six Italian soil series, ranging from clay to sandy, AWC values at increasing %SOM were lower in clay soils and higher in sand as compared with actual conditions, which could be explained by considering the shape of the corresponding moisture retention curves. Rather than focus on static AWC values to define moisture supply to plants, real or actual soil moisture supply capacities (MSC) can be obtained by dynamic modeling of the soil-water-atmosphere-plant system, including a &amp;amp;#8220;sink-term&amp;amp;#8221; indicating a continuous relation between water uptake and negative pressure head of soil water and evaporative demand. Also, only models allow exploration of the effects of future severe IPCC climate scenario RCP 8.5. Thus, studying MSC for the six Italian soil series showed that MSC values were: (i) on average 30% higher than the corresponding AWC; (ii) distinctly different for the six soils; (iii) affected by declines of 1-9% as a result of the effects of future climate scenarios.; (iv) not significantly affected by increases of %SOM when considering climate change, except for the sand. Generalizations as to the effect of future climate scenarios and %SOM on MSC can only be realistic when modeling is performed for soil series in different climate zones.

The last decade or so has seen an abundance of research which focuses on debris-covered glacier dynamics and supraglacial processes, such as ice-cliff back wasting and the development of supraglacial ponds. However, far fewer studies have focussed on improving understanding of debris supply to these systems over short- (months-years) or long (centennial-millennial) timescales. Existing work has attempted to quantify headwall erosion by calculating the ratio of supraglacial debris flux (the product of debris thickness and supraglacial velocity) to the headwall catchment area. Whilst these studies provide estimates of headwall erosion rates over long timescales, they are unable to capture subtle (or extreme) spatial and temporal variations in debris supply that operate over shorter timescales. Capturing this variation is important because it will allow predictions of the spatial distribution and volume of debris layers on debris-covered glaciers, which in turn will increase the accuracy of ablation modelling and future melt predictions for these systems. To quantify such variability, we conducted terrestrial LiDAR surveys of potential debris slopes at Miage Glacier, Italy, between July &amp;amp;#8211; September 2019. We acquired &amp;gt; 1.8 billion 3D points per catchment survey covering an approximate slope area of 7.7 km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, which supplies debris to ~33% of the glacierised area. Sequential 3D point clouds were co-registered using iterative closest point adjustment. Vegetated surfaces were automatically detected using the CloudCompare plugin CANUPO and removed from further analysis. The M3C2 change detection algorithm was used to calculate 3D change normal to the surface plane, and a 95&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;th&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; percentile confidence interval was applied to eliminate non-significant change. Connected components analysis was used to identify discrete rockfall events, estimate their dimensions, explore their magnitude-frequency and quantify their spatial distribution. We find at least one large failure which developed over a period of two weeks (validated by in situ time-lapse footage) and comprised an estimated volume of around 1 x 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. This particular failure occurred from a recently (&amp;lt;10 years) deglaciated slope, lending support to the theory that large-scale slope response to glacial erosion can be rapid.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Deltas are home to hundreds of millions of people worldwide and form a key part of many coastal environments. Due to their low elevation, many deltas are threatened by sea level rise as well as direct human influences on flow and subsidence. Added to this, the volume of sediment exported by rivers to the coast has been reduced by around 1.4 billion tons per year, starving deltas of the building material needed to construct and maintain their valuable subaerial land in the face of these challenges. The calibre and cohesivity of sediment have both been shown to be important factors in determining the erosion, deposition and stability regimes within a delta system. However, it has not yet been shown how the qualities of river and substrate sediment affect how resilient deltas are to sediment reduction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study uses numerical modelling to investigate how the cohesivity of incoming river sediment and the erosion resistance of the delta&amp;amp;#8217;s substrate affect how deltas respond to a reduction in supplied sediment. Delft3D was used to create a series of stable deltas with varying fluvial and basal sediments, that where then exposed to sediment reduction. The loss of land area, change in channel geometry and other metrics where extracted from model output using Matlab to assess the effects of this sediment reduction, and how these effects varies between deltas.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With environmental problems becoming severe, many firms, including HP, Huawei, and Apple are simultaneously implementing trade-in programs and advertising to stimulate market demand. Offering trade-in service by the manufacturer is a method of price discrimination by providing replacement consumers with a rebate when they purchase new products. With the recycled, used products, the manufacturer can benefit through a strict series—via a remanufacturing process. Although numerous literatures have investigated the pricing strategy and advertising decisions in the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), to the best of our knowledge, there is little research that analyzes and compares the economic and social performance of these two marketing strategies. To fill this gap, we establish two supply chain models with two periods, namely, an advertisement model and a joint model, while the equilibrium purchasing behavior of the replacement consumers can be characterized under three conditions: (1) all of the replacement consumers purchasing new products (ATA); (2) partial replacement consumers purchasing (PTA); (3) no replacement consumers purchasing (NTA). These three conditions are decided by the numerous relationships of the parameters. Solving the optimal decisions of the manufacturer in both models, the critical value in the joint model is higher in the advertisement model, which indicates that developing the trade-in program can enhance the robustness of the business model. Furthermore, through numerical example, we find that the market demand in the joint model is higher than in the advertisement model, and the cost of marketing strategy in the joint model is lower in the advertisement model, which means that the efficiency of the marketing strategy is higher than the single marketing strategy. As a result, comparing the economic and social performance between the two models, we conclude that the advertisement elasticity of the market demand is the key factor of the manufacturer’s profits and total social welfare.</jats:p>"

In the process of the natural development of food security system Alexander I ordered to create supply funds in 1822. Supply funds are the sums of money accumulated at the expense of the population to provide in the event of a crop failure and possible following famine. The article examined the supply funds of the Arkhangelsk province from 1871 to 1917 as a part of the food safety system of the Russian Empire. The study is based on archival data from the Russian State Historical Archive. The research identified that although the full provision of the population of the Arkhangelsk province with supply funds for the study period (45 years) was observed only in 14 cases, the variability of money collection over the years was reflected in the average indicator of the collection of supply funds, which amounted to more than 100 %. It can be argued that, for the most part, supply funds would have allowed the administration of the Arkhangelsk province in the event of a crop failure to provide the population with money for the purchase of food.</jats:p>",

However, retrieving SSS at high latitudes with a reasonable accuracy remains challenging, in particular due to the low sensitivity of L-Band radiometric measurements to SSS in cold waters and to the contamination of SMOS measurements by the vicinity of continents and sea ice as well as the presence of Radio Frequency Interferences.&amp;amp;#160;In this paper, we assess the quality of weekly SSS fields derived from swath-ordered instantaneous SMOS SSS (so called Level 2) distributed by the European Space Agency. These products are filtered according to new criteria. We use&amp;amp;#160;the pseudo-dielectric constant retrieved from SMOS brightness temperatures to filter SSS pixels polluted by sea ice. We identify that the dielectric constant model and the sea surface temperature auxiliary parameter&amp;amp;#160;used as prior information in the SMOS SSS retrieval&amp;amp;#160;are significant sources of uncertainty. We develop a novel correction methodology accordingly.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;SSS Standard deviation of differences (STDD) between weekly SMOS SSS and in-situ near surface salinity significantly decrease after applying the SSS correction, from 1.46 pss to 1.26 pss. The correlation between new SMOS SSS and in-situ near surface salinity reaches 0.94. SMOS estimates better capture SSS variability in the Arctic Ocean in comparison to TOPAZ reanalysis (STDD = 1.86&amp;amp;#160;pss), particularly in river plumes fresher by about 10&amp;amp;#160;pss than surrounding waters. Furthermore, comparisons with in-situ measurements ranging from 1 to 11 m depths identify huge vertical stratification in fresh regions. This emphasizes the need to consider in-situ salinity as close as possible to the sea surface when validating L-band radiometric SSS which are representative of the first top centimeter.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

We answer these questions in an equilibrium life-cycle model with household labour supply decisions, skill losses of females associated to non-participation, and heterogeneity in terms of fertility, childcare expenditures, and access to informal care. Calibrating our model to the U.S. economy, we first provide a roadmap for policy evaluation by contrasting transfers that are conditional on market work (childcare subsidies and childcare credits) with those that are not (child credits), when both types can be means tested or universal. We then evaluate expansions of current arrangements for the U.S. and find that expansions of conditional transfers have substantial positive effects on female labour supply, that are largest at the bottom of the skill distribution. Expanding childcare credits leads to long-run increases in the participation of married females of 10.6%, while an equivalent expansion of child credits leads to the opposite ($-$2.4%). Expanding existing programs generates substantial welfare gains for newborn households, which are largest for less-skilled households. Expanding childcare credits leads to the largest welfare gains for newborns and achieves majority support.</jats:p>",

The microbicidal potential of a silver and copper coating was investigated. Field-scale experiments on a riser pipe showed that silver coating only slightly subdued the growth of iron bacteria, while copper coating was highly effective. However, the coating was eroded and oxidized over the course of the experiment, rendering it ineffective. Model experiments with different types of copper coatings showed that only polished copper metal was able to prevent the growth of an iron bacteria biofilm for a longer period of time, while thinner coatings were overcome after some months. While the coating of screens, casings and riser pipes might thus not be sustainable, protecting parts of the submersible pump prone to iron oxide deposition by a copper coating could be an interesting option.</jats:p>",

The curriculum, certificate examination, and licensing of RTs in RTPs in Taiwan are similar to those for RTPs in Japan and Korea. The present study explored the supply of and demand for RTs over the past 20 years and identified predictive indicators of trends affecting the numbers of RTs supplied and demanded.<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The present study involved web-based research. The analyzed data were publicly available information downloaded from the websites of relevant statistical departments in Taiwan. The study employed specific medical devices or examinations used in hospitals to determine the demand for RTs. Long-term (1999–2018) and short-term (2014–2018) trends were analyzed. The change rates were calculated using compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate two groups of continuous variables. Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests were used to test normally distributed data.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> During 1999–2018, the annual numbers of students and graduates in RTPs were 2654 ± 350 and 516 ± 109, respectively, with corresponding CAGRs of 2.2% and 3.7%. During 2014–2018, the annual numbers of students and graduates in the RTPs were 2908 ± 67 and 605 ± 55, respectively, with corresponding CAGRs of −0.7% and 2.4%. During 1999–2018, the annual numbers of examinees and qualified personnel were 1228 ± 174 and 372 ± 62, respectively. The CAGRs for the number of qualified personnel were −1.5% and −4.7% during 1999–2018 and 2014–2018, respectively. The number of specific medical devices increased from 599 in 2000 to 1057 in 2018, whereas that of specific medical examinations increased from 1.7 million in 2000 to 5.3 million in 2018.<jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> During 2014–2018, 605 students graduated from RTPs annually, with approximately 375 annually becoming qualified personnel in Taiwan. The increase in the numbers of specific medical devices and examinations resulted in an annual increase of 204 new positions for RTs.</jats:p>"

Different parameter realizations of the K field are generated by applying the pilot point methodology. Backward particle tracking (PT) was then applied to each calibrated model, and the resulting particles are interpreted as the spatial pathline density distribution of multiple sources. The adopted approach offers advantages over classical PT which does not provide a means for treating uncertainty originating from the incomplete description of the K field. Besides evaluating the effect of uncertainty in the K field on pathline distribution, the importance of the chosen boundary conditions for flow predictions is also investigated by applying a linear uncertainty approach.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Uncertainty in the K field is shown to strongly influence the spatial pathline distribution. Pathline spreading is particularly evident in locations where the information content of the head observations does not sufficiently constrain the estimated parameters. As demonstrated with the linear uncertainty analysis, however, the artificial recharge rates and the pumping well conditions can also significantly affect the model predictions. Explicitly accounting for uncertainty in the boundary conditions is therefore a necessity rather than a choice.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Despite the predictive uncertainty, the pumped drinking water at the study site is most likely dominated by artificially&amp;amp;#8208;infiltrated groundwater originating from the local artificial infiltration canals and ponds. The results suggest that within the well field, the central pumping wells could be extracting regional groundwater, although the probability is relatively low. Nevertheless, a rigorous uncertainty assessment is still required since only a few realizations resulted in flow paths that support the field observations from tracer tests and on-site noble gas measurements to estimate groundwater mixing ratios.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We demonstrate that standard PT approaches without a Monte-Carlo approach will not represent the underlying subsurface uncertainty and will always underestimate well capture zones. While PT based on a single flow simulation can be used as an initial screening tool, model results and hence water resource management decisions should not be based on only one model realization; rather, an uncertainty analysis should be carried out to provide simulations within the range of all likely system states, including uncertainties in the hydraulic K distribution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

However, our quantitative understanding of the physical mechanisms that return deep-ocean water and nutrients to the upper ocean is currently limited. The nitrate isotopes are investigated here as a new data constraint on the percentage of gross water transport into the global pycnocline that derives from the Southern Ocean as opposed to the deep ocean (which we term the &amp;amp;#8220;pycnocline recipe&amp;amp;#8221;). Based on a comparison between large-scale observations of nitrate isotopes and the output of a box model, we estimate that the pycnocline recipe is 75 &amp;amp;#177; 10%; this result implies that ~ 64% of the nutrients supplied to the low latitude pycnocline pass through the Southern Ocean. Our simulations also highlight the shortcomings of a purely advective view of the ocean&amp;amp;#8217;s transport of water and nutrients, confirming that mixing with both the deep ocean and the Southern Ocean ventilating area are key to the exchange of water and nutrients between the pycnocline and higher-density deep and polar surface waters. Our calculations support a pure advective-diffusive balance in the deep ocean. In contrast, in the Southern Ocean, our findings provide independent evidence for the importance of air-sea fluxes of momentum and buoyancy in driving the circulation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

The manufacturer is unreliable which causes an increase of lead time and shortage. For solving the shortage problem and reducing lead time crashing cost (LTCC), an investment is utilized with the variable backorder price discounts. The number of transportation increases due to the new transportation policy and it causes pollution. Besides the fixed transportation and carbon emission cost (FTCEC), a container dependent carbon emission cost is applied. Some investments for setup cost reduction (SCR), ordering cost reduction (OCR), and quality improvement (QI) are considered. The lead time demand follows a normal distribution. The total cost of the supply chain is optimized and the model is tested numerically. The main intent of this study is to solve the shortage problem which occurs due to unreliability of the manufacturer. The study helps to reduce the unreliability issue of the manufacturer. The objective function is solved by using the classical optimization technique. Numerical results show that the discount for partial backorder enhances the profitability of the manufacturer.

The customer demand depends on the price such household items. In the other side, some retailers face supply problems. Supplier often cannot supply products when the products needed on time. There is delay time between customer demand and products arrive at retailer warehouse. The retailer should determine the optimal price and replenishment time. There are some assumptions are used for the model. The first assumption, the demand is known and has constant elasticity. Second, there is stochastic replenishment period and demand that are not filled are lost sales. The model is developed mathematically and a numerical example is conducted to show how the model works.

Previously, the project area (70 hectares) was used as pasture and as meadow. Later it was abandoned, resulted in an increased spread of shrubs and weeds. Climate change may harm the water balance of the vulnerable wetlands. To ensure and manage the water supply and retention in the project area several interventions are planned. The hydrological investigations started in April 2019. Groundwater levels and surface soil moisture (at the surroundings of the wells) are monitored manually once a week at the four selected points in the area. According to the initial results, the groundwater levels and the surface soil moisture values follow the typical seasonal change. A decrease can be detected during the vegetation period, while an increase started in the dormant season. Since the measurements started before the installation of the water control structures and the grazing, the current results can be interpreted as the results of the control period. Thus, the effects of the water supply and retention will be subsequently analyzed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The research was supported by the &amp;amp;#8220;EFOP-3.6.1-16-2016-00018 &amp;amp;#8211; Improving the role of research+development+innovation in the higher education through institutional developments assisting intelligent specialization in Sopron and Szombathely&amp;amp;#8221; project.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Therefore, the objective of this research was to assess the physicochemical &amp; bacteriological water quality in Asella town, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out from November, 2015 to April, 2016 G.C. 8 liter composite water samples in plastic bottles packed cold chain had been taken by the investigator from eight different sites with two round totally 192 parameters were analyzed. A standard instrument like AAS for heavy metal analysis was using APAH procedures. Statistical analysis was done by the use of software for data entry Epi info 7 &amp; Minitab 19.2. Results The first round of laboratory had showed that mean± SD TH 59.5± 7.4 mg/L, COD 30± 25.8mg/L, calcium 15± 4.3 mg/L, magnesium 5.3± 0.9 mg/L, BOD5 3± 2.6 mg/L and Nitrate 1.5± 0.1mg/L. The result of microbial analysis was 180CFU/100ml for TF &amp; FC, 40CFU/100ml was E.coli detected in the first study site. The second round physical analysis had showed that municipality water was colourles, odourles &amp; tasteless. But the Mean ± SD turbidity was 32.6± 63.4 mg/L. The mean± SD pH 4.5±0.8,EC 101.8±23.1,TH 24± 2.5 mg/L, calcium 6.9± 0.8 mg/L, magnesium 1. ± 0.6 mg/L, Fluoride 0.4± 0.2mg/L, aluminum 0.3± 0.2 mg/L, DO 4.6± 1.2 mg/L, nitrate 3.3± 2.5 mg/L, nitrite 0.9± 2/5 mg/L, zinc 0.3± 0.4 mg/L, CO32- 7. ± 6 mg/l, chloride 6± 1.3 mg/L, alkalinity 6± 4.9 mg/L, total solid 96± 50.3 mg/L, TDS 62± 14.8 mg/L, sodium 3.9± 2.4 mg/L, potassium 1.7± 0.1 mg/L, iron 0. ± 1mg/L and ammonia 0.9± 0.3 mg/L. There was strong pair wise statistical correlation among water quality parameters with p value &lt; 0.05 Conclusions The water quality analysis was below the limit of WHO standard, but some chemical, turbidity &amp; microbes need a critical attention. So, efficient water treatment must be monitored by the municipality &amp; homemade water treatment by urban community</jats:p>"

Unlike previous studies, which analyze the supply chain from input users’ perspective only, the present study examines the supply chain from both input users’ (backward linkage) and input suppliers’ (forward linkage) perspectives. In doing so, this study utilizes structural path analyses (SPAs) to scrutinize the specific paths along which the effects of a shock to a seafood industry are transmitted in both backward and forward directions. This study executes these two types of SPAs (backward linkage and forward linkage SPAs) for three seafood industries in Korea that include wild fisheries, aquaculture, and seafood processing, thus depicting a more detailed and complete picture of the mechanisms through which the influences of the seafood industries spill over to the rest of the economy. One important finding is that our SPAs are able to identify a number of seemingly unlikely non-seafood industries that play a critical role in transmitting the effects of a shock to a seafood industry.</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In Hungary the drinking water supply is mainly based on groundwater from aquifers characterized by different lithology. Riverbank filtered systems represent 40 % of drinking water supply. According to the EURATOM drinking water directive, there are recent regulations in Hungary regarding the natural radioactivity of drinking waters. Based on this, if gross alpha or gross beta radiation exceeds the limit, nuclide-specific measurements are required to be performed by the relevant waterworks. Since the mobility of uranium and radium is strongly influenced by the geochemical conditions, knowledge on the geochemical parameters of water is required. Therefore hydrogeology has a crucial role in revealing the origin of elevated activity concentrations. This research presents a case study in Hungary where the drinking water supply is provided by bank filtered and karst wells. The main aim of this study is to determine which radionuclides may cause the elevated radioactivity and explain their occurrence using hydrogeological approach, considering also the temporal variation of groundwater/surface water ratio. In most of the wells of the research area the gross alpha values are above the screening level, 0.1 Bq L&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. The study revealed the correlation between the river water level fluctuation and the uranium content of the wells. Among the investigated radionuclides, the uranium activity concentrations responded the most to the water level changes of the river and showed systematically higher values during low water conditions. In addition the karst wells showed low activity concentrations. This suggests, that uranium is transported by the groundwater component, and possibly sourced from the fluviatile sediments. The results of this study highlighted the transient nature of river bank filtered systems, which should be taken into account in the monitoring and water supply strategy. Nevertheless, the study emphasizes the importance of considering the dynamics of groundwater and associated geochemical environment in addition to geological factors, when investigating the radioactivity of groundwater or other potential contaminants.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This study was supported by the &amp;amp;#218;NKP-19-3 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities.

The advantage of effective supply chain management is to get maximum speed when goods and services move through the supply chain channel, lower costs, and increase added value for customers and product competitiveness in the market. The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the management of the coconut industry supply chain. The method used is descriptive qualitative analysis. Those who play a role in the coconut supply chain in the Sula Islands district are farmers, collectors I, collectors II, owners of home industries, transport vehicle owners and marine vessels as modes of transportation. With this supply chain channel, there are only a few benefits for farmers and business operators. The added value of coconut and copra is very small, meaning that the economic value obtained is very small. To provide greater economic value for residents of the Sula Islands district, especially for coconut farmers and coconut entrepreneurs, so coconut fruit must be processed not only until copra, but made in industrial scale coconut oil.Keywords— Supply Chain; Coconut; Industry; Coconut oil; Sula Islands Regency. Abstrak— Manajemen rantai pasok industri kelapa di kabupaten Kepulauan Sula masih dirasakan belum efektif dan efisien. Keuntungan manajemen rantai pasok yang efektif adalah   untuk   mendapatkan   kecepatan   maksimal pada saat barang dan jasa bergerak melalui jalur rantai pasok, menurunkan biaya, serta meningkatkan nilai tambah bagi pelanggan dan daya saing produk di pasar. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah mengidentifikasi dan menganalisis   pengelolaan   rantai   pasokan industri kelapa. Metode yang digunakan adalah Analisis deskriptif kualitatif.  Yang berperan dalam rantai pasokan kelapa di kabupaten Kepulauan Sula adalah petani, pengepul I, pengepul II, pemilik industri rumahan, pemilik kendaraan angkut dan kapal laut sebagai moda transportasi. Dengan jalur Rantai Pasokan seperti ini hanya sedikit keuntungan yang didapat oleh petani maupun pelaku usaha. Nilai Tambah dari Kelapa dan Kopra sangat kecil, berarti Nilai ekonomi yang didapatpun sangat kecil. Untuk memberikan nilai ekonomi lebih besar bagi penduduk kabupaten Kepulauan Sula, terutama bagi petani Kelapa dan pelaku usaha Kelapa, makanya buah Kelapa harus diolah tidak hanya sampai Kopra, tetapi dibuat minyak Kelapa berskala industri.Kata kunci— Rantai Pasok; Kelapa; Industri; Minyak Kelapa; Kabupaten Kepulauan Sula.</jats:p>"

The aforementioned HAT and its implementation are complying with the Product Design Engineering’s perspectives within theoretical and industrial implementation through Industry 4.0 in Indonesia. The objective of this paper is to intertwine the theoretical perspectives with industrial implementation. The industrial implementation constitutes the effort to implement paperless system for HAT in order to reduce wasted papers that are necessarily needed by user of this HAT, as transaction proof. The result and discussion of this paper comprise several discussions to be considered. To begin with, the result of this paperless system helps the cleaning service officers to reduce their cleaning duty. Furthermore, the result of this paperless system integrates the concept of industry 4.0 within scope of internet of things (IoT) and internet of everything (IoE). Subsequently, the discussion on this paper refers to the discourse on logistics and supply chain engineering perspectives, to ease the transaction proof involving big data. As a result, it reduces significantly the vehicle traffic and time needed to proceed to transaction in the aforementioned HAT. This paper refers to the research methodology within quantitative approach. As future research, it is indispensable to intertwine both aforementioned theoretical and industrial implementation. Both implementation, as future research, need to be integrated within the Asia Region.\r\nKeywords: big data analytics; internet of things; making Indonesia 4.0; paperless mechanism; product design engineering</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Land-use changes affect the properties of ecosystems, and are typically associated with decreasing ability to supply services, which in turn causes a decrease in the social well-being. Urbanization is identified as one of the main causes of ecosystem degradation, once it is considered an artificial space that replaces natural areas.This study investigates the impact of land-use changes during 20 years (1995-2015) on the potential supply of ecosystem services in Coimbra municipality, central Portugal. The assessment was based on the evaluation performed by 31 experts familiar with the study area, through questionnaires. The experts ranked the potential supply of 31 ecosystem services, grouped in regulation, provisioning and cultural services, for the several land-uses existent. Experts performed a qualitative evaluation, considering &amp;amp;#8216;strong adverse potential&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;weak adverse potential&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;not relevant&amp;amp;#8217;, &amp;amp;#8216;low positive potential&amp;amp;#8217; and &amp;amp;#8216;strong positive potential&amp;amp;#8217;. The qualitative evaluation was converted into a quantitative classification (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2). Quantitative values were then used to develop an ecosystem services quantification matrix and to map the information in the study area, using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). An urban expansion from 14% to 18% was recorded over the last 20 years. Agricultural land decreased 8% due to conversion into forest (4% increase) and urban areas (4% increase). This has led to a decrease in the supply of provision (e.g. food) and regulation services (e.g. flood regulation). In fact, over the last years, recurrent floods have been increasingly noticed in Coimbra city. On the other hand, the growth of forest areas has led to an increase in general ESs supply. The adverse impacts of urbanization were partially compensated by enlarging the benefits provided by forest areas, which is the land-use with greatest ESs potential supply. In order to support urban planning and develop sustainable cities, it is essential to quantify the potential supply of ecosystem services considering local scale and characteristics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

The practice in reform pilot areas indicates that government funds cannot meet all the needs, so exploring market-based LCR payout paths is important for rural land tenure system reform. The purpose of this study is to answer questions such as the following: How would farmers respond if they were allowed to trade LCRs? Is there an equilibrium point between the potential supply and demand of LCRs? Which factors would affect the potential supply and demand of LCRs? In this study, 697 valid questionnaires from Ningxia, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces, China, were used for analysis by the multiple bounded discrete choice (MBDC) method and MBDC-Tobit model. The results show that there is a potential market among rural collective households in China, with an equilibrium price of ¥27,800/mu ($59,714.4/ha), and a proportion of farmers who are willing to buy or sell LCRs is around 10.0%. The factors affecting the potential supply and demand of LCRs include land grade, average agricultural income per unit, total money to buy urban houses and cars, age, number of household members with a college education or above, and risk appetite. If the institutional barriers that hinder LCR transactions were eliminated, the potential supply and demand of LCRs would be matched, and the market would provide funds for next-stage reforms.</jats:p>"

The process of determining the location is based on a ranking method, in which the usefulness of individual subareas and measuring nodes is determined by means of a formula taking into account the amount of water intake, the required level of water supply and the effects of a lack of water supply, as well as the calculated concentration of free chlorine. The application of the method requires the construction and calibration of a numerical model of free chlorine decay in the network, as well as the knowledge on the location of the objects of particular importance for the network users. The proposed method will be applied in an existing water supply network of approximately 50,000 recipients.</jats:p>"

The results indicate a rather low contribution of Legionella spp. in total bacteria in the tested samples, but L. pneumophila was not detected in any sample. E. coli was detected in only one sample, but at a very low level. The qacEΔ1 gene, conferring resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds, was also not detected in any sample.

Despite these treatments no long-term improvement of the water quality was observed and the lake water phosphate content continued to increase by e.g. ~ 350 kg phosphate per year between March 2016 and February 2019. As no creeks or rivers drain into the lake and hydrological groundwater models do not suggest any major groundwater discharge into the lake, sources of phosphate (and other nutrients) are unknown.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We investigated the phosphate fluxes from sediment pore water and groundwater into the water body of the lake. Sediment pore water was extracted from sediment cores recovered by divers in August 2018 and February 2019. Diffusive phosphate fluxes from pore water were calculated based on phosphate gradients using first Fick`s law. Stable water isotopes (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;H, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O) were measured in the lake water, sediment pore water, interstitial waters in the banks surrounding the lake, the Elbe river and in three groundwater wells close to lake. Stable isotope (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;H, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O) water mass balance models were used to compute water inflow/outflow to/from the lake.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our results revealed pore-water borne phosphate fluxes between &amp;amp;#8211; 0.07 mg/m&amp;amp;#178;/d (i.e. slight phosphate uptake by the sediments) and 2.6 mg/m&amp;amp;#178;/d (i.e. phosphate release to the lake). Assuming that the measured phosphate fluxes are temporarily and spatially representative for the whole lake, about 100 kg/a to 220 kg/a of phosphate is released from sediments. This amount is slightly lower than the observed phosphate increase of the lake water. Stable isotope signatures indicate a water exchange between the aquifer and the lake water. Based on stable isotope mass balances (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;H, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O) we estimate an inflow of phosphate from the aquifer to the lake between 190 kg/a and 1400 kg/a. This inflow indicates that groundwater-born phosphate is as or even more important than phosphate supply via sediment pore-water. Our study suggests that groundwater may have an important impact on lake nutrient budgets.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Even though biomass is characterised as renewable energy, it produces anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially from biomass logistics. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool to quantify the GHG emissions from logistics but in the past the majority of LCAs have been steady-state and linear, when in reality, non-linear and temporal aspects (such as weather conditions, seasonal biomass demand, storage capacity, etc.) also have an important role to play. Thus, the objective of this paper was to optimise the environmental sustainability of forest biomass logistics (in terms of GHG emissions) by introducing the dynamic aspects of the supply chain and using the geographical information system (GIS) and agent-based modelling (ABM). The use of the GIS and ABM adds local conditions to the assessment in order to make the study more relevant. In this study, GIS was used to investigate biomass availability, biomass supply points and the road network around a large-scale combined heat and power plant in Naantali, Finland. Furthermore, the temporal aspects of the supply chain (e.g., seasonal biomass demand and storage capacity) were added using ABM to make the assessment dynamic. Based on the outcomes of the GIS and ABM, a gate-to-gate LCA of the forest biomass supply chain was conducted in order to calculate GHG emissions. In addition to the domestic biomass, we added imported biomass from Riga, Latvia to the fuel mixture in order to investigate the effect of sea transportation on overall GHG emissions. Finally, as a sensitivity check, we studied the real-time measurement of biomass quality and its potential impact on overall logistical GHG emissions. According to the results, biomass logistics incurred GHG emissions ranging from 2.72 to 3.46 kg CO2-eq per MWh, depending on the type of biomass and its origin. On the other hand, having 7% imported biomass in the fuel mixture resulted in a 13% increase in GHG emissions. Finally, the real-time monitoring of biomass quality helped save 2% of the GHG emissions from the overall supply chain. The incorporation of the GIS and ABM helped in assessing the environmental impacts of the forest biomass supply chain in local conditions, and the combined approach looks promising for developing LCAs that are inclusive of the temporal aspects of the supply chain for any specific location.</jats:p>"

In the first century, a complex water supply system, of more than 17 km in length, was built to withdraw groundwaters in the southern part of the aquifer and whose main elements were an extensive network of “qanats”, a surface conduction and a reservoir in the city (castellum aquae). After the abandonment of this infrastructure, the surface conduction was reconstructed in the 12th century (known as Caños de Carmona), which was made up of a canal and, in the part closest to the city, by a brick aqueduct over arches. Since the end of the 19th century, the urban, industrial and the transport network development and the conduction of water from the reservoirs of the Sierra Morena produced, once again, the progressive abandonment and destruction of these infrastructures. However, a large part of the “qanat” network excavated in the Los Alcores aquifer has been preserved and recently the GEOS and AAES speleological groups have explored about 20 km of water mines. The characteristics of tunnels and vertical shafts, the construction techniques, the discovery of Roman mortar (opus signinum) and bricks (opus testaceum) and the Arab chronicles suggest that this network of “qanats” was made mainly during the Roman domination period.</jats:p>"

They may cause energy losses and reduce the quality of the freshwater, which may endanger human life. Model predictive control (MPC) is a model-based approach widely used to control process systems such as reverse osmosis, while considering a set of constraints. In this paper, three methods of predictive model controllers are considered for the control of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) reverse osmosis desalination system in the presence of noise, model mismatch, and actuator fault. Formulation of enhanced constrained receding horizon predictive control via bounded data uncertainties (CRHPC-BDU) are extended for linear time-invariant MIMO systems. Permeate flow rate and conductivity of the water produced are controlled by a retentate valve and a bypass valve, respectively. The simulation results show the robustness of the suggested approach in the presence of both noise and uncertainties. CRHPC-BDU has a better performance subject to systems with model uncertainty and actuator fault up to a reasonable limit. By increasing the actuator fault up to 34%, the robustness of CRHPC-BDU is further highlighted in permeate conductivity, where the fluctuations of permeate conductivity dampen sooner than in the other two controllers.</jats:p>",

The study was of a dynamic nature. Although the study period was 2000–2014, this paper only presents the figures for the first and the last year, i.e. 2000 and 2014. The main focus was on drawing conclusions on the trends observed which proved to be relatively stable in the years covered. The input–output analysis was used by aggregating the sectors of the economy for a better transparency of the inference process. As shown by this study, EU countries at higher development levels witness a decline in the share of the chemical industry in the mix of goods and services supplied to agriculture. Conversely, less developed countries saw that ratio increase. Also, the share of goods supplied to agriculture from the fuel and energy sectors goes up in most EU countries. As regards the food industry, this study observed high shares of agriculture, services and self-supply in the supply structure of EU countries. This analysis extends the existing knowledge on the relationships in the structure of materials supplied to the agribusiness because in addition to agriculture itself (which was addressed by similar studies found in literature) it takes account of the food industry. Moreover, based on long-term observations, it endeavors to capture the prevailing relationships in several countries at a time.</jats:p>"

Therefore, policies that reduce the number of low-skilled immigrants who work predominantly in low-skilled service occupations may have an unintended consequence of lowering women’s participation in the labor market. This article examines the labor supply impact of the Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), which led to a large decline in the low-skilled immigrant workforce of the state. The analysis shows no evidence that LAWA statistically significantly affected US-born women’s labor supply in Arizona. This finding is partly explained by an increase in native workers in household service occupations due to LAWA, which offset the decline in immigrants in these occupations and caused the cost of household services to be relatively uninfluenced by the passage of LAWA.</jats:p>",

New generation sprinkler machines are being put into production, in the power system of which solar panels are used. One of the factors that negatively affect the performance of solar cells in an open field is their dusting, which is formed as a result of dust storms and wind. Cleaning of the battery panels is carried out in various ways: manual, semi-automatic and automatic. Dust cleaning is included in maintenance. (Research purpose) The research purpose is to determine the conditions for performing the maintenance, which consists in cleaning solar panels in the field. (Materials and methods) Theoretical (analysis, hypothesis design), empirical (observation, testing), experimental (ascertaining experiment) methods has been used during research. (Results and discussion) The article describes an introduced parameter for estimating the level of dusting. The power loss indicator shows the ratio of the power of the dusted module to the power of the clean module. Unscheduled maintenance is affected by the distance of the solar module from the repair point, the power of the solar module, the loss from dusting, the frequency of maintenance and cost indicators. (Conclusions) It has been found the dependence of maintenance period of the solar module of the sprinkler machine on the distance to the sprinkler machine, to the point of maintenance and repair, the power loss coefficient in case of dusting of the solar module, the cost of performing maintenance, as well as the frequency of maintenance. Article describes the boundaries of the choice of operating mode of the sprinkler between unscheduled maintenance for cleaning the solar module and the acceptance of additional power of the sprinkler power supply system according to the criterion of minimum operating costs.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the producer develop the selling channel to sell their products through online channel and offline channel. In this research, we develop the three-level dual-channel supply chain by notice delivery lead time in the online channel used by the producer and develop selling channel from distributors so distributors can sell their product to consumer with direct selling. We construct the model with profit maximization motive of the system that consists producer, distributors, and retailer in the centralize system. The total profit function is nonlinear function without constrains with three decision variables. Furthermore, we determine the optimal solution of the model based on necessary and sufficient condition. Based on numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis we analyze the effect of delivery lead time strongly influences the optimal total profit system.Keywords: Centralize, Lead Time, Three-Level</jats:p>"

At the dawn of human history, surface water and groundwater, principally springs, were the most common water supply sources. As the population grew, periodic water shortages occurred. In Early Minoan times (ca. 3200–2100 BC), these water shortages led to the development of sophisticated hydraulic structures for importing water and for the harvesting and storage of rainwater. In addition, the water treatment technologies and water distribution techniques developed at that time served as the basis for the advanced technological progress in the development of the urban water supply systems in the centuries that followed. In this paper, an overview of the evolution of public water supplies and water treatment technologies in the Hellenic world through the centuries up to modern times is presented. Some of the most significant innovations in the provision of water, its treatment, and distribution are highlighted. The overview is followed by a discussion of the contemporary situation, emerging trends, and future challenges, and parallels are drawn between historical developments and the water supply problems faced today.</jats:p>",

However, the water consumed by large-scale afforestation has a huge impact on water supply in Southwest China, which also arise a new challenge causing severe drought here recently. In order to determine the impact of artificial afforestation on the region, this study conducts spatiotemporal, abrupt change, and correlation and regression analyses. Results show that although water resources fluctuate, they exhibit a general declining trend. Especially after 2000, water resources showed a significant downward trend. In terms of spatial tendency, there has been an obvious decrease in water resources in the Sichuan Basin, the mountainous region of eastern Chongqing, and the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Due to extensive afforestation and vegetation cover growth, there has been an increase in most trends of forest-shrub ecosystems, resulting in substantially enhanced evapotranspiration effects. The uptake of water by afforestation in Southwest China could reach 40.42 billion m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, which is equivalent to 10.69% of its annul available water supply (1980–2015). Generally, afforestation disrupts the water balance of the region. This study recommends substituting afforestation for natural restoration or, at the very least, selecting vegetation that requires less water for the restoration of the ecological environment of Southwest China, which provide scientific method for regional sustainable development.</jats:p>"

We focused on the roles of Mg in yield formation and interactions with potassium (K) nutrition of cherry tomato. Cherry tomato yield, leaf Mg concentration, photosynthetic parameters, dry matter weight and K, Mg and calcium (Ca) uptake were investigated in two soilless experiments with seven Mg levels and five K levels.Results: Low (&lt;1 mM) and high (&gt;4 mM) Mg supply limited cherry tomato yield by decreasing 22.6-78.1% dry matter accumulation and 13.9-40.7% harvest index. The critical leaf Mg concentrations required for adequate photosynthate production in the first and second harvest periods were 4.67 and 5.52 g kg –1 , respectively. But over-supply of Mg disturbed leaf K and Ca concentrations, limiting the plant K and Ca content. Moreover, adjusting K concentrations in solution is a crucial factor influencing plant Mg functions, and therefore cherry tomato growth.Conclusion: Balanced Mg and K application increased Mg, K, and Ca uptake by cherry tomato, as well as Mg concentrations in leaves which could maintain a sustainable photosynthetic rate and plant dry matter formation.</jats:p>"

The control of several quality parameters as free chlorine, total organic carbon (TOC), conductivity, turbidity, temperature, colour, pressure and flow are necessary to ensure a supply of safe and clean drinking water to consumers.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The aim of this project is to investigate the consequences of alterations detected in the water distribution system, to find the focus of occurrences and controlling them to provide a better drinking water quality to Barcelona citizens.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Barcelona procures drinking water to its citizens via two main water sources: Ter and Llobregat Rivers. They have intrinsic quality differences and they must be treated in different ways. With the purpose of controlling and investigating how these differences impact the water quality supplies, two s::can sensor systems were installed in the Poblenou District (Barcelona). The first one (nano::station) was installed in a drinking water distribution pipe, and the second one (pipe::scan) was installed in a domestic water supply network. Both systems were situated in the same drinking water confluence sector in order to compare the data recorded and to visualise water quality changes. More than 20 events were recorded, analysed and classified according to whether the alteration was due to an occasional event in the domestic water supply or to an external incident from the water distribution system. Some detected events were related to an increase of temperature, a rise of water demand, the water origins or changes in pressure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One important event recorded by the installed probes was an increase of temperature, directly associated with an augment of total organic matter (TOC) at the beginning of summer (June 2018). A great rise of TOC would be the causer of high consumption of free chlorine that it could be hazardous for human health if there is not enough chlorine dissolved in water. Due to this temperature increment (from 15&amp;amp;#176;C to 23&amp;amp;#176;C in a few days), the minimum level of chlorine (less than 0.2 mg/L) was registered in the Poblenou Sector.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nano::station and pipe::scan sensor systems are excellent tools as on-line water quality controllers. These kinds of sensors can record variations occurring every two minutes, giving a great perception of the events that are happening at different points of the drinking water city-wide network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

Specifically, the purpose of the study is to test empirically whether inter-group of supply chain strategy can be found the differences in the characteristics (1) the contexts of organization, they are competitiveness  and product type; (2) the featured competitive priorities in the manufacturing field and (3) the performance achievement. Researh Method: The hypothesis testing process of the study uses the sample of 102 SMEs in the Province of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The testing technique used in this study is the technique of cluster analysis and ANOVA. Findings: The testing result of cluster analysis identifies 3 taxa of supply chain strategy group, each strategic profiling of the supply chain describes that only cluster 2, that is the type of Le-Agile has the consistency of decision, while the type of Agile and Lean does not have the consistency. The result of ANOVA test is used to test 3 hypotheses and all hypotheses are supported, while the hypothesis of supply chain strategy group differences based on the type of product is not proven. Research Limitations: The use of single source will lead to a single respondent bias and give rise to an interrater  reliability for the perceptual data. Especially when measuring the performance variables in this study which uses self-report, thus the use of a single respondent will lead to bias. Novelty: This study aims to test the concept of fit in particular the alignment conception of strategy between functions, they are supply chain and manufacturing strategy by using a selection approach. The taxonomy result will produce a strategic profiling which is able to describe the extent to which the strategic decision congruency and consistency between functions in the scope of SMEs in particular.</jats:p>"

Monitoring over a large industrial area is complicated by many factors that impede the use of existing leak detection methods: complex topography of the water supply network, which makes it difficult to segment; deterioration of infrastructure, both due to aging and corrosion; heterogeneity of the material of the manufacture of pipes; large variation in pipe diameters in one pipeline system; a variety of construction, installation and repair work carried out at the production site of the enterprise; significant level of round-the-clock production noise; the presence of uncontrolled elements of the water supply network.\nIn addition to complicating factors, it was necessary to take into account the specified limitations: a significant distance from the infrastructure; remoteness of control places from power supply networks; small amount of transmitted data; the need to install sensors in water wells, since it is impossible to guarantee the safety of elevated cabinets in a production environment.\nAs a possible solution, we considered wireless technologies for transmitting small-volume data over long distances belonging to the class of LPWAN (Low-power wide-area network): NB-IoT (Narrow Band Internet of Things), LoRa (Long Range) and Strizh. The common advantages of the technology are high penetration and long range and low power consumption, which allows end devices to provide uninterrupted autonomous operation for up to 10 years without replacing the battery. Each technology also has additional advantages and limitations.\nThe conclusion of the study is that to solve the problem in the given restrictions, you can use any of the technologies considered, while specifying the problem, you need to take into account additional parameters, such as the availability of network coverage in a given area, the number of sensors to be placed, the availability of the necessary devices, financial constraints.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Muslim city of Vascos (Navalmoralejo, Toledo) was inhabited from the 9th to the11th centuries A.D. The reasons that justify its specific location are unknown, although the latest research considers this settlement to be a centre related to metallurgical work. The archaeological excavations carried out evidence a population greater than a thousand inhabitants. A city of such a magnitude must have had a water supply system, sufficient to meet the demand of the population, as well for derived secondary activities. Today some archaeological remains both inside and outside the city have been identified, which could be related to the original supply system. It is considered that the possibilities of water supply were complicated when the geological, hydrogeological and weather conditions are taken into account. This difficulty raises the hypothesis of a water supply and possibly of underground origin. After an analysis of the hydrogeological conditions of the environment, and in line with the identified remains, a possible supply system is proposed, characterized by the maximum use of available surface and underground water resources. This system combines waters of both origins, thus forming a truly integral system of resource management that arose as a result of a shortage of temporary water in the surroundings of the city of Vascos.</jats:p>"

Studies were performed from 2009–2011 to determine the effects of magnesium fertilisation and storage duration on the contents of the anti-nutritive compound nitrates, nitrites and total glycoalkaloids (TGA) in potato tubers of mid-early cultivar “Bila” (Solanum tuberosum L.). Magnesium (Mg) was applied in doses of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg MgO ha−1, respectively, in the form of kieserite–magnesium sulphate (26% MgO). Potato quality after harvest and after three and six months of storage was determined. The content of nitrates in tubers after harvest ranged from 303 to 356 mg kg−1 FW and nitrites from 1.59 to 1.67 mg kg−1 FW. Increasing magnesium fertilisation reduced the nitrate and nitrite content of tubers but increased TGA content. Possible explanations for the TGA increase after Mg supply are discussed. Tubers that contained less TGA after harvest also had less glycoalkaloids after storage. However, physical damage during harvest or transportation, exposure to light and bad storage conditions increase the concentrations of glycoalkaloids in tubers. The consumption of cultivar “Bila” would not exceed the acceptable daily intake of harmful substances.</jats:p>"

Monitoring the consumption of water can control water usage, and smart technologies can play a useful role. In this paper, a smart system based on Internet of Things (IoT) has been proposed to monitor the water consumption in an urban housing complex. An ultrasonic sensor, together with Arduino, continuously monitors the water level of water tanks on rooftops and sends these data to a server through a Wi-Fi module. Using the data collected from the IoT system, the daily and weekly average water requirement of households can be calculated. Support vector machines (SVM) are used to forecast water consumption. The observed readings are divided into training and testing datasets. Water consumption is predicted for each day for a user. Error is recorded as the difference between the actual consumption and the predicted value, and it decreases as the number of days increase. An algorithm to monitor leakage of water in the tanks has also been proposed. A web interface allows the user to visualize the water usage, monitor their consumption, and detect any leakage and leakage rate in the system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The energy audit conducted on the use of fuel and energy resources in agriculture in the Tambov region showed that energy costs in the cost of production of agricultural products, depending on the type of products produced (milk, meat, vegetables grown in greenhouses, etc.) and their production technology, reach 15-50 percent. On large livestock farms, forage shops and inter-district feed mills are being built for the feed production. Gas-fired cooking cauldrons of low capacity (of 40-250 kilogram per hour) are mainly used for small and private farms. Analysis of low-power cooking boilers has shown that it is possible to improve their energy supply system by applying a method of regulating gas in proportion to the consumed heat flow. Energy savings can reach 40-50 percent. (Research purpose) The research purpose is in designing an equation system for mathematical description of the heat and energy balance of a gas-using cauldron with self-regulation of power to identify energy-efficient modes of its operation. (Materials and methods) Methods of system analysis and synthesis has been used. of knowledge existing in the field of ongoing research on the development of a gas-using digester with self-regulation of power. The methods are based on the theory of heat and mass transfer. (Results and discussion) The article presents a theoretical analysis of heat and power processes occurring in the power supply system of a cauldron with self-regulating power. The authors have designed a heat balance equation describing the processes of heat and mass transfer in a cauldron to identify effective modes of operation of such a power supply system. The article presents derived formulas for determining the useful heat for heating the product in the cauldron, heat loss for heating metal structures, from the enclosing structures to the environment, with outgoing exhaust gases, and from chemical underburning. (Conclusions) The article presents a system of equations that allows to mathematically describe the processes of heat and mass transfer in a gas-using cauldron with self-regulation of power to identify the most energy-efficient modes of its operation. It was found that by improving the power supply system of cauldron by applying a method of regulating gas in proportion to the consumed heat flow, it is possible to achieve energy savings of up to 40-50 percent.</jats:p>",

The researcher applied the census sampling technique to select the sample size of 31 public universities and 333 respondents. The study was informed by the Principal-Agent Theory. Primary data was collected through the use of questionnaires issued to the procurement staffs in the sampled universities. This study undertook a census because the sample size was small. Data collected from the field was coded and cleaned to remove outliers or missing values and categorized manually according to the questionnaire items using frequency distribution tables and percentages. The researcher used both descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of statistical package of Social Science (SPSS) version 24 to analyze the data.Findings: Top management was found to be satisfactory significant in contribution as a factor to procurement regulatory compliance level. The p value 0.000 was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 at a testing at 95% level of significance. Motivation and rewards to staff can be used as a strategy to combat the personal interest that arise in preference to fulfill their duties and assignments. Management acts as the framework to the functionality of the procurement department and activities thereof. Top management making efforts on motivating the staff individually leads to an exemplary performance.Unique contribution to theory, policy and practice: Deficient checking and assessment of the functioning in an organization is connected to the non-attendance to a controllable situation. The existing hindrances from the top management for the staffs to engage and enhance adoption and application of total quality management in procurement should be eradicated. Disciplinary steps should be taken on staff with unbecoming behaviors in effort to uphold ethical practice. There should be freedom of staff to discharge their duties as assigned to them by the top management</jats:p>"

Worldwide, drained peatlands cover only 0.3 percent of the land area but emit almost 5 percent of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Rewetting of drained peatlands is therefore an urgent need &amp;amp;#160;for climate change mitigation. The production of biomass for the use as solid biofuel for combustion, is one promising utilisation option.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Compared to wood, herbaceous biomass (e.g. grasses and reeds) contains higher concentrations of critical elements (N, S, Cl or K) that leads to higher emissions (SO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;, NO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;x&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) or to the destruction of boilers or parts of it (corrosion). Late harvest in winter is often recommended for grass species to improve fuel quality and also storage stability. Nutrients and other elements will be reduced in plant tissues by leaching or translocation processes during plant die-off. Water content that is crucial for storage will also decrease. Combustion quality of herbaceous biomass depends on plant species, site specific parameters and harvest time.

The current study is considered as a causality study, it investigates the effect of SCI elements on services Organizationsâ€™ (medical field) OP. The study surveyed the managers working at the services Organizations (medical field). Practical data were collected from 307 managers out of 330 managers, by means of a questionnaire which developed and refined through expertsâ€™ interviews and the panel of judges committee. Statistical techniques such as descriptive statistics, correlation, and multiple regressions were employed. The results of the study indicated a positive significant relationship between SCI and services organizationsâ€™ OP. The results also indicated that the managers in services organizations (medical field) were almost similar in their preference of the customer integration and internal integration indicators. However, the customer integration indicators are the most important indicators, followed by internal integration. Furthermore, empirical results indicated that there are strong inter-relationships and interactions among the two components of SCI between them and OP. Finally, the results showed that the respondents believed that there is a strong relationship between SCI and OP. Results indicated that the internal integration was having the highest effect on OP, followed by customer. Finally, the current study recommend considering improving the two components of SCI together because they are strongly interrelated.</jats:p>"

In contrast, PO estimates do not significantly react to demand shocks. Revisions are also partly caused by mismeasurement of PO before recessions. In particular, we show that the length of the preceding boom and pre‐recession values of the current account balance and credit volumes are correlated with post‐recession PO revisions.

Our study takes return policy into a green dual-channel supply chain, wherein a manufacturer creates and sells green products simultaneously. We investigate the pricing and greening strategies for the supply chain players in the cases of providing and not providing cross-channel return service by employing the Stackelberg model under the hypothesis of a consistent pricing strategy. By comparing the equilibrium results of two cases, we find that the retailer will cooperate with the manufacturer to employ the cross-channel return policy when the spillover effect is greater than a threshold. Additionally, the green level of products is higher than before. The threshold decreases with consumers’ sensitivity to green products, which implies that the manufacturer is motivated to conduct marketing programs to enhance consumers’ willingness to buy green products. Moreover, we propose a contract to coordinate the supply chain. Finally, we discuss the scenarios if the supply chain implements a differential pricing strategy. Interestingly, the green level and the profits of the whole supply chain are greater than that under a consistent pricing strategy. However, the profits of the retailer are lower than profits in the other scenario, which is not beneficial to creating a stable green supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this study, DOM in 11 major lakes in Japan was characterised by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Molecular formulas were assigned to 845–1,451 components per sample. Among them, 555 components were commonly found in all lakes. The DOM compositions of the 11 lakes were clustered into four groups. Correlation analysis could extract specific components whose relative intensities were associated with water quality indices such as specific ultraviolet absorbance, specific dissolved chemical oxygen demand (DCODMn), and specific trihalomethane formation potential (R = 0.80–0.93, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Although further molecular structural analyses of DOM components are necessary, these results could be informative for exploring key candidates related to specific water quality issues. Pre-treatment of samples with permanganate oxidation was applied to screen components which could contribute to DCODMn. DCODMn components accounted for only 7–30% of total peak intensities, indicating the limited performance of permanganate oxidation. Pre-treatment by permanganate coupled with Orbitrap MS revealed that components with higher molecular weight, higher oxygen-to-carbon ratios (O/C), and lower hydrogen-to-carbon ratios (H/C) could be responsible for DCODMn.</jats:p>",

Data were collected from 1100 supply chain entities (including agri-farmers, partners and enablers across the supply chain) using semi-structured interviews. Twenty five items emerged as significantly influencing the adoption of sustainable agribusiness practices among farmers which have branched out of five factors. Further, it was found that low adoption capabilities and lack of uniform sustainable agribusiness policy were the major issues reported by the respondents. Identification of factors influencing adoption of sustainable agribusiness in Uttarakhand, India, can serve as a guiding tool for agribusiness regulators (government departments including Department of Rural Development), intermediaries (traders, NGOs, etc.). The examination of pertinent issues with the focus on major support required, bottlenecks in adoption, key benefits of sustainable agribusiness activities and most common sustainable practices is expected to provide a new understanding about the sustainable agribusiness-based issues in India. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. Development of new anticorrosion treatment technologies including prevention of inter-crystalline corrosion propagation inside the solid material in order to increase hot-rolled pipes life.Methodology. Based on the analysis of pipes manufacture and operation conditions, the main reason for reduction of the life of oil and gas transport pipelines made of hot-rolled pipes has been defined to be the poor corrosion resistance, which consequently causes propagation of fatigue processes. In course of theoretical and practical studies, one of the reasons for low corrosion resistance was revealed – complete absence of anticorrosion treatment inside the solid metal in order to prevent propagation of dangerous inter-crystalline corrosion.Results. Based on the conducted experimental studies, practices have been developed to carry out anticorrosion treatment inside the solid material by ensuring feeding of the inhibitor in ionic form into the solid material. This is done through plastic flow deformation of the material with grain refinement. As a result, mobility of grains and their fragments under conditions of deformation cause formation of \"conductance channels\", along which the inhibitor ions are transported to the solid material under the influence of electrostatic fields of the natural or, if necessary, artificial background. The most important result of this is the inhibitory treatment of the grains surface inside the solid material with prevention of electrochemical inter-crystalline corrosion propagation.Originality. Based on the practical works, anticorrosion treatment inside the solid material has been carried out for the first time, thereby eliminating the extremely dangerous inter-crystalline corrosion that latently propagates inside the solid material. A prerequisite for transportation of the inhibitor in ionic form inside the solid material are numerous examples of various elementary formations movements inside the solid body of material. This fact can be confirmed by inter-crystalline corrosion propagation in the solid material that generates in the manner of electrochemical corrosion, i.e. with water involved. This suggests the presence of water molecules in the solid material and possible channels of its penetration into the solid body. Many other examples can be given; their analysis reveals a common feature – in all cases there is an electrical nature, including water molecules that have an electrical dipole moment. Another precondition for the possibility of the inhibitor transportation is the presence of transportation channels. They are formed of free volumes, that are characteristic for crystalline structures, and volumes generated as a result of plastic flow deformation. The third precondition for the inhibitor ions transportation inside the solid material is the presence of driving forces; the forces of the electrical nature act in this case, ensuring \"instantaneous\" movements of micro-objects. Their source is the electrostatic fields of the material being the result of a large number of potential differences arising from the numerous and diverse inhomogeneities of materials. They form the natural electrostatic background, which ensures movement of micro-objects in the \"solid body\" of the material in vivo. If necessary, it can be supplemented with the artificial electrostatic background created by a grinding brush that removes scale from the pipe surface.Practical implications. The deterioration degree of operated pipeline systems is high; the required amount of repair work significantly exceeds the scope of work for the newly constructed systems. A similar situation both in terms of operating conditions and in technical state is with heating pipeline systems, also being of great length. Failures in operation of both abovementioned systems due to their underground laying bring high economic losses; the same is in case of their repair. For these reasons, extension of hot-rolled pipes service life is of great economic importance, which is hard to overestimate.</jats:p>"

The researcher applied the census sampling technique to select the sample size of 31 public universities and 333 respondents. The study was informed by the Principal-Agent Theory. Primary data was collected through the use of questionnaires issued to the procurement staffs in the sampled universities. This study undertook a census because the sample size was small. Data collected from the field was coded and cleaned to remove outliers or missing values and categorized manually according to the questionnaire items using frequency distribution tables and percentages. The researcher used both descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of statistical package of Social Science (SPSS) version 24 to analyze the data.Findings: Top management was found to be satisfactory significant in contribution as a factor to procurement regulatory compliance level. The p value 0.000 was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 at a testing at 95% level of significance. Motivation and rewards to staff can be used as a strategy to combat the personal interest that arise in preference to fulfill their duties and assignments. Management acts as the framework to the functionality of the procurement department and activities thereof. Top management making efforts on motivating the staff individually leads to an exemplary performance.Unique contribution to theory, policy and practice: Deficient checking and assessment of the functioning in an organization is connected to the non-attendance to a controllable situation. The existing hindrances from the top management for the staffs to engage and enhance adoption and application of total quality management in procurement should be eradicated. Disciplinary steps should be taken on staff with unbecoming behaviors in effort to uphold ethical practice. There should be freedom of staff to discharge their duties as assigned to them by the top management</jats:p>"

Recently, customers’ demands, and governmental legislations have forced domestic and global organizations to implement environmentally sustainable practices in order to cure what has been damaged in the previous decades. This study focuses on the impact of green supply chain management practices on firm’s performance. These practices are green purchasing, green packaging, green manufacturing, green design and green marketing. A questionnaire was circulated among two companies of two industries: shipping and automobile. 80 managers and supervisors were targeted; 59 responses were received indicating a response rate of (74%). For testing, regression analysis and T-test were used. From the analysis, it was found that most of green practices influence firm’s performance with green manufacturing the most adopted practice that shapes the industries, followed by green marketing and green purchasing. On the other hand, little impact was found in green packaging and negative impact of green design on firm’s performance. Overall, the study indicates that the tested sample is moving towards the green concept but still it is in its first stages and needs more efforts and support from firms, suppliers and customers. </jats:p>",

ANC and delivery services at health facilities, however, have been underutilized in Kenya. One potential strategy to increase the demand for ANC services is to provide health interventions as incentives for pregnant women. In 2013, an integrated ANC program was implemented in western Kenya to promote ANC visits by addressing both supply- and demand-side factors. Supply-side interventions included nurse training and supplies for obstetric emergencies and neonatal resuscitation. Demand-side interventions included SMS text messages with appointment reminders and educational contents, group education sessions, and vouchers to purchase health products. Methods : To explore pregnant mothers’ experiences with the intervention, ANC visits, and delivery, we conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) at pre- and post-intervention. A total of 19 FGDs were held with pregnant mothers, nurses, and community health workers (CHWs) during the two assessment periods. We performed thematic analyses to highlight study participants’ perceptions and experiences. Results : FGD data revealed that pregnant women perceived the risks of home-based delivery, recognized the benefits of facility-based delivery, and were motivated by the incentives to seek care despite barriers to care that included poverty, lack of transport, and poor treatment by nurses. Nurses also perceived the value of incentives to attract women to care but described obstacles to providing health care such as overwork, low pay, inadequate supplies and equipment, and insufficient staff. CHWs identified the utility and limitations of text messages for health education. Conclusions : Future interventions should ensure that adequate workforce, training, and supplies are in place to respond to increased demand for maternal and child health services stimulated by incentive programs.</jats:p>"

This can be observed either in medium speed engines, where, as one of the traditional solutions, the oil for piston cooling is supplied through the connecting rod, or in automotive engine VCR (variable compression ratio) connecting rods, where engine oil is used to change the compression ratio of the engine. In both cases, precise numerical results are necessary to shorten the prototyping period and to reduce the overall development cost.\nThe multi-physics character of the simulation problem basically consists of the interaction between the dynamics of the crank train components and the oil flow. For the oil supply to the piston cooling channels through the connecting rod in medium speed engines, being the objective of this paper, a major influencing factor is the oil pressure behavior in the piston cooling gallery providing periodical interaction with its supply. At the same time, the connecting rod elastic deformation during engine operation can be regarded as negligible and the planar motion of the connecting rod can be reproduced by combination of translational and rotational acceleration fields in the CFD solver.\nThe paper includes the description of the applied simulation approach, the results and a comparison with the state-of-the art calculation without consideration of the above-mentioned influencing factors.</jats:p>"

In this article, a closed-loop supply chain management containing a single manufacturer, a single retailer, and a third party is introduced in which the manufacturer first propagates newly finished goods and then dispatches some of the finished goods to the retailer considering a single-setup multi-delivery policy. Due to shipping, carbon emission is taken into account as well as a carbon emission trading mechanism to curb the amount of carbon emissions by the retailer. For recycling through collection, inspection, remanufacturing, and landfill, the third party collects the end-of-life goods from its customers and ships perfect products to the manufacturer after a two-stage inspection. In this model, major sources of emissions such as shipping, replenishment orders, and inventory have been taken care of. The minimizing of the total cost relating to the container capacity, shipment numbers, and replenishment cycle length is the main objective of the closed-loop supply chain management for making the system more profitable. Expository numerical explorations, analysis, and graphic representations are conferred to elucidate this model, and it is observed that this model saves some percentage of the cost compared to the existing literature.</jats:p>"

As part of this larger effort, we are aiming to understand how climate change will impact: water availability and quality; farming, lives and livelihoods; and to work with local communities to plan adaptation strategies. The current water supply and demand in two catchments in the Cordillera Blanca and two in the Cordillera Negra is being assessed to understand the background water context in contrasting glaciated and non-glaciated landscapes. Based on detailed surveys of the ancient and modern waterscapes led by South American archaeologists, supplemented by more recent data from hydrological measurement and ethnographic surveys and discussions with local communities, a nuanced picture is emerging of how communities have adapted to past and current climate conditions, and potential solutions are being co-developed with the local communities to maintain and improve livelihoods in situations with low rainfall in the Negra and glacial retreat in the Blanca. Crop water demand during the dry season in the Rio Ancash (114 km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) catchment has been assessed using the CROPWAT model and local climate and crop survey data, and the present-day water supply assessed through the gauging of rivers and irrigation canal flows, and measurement of water quality and isotopes. Preliminary results, for the Rio Ancash, suggest the amount of water available for dry season irrigation on the mid-slopes is approximately 70 mm over the cropped area (57 km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) which appears to be less than the crop water demand, though this estimate may change as more data is processed. Initial climate projections suggestion an increase in water as the glaciers melt until around 2050. The dry season crop water demand and supply beyond 2050 is currently being estimated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

The main measures to reduce heat losses in steam networks are considered and their calculation is carried out. Of the considered methods of energy saving, it is preferable to increase the thickness of the thermal insulation of steam pipelines. Moreover, the calculations showed that the optimal value of the insulation thickness for the investigated steam pipeline was 0.17 m, which corresponds to the highest quality of the supplied steam and the shortest payback period.</jats:p>",

In the case of cutting aluminum alloys, the chip breakability is the most important feature to ensure reliable operation in automated machining. In this study, in turning of 7075 aluminum alloy with a high-pressure coolant supply, the chip configurations, and the mass and thickness of chips were experimentally investigated. The following results were obtained:(1) In the case of a cutting speed of 5.0 m/s, a feed rate from 0.05 mm/rev to 0.50 mm/rev and a depth of cut from 0.1 mm to 3.0 mm, chips were not broken at a feed rate of 0.15 mm/rev or less with the conventional coolant supply. With a high-pressure coolant supply, the combination area of feed rate and depth of cut in which chips were broken was wider than that with the conventional coolant supply. With the high-pressure coolant supply at a coolant pressure of 7 MPa, there was a combination area of feed rate and depth of cut in which chips were not broken. However, chips were broken in all areas at a coolant pressure of 20 MPa.(2) In the case of both the high-pressure coolant supply, which has a coolant pressure of 7, 14 or 20 MPa, and the conventional coolant supply, the thickness of chip increased with the increase of the depth of cut. And, the thickness of chip did not change depending on the cutting method, namely the high-pressure coolant supply cutting method and the conventional coolant supply cutting method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Damage to coastal and inland communities in the United States from extreme weather events has increased dramatically in recent years and the decade of the 2010s was particularly harsh. These violent storms damage civil infrastructure systems, such as transportation, power, water and sewer, and communications, resulting in many people losing access to healthcare services. These breakdowns in the healthcare supply chain can be relatively minor, e.g., a pharmacy closed for a few hours, or life‐threatening, e.g., when dialysis or radiation treatment for cancer is unavailable for days or weeks. In 2017, more than 1,500 deaths were attributed to delayed or interrupted healthcare in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. This paper describes how damage to civil infrastructure from an extreme weather event can disrupt the delivery of critical healthcare services, how such disruptions impact those in need of services, and offer suggestions for improving the resilience of the healthcare supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this work, the concept of the smart rain barrel (SRB) as an IoT solution for green infrastructure is presented. The SRB are real-time controlled micro-storages (200&amp;amp;#160;litre) used for an advanced rainwater management. System states and high-resolution weather forecasts from the meteorological service are integrated into the control strategy to provide adequate rainwater for irrigation requirements and to reduce peak runoff in the drainage system. The integration into the smart water infrastructure and the exchange of control commands is done via LoRaWAN, a low-power radio network. For ease of development and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SRB concept, a two-stage approach was chosen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First, a prototype of the SRB was built, which is in operation at the university campus of Innsbruck (Austria) during the summer months since 2019. The campus area, also denoted Smart Campus, is part of a pilot project for a &amp;amp;#8220;Smart Water City&amp;amp;#8221;. This campus is used as both, demonstration object and experimental framework for smart applications in urban water management. The Smart Campus integrates water supply and urban drainage into a joint controlled system, in which natural and anthropogenic water inflows and outflows are measured in real-time. Current measurements encompass water consumptions and pressures in the distribution system, meteorological data at different locations, filling levels in the drainage system, as well as filling levels and soil moistures of decentralised stormwater retention and infiltration systems. The temporal resolution of the measurements is depending on the application between 1 and 15 minutes. By using these high-resolution measurement data, the Smart Campus is an ideal testing ground for smart applications such as the SRB.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In addition, numerical simulations were carried out to test different control strategies and to investigate the effects of a large-scale implementation of the SRBs at community level. The results show that the SRBs can significantly improve system performance (e.g. reduce potable drinking water demand and reduce the risk of flooding) despite their small storage volumes. But the results also demonstrate, that if a large number of SRBs are implemented, a coordinated control strategy to operate SRBs and urban water infrastructure is necessary to avoid a worsening of the system (e.g. generate a combined sewer overflow by simultaneous emptying the SRBs during dry weather flow).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Responsible supply chain management (RSCM) as a growing sub-field of supply chain management (SCM) has gathered increasing consideration from both practitioners and academics for the past two decades. Even though manufacturing firms have implemented RSCM behaviors throughout this period, there exist some concerns as to whether these RSCM behaviors are being applied for the effect they have on social performance outcomes. In recent times, various debates have been opened concerning this RSCM paradox, throwing doubt on whether an investment in the implementation of RSCM behaviors certainly comes with a corresponding social and safety performance outcomes and, therefore, the commercial benefits of responsibility management in the context of SCM remain open for interrogation. This study aims to explore the impact of responsible supply chain management behaviors on social performance among pharmaceutical companies in China. And also, investigate the intervening roles of process innovation (PI) and supply chain integration (SCI) as mediating and moderating constructs, respectively. The research hypothesis was formulated following an extensive study of relevant literature and was based on resource and capability-based theories such as the resource-based view, the natural resource-based view, and the stakeholder theories. The design of the study was descriptive with a confirmatory reach, applied to 123 Chinese pharmaceutical firms selected across Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Guangdong provinces. The proposed theoretical model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The empirical findings of the study confirmed that a practical application of RSCM behaviors, process innovation, and supply chain integration initiatives positively and significantly improves social performance outcomes. This confirms the position of existing literature that there is a positive relationship between RSCM behaviors and social performance. It also validated the belief that process innovation and supply chain integration positively mediates and moderates the relationship between RSCM and social performance, respectively. Therefore, the findings herein can be considered as complementary to the existing body of knowledge in the field. The practical implications derived from this study will contribute to sustainable development and expand knowledge both in industry and in academia.</jats:p>",

(all p &lt; 0.05). Lower protein thiamine intake in medium BMI males was related to POAG. Low dietary intake of several nutrients showed an association with glaucoma in low BMI female subjects. An insufficient intake of certain nutrients may be associated with an increased risk of glaucoma in Koreans. Further large-scale cohort studies are needed to determine how specific nutrients alter the risk of glaucoma.</jats:p>"

Kaliandra (<jats:italic>Calliandra calothyrsus</jats:italic>) is one of potential bee forage that also has a good performance to be used as biomass source. On the other hand, this along year flowering plant, also provide their leaves as proteins source for cattle. Through sustainable beekeeping activity, which is involving bee forages planting and pruning, bioenergy sources also will automatically increase in availability. As a part of Java Island, West Java was well known for its green and flowering landscape. Though honey also produced by outer area of Java Island, but beekeeping activity was majority well arranged by Java Island people. The calculation shows that the beekeeping activity with new 450 beehive result in the potential addition of biomass and biogas supply in West Java.

The foreland basin of the East Carpathians is 800 km long and stretches out across Poland, Ukraine, Moldova and Romania. We use the results of our intensive field research to unravel the sedimentary architecture of this basin and reveal how it responded to the final phases of foreland vergent thrusting, continental collision and subsequent slab detachment. We discuss the asymmetry in the basins evolution and eventual inversion and relate this to the diachronous evolution of the Carpathian orogen. We also address the impact of changing subsidence patterns and base-level changes on connectivity with the Central and Eastern Paratethys, important for faunal exchange and patterns of endemism. We finally show that continental collision led to the establishment of a Late Miocene NW-SE prograding axial drainage system in the foreland supplying abundant sediment to the NW Black Sea, thus triggering large-scale shelf edge progradation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

The authors of this paper reviewed the relevant literature and discovered its reliance on approaches like corporate social responsibility and its marginalization of systems thinking. This situation undermines the contributions of this literature, as it could be reductionist from a systemic perspective. Reductionism limits solutions to suboptimizations incapable of achieving multifinal and holistic outcomes. To assess this literature, the authors conducted a mapping study to analyse its distribution over four systemic paradigms: functionalism, interpretivism, emancipation, and postmodernism. The results showed that it clustered unevenly around these paradigms and lacked pluralism in perspective. This paper is significant as it revealed the innate inability of most of the supply chain social responsibility literature in offering creative and holistic solutions. Therefore, this literature can only resolve some social responsibility factors allowing the persistence and resurfacing of social responsibility messes.</jats:p>",

One of the most promising technologies is Blockchain, which has already been used successfully in financial aspects, such as bitcoin, and it is attracting interests from food supply chain organizations. As blockchain has characteristics, such as decentralization, security, immutability, smart contract, it is therefore expected to improve sustainable food supply chain management and food traceability. This paper applies a content-analysis based literature review in blockchain adoption within food supply chain. We propose four benefits. Blockchain can help to improve food traceability, information transparency, and recall efficiency; it can also be combined with Internet of things (IoT) to achieve better efficiency. We also propose five potential challenges, including lack of deeper understanding of blockchain, technology difficulties, raw data manipulation, difficulties of getting all stakeholders on board, and the deficiency of regulations.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to determine the presence of microbial contaminants, specifically pathogens, in stagnant grey water in the RR Section in Khayelitsha, Western Cape. The most probable number (MPN) technique was conducted to determine faecal coliform (FC) and Escherichia coli (EC) counts in the samples. The API 20E and the RapID ONE systems were used to identify possible pathogenic Gram-negative microorganisms, while the isolated Gram-positive microorganisms were identified using the BBL Crystal Gram-Positive (GP) Identification (ID) system. The highest respective FC and EC counts observed during this period were recorded as 2.8 × 107 microorganisms/100 mL (Site F, week 5). The RapID ONE and the API 20 identification systems identified mostly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Enterobacter cloacae, amongst others, while the BBL Crystal-GP ID system identified mostly Corynebacterium and Bacillus species. The presence of these organisms raises health concerns for the community of RR Section.</jats:p>",

Hence sophisticated fuzzy optimization (metaheuristics) techniques have become commonplace; and are currently indispensable for effective design, maintenance and operations of such systems. Unfortunately, such state-of-the-art techniques suffer several drawbacks when applied to largescale problems. In line of improving the performance of metaheuristics in those, this work proposes the fuzzy random matrix theory (RMT) as an add-on to the cuckoo search (CS) technique for solving the fuzzy large-scale multiobjective (MO) optimization problem; biofuel supply chain. The fuzzy biofuel supply chain problem accounts for uncertainties resulting from fluctuations in the annual electricity generation output of the biomass power plant [kWh/year].

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the shortage of global resources and the call for sustainable development, the remanufacturing supply chain and the corporate social responsibility of enterprises have attracted extensive attention from scholars. This paper studies a manufacturer-retailer corporate social responsibility (CSR) remanufacturing supply chain in which the manufacturer collects the used products grounded in the willingness to pay (WTP) differentiation. Different from previous literature, this paper first adds WTP differences to the CSR remanufacturing supply chain. Next, we analyze the manufacturer exhibiting CSR activity by Stackelberg game theory in both centralized and decentralized models with a consideration of prices, recycling, consumer surplus, and profits for the chain players in the two models with different CSR ratios. Through calculation and analyses of the models, we note that the chain members have the best status when the consumers’ WTP for new and remanufactured products is within a threshold. Subsequently, we compare the optimal price decisions and the expected profits in the decentralized and centralized systems, and we find that the retail price, wholesale price, and recycling rate decrease with a rising CSR under WTP differentiation. The centralized retail price is lower than the decentralized one. Conversely, the profit is higher when the increment of demand is higher. On top of that, in common cases, the pure and total profits of manufacturing are ascending while the retailer’s profit is descending. We also find that the consumer surplus is increasing in two cases. Finally, to motivate the players in the supply chain to engage in CSR activity, we consider the revenue sharing contract. From the perspective of WTP differences, this paper studies CSR remanufacturing, which has certain influences on the sustainable development of the economy.</jats:p>"

Framing our study within the “strategy‐conduct‐performance” paradigm, we consider the focal firm's role in the implementation of sustainable supply chain initiatives, social as well as environmental. We use data on the S&amp;P 500 Index retrieved from Bloomberg, including variables for two relevant focal firm strategies: (a) reducing the environmental footprint of the supply chain and (b) reducing social risks in the supply chain (SRSS). Hierarchical logit modeling is carried out to examine the sequential impact of governance board characteristics and the focal firm's adoption of related internal policies and practices on the likelihood of implementing these initiatives along the supply chain. Controlling for industry, firm size, and resources, we find that board structure and diversity influence the implementation of sustainable supply chain initiatives by increasing organizational commitment to environmentally friendly and socially responsible policies and practices. Consequently, empirical evidence exists for the importance of strategic factors, namely a proactive corporate stance on sustainability associated with governance board characteristics, as antecedents of sustainable (environmental and social) supply chain initiatives.</jats:p>",

In this sense, it is crucial to apply appropriate preventive maintenance in critical components (such as the wellheads, heat exchangers, or pipes), while reducing shutdown times. Based on electrochemical measurements performed in an autoclave corrosion testing setup, we studied the corrosion mechanism of API L80 steel grade as a function of operational and/or maintenance procedures. We used a test fluid representative for a site in Switzerland, but the main observations made may be applicable in a wider context. We found that changes in the fluid temperature (from 200 to 100 °C) or temporary oxygen ingress significantly influenced the corrosion behavior of this carbon steel and increased its corrosion rate (from approx. 20 µm/year to &gt; 120 µm/year). After a few days, the corrosion rate was found to decrease and stabilize around values of 50–70 µm/year, as a result of a porous corrosion product layer formed on the metal surface (approx. 250 µm thick). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated an increase in capacitance of the double layer over time, most likely due to an increase in the effective surface area of the steel sample, as a consequence of surface roughening due to corrosion. The results from this study may be implemented in the design and operation of future power plants in Switzerland and elsewhere to ensure reliable and cost-effective energy production from geothermal resources.</jats:p>",

The surface runoff from upper Citarum contributed to the flooding downstream, such as Bandung city and West Bandung District. The degraded areas could be determined through analysis of land vulnerability to erosion. The aim of this study is to identify areas vulnerable to erosion and to design a rehabilitation plan to reduce erosion and increase infiltration. It is expected that by doing the land rehabilitation, the surface runoff is decreased and the groundwater is increased. The land vulnerability is identified by overlaying land cover, land system and precipitation. The result shows that more than 50% of the total areas of Upper Citarum are vulnerable to erosion, 26% are very vulnerable and the rest are moderate to not vulnerable. The recommended activities for land rehabilitation in the vulnerable and very vulnerable areas are determined according to their functions: forest and non-forest. In the non-forest function, the suggested activities are infiltration well, ponds, and planting forest trees; while in the forest function, especially in the protected forest, enrichment planting completed with water trap.</jats:p>",

Crustal structure near an extinct MOR, therefore, provide unique constraints on how the magma supply and the crustal accretion respond to the reduced and ultimately ceased spreading. We present the crustal structure beneath 11 OBS sites near the extinct MOR in the central sub-basin of the South China Sea (SCS). We use the Receiver Function (RF) method to reveal the thickness and the Vp/Vs ratio of the crust based on the passive-source OBS data collected in this sub-basin. The thickness of the crust varies systematically with the distance to the ridge. &amp;amp;#160;The thinned crust near the ridge likely indicates that, in the late stage of spreading, the magma supply has diminished and the spreading rate has dropped to the ultra-slow range. While the Vp/Vs ratios at most sites fall into the normal range, there exist a few anomalously high Vp/Vs ratios (&amp;gt; 2.0) at sites very close to the ridge. These high Vp/Vs values can be explained by the serpentinization of the uppermost mantle beneath the sites. As the spreading rate and magma supply were reduced, fractures and fissures were easily developed at the frank of the crust accretion, allowing water enters the lowermost crust and serpentinizes the uppermost mantle.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

And the concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3−-N and NO2−-N in the sediment, pore water and overlying water were determined to evaluate the diffusion flux across the water–sediment interface. The results showed that the lowest sediment N concentration was 36.54 mg/L in July, and the highest one was 145.93 mg/L in November. Spatially, the sediment N concentrations were higher in tidal soil and loam than in sandy soil. According to the diffusion fluxes of NH4+, NO3− and NO2−, sediments at all sites tend to release N to the overlying water except in the sampling month of November, when the sediment acts as a sink of NO3−. The highest release rates of NH4+-N and NO3−-N were 17.66 mg m−2·d−1 and 80.15 mg m−2·d−1, respectively, which are much higher than the release rate of NO2−-N (0.29 mg m−2·d−1). The findings indicate that hydro-fluctuation belt sediment contributes a lot to the nitrogen contents in the overlying water, and internal pollution is a main reason for the water quality deterioration and even eutrophication.</jats:p>",

The main innovation of the work lies in the following: first, the coal demand when the coal-electrical supply chain is in balance under centralized decision-making is taken as the total annual trading volume needed to design the contract coordination mechanism and solve double marginalization. Second, based on prospect theory, in the construction of CFD, the benefits of coal-fired power plants and coal enterprises when both sides are in equilibrium under the Stackelberg non-cooperative game are taken as the reference points, and coal demand is taken as a random variable to design the CFD with a one-year transaction period. The price of coal that is not traded through CFD is calculated according to the daily market price. Third, this paper proposes the prospect M-V criterion of the risk-benefit equilibrium of both power and coal enterprises, which means that the risk-benefit equilibrium of both sides is the prospect variance effect of both sides relative to the reference point benefit divided by the prospect expectation effect.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

We investigate the effects of encroachment and power structure on quality and profits for chain members. Employing a game-theoretic approach, we find that, first, in a manufacturer-led supply chain, encroachment makes both manufacturer and retailer better off when the quality investment efficiency is relatively high. And, the manufacturer’s profit exhibits nonmonotonicity with respect to the extent of consumers acceptance on the direct channel in a retailer-led setting. Second, our result shows that the pure equilibrium outcomes are driven by the quality investment efficiency and the extent of consumers’ acceptance on the direct channel. An interesting result is that, for the manufacturer, establishing encroachment channel and occupying the leader position simultaneously are always not the optimal choice. Additionally, the options of encroaching and striving for leader position can lead to lose-win, win-win, and win-lose situations for the manufacturer and the retailer. Finally, a prisoner’s dilemma may occur with a low quality investment efficiency, a moderately fixed encroachment cost and a high extent of consumers’ acceptance on the direct channel when a fixed encroachment cost is considered.</jats:p>",

It is one of the richest gold-producing areas in the world but unfortunately the current state of the town’s infrastructure is in shambles and the environment is in a pitiful state because of human activities that have caused massive physical changes. Geohydrological aspects such as complex geology and the compartmentalisation of the groundwater into seven areas separated by syenite dykes, of which five have been dewatered to facilitate the gold-mining, have made it the research area of choice. Unfortunately, this led to the formation of hundreds of new sinkholes between the towns of Westonaria and Carletonville and eventually the evacuation of the old town of Bank, abandoning the area and declaring it unsuitable for human settlements. To try and identify possible reasons for this unfortunate state of the human-induced environmental change all along the Wonderfontein Spruit draining the area, the author using a comprehensive literature review, study of geological maps and databases as well as through data collection and semi-structured interviews with selected role-players and stakeholders identified basic essential geographical, geohydrological, organisational and municipal management aspects of significance for consideration. These steps were all a part of an attempt to improve the nature and extent of basic water-, sanitation-, human settlements- and environmental management in the Westonaria, Carletonville and Khutsong areas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the global scale and on geological time scales, mechanical erosion and chemical weathering budgets are linked. Together, these processes contribute to the formation and the degradation of the Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s critical zone and to the biogeochemical cycles of elements. While the weathering of hot and humid shields areas exhibit low weathering rates because of the depth of the mature depleted soil mantle there, shields areas dominate the continents areas over intertropical regions and, therefore, represent a significant proportion of the global delivery of dissolved matter to the oceans. In addition, these environments are under supply-limited conditions (the weathering rate is limited by the low rates of the erosion) and thus particularly sensitive to long-term variability erosion rates. Despite this importance, weathering-erosion budgets and rates estimation in these environments is sparse, and generally performed at a local scale (soil profiles) or, when performed at a larger catchment scale, the intra cratonic characteristics variabilities (e. g. the diversity of mechanical erosional regimes) are usually not singled out.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the present study, we explored the variability of the weathering intensity of the Ogoou&amp;amp;#233; sub-basins (Western central Africa, Gabon) as a function of their geomorphologic, tectonic and lithological setting variability. We analyzed major and trace elements concentration and the strontium and neodymium isotopes of water, suspended matter sediments and bedload sampled in 24 Ogoou&amp;amp;#233; tributaries (September 2017 campaign). Our results show that shield areas exhibit a high variability of chemical weathering intensity, which follows the erosional regime characteristics of the studied sub-basins, likely related to their tectonic activity. Three regions can be distinguished: The Bateke plateau (East sub-basins - PB), is composed of pure sandstones (quartz) and is inert in term of tectonic activity and therefore in term of erosion and weathering budget; the northern sub-basins (NB) are subjected to low tectonic activity and exhibit slightly higher erosion and weathering intensity than PB region and, by comparison, southern sub-basins (SB) exhibits uplift activity which is traduced by more intensive erosion and weathering processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The annual dissolved solid budget of the Ogoou&amp;amp;#233; basin is ~2.52 t.yr&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; for a rate of 11.7 t.km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;.yr&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. According to the source discrimination method performed based on the geochemical analysis, the atmospheric inputs contributes to around 20% to the TDS, the silicate weathering contribution dominates the dissolved exports throughout 70% of its production while the carbonates weathering lowly contributes to the TDS production.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By comparison to the other large shields rivers, this basin exhibit a lower range of chemical silicate weathering rate than most of the world&amp;amp;#8217;s large rivers, with values similar to those of the Congo River. This new dataset provides a key information to complete the World River chemistry database, which is limited for inter-tropical regions, especially in tectonically quiescent environments. Moreover, this study provides new data for tropical shields contexts allowing for the exploration of the interactions between erosion rates and climate in the control of continental weathering rates, and their relationships with long-term carbon cycle and short-term biogeochemical cycles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

There are some parameters like length and diameter of pipes, for which fairly accurate values can be obtained. As with all hydraulic models, water demands are one of the main parameters that cause the most uncertainty in the model outputs. The calibration of the water demands is usually not feasible, which is attributable to the limited quantity of available measurements in most real water networks. However, some parameters like nodal demands and pipe roughness coefficients are estimated close to the actual values. Various types of valves are used for flow control by throttling. Hence, their setting in the field is also an important input to the model. Having more precise data helps in reducing time and results in better calibration as presented in the case study of one hydraulic zone served from Ramnagar Elevated Service Reservoir (ESR) (Zone II) in Nagpur City, Maharashtra State, India. This paper aims at presenting the complexities and challenges involved in calibration of the study area. It further describes the entire process from collection of the required data to the calibration of the network.</jats:p>",

The supply chain deals with multiple items that compete for storage space and transportation capacity with multi-modal transportation considering regional capacity constraint for each mode of transportation. The objective is to determine an optimal storage and transportation plan to satisfy the demand of all regions without shortages for known procurement plan for all items. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for minimizing the total costs over a finite planning horizon. An MIP-based fix-and-optimize (F&amp;O) heuristic with several decomposition schemes is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. The performance of the decomposition schemes is investigated against the structure of the sub-problems obtained. To enhance the performance, F&amp;O is crossbred with two metaheuristics – genetic algorithm (GA) and iterated local search (ILS) separately, which lead to hybrid heuristic approach. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed solution methodology by randomly generating several problem instances built using data collected from the Indian Public Distribution System. The proposed solution approach is found to be computationally efficient and effective, and outperforming state of the art MIP solver Cplex for practical size problem instances. Also, the hybridization of F&amp;O heuristic with GA and ILS boosts its performance although with a justified increase in the computational time.</jats:p>",

What competitive inventory policy behavior arises under these various payment-timing arrangements? Academic/practical relevance: Technology advancements are increasing the variety of payment triggers between supply chain stages. However, traditional multiechelon inventory models, which were originally developed for vertically integrated systems, do not explicitly account for payments flowing up the supply chain nor issues of payment timing between stages. Methodology: We introduce an analytical modeling methodology to incorporate financial inventory costs generated by payment-timing arrangements between stages in multiechelon inventory models. We also combine these methods with established inventory theory to study competitive inventory policies in a two-echelon system. Results: Under a class of payment-timing contracts, we show how to express payment flows at each stage in terms of standard physical inventory metrics and the demand-arrival process. We also show how to calculate the average inventory costs for each stage under given inventory policies and payment-timing contracts. In the two-echelon base-stock model, we first show that the cost of decentralization under standard wholesale price contracts is significantly driven by too much inventory at the supplier; it is not exclusively driven by too little inventory at the retailer as in the selling-to-the-newsvendor literature. We show that wholesale price contracts with a type of popular consignment payment timing still leads to too little inventory at the retailer. However, we prove there exists a wholesale price contract with partial consignment timing that can achieve the centralized inventory levels at both the supplier and the retailer. Managerial implications: Researchers can leverage our methodology to incorporate the price transfers and timing aspects of contracts in multiechelon inventory models. Our insights also help managers better understand the impact of prices and payment timing on decentralized chain behavior and performance. </jats:p>",

Of the numerous problems that have arisen and been solved by the group of researchers, only those referring to the mechanical behavior of the materials used for pipes are presented. HDPE, which is a thermoplastic material, is suitable for manufacturing the pipes used in water supply networks, having many advantages. Data on the mechanical properties of the material of which the pipe and elbow are made is obtained experimentally. The work involved the main steps required to design a water network, but the subject is not exhausted. The stresses in the polyethylene pipe are determined in two cases: buried in the ground and supported in a concrete massif. Thus, by calculation, the advantage offered by the second solution is justified. The crack of the pipes manufactured from HDPE is studied, taking into account the classical model used in the cracking process. A simulation of pipes and elbows cracking was made.

In terms of spatial distribution, the ecosystem service supply took on an obvious trend of gradual decrease from the northwest to the southeast, with major ecosystem service supply coming from the northwest. (2) The construction land ecosystem service demand equivalent of Haidian District was characterized by a multicenter cluster: the high equivalent area was in the southeast, while the equivalent of the northwest was relatively low. POI kernel density estimation demonstrated cluster distribution, with a high kernel density estimation in the southeast, a lower kernel density estimation in the central part, and the lowest kernel density estimation in the northwest. The ecosystem service demand index also showed cluster distribution: high index in the southeast, low index in the northwest, and prominent sudden changes from the central part to the south. (3) The bivariate local spatial autocorrelation cluster diagram method was used to divide five types of ecosystem service supply and ecosystem service demand, namely non-significant correlation region, high ecosystem service supply and high ecosystem service demand region, high ecosystem service supply and low ecosystem service demand region, low ecosystem service supply and high ecosystem service demand region, low ecosystem service supply and low ecosystem service demand region. Grids with the highest ratio belonged to the non-significant correlation region; the distribution of low ecosystem service supply and high ecosystem service demand region had the greatest concentration, mainly in the southeast; the grids of high ecosystem service supply and low ecosystem service demand region were mainly present in the northwest and in a continuous way; the grids of low ecosystem service supply and low ecosystem service demand region, and high ecosystem service supply and high ecosystem service demand region were extremely few, with sporadic distribution in the central part. The research results could provide a basis for the adjustment and fine management of regional land use structure.</jats:p>"

Researches on anomaly detection method of satellite power systems can improve the reliability of normal satellite operations. Fixed top and bottom limitations for telemetry parameters are often used in engineering to detect anomalies of telemetry parameters, but the detection thresholds do not change with time and can neither reflect the dynamic tendency of telemetry parameters nor anomalies that occur during dynamic changes of telemetry parameters. In order to solve this problem, this paper puts forward a dynamic detection method for finding anomalous satellite power supply telemetry parameters by comparing predicted values and real-time telemetry data by using dynamic characteristics of satellite power supply telemetry parameters and the Bayesian Model. This method can be used to verify telemetry data of voltage parameters of the storage battery of satellite actually in orbit. The results show that this method can effectively detect anomalies of satellite power supply.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, common issues occurred such as the fluctuation of the stock price and chili, the low exchange values of farmers in prices because of the complicated flow distribution chain. Furthermore, chili is quickly decomposed, but the demand is high enough. The solutions are to predict the demand for supply chain management, to make payment transactions of agricultural needs of farmers by analyzing stocks, raw materials, price to the chain of distribution, also to build trade links among farmers, consumers and Semarang District Agriculture Service. This journal discussed the flow of supply chain and logistics. We recommend to use the latest technology called Hyperledger Blockchain and IOT so that they can make it easier to carry out the transaction process because it is simple, low cost, transparent, faster. It also has high data security, and simplify ecosystems can be easy to exchange information quickly through Hyperledger Blockchain transactions so that the potential of this technology can bring benefits to farmers and consumers by creating the construction of a trusted distribution network that will bring a data transparency solution so that it can become a suggestion for the Semarang District Agriculture Service.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a multi-objective, multi-period inventory routing problem in the supply chain of perishable products under uncertain costs. In addition to traditional objectives of cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission minimization, a novel objective of priority index maximization has been introduced in the model. The priority index quantifies the qualitative social aspects, such as coordination, trust, behavior, and long-term relationships among the stakeholders. In a multi-echelon supply chain, the performance of distributor/retailer is affected by the performance of supplier/distributor. The priority index measures the relative performance index of each player within the supply chain. The maximization of priority index ensures the achievement of social sustainability in the supply chain. Moreover, to model cost uncertainty, a time series integrated regression fuzzy method is developed. This research comprises of three phases. In the first phase, a mixed-integer multi-objective mathematical model while considering the cost uncertainty has been formulated. In order to determine the parameters for priority index objective function, a two-phase fuzzy inference process is used and the rest of the objectives (cost and GHG) have been modeled mathematically. The second phase involves the development of solution methodology. In this phase, to solve the mathematical model, a modified interactive multi-objective fuzzy programming has been employed that incorporates experts’ preferences for objective satisfaction based on their experiences. Finally, in the third phase, a case study of the supply chain of surgical instruments is presented as an example. The results of the case provide optimal flow of products from suppliers to hospitals and the optimal sequence of the visits of different vehicle types that minimize total cost, GHG emissions, and maximizes the priority index.</jats:p>"

However, most of the existing studies focusing on the quality problems of fresh agri-products are mainly cases studies and statistical analyses, and they do not take into account the farmers’ willingness to comply with safe agri-food supply procedures. To solve the supply quality problems of fresh agri-foods and help participators make a better choice, the decision-making behavior on the supply quality of agri-foods in the e-supply chain was deeply studied in this paper using game theory. Some factors related to the decision behavior of the supply chain were analyzed, including the supervision intension of the government, the rights protection consciousness of consumers, and the intensity of punishment for poor-quality agri-foods. These factors have an important influence on the farmers’ willingness to provide high-quality products and e-business’ probability of inspection. Compared with three different decision models of agri-food e-supply chains, the results show that the decentralized decision model is better than the centralized model from the view of quality protection. The behavior of members of the supply chain is as follows: the farmers’ willingness to supply high-quality agri-foods increases with the increase in the consumers’ consciousness of their rights and the government’s supervision intensity. The “experience deviation” phenomenon also occurs when a new e-business makes a decision about its quality inspection behavior in this e-supply chain where the quality information is traceable. As such, e-business enterprises should reduce their quality inspection behavior based on the increase in the government’s supervision intensity. This happens to be opposite to the traditional experience where quality information is not traceable. This study not only extends the research framework of the novel electronic supply chain, but also provides a certain reference for the subsequent research and e-business practices of fresh produce in developing countries.</jats:p>"

The results showed 1) The structure of the cayenne pepper supply chain in Gorontalo Province consists of seven distribution channels. Sale of cayenne pepper by farmers through collectors (40 percent), wholesalers (26.67 percent), market traders (10 percent), and retailers (23.33 percent). The primary members of the cayenne supply chain consist of farmers, collectors, wholesalers, out-of-town traders, market traders, retailers, consumers, and agroindustries. The secondary members are farm shops, banks, transportation service providers, the Agriculture Service, and information media. 2) The most efficient distribution channel is channel six because the smallest marketing efficiency value is 3.17 percent. The cayenne pepper’s market in Gorontalo runs inefficiently because it has a price transmission elasticity value of 1.11 (Et&gt; 1). It means the rate of change in prices at the consumer level is greater than the rate of change in prices at the farmer’s level.</jats:p>",

Their operation is based on cogeneration, which is the conversion of chemical fuel energy into electrical and thermal energy. At the same time, a significant part of the heat supply sources are still represented by heating boilers, which consume electricity for their own needs. In the gas industry, diesel engines are used as the drive for gas pumping plants. One of the factors hindering the organization of combined production of electric and thermal energy in heating boilers is the lack of production in Russia of gas-piston power plants with a capacity of more than 500 kW. The use of imported equipment for these purposes is usually not economically and technologically justified. According to the order of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia dated 16.04.2019 No. 1327, the share of imports of gas piston and gas turbine units is planned to be reduced from 70% in 1918 to 25% in 2024. One of the promising directions of creating gas piston installations in Russia is justified: reproduction on a modern technological basis of two-stroke engines produced in the USSR of GD100 series gas piston engines that are still working at a number of facilities. The Russian government is considering converting mainline and shunting locomotives of railway transport to gas-powered fuel. One of the ways of increasing the efficiency of two-stroke engines is shown-in-cylinder mixing of gas with air with pre-chamber-flare spark ignition.</jats:p>",

Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, observation and documentary analysis were used in the data collection, whereas thematic analysis was applied in the data analyses process. The research findings supported the widely held public perception that skills mismatch exist on the Ghanaian labour market. Besides, the HND Purchasing and Supply practitioners were found to lack managerial skills, confidence (psyche), analytical skills, critical thinking skills, specification development skills, computer skills in terms of data entry, word processing, excel and power point capabilities. Unfortunately, the study did not establish the existence of any practical on the job training in industry to resolve the identified skills deficiency. Although the research revealed that the Public Procurement Authority ( PPA) has been organizing some internships for HND Purchasing and Supply graduates, they still lack hands-on/ practical experience. Nonetheless, the study has confirmed the relevance to practice of the skills set imparted through HND Purchasing and Supply programme.&#x0D;\nKeywords: skills set, skills mismatch, purchasing and supply, job market, unemployment.</jats:p>"

An analysis of the water supply situation during transition from intermittent to continuous supply in a referent sector called Riberas de Sacramento was carried out on the behavior of the network, the operating criteria of the system and the demand of the sector. For the consumption analysis, three consecutive years of data collected by government institution from micro meters were analyzed. In order to characterize the hybrid demand pattern to operate the network, prior site analysis determined the minimum amounts of pressures and consumption records to obtain series of data for analysis. After the review of the transition from intermittent to continuous water supply and the establishment of methodology to characterize the hybrid demand pattern, the need for a hybrid demand pattern is required, and this experiment design gives part to achieve it.</jats:p>",

This paper also theorizes comprehensive SSCM practices and sustainable performance models of firms and evaluates them empirically. Two aspects of SSCM experiences have been integrated into the model: internal management and external management practices of a firm’s sustainability impact assessment. Research methodology: Using the data from 297 manufacturing firms in Pakistan, this research paper analyzes the influence of sustainable supply chain management practices on sustainable performances of firms with the moderation of process innovation in the said relationship. In this study, we used partial least-squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) for data analysis. Results: The findings demonstrate that both internal management and external management SSCM practices have a positive and significant impact on a firm’s sustainable performance, thus supporting hypotheses (H1–H4). Moreover, process innovation as a moderator has a statistically significant relationship between hypotheses H5 and H5c. Originality: For Pakistani firms, comprehensive performance models of SSCM practices are proposed and empirically evaluated. The results of this study help to support the hypotheses that internal and external SSCM practices are necessary for the service sector. Process innovation plays an important role if managed and implemented properly. A number of internal and external SSCM approaches and implications are recommended, along with firm size as a moderator.</jats:p>"

One of the practical ways to make supply chains more sustainable is for enterprises to utilize green innovation strategies and to increase resource reuse. In this work, we focus on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer, and a collector. In the investigated CLSC, the manufacturer and the retailer drive the green innovation strategy either individually or simultaneously to boost market demand. In the reverse flow of the CLSC, the collector is responsible for collecting consumers’ used products and transferring them to the manufacturer for remanufacturing. By combining two types of the market leadership and three types of green innovation strategies, we establish six different Stackelberg game models and solve them analytically. Through an extensive comparative analysis, we show who should have market leadership and who should drive the green innovation strategy in the CLSC. Various numerical examples are also given to support our major findings. One of our key findings suggests that the supply chain members must participate in green innovation activities at the same time to achieve a win-win scenario in the CLSC.</jats:p>"

The survey was conducted through distributing questionnaires to 48 samples of  batik SMEs in Yogyakarta city  selected by simple random sampling method then the data was analyzed using path analysis with SPSS 15. The results of the study found a significant positive effect of IS on SCP indicated by the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.374 and t count&gt; t table at a significance level of 5% (4,976&gt; 2,014). Then the significant positive effect of IS on CR is shown by the value of the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.453 and the value of t count&gt; t table at the significance level of 5% (4.540&gt; 2.014). Then the significant positive effect of CR on SCP is shown by the value of the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.360 and the value of t count&gt; t table at the significance level of 5% (3.896&gt; 2.014). Finally, the significant positive effect of IS on the SCP that is mediated by CR is shown by the sum of the coefficients of 0.537 then tested using the sobel test and produces z count&gt; t table at a significance level of 5% (3.078&gt; 2.014).

The diagnostic process here consists of the following three stages: detection of the fact of the accident, assessment of the quality level of the system operation and search of the emergency area. To solve the problem, the researchers resort to the method of discriminative analysis. This method makes it possible to use information about the values of such controlled parameters as pressure at the network certain points and discharge in the network sections thus assessing if the technical condition under diagnosis belongs to one of the emergency subsets. The method also involves the decision procedure constructed in the multidimensional space of the observed indicators proving the emergency conditions.</jats:p>",

The Limburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) was used to simulate the roads&amp;amp;#8217; impact on soil erosion. Eight rainfall events, monitored from 2014 to 2017, were calibrated. Rainfall ranged from 9 to 97 mm, total runoff volume (Q) varied from 1462 to 60765 m&amp;amp;#179; and SY from 0.6 to 81 tons. These events represent different precipitation and land use conditions, so that the road&amp;amp;#8217;s effects on the hydrological dynamics of this catchment may be investigated. Then, modeling scenarios consisting of three levels of intervention to mitigate sediment supply were tested. &amp;amp;#160;The low intervention (LI) level was based on cost-efficient practices, applied to the road only through the installation of rockfill and energy-deflecting small reservoirs. The medium intervention (MI) included the sowing of grass for gutter protection on the road area and filter strips were installed near the drainage channels. For the high intervention scenario (HI), additional grass strips were installed on hillslopes. Their impact was evaluated by comparing the hydrosedimentological variables Q (m&amp;amp;#179;), peak flow (L s&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;-1&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;) and SY (tons), modelled at the catchment&amp;amp;#8217;s outlet. Rockfill and energy-deflecting small reservoirs were not enough for reducing peak flow (Qp), on average. Indeed, the main proportion of overland flow originates from other landscape components, such as hillslopes. Under the MI and HI scenarios, Qp decreased by 2 and 46%, respectively. The LI and MI scenarios led to an average Q reduction of 12%, compared to 53% under scenario HI. For one event, HI promoted a reduction of 92% of calculated Q, representing 15,693 m&amp;amp;#179;. HI also showed the most positive effects on limiting SY. It becomes evident that hillslope interventions are necessary, as they allow increasing infiltration, reducing both runoff volume and stream power when the flow reaches the roads. For rainfall events of higher magnitude, it was observed that HI was responsible for reducing Qp between 9 and 25%, while during smaller events, this reduction reached 61 to 93%. This indicates the importance of managing roads in order to reduce runoff energy and concentration, but also to take measures on hillslopes to limit overland flow and erosion inputs, as well as to delay peak Q.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Responsible supply chain management (RSCM) as a growing sub-field of supply chain management (SCM) has gathered increasing consideration from both practitioners and academics for the past two decades. Even though manufacturing firms have implemented RSCM behaviors through this period, there exist, some concerns as to whether these RSCM behaviors are being applied for the effect they have on environmental performance. In recent times, various debates have been opened concerning this RSCM paradox, throwing doubt on whether an investment in the implementation of RSCM behaviors certainly comes with a corresponding environmental performance outcome and, therefore, the commercial benefits of responsibility management in the context of SCM remain open for interrogation. The aim of this study is to explore the impact of responsible supply chain management behaviors on environmental performance among pharmaceutical companies in China. In addition, investigate the intervening roles of process innovation and supply chain integration as mediating and moderating constructs respectively. The research hypothesis were formulated following an extensive study of relevant literature and were based on resource and capability-based theories such as the resource based view, the natural resource based view and the stakeholder theories. The design of the study was explanatory with a confirmatory reach, applied to 123 Chinese pharmaceutical firms selected across, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces. The proposed theoretical model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The empirical findings of the study confirmed that an effective application of RSCM behaviors, process innovation(PI), and supply chain integration(SCI) initiatives positively and significantly improves environmental performance outcomes. This confirms the position of extant literature that there is a positive relationship between RSCM behaviors’ and environmental performance. It also validated the position that process innovation and supply chain integration positively mediates and moderates respectively the relationship between RSCM and environmental performance. Therefore, the findings herein can be considered as complementary to the existing body of knowledge in the field. The practical implications derived from this study will contribute to sustainable development and expand knowledge both in industry and in academia</jats:p>",

The first scenario indicates that feed price falls while supply increases, which decreases the production costs of breeders and grow-out farms.

Drawing on natural resource‐based view and knowledge‐based view, we develop four hypotheses and examine these hypotheses using two‐waved data from 206 Chinese manufacturing firms. We find that green supplier integration has positive effects on both proactive dimension and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. Proactive dimension and reactive dimension of supply chain resilience partially mediate the link between green supplier integration and environmental performance. In addition, knowledge combination strengthens the positive impact of green supplier integration on reactive dimension of supply chain resilience. These findings suggest that supply chain resilience and knowledge combination cannot be overlooked when firms expect to gain environmental profits by conducting green supplier integration.</jats:p>",

Little is empirically known about the obstacles to blockchain adoption, particularly in a supply chain's interorganizational setting. In supply chains, blockchains' benefits, for example, BCT‐based tracking and tracing, are dependent on a critical mass of supply chain actors adopting the technology. While previous research has mainly been conceptual and has lacked both theory and empirical data, we propose a theory‐based model for interorganizational adoption of BCT. We use the proposed model to analyze a unique in‐depth revelatory case study. Our case study confirms previous conceptual work and reveals a paradox as well as several tensions between drivers for and against (positive and negative determining factors, respectively) of BCT adoption that must be managed in an interorganizational setting. In this vertical context, the adoption and integration decision of one supply chain actor recursively affects the adoption and integration decisions of the other supply chain actors. This paper contributes midrange theory on BCT in supply chain management (SCM), future research directions, and managerial insights on BCT adoption in supply chains.</jats:p>",

At the same time the question of a role of the theory of stakeholders in formation and maintenance of chains of deliveries was staticized. The main attention of the concept of interested parties of rather logistic processes has concentrated on the main points of decision-making in a choice of routes for transportation of freights. In article the methodical approach developed by authors to the analysis of extent of influence of interests of stakeholders in management of chains of deliveries within digital transformation of logistics is considered. For a choice of optimum option of transportation of the freights, most realizing the transport capacity of Russia, authors have taken as a basis A. Garrison's fundamental approach, allowing to develop methodical approach to an assessment of interests of stakeholders of the international logistic knot of the country. The circle of the stakeholders (interested parties) involved in process of decision-making on a choice of an optimum route at implementation of transportation of freights is created. The main transnational corridors of transportation of goods from the People's Republic of China in the European Union and criteria by which it is possible to carry out their assessment for a choice of the most acceptable are defined. Methodical approach to an assessment of degree of compliance of routes to certain criteria according to interests of stakeholders is developed. Comparison of criteria among themselves, and also an assessment of their influence in each option of transportation have shown as far as interests of stakeholders of chains of deliveries differ. The hierarchy of the importance of each criterion for the described routes of transportation taking into account interests of stakeholders of chains of deliveries is created. The conclusion is drawn that the main factor in transportation of goods when using capacities of Russia is time. This criterion plays a significant role at a route choice, however at the high cost and insufficient reliability such route will concede in most cases to competitors. Proceeding from it, attraction of opportunities and advantages which can provide other options, becomes quite expedient. Thus, harmonization of the relations of stakeholders is reduced uniting their interests of rather allocated options of transportations on development of Russia as the international logistic knot and to show, what economic benefits they can receive from this interaction.</jats:p>"

Quantifying the amount of particles deposited in water pipes is usually done by obtaining total suspended solid measurements while performing flushing sequences, which requires time, skills, and equipment. Some authors explored the possibility of rapidly approximating total suspended solids concentration (TSSC) in water pipes by measuring water turbidity on site, but they obtained different results and coefficients of correlation. This paper presents the results of tests performed in the laboratory on a test loop. Unidirectional flushing (UDF) and air scouring sequences were performed under various hydraulic conditions and two different particle origins. Samples were obtained along each sequence, and the turbidity and TSSC were measured. The results illustrate that the ratio between turbidity and TSSC may vary greatly between samples, up to 10 times during UDF sequences and 20 times during air scouring sequences. Particle origin, flushing method, and sampling time are all factors impacting the turbidity/TSSC ratio. This is why TSSC should not be estimated from a single turbidity reading.</jats:p>",

This paper investigates the feasibility of grid connected and stand-alone hybrid energy system to meet electric load requirement of a community or organization, by utilizing the available resources. Potentiality of different energy sources like solar, wind, bio-gas, etc. along with currently used energy sources is studied thoroughly by taking a case study of Kathmandu University central campus, located at Dhulikhel, Nepal. Technical and economic analysis of on-grid and off-grid hybrid system is performed to get optimum model that supply continuous energy to the end user. Furthermore, the possibility of net metering with national utility has been analysed. The main objective of this study is to identify the suitable energy mixed model, that provide the sustainable energy supply to the university, and recommend the possible energy generators to be added for fulfilling the continuously increasing load demand. The load profile of several years of the University is taken into consideration for forecasting the power demand. The findings of the research show that system when adopted to hybrid system can meet up to 55% of the load by renewable resources. Maximum renewable fraction is found to be 0.603 and maximum renewable penetration of 812%.</jats:p>",

The object of the study is the natural and economic conditions that determine the feasibility of using renewable energy sources in order to diversify electricity supply. The basis of the study was the data of domestic and foreign scientists in the field of assessing the possibilities of using renewable energy sources.\nThe region of activity of the guaranteeing supplier JSC AtomEnergoSbyt is represented by the Kursk, Smolensk, Tver and Murmansk regions. An assessment of the installed electric power generation capacities made it possible to determine that in the Kursk and Smolensk regions generation with the use of atomic energy predominates. In the Tver region, the largest share of installed capacities is accounted for by nuclear generation, however, thermal generation has a significant share. The installed capacities of the Murmansk region demonstrate significant differentiation. There is generation in the region using atomic, hydrocarbon and renewable energy sources. The region is the only one among the considered regions that uses renewable energy sources. More than half of the generation of electricity in the Murmansk region occurs using renewable energy sources.\nAn assessment of the potential of renewable energy sources in the region of activity of the guaranteeing supplier showed that in the Kursk, Smolensk and Tver regions it is inexpedient to place generation facilities using solar, wind, geothermal and small river energy. In the Murmansk region, on the contrary, there is sufficient potential to accommodate wind and small hydropower plants. An assessment of the bioenergy potential of the livestock industry showed that it is advisable to develop biogas energy in the Kursk, Smolensk and Tver regions, which, on the one hand, will allow the disposal of livestock waste, and, on the other hand, provide small towns with electricity and heat.</jats:p>"

Academic papers on BSC applications for evaluating supply chain performance has an expressively increased in recent years. Considering that examining published papers on a topic is a way of monitoring the emergence of a new field, this study aims to explore, through bibliometry, papers published in indexed journals (SCOPUS and Web of Science databases). This paper weaves an overview of academic production and study trends on BSC for performance evaluation of supply chains. Findings help researchers and managers to understand the state of the art, to identify gaps and to identify future trends. The results also showed the maturation of studies over the years. The predominance of publications in journals with impact factor (Thomson Reuters) also has been noticed. The development of the theme in emerging countries can be useful for increasing the competitiveness of their companies. In summary, this study is helpful for influencing future studies and publications of researchers interested in performance evaluation of supply chains based on BSC and may orient new researchers so that they directly know which journals to consult and which technical procedures to explore.</jats:p>"

By using the proposed upper efficiency non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm, the set of non-dominant solutions are obtained. During optimization process, the upper efficiency data envelopment analysis (SE-DEA) is used to calculate the supper efficiency of the non-dominant solutions. In this way, on the one hand, the algorithm is guided to converge to the optimal efficiency individuals. On the other hand, the non-dominant solutions are sorted to select the optimal one. The example shows that 16 non-dominate solutions are obtained by using proposed algorithm, and the solution with supper efficiency of 0.9538 is determined as the optimal scheme.</jats:p>",

In collagen-based skin disorders this stability is lost, either due to mutations in collagens or in the chaperones involved in collagen assembly. This leads to chronic wounds, skin fragility, and blistering. Existing approaches to treat such conditions rely on administration of small molecules to simulate collagen production, like 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) or growth factors like TGF-β. However, these molecules are not specific for collagen synthesis, and result in unsolicited side effects. Hsp47 is a collagen-specific chaperone with a major role in collagen biosynthesis. Expression levels of Hsp47 correlate with collagen deposition. This article explores the stimulation of collagen deposition by exogenously supplied Hsp47 (collagen specific chaperone) to skin cells, including specific collagen subtypes quantification.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Here we quantify the collagen deposition level and the types of deposited collagens after Hsp47 stimulation in different in vitro cultures of cells from human skin tissue (fibroblasts NHDF, keratinocytes HaCat and endothelial cells HDMEC) and mouse fibroblasts (L929 and MEF). We find upregulated deposition of fibrillar collagen subtypes I, III and V after Hsp47 delivery. Network collagen IV deposition was enhanced in HaCat and HDMECs, while fibril-associated collagen XII was not affected by the increased intracellular Hsp47 levels. The deposition levels of fibrillar collagen were cell-dependent i.e. Hsp47-stimulated fibroblasts deposited significantly higher amount of fibrillar collagen than Hsp47-stimulated HaCat and HDMECs.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>A 3-fold enhancement of collagen deposition was observed in fibroblasts upon repeated dosage of Hsp47 within the first 6 days of culture.

Ayvalık, Türkiye’nin en büyük Doğa ve Tabiat Parkına sahip olmasının yanı sıra zeytin ve zeytinyağıyla Türkiye’de ve Dünya’da tanınmış markalardan biridir. Ayvalık’ta turizm işletme ve belediye belgeli toplam 291 adet konaklama tesisi bulunmaktadır. Ancak bu tesislerin sadece 22’si turizm işletme belgelidir. Bu noktada bölgede turizm işletme belgeli tesis sayısı oldukça azdır. Bu verilere göre Ayvalık’ın bugüne kadar turizm potansiyelini hedeflediği düzeyde değerlendirememesi, turizm işletme belgeli tesis yatırımı ihtiyacına işaret etmektedir.

Increasingly, the focus of legislators is on leaks in the tobacco crop supply chain, in which raw or cured tobacco that was never taxed finds its way to smokers. To study the process undertaken by Poland to secure the tobacco supply chain, we analyzed the 2013–2018 legislation around tobacco supply and interviewed a key stakeholder in the Government of Poland. We found that farmers and intermediary entities can trade tobacco only if registered with the government. Farmers are required to report the size of their fields and the weight of their crops to the state authorities. Each purchase within the supply chain is also reported by both the seller and the buyer for cross-validation. This has prevented manipulation within the system, while the mere threat of heavy fines related to an excise tax law violation and/or the administrative burden associated with becoming an excise tax payer (had the violation been prosecuted) has significantly contributed to securing the tobacco supply chain. The experience of Poland demonstrates that securing the tobacco supply chain is complicated but also a tractable problem. This case can be widely applicable to other countries.</jats:p>"

An enterprise’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) behaviors will affect the interests of other enterprises in the supply chain through transmission, diffusion, amplification, feedback, etc. Therefore, scholars are currently focusing on helping supply chain enterprises to take social responsibility. This paper takes a two-echelon supply chain as an example, which is composed of one manufacturer and one retailer. Considering the influence of lag effect on the performance level of corporate social responsibility, we discuss the optimal strategy of corporate social responsibility in supply chain under centralized and decentralized decision-making. Three incentive models are proposed to improve the implementation effect of decentralized supply chain decision. Study finds that, in real life, decentralized supply chain is more in line with the decision-making mode of supply chain participants, even though centralized decision-making has better operation effect. Under certain circumstances, the mixed contract, which is composed of advertising cooperation, cost sharing and revenue sharing, could lead to supply chain coordination. As an external stakeholder, the government’s subsidy plays a positive role in promoting the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility. Multi-subsidy performs better than single-subsidy. Although the time lag promotes the manufacturer’s social responsibility efforts and the retailer’s advertising, it somehow compromises overall profit of the supply chain. Therefore, manufacturers should try to reduce the lag effect to maintain the overall profitability of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

They are the sources of the so-called “clean energy”, the production of which is not accompanied by harmful emissions into the atmosphere. Renewable energy plants are complex systems with a large number of interconnected elements. Their design requires the solution of a number of problems, which include the selection of the functional, technical and technological structure of the system. The power plants components parameters depend on many factors, including the system’s installation location characteristics, the consumers operating mode features, the system components compatibility with each other. Design automation of power plants based on renewable sources will help reduce the workload on the designer during the system development, thereby will promote wider use of such sources in facility’s energy supply systems. In this work, the authors developed an algorithm and a program based on it for designing a facility’s power supply system with photovoltaic modules as an energy source. The program allows user to select the necessary system components based on databases; evaluate the system effectiveness depending on the facility location; calculate the selected power supply system cost.

In this paper, an integrated method including decomposition technique based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) combined with multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) was carried out to predict daily streamflow values. Daily streamflow value datasets collected from two stations in Iran (Gachsar and Kordkheyl) were selected. After dividing into calibration and validation datasets, each of them was decomposed by EEMD. Crow search algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the MARS parameters (MARS-CSA). The performance of the integrated model (EEMD-MARS-CSA) was investigated by error indices (correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), as well as RMSE to standard deviation ratio (RSR)). From the results, EEMD was an important tool for increasing model accuracy and EEMD-MARS-CSA outperformed other alternative methods for daily streamflow estimation. According to one-day-ahead flow forecasting, EEMD-MARS-CSA (R = 0.94, RMSE = 5.94 m3/s (Kordkheyl) and R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.71 m3/s (Gachsar)) outperformed EEMD-MT/MARS, MT, and MARS models. Furthermore, RSR criterion of EEMD-MARS-CSA was reduced by 18%, 16%, and 17% for 3-days, 1-week, and 2-weeks-ahead streamflow forecasting compared to MARS-CSA model, respectively, for Gachsar station.</jats:p>",

We examine labor supply, food consumption, and overall social welfare under various climate change scenarios. First, we combine nationally representative longitudinal survey data with high-resolution climatic data using an instrumental variable approach. Controlling for calorie intake, our study shows that warming has a non-linear impact on agricultural labor supply, with the number of hours worked being optimized at an optimal temperature of 21.3°C. Using these econometric estimates to parametrize an overlapping generations model, we find that under RCP8.5, output per adult decreases by 20 per cent by the end of the century due to the combined effect of climate change on food consumption and labor supply.</jats:p>",

An increase or decrease in accommodation causes the fluvial system to respond by either aggrading or degrading to a new equilibrium slope. However, in recent years the role of upstream drivers, such as water discharge and sediment supply (volume and grain-size distribution), in controlling equilibrium slopes has gained more importance, however we still lack significant understanding of these upstream processes. It is important to be able to differentiate between stratigraphy influenced by upstream and downstream drivers in the field because fluvial deposits represent an important archive of environmental changes.&amp;amp;#160; Traditionally, downstream drivers are often invoked to explain past accommodation changes, but in actuality there are rarely robust constraints on the cause of these space changes. At present there is still no well-documented examples of upstream versus downstream driven stratigraphic architecture. One way to address this issue is by undertaking analogue modelling (i.e. flume experiments) as this permits the isolation of individual parameters, such as water discharge, and allows us to investigate their role on the fluvial system in a controlled environment. &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;In the first part of the project that we present here, we investigate how sediment aggradation within a channel develops through time by using a quasi-2D flume.&amp;amp;#160; We have designed and manufactured a narrow (0.05 m), long (2.4 m) flume with an initial gradient of zero.&amp;amp;#160; We aim to (i) investigate how aggradation occurs through time using a series of different water discharges, sediment supplies and sediment concentrations and observe the resulting equilibrium slopes; (ii) perturb the system once equilibrium is reached to observe the readjustment of the system to new conditions; (iii) carry out a series of experiments varying downstream drivers (i.e. sea-level) which theoretically produce the same amount of aggradation as the upstream parameters we have used do, we will then be able to compare any similarities or differences in stratigraphy.&amp;amp;#160; Ultimately we will use these results to scale up to a fully three-dimensional analogue model (i.e. a wide flume, approximately 1 m) that produces channels and floodplains.&amp;amp;#160; We can then investigate how the upstream and downstream changes seen in the narrow flume are translated into the wider flume.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

In fact, the quality reference effect is also an important factor which influences consumer purchasing behavior. We aim to explore the influence of the reference effect on the optimal decisions and performance of a dual-channel supply. Thus, we formulate dynamic models that include the product quality reference effect and the service quality reference effect in a dual-channel supply chain system consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer under the different decision-making scenarios. Utilizing differential game theory, optimal decisions are obtained for the product quality and service quality decision under the different decision-making scenarios. In addition, the optimal decisions and profits are compared, then a service cost-sharing coordinating mechanism is proposed and proven to be effective in the supply chain system. The main results show when the initial reference service quality is low, the consumer service quality reference effect is beneficial to the manufacturer. The spillover effect of service quality is not conducive to the retailer and the manufacturer. When the initial reference product quality is low, both online and offline product quality reference effects are beneficial to the retailer and the manufacturer. The stable (or final) reference quality will not be affected by the initial reference quality. The sum of the two members’ profits under decentralized decision making is less than the total profit of the supply chain under centralized decision making.

On the other hand, scientific research produces high quality models, algorithms and schemes capable of solving the water problems, but scientists often struggle when it comes to deploy tools that deliver their research outcomes to stakeholders and decision makers that ultimately will use them. The principal goal of this project is to fill the gap between the development of innovative research methodologies and their practical usability in the real world. We present &amp;amp;#8220;RApp&amp;amp;#8221;, a web-based application written purely in R within the Shiny framework and developed in collaboration with the water supply company Romagna Acque SpA. RApp simulates and visualizes the behavior of the reservoir that sustains the drinking water supply system of the Romagna region, Italy, in order to support its optimal management. Reservoir simulations are obtained connecting, through a unique and site-specific modelling chain, the inflows from the upstream catchments, the functioning of the reservoir, the potential of the treatment plant and the water demand. The optimized monthly-based management rules were obtained off-line, through a multi-objective optimization algorithm by maximizing the water yields and, at the same time, minimizing the occurrence of water outages during drought periods. The RApp user can produce quick reports of the past and expected reservoir yields and stored volumes, in terms of either graphical or table outputs, as a function of different initial and boundary conditions provided by the users, such as the initial stored volume, the expected inflows, the adoption of optimized or user-defined management rules, the occurrence of an abrupt change in the water demand, thus, allowing stakeholders to explore the impact of different scenarios and management options.

An empirical formula was presented by briefly arranging the required air quantity formula, and a quick reference was prepared by putting air supply in the conductivity range sequentially. The performance evaluation was judged based on the removal efficiency of ammonia nitrogen and total inorganic nitrogen, SNR and SDNR, the change of air supply, the stability of the process against inflow change.Results and Discussion : The seasonal correlation coefficients of conductivity and water quality items were calculated in the order of ammonia nitrogen, total inorganic nitrogen, DOC, and phosphate in the range of 0.5267 ~ 0.9115. It was found that the conductivity could be used as an operation indicator of the biological treatment process with a correlation coefficient of 0.5 or more. The regression equations for the conductivity and ammonia nitrogen are secured by season, so it is possible to estimate the ammonia nitrogen through the conductivity. At the end of the aerobic basin DO was 3.4 mg/L, the nitrogen treatment efficiency in winter was the best. The aerobic basin DO can be controlled by the air supply, and it can be seen that it is possible to control the air supply and improve the nitrogen treatment efficiency by directly measuring the conductivity having a high correlation with nitrogen. An empirical formula for estimating the required air volume through conductivity and inflow is presented. A' and (B' + X') are 0.0589 (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-air/h)/(m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h)/(μS/cm) and –77.562 (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-air/h)/(m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h). The result of automatic control of air supply according to the measured conductivity of anoxic tank during winter season showed that total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency and SDNR were 8.3% and 0.007 g-N/g-MLSS/d higher than the actual plant conditions, respectively. During the automatic control period, the air supply/inflow average ratio was 36 (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-air/h)/(m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h), which could reduce the air supply by 21.7% compared to the actual plant conditions.Conclusions : The air supply can be estimated from the flow rate and conductivity. The air supply control technology of the conductivity-based MLE process will be able to simultaneously improve nitrogen removal efficiency and reduce energy consumption.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Anterior cranial fossa (ACF) dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) are mainly fed by the ethmoidal arteries and sometimes have pial arterial feeders. DAVFs with pial arterial supply in ACF are extremely rare because most of the reported cases of DAVFs with pial arterial supply are located at the transverse sigmoid sinus and tentorium. A 68-year-old male presented with dizziness. Angiography showed cortical venous reflex (CVR) through an ACF DAVF fed by both bilateral ethmoidal arteries and by the right orbitofrontal artery as a pial feeder. The ethmoidal feeders were disconnected by craniotomy. The pial arterial feeder from the anterior cerebral artery was not found during surgery, and disconnection of the draining vein was not performed. CVR showed a significant reduction after the surgery. After 2 years of follow-up, angiography revealed an increased shunt flow from the pial feeder. Endovascular treatment using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate was performed, resulting in the complete occlusion of the fistula. DAVFs with pial supply are reported to carry a high risk of perioperative complications because of the restriction of the venous outflow and retrograde thrombosis of the pial artery. Endovascular pial feeder occlusion after surgical dural arterial feeder disconnection might achieve a safe and effective outcome. With close follow-up, the recurrence of increased shunt flow may be an appropriate timing for additional treatment. This rare condition may offer a new insight into the mechanisms of pial feeder development.</jats:p>",

Western countries are actively implementing mobile applications-services for household energy users. In Belarus, there is a positive dynamics in the number of active users of applications-services, every year it is possible to attract 7 % of unique customers. In the present paper the experience of implementation and operation of the mobile application for power systems is analyzed. The dynamics of the market of mobile applications-services has been traced: the amount of time spent by the person in interaction with the device was determined as well as the total expenditure of funds in the application at the moment; also, the growth of expenses within the applications was forecasted. The potential benefits for business and end-users of services from the implementation of mobile applications-services were demonstrated. Their properties, main qualities and advantages over traditional methods of “business – client” interaction are considered. A number of features needed for the successful functioning of the mobile application in the power system of Belarus are identified. The process of creating software for smart devices has been studied and the functionality needed by the mobile application for the power system has been proposed for attracting new users. A special algorithm for the launch and successful “life cycle” of a mobile application has been proposed. It allows to operate and develop mobile applications-services as efficiently as possible, as well as to avoid the most common errors at the stages of their development and launch. The implementation of a mobile application in the power system of the Republic of Belarus, in the long-term, will significantly increase customer loyalty, simplify interaction with users, make it possible to build new models of distribution of electricity, and, consequently, regulate the demand for energy resources.<jats:bold /></jats:p>"

An electrically enhanced filter was installed in the HVAC system of an office building and its removal efficiency for particles was altered by using a separate particle charging section in power on and off positions. The effect of air filtration on indoor particle concentrations was determined by using an automated measurement system which was continuously sampling from the outdoor air, filtered supply air and exhaust air. With the aid of the measured outdoor and modelled indoor concentrations the indoor/outdoor ratio of particles of outdoor origin could be accurately determined. External charging of the particles increased the electret filters removal efficiency for 0.4 µrn size particles from 60% to 95%, resulting in decrease of the average I/O ratio of the same size particles from 0.67 to 0.40. Despite the high improvement in the supply air filtration efficiency the indoor concentrations decreased only modestly which is likely due to the leaky construction of the building, demonstrating the detrimental effect of air infiltration on the protection provided by buildings against outdoor airborne hazards. Practical implications: The developed method allows quantification of the key parameters affecting the protection of buildings against outdoor contaminants, thus allowing accurate estimation of size resolved indoor to outdoor ratios for fine particles. The electrically enhanced filter can remove effectively also submicron particles thus reducing the occupant exposure to outdoor hazardous or harmful materials. Best results can be achieved with airtight buildings.</jats:p>",

The manufacturer makes the channel selection decision between a dual channel and an omni‐channel. We formulate a retailer Stackelberg game and characterize the equilibrium pricing and service solutions under centralized and decentralized cases. Our results indicate that the service value of a physical store strongly influences the players' pricing strategies. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the total revenue of the supply chain increases with the market scale expansion coefficient of the BOPS option.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The wide voltage design methodology has been widely employed in the state-of-the-art circuit design with the advantage of remarkable power reduction and energy efficiency enhancement. However, the timing verification issue for multiple PVT (process–voltage–temperature) corners rises due to unacceptable analysis effort increase for multiple supply voltage nodes. Moreover, the foundry-provided timing libraries in the traditional STA (static timing analysis) approach are only available for the nominal supply voltage with limited voltage scaling, which cannot support timing verification for low voltages down to near- or sub-threshold voltages. In this paper, a learning-based approach for wide voltage design is proposed where feature engineering is performed to enhance the correlation among PVT corners based on a dilated CNN (convolutional neural network) model, and an ensemble model is utilized with two-layer stacking to improve timing prediction accuracy. The proposed method was verified with a commercial RISC (reduced instruction set computer) core under the supply voltage nodes ranging from 0.5 V to 0.9 V. Experimental results demonstrate that the prediction error is limited by 4.9% and 7.9%, respectively, within and across process corners for various working temperatures, which achieves up to 4.4× and 3.9× precision enhancement compared with related learning-based methods.</jats:p>"

This is performed by adjusting the supply and demand balance by power exchange from areas with surplus reserve capacity to areas with insufficient reserve capacity using cross‐regional interconnection lines. By using our supply and demand control model considering the adjustable range that can respond to a fluctuation after 10 min (10‐min spinning reserve, <jats:italic>SR</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub>), we quantitatively evaluate the margin of <jats:italic>SR</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub> (<jats:italic>SR</jats:italic><jats:sub>10_<jats:italic>margin</jats:italic></jats:sub>) by subtracting the 10‐min residual load fluctuation from <jats:italic>SR</jats:italic><jats:sub>10</jats:sub> in the local area.

Moreover, the use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) with Remote Sensing imagery in surveying, modernizing and developing Baghdad city complex water supply network is discussed. The data of land-use and current water supply system was generated using the Quick Bird Satellite Image (0.6m resolution data, 2015) with a map of the city of Baghdad at scale 1:25000 and field update survey. The necessary water supply system maps and data were collected from the Mayoralty of Baghdad (MoB). The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the contour map were generated from the LiDAR point cloud. All these techniques and geospatial data were mapped and analyzed in ArcGIS 10.2.2 software. The outputs of the study were the water distribution network with the position of projects, reservoirs, pipelines, etc. The interpretation of the geospatial database with analytical tools allowed the water distribution network to be planned more economically and effectively.</jats:p>",

Based on the statistical data from 2001 to 2018, the paper estimated and tested the parameters of the disequilibrium model of effective supply and demand, and calculated the disequilibrium degree of effective supply and demand in China’s assembled property market. The results indicated that China’s assembled property market was not effective and equilibrium, but obviously imbalanced and fluctuated. The research results provided strong empirical evidence for revealing that price distortion was one of the important factors causing the disequilibrium in China’s assembled property market. In order to develop healthily and improve the level of social welfare, the government should take it as a basic policy in the future to eliminate the disequilibrium of effective supply and demand in the assembled property market.</jats:p>",

Kiribati, however, does not have a strong history of using seaweed in their diets, despite having reliable access to indigenous edible seaweeds. A series of peer-led seaweed training workshops held in Kiribati between 2018 and 2019 provided women with knowledge, skills, and motivational support needed to engage in the seaweed supply chain, from harvesting, processing, and marketing to consumption. This study aimed to identify opportunities and enablers to support women’s participation across the seaweed supply chain. Structured interviews with 49 women explored their interest and expected costs and benefits from involvement in the supply chain. There was high interest in most seaweed-related activities and the key motivators were health and nutrition for themselves and their family. Participants were also interested in developing and sharing new skills and saw the potential for income generation. However, there were also clear barriers including a desire for further training in seaweed harvesting, processing, and recipe creation; additional social support; and in public promotion. Given the natural resources and desire of women to engage in developing this new edible seaweed supply chain in Kiribati, there is now a need for capacity development to build social and economic wellbeing and food security across the broader community. Additional peer-to-peer training opportunities may look to other Pacific Islands where seaweed is already an established and traditional food.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Circular economy is an alternative to the traditional production model and has therefore attracted a great deal of attention from researchers. The change in the production system is accompanied by new logistical needs related both to resources and waste and to the distribution and recovery of products. The circular supply chain involves return processes and the manufacturer intends to capture additional value in the supply chain. In this paper, value chains have been mapped to visualize the links and interactions between the different stages and actors to understand the complexities of these systems and to make informed decisions. For this reason, and based on thorough literature review, the final objective of this work is to achieve a conceptual framework to study circular supply chain, which uses the main theoretical perspectives in strategic management literature. Four dimensions have been identified to support the development of these new supply chains—greater intensity in the relationships established in the supply chain, adaptation of logistics and organizational, disruptive and smart technologies, and a functioning environment. It can be concluded that to develop a new relationship capacity will allow for reaching more frequent, closer relationships with more actors. These relationships will be developed within an adapted organizational and logistical framework that is framed in new business model archetypes. However, dimensions related to the business environment such as sectoral, legislative, and fiscal frameworks must be incorporated.</jats:p>"

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is one of the tools in advancing construction technology today. On the other hand, supply chain construction continues to grow and becomes important in project management. This study aims to identify the potential use of BIM in construction supply chain management. Preliminary studies on several projects in Indonesia were carried out as identification methods. The Delphi process was used to obtain the data described in the Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis. As a result, BIM has the potential to be applied to the construction SCM with several considerations. There are 5 trends in strength, 4 trends in weakness, 5 trends in opportunity, and 3 trends in threat. Trends in strength and opportunity are used as indicators in the analysis of impacts. BIM as advanced technology is the highest indicator and the lowest trust between stakeholders in the application of BIM in the construction supply chain. In addition, harmonization between BIM actors is needed: the Ministry of Public Works, contractors, suppliers and academics in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Dredging is required between the shore and the deep trough to allow water to be introduced into the intake during low water season. Based on the intake dredging project, this study established a numerical model of water and sediment transport of the research area. The model is verified in terms of water level, flow velocity, erosion-deposition rate using hydrological and topographical data. The characteristics of water flow and erosion-deposition, before and after the implementation of different dredging schemes, are studied and the influence by dredging project are analyzed from the hydrodynamics perspective. The simulation results show that the water level and flow velocity change before and after the dredging project is less than 0.002m and 0.1m/s. The dredging area before and after the project shows deposition, and the average deposition rate changed by 0.01m/year. research shows that the dredging project only affects the erosion and deposition of the dredging area. The adjustment of the dredging scheme will not have a significant impact on the deposition rate and distribution of the area. The research results can provide a scientific basis for the argumentation and optimization of the water intake dredging scheme.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of closed-loop supply chains has been widely recognized both in academic communities and in industrial sectors. This paper starts from the traditional supply chains and the new self-supply chain of GREE to extract realistic problems, to mainly investigating two noncooperative dynamic pricing policies in a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. Then, it studies the influence of different channel power structures on dynamic decisions and their complexities. Furthermore, the reference price affects the purchase decisions of consumers. Therefore, the model takes into account the influence of reference price of the market demands. Results show that the manufacturer who opens up a direct channel can make a huge profit in the game. In the dynamic game evolution process, the game leader is in a more advantageous position when the system is in a stable region; once entering into the bifurcating region or chaotic region, the game follower needs to adjust his price to follow the leader’s decision in order to make a profit. In addition, the system’s stable region becomes smaller when the market demand becomes more sensitive to the difference between the reference price and the actual price. In this model, if the manufacturer acts as a leader, he is in a more advantageous position when the market is sensitive to channel competition in the stable stage while the result is opposite in the unstable stage. </jats:p>",

No fertilizer was added during the study period (1 year). Irrigation waters and water and soil samples extracted from different soil depths were analysed in laboratory. Considerable changes occurred in soil characteristics over the study period under various treatments. Soil pH increased more than 1 unit under irrigation with treated wastewater produced by the IDAL system while soil irrigated with treated wastewater from the MBR treatment system showed little change and TW irrigated soil evidenced a slight decrease when compared to pH at the beginning of the study. There was also a remarkable increase recorded for EC1:5 of top soils irrigated with treated wastewaters compared to the initial EC of the soil. The results from this study highlighted the benefits of irrigation with treated wastewater from the MBR system due to its lower cost of treatment compared to the IDAL process while providing additional nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus from the wastewater for plant growth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: As part of the FDA’s DSCSA Pilot Project Program, UCLA and its solution partner, LedgerDomain (collectively referred to as the team hereafter), focused on building a complete, working blockchain-based system, BRUINchain, which would meet all the key objectives of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) for a dispenser operating solely on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology.&#x0D;\nMethods: The BRUINchain system requirements include scanning the drug package for a correctly formatted 2D barcode, flagging expired product, verifying the product with the manufacturer, and quarantining suspect and illegitimate products at the last mile: pharmacist to patient, the most complex area of the drug supply chain.&#x0D;\nThe authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden. At the core of this effort was a blockchain-based solution to track and trace changes in custody of drug. As an immutable, time-stamped, near-real-time (50-millisecond latency), auditable record of transactions, BRUINchain makes it possible for supply chain communities to arrive at a single version of the truth. BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States.&#x0D;\nResults: In addition to communicating with the manufacturer directly for verification, BRUINchain also initiated suspect product notifications. During the study, a 100% success rate was observed across scanning, expiration detection, and counterfeit detection; and paperwork reduction from approximately 1 hour to less than a minute.&#x0D;\nThe authors demonstrate a successful implementation where product-tracing notifications are sent automatically to key stakeholders, resulting in enhanced timeliness and reduction in paperwork burden.

BRUINchain was tested with real data on real caregivers administering life-saving medications to real patients at one of the busiest pharmacies in the United States.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nConclusions: By automatically interrogating the manufacturer’s relational database with our blockchain-based system, our results indicate a projected DSCSA compliance cost of 17 cents per unit, and potentially much more depending on regulatory interpretation and speed of verification. We project that this cost could be reduced with manufacturers’ adoption of a highly performant, fully automated end-to-end system based on digital ledger technology (DLT). In an examination of the interoperability of such a system, we elaborate on its capacity to enable verification in real time without a human in the loop, the key feature driving lower compliance cost. With 4.2 billion prescriptions being dispensed each year in the United States, DLT would not only reduce the projected per-unit cost to 13 cents per unit (saving $183 million in annual labor costs), but also serve as a major bulwark against bad or fraudulent transactions, reduce the need for safety stock, and enhance the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to group the communal salt farmer ventures (KUGAR) in Sumenep District to minimize the total transport distance of salt commodities in the food supply chain network. Location coordinates and salt production capacity of each communal salt ventures are required to be able to calculate the total transport distance. Site survey was conducted for each communal salt ventures to mark locations on the Google map and record production capacity. Using the Google map API the distance data between communal salt ventures is collected and built distance matrix from one origin venture to another destination venture. The communal salt ventures grouping is done by the P-Median method. The experiment was conducted with an alternative of 2 groups, 3 groups, 4 groups. Total minimum transport distances as low as 127.82 km are achieved with 4 groupings. The first group was centered at Asapok Angin venture in the village of Pragaan Laok, the sub-district of Pragaan with 13 ventures member. The second group was centered at Mekar Jaya venture in Karanganyar village, Kalianget sub-district with 41 ventures member. The third group was centered at Usaha Bersama VII venture in the village of Gersik Putih, Gapura sub-district with 16 ventures member. The fourth group was centered at Persada Indah VII venture in the village of Kertasada, the Kalianget sub-district with 20 ventures member.</jats:p>",

Related researches mostly refer to qualitative and static analysis, some quantitative studies consider the influence of only one aspect on the status of water supply pipe network such as hydraulic, water quality and static structure, and cannot objectively reflect the health status of pipe network due to neglecting or simplifying the influence of internal hydraulic condition on the health of the pipe network. Comprehensively considering the influencing factors and the hydraulic mechanism during the operation process of pipe network, this study constructs a health evaluation index system for the water supply pipe network, and introduces the triangular fuzzy number theory into the traditional Bayesian water supply network health status evaluation model taking the uncertainty of model structure and data into account. Through applying the method to Yunhe county of Zhejiang Province China, some suggestions for the optimization and transformation of the regional water supply network are proposed, which can provide a basis for ensuring the safety of regional water supply and scientifically determining the renewal sequence of the pipe network.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In addition to pursuing profits, more and more international enterprises are beginning to pay attention to environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR). How to effectively encourage enterprises to undertake more CSR and maintain the sustainable development of society has become an urgent task for managers and researchers. Under this background, this paper considers the recycling of used products for environmental sustainability and takes into account profit donation as a CSR investment. Aiming at the decision-making of single-cycle closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with a dominant retailer when considering government subsidies and CSR investment, and based on the Stackelberg Game analysis technology, we formulate three distinct donation (CSR investment) models; the centralized system’s donation model, the manufacturer’s donation model, and the retailer’s donation model, and by doing system comparisons and numerical examples to analyze the impact of government subsidy and CSR investment on new product pricing and waste product recovery from the perspectives of government, environment and CLSC system. The results show that government subsidy is not only conducive to expanding market demand and increasing waste recycling rates, but also to improving CSR investment levels. Under the two decentralized decision-making models, regardless of whether the dominant retailer makes CSR investment, she can always get more channel profits than the manufacturer. From the view of environmental, economic, and social perspectives, the manufacturer makes CSR investment a better choice, and at this time the government has the best effect of implementing subsidy. Finally, based on the principle of cost sharing, a CSR cost sharing contract which can realize the coordination of CLSC is designed to solve the channel conflict and optimize the decision-making. Counterintuitively, the dominant retailer can gain more profits when it bears more cost in the CSR cost sharing contract.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The conversion of the natural grasslands of the Pampa biome (Southern Brazil) into cropland may lead to an increase in soil erosion rates and sediment delivery to the rivers. Grasslands represent a significant sink of carbon, and according to the literature, 59% of the soil organic carbon (SOC) is lost when pastures are converted into cropland. It makes soils even more vulnerable to water and land degradation. This study aims to evaluate the impact of land use change on the river sediment composition by calculating the sediment contribution of each potential sediment source using organic matter composition, ultra-violet and visible (UV-VIS) spectra derived parameters and fallout radionuclide activities, as potential tracers in a sediment fingerprinting approach. The study site (Ibirapuit&amp;amp;#227; river basin &amp;amp;#8211; 5,942 km&amp;amp;#178;) is located in the Pampa biome, Southern Brazil, were sandy and shallow soils predominate, occupied mainly by native grasslands that are gradually being converted to cropfields, especially soybean. Potential sediment sources were sampled, which include croplands (n=36), native grasslands (n=31), unpaved roads (n=31) and subsurface sources (channel banks (n=18) and gullies (n=16)). Samples were taken from the soil surface layer of croplands and grasslands, as well as from the top layer of exposed sites of gullies, channel banks and unpaved roads. Samples were oven dried (50 &amp;amp;#176;C), gently disaggregated and dry sieved to 63 mm to avoid particle size effects prior to further analysis. Suspended sediment samples were collected using time integrated samplers deployed in the bottom of the river, and during rainfall runoff events at the outlet of the catchment. Organic matter parameters (total organic carbon - TOC, total nitrogen - TN, &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;13&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C and &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;N) were measured using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (EA-IRMS). Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UV-VIS wavelengths was measured using a Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer, and 33 parameters were derived from the spectra. Fallout radionuclide (&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;137&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Cs and &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;210&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;Pb&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;xs&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt;) activities were measured by gamma spectrometry using low-background high-purity germanium detectors. Tracers were selected following a three step procedure, including: (i) a conservative range test, (ii) a Kruskal&amp;amp;#8211;Wallis H-test, and (iii) a linear discriminant function analysis. The selected tracers were introduced into a mass balance mixing model to estimate the source contributions to in-stream sediment by minimizing the sum of square residuals. TOC and TN show significant differences between cropland and native grassland, while the isotopes &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;13&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;C and &amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;15&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;N, presented a lower discrimination potential. TOC and UV-VIS derived parameters did not present a good discriminant potential when they were tested in isolation, although they increased the source discrimination when combined with organic matter parameters. Fallout radionuclides have a good discriminant potential between surface and subsurface sources, but also between native grasslands and croplands. Croplands are the main sediment source in the Ibirapuit&amp;amp;#227; river catchment (36%), followed by the native grasslands (33%). However, the area occupied by croplands is approximately eight times smaller, demonstrating that erosion processes have been intensified by the conversion of native grasslands into croplands and/or croplands are better connected to the river network.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The capacity and ecological flows of ecosystem services as well as the demand for them are key areas of urban and rural ecological planning that have been studied using the spatial-explicit model as a decision support tool. This study develops a framework for mapping the relationships among the capacity of and demand for ecosystem services, ecological flows, and planning management. This is done by estimating the ecosystem services based on the space for recreation and environmental conditions and assessing planning for green spaces using the spatial-explicit model. The results show that the carrying capacity of green recreational space was high in the northwest, southwest, and southeast parts of the city of Hefei in China, where this space was highly sustainable in the northwest and southwest. The data also show that the carrying capacity for air purification was higher in the northwest, southwest, and southeast suburbs of Hefei, while areas with high demand for air purification were mainly located in the northeast. The spatial variation in the flows of supply and demand for ecosystem services remained high and unbalanced in the northeast and southwest of Hefei. The excessive use of ecosystem services was concentrated in the urban center while their use in suburban areas was sustainable. The results show that the gap between the supply and demand of space for recreation increased with distance while that between the supply and demand of air purification decreased with increasing distance. The results of assessment based on spatial visualization show that green space was abundant in areas with low demand for it, while those with high demand for it tended to have limited green space in Hefei. This analysis shows that indices for the demand for green spaces in the context of ecosystem services can be improved via public participation, interactions between different scales of ecosystem services for green space, and use of decision support in urban and rural planning systems. These areas will form important directions for future research.</jats:p>",

In this work, an improved stage-wise superstructure of HENs is proposed to integrate with a Rankine cycle-based utility system. Inner- and inter-stage heaters are considered in the new structure. Furthermore, the selection of steam in different levels is also investigated, extending the possibilities of steam utilization in HENs and generation in utility systems. The presented methodology is able to realize the optimal design of HENs by considering the supply and utilization of steam. Heaters’ allocations, matches of streams, steam distribution and utilization are optimized accompanying with the trade-off amongst equipment investment, fuel consumption and power generation in objective, which is highly related to the final structure of the system. The optimization problem is formulated into a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model and solved towards the lowest total annual cost (TAC) of the entire system.

Two field experiments were conducted in a randomized complete‐block design with split‐plots and four replications.

The results revealed that an evaluation of the nutritional status of cassava during its second vegetative cycle should be considered if shoot pruning has been conducted because pruned plants had higher concentrations of N, P, and K in their leaves, and unpruned plants exhibited leaves with higher Ca, Fe, and Mn concentrations. Pruning of cassava shoots during the autumn/winter resting phase did not negatively affect root yield and may represent a recommended management practice for cassava cultivation. In soils with a medium level of K availability, K provision during the second cassava growth cycle is unnecessary because the application of K did not increase leaf reconstitution or yield components in either pruned or unpruned plants. The late application of N improved the nutritional status of cassava plants and increased their leaf area during the second growth cycle. Cassava root, starch, and flour yields increased in a linear fashion in response to the late application of N.</jats:p>",

The influence of the Co alloying content on the cermet microstructure, SOFC characteristics, and prolonged cell performance stability has been studied. Co was incorporated into Ni and formed a solid solution of Ni1−XCoX alloy connected with the YSZ as the cermet anode. The porous microstructure of the Ni1−XCoX/YSZ cermet anode formed by sintering exhibited a grain growth with an increase in the Co alloying content. The electrochemical performance of the cells consisting of the Ni1−XCoX/YSZ cermet anode, the YSZ electrolyte, and the LSM (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3) cathode showed an enhancement by the Ni1−XCoX impregnation treatment for the respective supply of H2 and CH4 to the anode. The cell using the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ cermet anode (the Ni0.75Co0.25 cell) showed the highest cell performance among the cells tested. In particular, the performance enhancement of this cell was found to be more significant for CH4 than that for H2; a 45% increase in the maximum power density for CH4 and a 17% increase for H2 at 750 °C compared with the performance of the cell using the Ni/YSZ cermet anode. Furthermore, the prolonged cell performance stability with a continuous CH4 supply was found for the Ni0.85Co0.15 and Ni0.75Co0.25 cells at least for 60 h at 750 °C. These enhancement effects were caused by the optimum porous microstructure of the cermet anode with the low anodic polarization resistance.</jats:p>"

By observing the selected three indicators (clustering coefficient, maximum connectivity, and network connectivity efficiency), the influence caused by the problem will continue to spread to more subjects along the network when a problem exists in one part of the network. The results showed that the destructive power of deliberate attacks is far greater than the damage caused by random attacks, and the disruption of logistics service integrators will considerably increase the vulnerability of the LSSC. However, even if logistics service integrators are removed completely, the LSSC still can operate at low efficiency.

The manufacturer acts as a Stackelberg leader to adopt a preannounced pricing policy. This study first proposes demand functions for a two‐period dual‐channel model by incorporating consumer utility functions. Based on the demand functions, optimal pricing strategies for both manufacturer and retailer are established. The results show that the manufacturer prefers to raise prices in both periods for consumers with a short delivery lead time. However, counterintuitively, the selling prices set by the manufacturer do not decrease as the degree of consumer patience increases. Finally, there is a Pareto zone under a certain condition where both the manufacturer and the retailer in the two‐period dual‐channel model outperform their counterparts in terms of profit in the single‐period dual‐channel model.</jats:p>",

On the basis of the characteristics of the fresh agricultural supply chain, this paper analyses the financing strategies adopted by SMEs and obtains optimal operational and financing strategies for SMEs in six different situations. The analysis shows that the optimal level of financing  by SMEs is not only affected by the financing rate, but also negatively related to the freshness effort cost coefficient, and is positively related to the sensitivity coefficient of market freshness. Moreover, although the cost of improving the freshness level of the producte is only  borne by the SME, the supply chain cannot maximise profit from the optimal financial strategies of SMEs. Shouldering the fresh effort cost also lessens the optimal financing requirement of the SME compared with that of the entire supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study investigates a supplier’s voluntary disclosure strategy when it can encroach on a retailer’s operations by selling directly to final consumers. The establishment of a direct sales channel expands market potential, induces the supplier to adopt a more frequent disclosure strategy, and ultimately leads to a higher level of information transparency in the supply chain. Since more quality information is revealed in the presence of a dual channel, the retailer is able to free ride on the supplier’s disclosure to enhance consumers’ quality expectations. In most cases, such a free‐riding effect is positive and can even create a higher ex ante payoff for the retailer in face of the supplier’s encroachment. Conversely, more transparent product quality information does not necessarily benefit the supplier, who can then no longer hide negative quality information from consumers due to the potential change in the channel structure. Thus, we show that the supplier’s ex ante payoff may become lower with encroachment and that the supplier may commit not to encroach on the retail market, even when it has a free option to open a direct sales channel. </jats:p>",

In Roman times wells were drilled, of which nineteen reached a natural cavity. A horizontal gallery for water supply was also opened up, and a drainage conduct in the theatre was made to eliminate storm water. At some point, for natural or artificial reasons, the water table dropped and several wells dried up, forcing the descent of workers and other people to do additional work and to carve abundant graffiti and several clay figurines. The city did not survive the Middle Ages, the wells became cesspits and the ruins were plundered by neighbouring villages. It recovered its memory in the eighteenth century, in 1908 a Roman cave was rediscovered, the old water supply gallery, which gives access to the natural cave. This has been explored and surveyed by the Grupo Espeleológico Ribereño since 1980. From 2013, the Grupo de Technologías in Entornos Hostiles (University of Zaragoza) has carried out systematic radiolocation for the opening up of a direct access to the cavity. In addition, recognition of inscriptions with cavity scans and specific details have been made as well as the installation of two monitoring stations, both inside and outside the cavity to analyze the water performance of the system and the internal evolution of the CO2 content of the air in the cavity. The evolution of the piezometric level presents relatively important oscillations and a delay of two months is detected between the moments of heavy rains and the increase of water levels in the cavity. The CO2 content has a double periodicity, annual and daily.</jats:p>"

Yet mechanisms of how microbial responses to hydrodynamics regulate biofilm formation in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) are underappreciated. Here, we investigated the linkage between early-stage biofilm formation and flow velocity fluctuations in a model DWDS. Results showed that an intermediate velocity (1.0 m/s) enhanced biofilm formation, with the highest biofilm/total cells ratio of 96.91% ± 2.26%. Moreover, the intermediate velocity promoted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) release, accompanied with lowered zeta potential and elevated hydrophobicity of suspended cells, which could be responsible for surface aggregation. Shifts in biofilm community were observed along with hydrodynamics fluctuations. Intermediate velocity (1.0 m/s) stimulated the dominance of Proteobacteria (78.16%) along with the genus predominance of Pseudomonas, known to secrete large amounts of EPS favoring biofilm formation. Overall, this study provides new understanding of biofilm formation responding to hydrodynamic fluctuations in DWDS.</jats:p>",

FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis) with occupational safety approach is applied in the execution of water supply network maintenance in a medium size city in the state of Maranhão. This work shows that FMEA is an effective tool for risk prioritization in work process. The FMEA application with use of index reference table can become faster than application without reference table - and thus spread the tool for risk analysis.&#x0D;\nDesign / Methodology / Approach: A photographic records was carried out in loco and the main risks to the workers were enumerated and based on the obtained data, a risk analysis was elaborated with the application of FMEA (Failure modes and effects analysis).&#x0D;\nResults: The maintenance services teams of the supply system are subject to a high risk of accidents caused mainly by the working conditions precariousness. It was observed that the services of manual excavations and the lack of use of PPE (helmet, gloves, pants suitable for flooded environments and etc.) have high risk index (RPN) and that the mismanagement added to the unsafe behavior were the main factors to accident occurrence in this type of work.&#x0D;\nLimitations of the investigation: The study studied the reality found in a medium-sized city with precarious working conditions. Further studies can compare the work reality of other teams in cities of different sizes, with better working conditions. Other limitation of this work is the impossibility of work situation improvement and posterior tool application – a study with this magnitude is non-trivial and needs future research.&#x0D;\nPractical implications: The great achievement of this work is to demonstrate that FMEA - a tool that is widely used in maintenance management and product engineering - is able to identify and prioritize risks based on its preliminary risk index obtained - contributing to reduce the difficulty of index choices previously cited in literature and disseminate the FMEA utilization for employee safety and occupational health. Such a tool has a great capacity for quantitative description of the risks, showing that the FMEA is very useful in the work safety sector for the organization of correction plans.&#x0D;\nOriginality / Value: The difficulties of using the tool mentioned in the available literature were minimized with the use of the reference table, showing that the use of FMEA can become faster and thus spread the tool for risk analysis.</jats:p>"

The relationship between runoff and landscape pattern was analyzed, and the spatial correlation between runoff and landscape pattern analyzed using the geographic weighted regression model combined with the change of landscape pattern in the study area from 2000 to 2015. The results show the following. (1) The SWAT model can simulate the monthly runoff processes in the catchment area of the Ulungur River Basin (URB) under different land-use types for 2000 and 2015, but the simulation effect in 2000 was found to be better than that in 2015. (2) From 2000 to 2015, the area of woodland and grassland decreased. Runoff was positively correlated with woodland, grassland, largest patch index, mean patch area (AREA_MN), and contagion index, and negatively correlated with others. This indicates that the landscape fragmentation of URB was aggravated in 2000–2015, the landscape balance was destroyed, and the ability of rainfall interception and water conservation was weakened. (3) Landscape pattern indicators of grassland had a negative spatial impact on URB runoff, and the northern region of URB was more severely affected in 2015 than in 2000. AREA_MN landscape pattern index had a positive impact on runoff in the northern part of URB, and the positive impact in northern URB in 2000 was better than that in 2015.</jats:p>",

However, limited by device designs and fabrication technologies, the current integrated sensing systems still face many great challenges, such as safety, miniaturization, mechanical stability, energy‐efficiency, sustainability, and comfortability. In this review, the key challenges and opportunities in the current development of integrated wearable sensing systems are summarized. By summarizing the typical configurations of diverse wearable power supplies, and recent advances concerning the integrated sensing systems driven by such power supplies, the representative integrated designs, and micro/nanofabrication technologies are highlighted.

In this study, the effect of nitrogen (N) supply levels on the accumulation and translocation of NSC in leaf sheath tissues and its relationship with the initiation and progression of leaf senescence during grain filling was investigated using two rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic> L.) genotypes, namely, premature flag leaf senescence mutant (<jats:italic>psf</jats:italic>) and its wild‐type. Three N treatment levels were used to examine N‐supply induced alteration in the activities of several key enzymes involved in NSC translocation and N assimilation in different leaf sheaths. The results show that the NSC translocation rate in leaf sheaths under low nitrogen (LN) treatment was significantly higher than those under normal nitrogen (NN) and high nitrogen (HN) treatments. However, the positive effect of LN on the NSC translocation in leaf sheath was closely associated with its negative effect on grain yield, due to accelerated leaf senescence and shortened leaf longevity. Comparatively, the upper‐positional sheath had a lower NSC amount and higher NSC translocation rate than the lower‐leaf sheaths after heading. High N suppressed sucrose‐phosphate synthase (SPS) activity in leaf sheaths, but enhanced the activity of key enzymes involving in N assimilation in leaf sheaths. The upper sheath had higher activity of sucrose‐metabolizing enzymes and lower activity of N‐assimilating enzymes. Hence, the upper‐leaf sheath had a relatively weak N assimilation and stronger NSC translocation than the lower‐leaf sheaths.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the increasing awareness of sustainable manufacturing, remanufacturing has been widely accepted by enterprises in many countries. In the process of Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) development, to stimulate the demand for remanufactured products, the Chinese government’s interventions such as the “Trade old for Remanufactured” program cannot be ignored. However, prior research has not answered the questions of whether governments should offer consumption subsidies and how to determine the optimal subsidy value. This paper investigates the optimal government consumption subsidy policy and its impact on the operation of Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) where an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) produces new products, while a Third-Party Remanufacturer (TPR) remanufactures the used products collected from consumers. A game model with a leader (government) and two followers (OEM and TPR) is then introduced. The government determines the consumption subsidy to maximize the social welfare, while the TPR and OEM attempt to maximize their own profit functions. Game theoretic models are proposed to explore and compare the scenarios, i.e., CLSC with a consumption subsidy policy and without a consumption subsidy policy. The equilibrium characteristics with respect to the government’s consumption subsidy decisions and the price decisions for chain members are derived. Based on the theoretical and numerical analysis, the results show that: (1) governments should not always offer a consumption subsidy; (2) the consumption subsidy cannibalizes demand for new products while boosting the demand for remanufactured products; (3) the consumption subsidy should be shared between the TPR and consumers when the TPR raises the sales price of remanufactured product; (4) the members of the CLSC do not always benefit from the consumption subsidy policy.</jats:p>"

This paper introduced “vitality” to measure the intangible benefits of urban parks and constructed a straightforward and spatially explicit approach to assess the park vitality based on visiting intensity and recreational satisfaction rate. Freely available data of check-in comments on parks, points-of-interest (POIs), and other multi-source data from Beijing were used to assess the urban park vitality and explore the factors influencing it from the perspectives of recreational service supply, demand, and spatial linking characteristics. We found that the urban park vitalities decreased along the urban–rural gradient. The presence of water and facility density in the parks have significant positive impacts on park vitality, and high population density nearby was a positive factor. Moreover, the external higher levels of the POI-based urban function mix and density, as well as developed public transportation, were strongly associated with greater park vitality. Our research proposed a feasible and effective method to assess the park vitality, and the findings from this study have significant implications for optimizing the spatial configuration of urban parks.</jats:p>"

Biomass residues generated from agricultural production of corn and barley represent an essential source of raw material for the production of biofuels, and a mathematical programming-based approach can be used to establish an efficient supply chain. This paper proposes a model of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) that seeks to minimize the total cost of the bioethanol supply chain. The proposal allows determining the optimal number and location of storage centers, biorefineries, and mixing plants, as well as the flow of biomass and bioethanol between the facilities. To show the proposed approach, we present a case study developed in the region of Tulancingo, Hidalgo, in Mexico (case study), considering the potential of biomass (corn and barley residues) in the region. The results show the costs for the production of bioethanol, transportation, and refining and total cost of the bioethanol supply chain, besides a sensitivity analysis on the costs of the bioethanol supply chain which is presented by mixing different percentages of bioethanol with fossil fuel to satisfy the demand. We conclude that the proposed approach is viable in the process of configuring the supply chain within the proposed study region.</jats:p>",

This low velocity zone displays a maximum velocity anomaly relative to the ‘background’ ridge axis crustal structure of ∼0.5 km s−1, has lateral dimensions of ∼10 × 5 km, and extends to depths ≥2.5 km below the seabed, placing it within layer 2 of the oceanic crust. We interpret these observations as representing increased fracturing under enhanced tectonic stress associated with the opening of the overlapping spreading centre, that results in higher upper crustal bulk porosity and permeability. Evidence for ongoing magmatic accretion at the Costa Rica Rift ridge axis takes the form of an axial magma lens beneath the western ridge segment, and observations of hydrothermal plume activity and microearthquakes support the presence of an active fluid circulation system. We propose that fracture pathways associated with the low velocity zone may provide the system through which hydrothermal fluids circulate. These fluids cause rapid cooling of the adjacent ridge axis and any magma accumulations which may be present. The Costa Rica Rift exists at a tipping point between episodic phases of magmatic and tectonically enhanced spreading. The characteristics inherited from each spreading mode have been preserved in the crustal morphology off-axis for the past 7 Myr. Using potential field data, we contextualize our seismic observations of the axial ridge structure at the whole segment scale, and find that the proposed balance between magmatic and tectonically dominated spreading processes observed off-axis may also be apparent along-axis, and that the current larger-scale magma supply system at the Costa Rica Rift may be relatively weak. Based on all available geophysical observations, we suggest a model for the inter-relationships between magmatism, faulting and fluid circulation at the Costa Rica Rift across a range of scales, which may also be influenced by large lithosphere scale structural and/or thermal heterogeneity.</jats:p>",

The total N, P, and K released from the pasture or soybean residues were related to the initial quantity of plant residues, which was reduced in the CLT systems, mostly for pasture residue (−60%), probably due to light reduction (−55%), rather than changes in litter quality and dynamics.

The results indicated that each target compound could be identified from 15 sampling sites, and the total concentration of 14 VOSCs ranged from 2.575 to 52.981 μg L−1. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was the most important contaminant with an average concentration of 4.029 μg L−1, a detection rate of 93.33% and a variation coefficient of 0.72. The VOSCs were primarily distributed in suburban and rural sections, and the suburban section was the worst in regard to pollution by VOSCs. Dimethyl trisulfide was primarily distributed in urban and suburban sections of the Xi River due to industrial emissions. Ethanethiol, DMS, and ethyl methyl sulfide, which are typical by-products of microbial anaerobic decomposition from domestic wastewater, were found in abundance in the suburban section.

This results in alternate sources such as groundwater inundation and storm-drain backflow being overlooked in studies that inform planning. Here a method is developed that identifies flooding extents and infrastructure vulnerabilities that are likely to result from alternate flood sources over coming decades. The method includes simulation of flood scenarios consisting of high-resolution raster datasets featuring flood-water depth generated by three mechanisms: (1) direct marine flooding, (2) storm-drain backflow, and (3) groundwater inundation. We apply the method to Honolulu’s primary urban center based on its high density of vulnerable assets and present-day tidal flooding issues. Annual exceedance frequencies of simulated flood thresholds are established using a statistical model that considers predicted tide and projections of SLR. Through assessment of multi-mechanism flooding, we find that approaching decades will likely feature large and increasing percentages of flooded area impacted simultaneously by the three flood mechanisms, in which groundwater inundation and direct marine flooding represent the most and least substantial single-mechanism flood source, respectively. These results illustrate the need to reevaluate main sources of SLR induced flooding to promote the development of effective flood management strategies.</jats:p>"

One of the main problems for these companies is when products are sold later than expected, causing overstock due to lower inventory turnover, which increases inventory levels. Therefore, for many retailers, it is important to solve this problem. This is mostly applicable to companies engaged in sales; however, if we take into account the main supplier and the way they act within the supply chain, we must also consider an additional approach. Since online sales are a major innovation brought about by the new digital era, it is standard for sales strategies to focus on this new requirement of customers. In this way, the main supplier takes a leap forward on Internet sales, creating another sales channel. This is when companies under the supply chain start losing sales. According to the above, a dual supply chain model was suggested using the SCOR model and drop shipping. After the improvement proposal was implemented, the company reported a reduction of approximately S/13,000 when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to that of 2019.</jats:p>",

This growing trend is a result of a series of recent disruptions, among others also affecting electricity systems. Therefore, it is of crucial importance for policymakers to determine whether their country has a resilient electricity supply. Starting from a set of 12 indicators, this paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) to comprehensively evaluate the electricity supply resilience of 140 countries worldwide. Two DEA models are applied: (1) the original ratio-based Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR) model and (2) a novel hybrid framework for robust efficiency analysis incorporating linear programming and Monte Carlo simulations. Results show that the CCR model deems 31 countries as efficient and hence lacks the capability to differentiate them. Furthermore, the CCR model considers only the best weight vectors for each country, which are not necessarily representative of the overall performance of the countries. The robustness analysis explores these limitations and identifies South Korea, Singapore and Canada as the most resilient countries. Finally, country analyses are conducted, where Singapore’s and Japan’s performances and improvement potentials are discussed.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the interaction between a manufacturer’s product quality information acquisition and different product quality information disclosure systems in a supply chain wherein the manufacturer can privately acquire the precise quality information of its product by affordable means initially. We consider two different quality information disclosure systems for the quality information acquisition: voluntary disclosure (i.e., the manufacturer determines whether to disclose the quality information that he has acquired), and mandatory disclosure (i.e., the manufacturer is mandated to disclose the quality information that he has acquired). We examine the effects of voluntary disclosure and mandatory disclosure on the equilibrium strategies and payoffs of the manufacturer and the retailer and on the consumer surplus. It is shown that mandatory disclosure significantly reduces the manufacturer’s incentive to acquire the precise product quality information and leads to a reduction in the product quality information that the retailer and the consumers can receive. Interestingly, although the manufacturer is ex ante better off, the retailer’s ex ante payoff and the expected consumer surplus become lower under mandatory disclosure, as opposed to voluntary disclosure of product quality information. </jats:p>",

Europe has several crops that can be used as raw materials for this purpose, however pressure on land which might displace other activities and industrial competition for cost efficient raw materials remains a challenge. Hence, ensuring good yielding capacity and examining the likelihood to produce more by exploiting low quality, unused land can present significant opportunities to increase sustainable, locally sourced supply and at the same time offer profitable solutions to both industry and the farmers. This paper estimates the production costs of fourteen crops (oil, sugar, starch and lignocellulosic) and analyses how their profitability can be influenced by yield increases and cultivation in low quality land. Results show that there are profitable options for all crops under current market prices and land types except for cases in countries where crop productivity is rather low to sustain farm incomes. The analysis confirms that Europe has plenty crop options as raw materials for bioeconomy. Decision makers however must ensure future research and policy support are oriented towards sustainable yield increases and accelerate rehabilitation of land that is unused and of low quality.</jats:p>"

In Europe, an example of such a scheme is Nutri-Score, which was first introduced in France. Supported by additional research, the scheme has the potential to expand into other countries. Such a scenario opens a series of questions related to the use of Nutri-Score in the territories with pre-existing food labelling schemes. A key question is whether different nutrition labelling schemes would provide conflicting information for consumers when applied to same foods. The goal of our study was, therefore, to evaluate the alignment of different front-of-package nutrition labelling schemes. The study was conducted using cross-sectional data on the composition of selected categories of prepacked foods with high penetration nutrition/health claims and symbols in the Slovenian food supply. We evaluated a variety of existing front-of-package nutrition labelling schemes: three interpretive nutrition rating systems (Nutri-Score, Health Star Rating (HSR), Traffic light system), four health symbols (Protective Food symbol, Choices, Finnish heart, and Keyhole symbol), and also three nutrient profile models developed for other purposes (Office of Communications (United Kingdom, Ofcom), World Health Organization Regional office for Europe (WHOE) and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ)). Overall, our results indicate that interpretive nutrition rating systems (i.e., Nutri-Score) are mostly less strict than the nutrient profiles of tested health symbols. A risk of conflicting information would happen in a scenario where food is eligible to carry a health symbol, but is at the same time rated to have lower nutritional quality by an accompanying interpretive nutrition rating system. When Protective Food symbol and Nutri-Score are used together, this would occur for 5% of foods in our sample. To avoid such risks, schemes for health symbols could be adapted to be stricter than interpretive nutrition rating systems used in the same territory/market, but such adaptations are challenging and should be well planned. While our study showed that, in most cases, Nutri-Score is a less strict model than tested health symbols, the rating-system approach might offer useful support and incentive for food producers towards gradual food reformulation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this article, a two-echelon supply chain model with a single-vendor a single-buyer is considered. The vendor's production process is imperfect and the market demand is assumed to be dependent on the buyer's selling price and warranty period. The vendor consents to return a definite portion of the buyer's purchase value, if any product is found defective within the length of warranty. The refund value or the warranty cost is considered as a function of the warranty period and the buyer's selling price of the item. This warranty cost is assumed to be fully borne by the vendor in the first model (Model I) while in the second model (Model II), it is assumed that the buyer agrees to bear a portion of the warranty cost. The proposed models are solved under decentralized scenario. We also derive and optimize the average total profit of the supply chain in order to obtain the optimal decisions of the centralized model. We consider a Stackelberg game between the vendor and the buyer in the decentralized scenario, where the vendor is assumed to be the leader and the buyer as the pursuer. Through numerical study, it is observed that, with respect to all the key decisions of the models, Model II provides better outcomes than Model I. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out to examine the impacts of changes of parameter-values on the optimum decisions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Historical seismic events show that water supply networks are increasingly vulnerable to seismic damage, especially in a violent earthquake, which leads to an unprecedented level of risk. Evaluation of vulnerability to seismic hazards can be considered as one of the first steps of risk management and mitigation. This paper presents a stochastic interpolation-based fractal model for assessing the physical vulnerability of urban water supply pipelines. Firstly, based on the formation mechanism of natural disaster risk and the concept of seismic vulnerability, the most representative factors were selected as the vulnerability evaluation indices, and the classification criterion of each index was teased out according to the earthquake damage investigations and researches on the aseismatic behavior of water supply pipelines. Secondly, considering the randomness of vulnerability to earthquake hazards, the test data set was produced by way of stochastic interpolation according to the uniform distribution, on the basis of the classification criterion. The fractal dimensions of all of the indices were calculated based on the test data set. The fractal interpolation diagnosis function for identifying the vulnerability levels of pipelines to earthquake disasters was established. Finally, the application of the proposed model to a real water supply network and its comparative analysis showed that the water supply network was basically in a medium vulnerability level. Through the case study verification, we could find that the model was theoretically and practically feasible. This study helps to gain a better understanding of the extents of potential vulnerability levels of water supply pipelines. It can provide technical support for disaster prevention plans of urban water supply networks.</jats:p>"

To further develop its potential value, it is necessary to explore the regulatory mechanism of nitrogen metabolism for rational nitrogen utilization. In this study, we investigated the morphology, physiology and transcriptome of a paper mulberry hybrid (Broussonetia kazinoki × B. papyrifera) in response to different nitrogen concentrations. Moderate nitrogen promoted plant growth and biomass accumulation. Photosynthetic characteristics, concentration of nitrogenous compounds and activities of enzymes were stimulated under nitrogen treatment. However, these enhancements were slightly or severely inhibited under excessive nitrogen supply. Nitrite reductase and glutamate synthase were more sensitive than nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase and more likely to be inhibited under high nitrogen concentrations. Transcriptome analysis of the leaf transcriptome identified 161,961 unigenes. The differentially expressed genes associated with metabolism of nitrogen, alanine, aspartate, glutamate and glycerophospholipid showed high transcript abundances after nitrogen application, whereas those associated with glycerophospholipid, glycerolipid, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism were down-regulated. Combined with weighted gene coexpression network analysis, we uncovered 16 modules according to similarity in expression patterns. Asparagine synthetase and inorganic pyrophosphatase were considered two hub genes in two modules, which were associated with nitrogen metabolism and phosphorus metabolism, respectively. The expression characteristics of these genes may explain the regulation of morphological, physiological and other related metabolic strategies harmoniously. This multifaceted study provides valuable insights to further understand the mechanism of nitrogen metabolism and to guide utilization of paper mulberry.</jats:p>",

Plants in this area are exposed to a prolonged dry season. In this study, we measured the stable isotopes of hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) of the local precipitation, river water, soil water, plant xylem water, and leaf water at four sampling sites during the 2016 growing season. Our results showed that plants relied mostly on wet season precipitation at sites N1, N2, and N3 because this recharged the soil after the long dry season. Leaf phenology had a significant effect on evaporation distance (ED) value, and evergreen plants have adapted to water tapping from deep soil water sources during the dry season. The ED values of trees and shrubs were quite different in the dry season, indicating water competition among different plant species was mitigated due to water resource partitioning. Moreover, plants at site N4 relied on a water source admixed with river water throughout the whole growing season. The mean value of xylem-to-leaf water deuterium enrichment (ɛl/x) was −0.91 ± 0.36‰ over all plant species, seasons, and sampling sites. Plant species, leaf phenology, and seasons were found to be the primary factors influencing the ɛl/x, while growth form and elevation had negligible effects.</jats:p>",

The crude protein content of the LPC varied from 24.2 to 31.4 m/m%, depending on clones and harvesting time, which was comparable to that of alfalfa LPC (~ 32.3%). The amino acid profile of the LPC of JA, particularly of the essential amino acids, was similar to alfalfa and soybean. In addition, our results confirmed that the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content varied between 64 and 68% in the LPC fraction, regardless of the clone that was used, with linoleic acid and linolenic acid being the predominant PUFAs. In addition, unlike alfalfa, the content of arachidonic acid was 0.5% in the JA LPC. The tuber yield was significantly reduced because of the repeated harvesting of the shoot parts; however, the tubers obtained were sufficient to regenerate the plantation in the subsequent year, thus ensuring the renewable ability and sustainability of the green biomass of JA.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Carbon emissions reduction has become a frequently discussed topic in industry and academia. However, how can reduction effects be enhanced with dominant brand and downstream manufacturer? This paper incorporates emissions reduction into a green supply chain which considers consumers’ low-carbon preference behavior and government intensity regulations, in order to discuss the impacts of consumers’ environmental awareness and government constraints on optimal emissions reduction and profit, respectively. The paper first constructs three reduction models on the basis of reality: independent reduction by manufacturer, contractual reduction by brand and collaborative reduction by both. Then it concludes the optimal decisions and compare the models. The results show that both the profits and emissions reduction will be decreased with the strengthened carbon intensity constraint, but the cost-sharing contract can mitigate this negative effect on dominant brand and society. Meanwhile, the acceptable range of cost-sharing ratio will be smaller with a lower cost coefficient of emissions reduction and a higher consumers’ preference. Furthermore, government should design the incentive method or regulate the carbon market to improve the social welfare level. Lastly, a numerical study is conducted, the impact of several key factors on supply chain performance and model selection are presented for management decisions. </jats:p>",

In this paper, enhanced coagulation technology was selected and various parameters (coagulant species, dosage, solution pH and coagulant aid species) were optimized for Yuquan River water treatment. Turbidity and UV254 removal rate were calculated to assess coagulation efficiencies, and meanwhile floc generation kinetics, zeta potential and scanning electron microscope (SEM) spectra were measured to study the coagulation mechanism. Results indicated that the coagulation effect of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) on Yuquan River water was better than that of aluminium sulphate (AS), and its optimal dosage was 20 mg/L. Flocs produced by PAC also exhibited larger size and faster growth velocity than those of AS. Moreover, the applicable initial pH range for Yuquan River was 6.0–9.0, and the optimal coagulation efficiency was observed at pH 7.0. When PAC or AS was selected as coagulant, the application of sodium alginate (SA) could improve turbidity and UV254 removal due to its adsorption bridging role. In addition, coagulation efficiency could be enhanced in an AS coagulation system when polyacrylamide (PAM) was dosed as coagulant aid.</jats:p>",

Provision of “related” carbon sources and synthesis of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs) were separately assigned to these strains via a modular construction strategy. To avoid growth competition, a preference for the use of a carbon source was constructed. Further, the main intermediate metabolite acetate played an important role in constructing the expected “nutrition supply–detoxification” relationship between these strains. The coculture consortium showed a remarkable increase in the mcl-PHA titer (0.541 g/L) with a glucose–xylose mixture (1:1). Subsequently, the titer of mcl-PHA produced by the coculture consortium when tested with actual lignocellulosic hydrolysate (0.434 g/L) was similar to that achieved with laboratory sugars’ mixture (0.469 g/L). These results indicate a competitive potential of the engineered E. coli–P. putida coculture consortium for mcl-PHA production with lignocellulosic hydrolysate.</jats:p>",

The engineered <jats:italic>R. sphaeroides</jats:italic> strain relying exclusively on the MVA pathway was completely functional in conditions for sesquiterpene production and, upon increased expression of the MVA enzymes, it reached even higher sesquiterpene yields than the control strain coexpressing both MEP and MVA modules.

The objective was to examine whether a model integrating additional clinical variables conferred meaningful improvement in predicting LTO, beyond a simple approach using only accumulated supply. Three cohorts were created using Veteran's Health Administration data based on accumulated supply days during the 90 days following opioid initiation: (a) &lt;30 days, (b) ≥30 days, (c) ≥60 days. A base, unadjusted probability of subsequent LTO (days 91‐365) was calculated for each cohort, along with an associated risk range based on midpoint values between cohorts. Within each cohort, log‐binomial regression modeled the probability of subsequent LTO, using demographic, diagnostic, and medication characteristics. Each patient's LTO probability was determined using their individual characteristic values and model parameter estimates, where values falling outside the cohort's risk range were considered a clinically meaningful change in predictive value. Base probabilities for subsequent LTO and associated risk ranges by cohort were as follows: (a) 3.92% (0%‐10.75%), (b) 17.59% (10.76%‐28.05%), (c) 38.53% (28.06%‐47.55%). The proportion of patients whose individual probability fell outside their cohort's risk range was as follows: 1.5%, 4.6%, and 9.2% for cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The strong relationship between accumulated supply days and future LTO offers an opportunity to leverage electronic healthcare records for decision support in preventing the initiation of inappropriate LTO through early intervention. More complex models are unlikely to meaningfully guide decision making beyond the single variable of accumulated supply days.</jats:p>",

It plays key roles in the well‐being of society in numerous ways. However, climate variability and land use land cover (LULC) change have caused spatiotemporal water supply variation. Disentangling the effects of climate variability from LULC change on water supply is crucial for sustainable water resource management. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to disentangle the relative contribution of LULC change and climate variability to the overall average annual water supply variation. Residual trends analysis combined with Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) annual water yield model was adopted to perform simulations and disentangle the relative impacts of climate variability and LULC change. Ground and satellite data were used in this study. The study area has experienced a significant increasing wetness trend and significant LULC dynamics between 2003 and 2017. As a result, an increasing water supply was observed due to the joint effects of climate variability and LULC change in the watershed (203 mm). The contribution of climate variability was 94%, whereas LULC contributes only 6% from 2003 to 2017. Climate variability negatively led to water supply variation while LULC change contributed positively from 2010 to 2017. Although the ongoing soil and water conservation (SWC) practices improved vegetation cover and water retention of the watershed, climate variability is the main driver of water supply variation. Therefore, SWC practices should incorporate ecosystem‐based climate change adaptation strategies and scale up to community‐based integrated watershed management to sustain water supply.</jats:p>",

Building on prior work on UWSS security and resilience, we quantify the sustainability of UWSS based on the performance of local sustainable governance and the size of global water and ecological footprints. We develop a new framework that integrates security, resilience, and sustainability to investigate trade-offs between these three distinct and inter-related dimensions. Security refers to the level of services, resilience is the system’s ability to respond to and recover from shocks, and sustainability refers to local and global impacts, and to the long-term viability of system services. Security and resilience are both relevant at local scale (city and surroundings), while for sustainability cross-scale and -sectoral feedbacks are important. We apply the new framework to seven cities selected from diverse hydro-climatic and socio-economic settings on four continents. We find that UWSS security, resilience, and local sustainability coevolve, while global sustainability correlates negatively with security. Approaching these interdependent goals requires governance strategies that balance the three dimensions within desirable and viable operating spaces. Cities outside these boundaries risk system failure in the short-term, due to lack of security and resilience, or face long-term consequences of unsustainable governance strategies. We discuss these risks in the context of poverty and rigidity traps. Our findings have strong implications for policy-making, strategic management, and for designing systems to operate sustainably at local and global scales.</jats:p>",

In two dynamic models, we analyze the influence of relevant parameters on the stability and complexity of the dynamic system and system profit by nonlinear system theory and numerical simulation. We find that the higher adjustment parameters can cause the system to lose stability, showing double period bifurcation or wave-shape chaos. The stable region becomes larger with increase in service value and value of unit profit sharing. Besides, when the system is in chaotic state, we find that the profit of the system will fluctuate or even decline sharply; however, keeping the parameters in a certain range is helpful in maintaining the system stability and is conducive to decision-makers to obtain steady profits. In order to control the chaos phenomenon, the state feedback method is employed to control the chaotic system well. This study provides some valuable significance to supply chain managers in channel integration and service cooperation.</jats:p>",

We confirm that when banks curtail loans, courts see more bankruptcies among businesses with high exposure to bank debt. To reduce real volatility, policy‐makers can set tough bank liquidity requirements in the upswing of business cycle but allow weaker requirements in the downswing. We also find that between 1914 and 1933, businesses in St. Louis were more sensitive to changes in bank loans than businesses in Kansas City, probably due to the tight monetary policy conducted by the conservative St. Louis Fed. The Glass‐Steagall Act weakened the relationship between bank loans and business debt structure. The takeaway is that lender‐of‐last‐resort practices stabilize both the financial sector and the real economy.</jats:p>",

Flume experiments were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamics through a boulder array over impermeable and permeable beds (i.e. IMPB and PB). For background reference, hydrodynamics investigation was made over smooth beds (SB) with the boulder array. Through measuring the instantaneous velocity field, the major flow characteristics such as mean flow velocity, turbulence intensity, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and instantaneous Reynolds stresses (through quadrant analysis) were presented. The results show that the increase in bed permeability through decreasing the exposure height of boulders has little impact on the magnitude of streamwise velocity, but tends to decrease the near-bed velocity gradient, thus affecting the bed shear-stress. For turbulence, similar to the previous studies, the bed permeability is identified to enable a downward shift of the peak of turbulence intensity. The TKE budget analysis shows that bed permeability tends to inhibit the transport and diffusion processes of TKE generation. Finally, the quadrant analysis of turbulence structure clearly shows that the ejections (Q2) and sweeps (Q4) with and without the boulder array are dominated by turbulence structure of different scales.</jats:p>",

With the help of connection the topology optimisation – the identification of the optimal place for installing a new pipe – can be determined within a short processing time, and without the implementation of a stochastic optimiser algorithm. The first part of the paper presents problems caused by high pressure sensitivity and introduces the mathematical background of the method, besides which it discusses the details of the algorithm. After that, the second part presents the results gained by the implementation of the method in two case studies: real-life water distribution systems of a small and a medium-sized town.

The manufacturer decides the wholesale price of the products and its selling quantity via the online channel, and the retailer decides the service level and its selling quantity via the traditional channel. We consider three Cournot competition games: Manufacturer-as-leader game, retailer-as-leader game, and simultaneous game. Optimal solutions are derived for these games. Based on the optimal solutions, we investigate the quantity leadership/followership decisions for the manufacturer and retailer, associated with the changes of some parameters. We observe that when the service sensitivity parameters are low, being a follower is a dominant strategy for the retailer; otherwise, both strategies of manufacturer-as-leader (retailer as the follower) and retailer-as-leader (manufacturer as the follower) are Nash equilibriums.

In this investigation, the content analysis is used to scrutinize the research to establish the knowledge, reveal the research opportunities and propose research strategies. The supply chain for product-service system depends more heavily on the implementation of the cooperation, collaboration and integration principles in operation. However, a complete analysis reveals that those crucial principles did not embody in current literature. Current research also failed to discuss the service operation decisions by modelling the intricate relations among them in a broad product-service supply chain context. Thus, the future research directions include developing service demand forecasting models; combining the time-series methods and the causal methods; establishing service resource planning models; addressing the relations between service deliverables, service capacity and the service resource; and strengthening the quantitative evaluation of the product-service supply chain performance with a systemic view. Moreover, by addressing the principles of cooperation, collaboration and integration, the added values of this review are the proposed research strategies for integrated forecasting of product services, integrated product-service resource allocation and scheduling, and systematic performance evaluation of the product-service supply chain. The findings and the proposed research strategies develop an in-depth understanding of product-service supply chain applications and serve as a basis for future research. </jats:p>",

Mixed sampling techniques (i.e. random, census and purposive) were applied to select sampling units. Descriptive statistics and the ordered logit model were used to analyse the data. This paper found that governance structures, opportunistic behaviour, asymmetric information and trust influence actors’ incentives in each functional node of the wheat value chain. Specifically, extension services, governance structures, power relations and price information have significant and positive effects on producers’ price incentives. The study provides pioneering evidence of the effects of governance structures on incentives in each functional node of the value chain. The study adds new knowledge to the existing empirical knowledge. The results recommend government to use effective policy interventions to reduce opportunistic behaviours and asymmetric information, and to adopt incentive strategies to encourage investment, and increase productivity and profitability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with capital constraints often have no access or find it costly to obtain a loan from a bank; the retailer tends to borrow money from other enterprises in the supply chain by trade credit financing. We consider an emission-dependent supply chain with one emission-dependent manufacturer and one capital-constrained retailer in need of financing to explore the optimal operational and environmental strategies of a low-carbon supply chain under trade credit financing. We use a Stackelberg game model to depict the low-carbon supply chain. We analyse the optimal carbon-emission reduction effort, wholesale price, and order quantity in the equilibrium state. The impacts of key parameters, such as the retailer’s internal working capital, the manufacturer’s risk-aversion degree, and the carbon-trading price on the supply chain operation, are analysed. The results show that the retailer’s capital constraint causes the carbon-emission reduction effort, wholesale price, and order quantity to improve synchronously. The supply chain achieves a win-win outcome for both the manufacturer and the retailer when the capital-constrained retailer is funded via trade credit from the manufacturer. The in-depth development of financing is beneficial to the manufacturer but is a disadvantage for the retailer. When the initial carbon-emission quota is low, the manufacturer benefits from a relatively lower carbon-trading price. Otherwise, a higher carbon-trading price is better for the manufacturer. The “carbon-trading price trap” ensures that the retailer’s profit is minimal. We further investigate the scenario in which the manufacturer is risk averse and find that the retailer will purchase fewer products and that the manufacturer will gain less profit to decrease the carbon-emission reduction effort. The manufacturer’s risk aversion is unfavourable to both the economic and environmental outcomes of the whole supply chain. This research provides strategic support for a low-carbon supply chain to carry out operational decisions in the context of enterprise capital constraint. To examine the theoretical results, the data used in the existing literature are further used to simulate the corresponding conclusions. Our research enriches the existing supply chain finance literature and provides decision support for the supply chain core enterprise.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The lagged time on goodwill is a common phenomenon in the process of quality improvement, which plays an important role in making quality strategy of supply chain. With increasing public attention to quality, supply chain quality management has become a research focus in recent years. This paper probes into the lagged time of quality on goodwill under the competitive environment of retailers and constructs a lagged differential equation of quality on goodwill based on the Nerlove–Arrow model. The results indicate that the optimal goodwill and quality are higher under centralized decision-making than under decentralized decision-making; however, whether or not the profit of the entire supply chain is higher under centralized decision-making depends on the span of the lagged time. Under decentralized decision-making, the lagged time of product quality on goodwill is favorable to retailers but unfavorable to manufacturers and vice versa. Therefore, when competition is low, a supply chain tends to adopt centralized decision-making. When competition is intense, it is appropriate for a supply chain to adopt decentralized decision-making. In conclusion, this paper analyzes the effects of the lagged time on the optimal quality level and supply chain profit as well as the effect of the competition coefficient on research findings concerning supply chain profit under centralized and decentralized decision-making to verify the relevant conclusions of this paper.</jats:p>",

In this study, the performance of existing equations collected from studies on vertical pipes is assessed, and an approximation for the of vertical pipes in the full flow regime, without Re, is proposed. The performance of the Brkić and Praks equation is the best, with a maximum relative error (MRE) of 0.003% (extremely accurate). The MRE of the new approximation is 0.43%, and its assessment level is very accurate.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In manufacturer-led closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with two competing retailers, the retailer-1 recycles WEEE whose fixed recycling cost is asymmetric information. Using dynamics game theory and principal-agent theory, three dynamic game models are built including (1) benchmark model without reward-penalty mechanism (RPM); (2) decentralized model with carbon emission RPM; (3) decentralized model with carbon emission RPM and recovery rate RPM. This paper discusses the influence of RPM and retailers competition on the CLSC and members benefits. The results show that (1) the carbon emission RPM increases retail price, but decreases the WEEE recycling motivation usually. On the contrary, the recovery rate RPM guides WEEE recycling and lowers the retail price effectively. (2) In any case, the retailer-1’s profit is higher than that of the retailer-2; apparently it suggests that the retailer recycling WEEE gains competitive advantages. Furthermore, both the recovery rate RPM and retailers competition are beneficial to improve the competitive advantage. The relationship between two retailers’ retail price is affected by many complicated factors. (3) The WEEE buyback price and WEEE recovery rate with high fixed recycling cost (H-type) are always higher than that of low fixed recycling cost (L-type), respectively, which means that the H-type fixed recycling cost has scale advantages; the greater the reward-penalty intensity and the fiercer the competition, the more obvious the scale advantages under certain condition. (4) The retailers’ competition can not only guide WEEE recycling but also improve retailers’ profits. Meanwhile, the impact of competition on the manufacturer is related to RPM, but the fierce competition decreases the manufacturer’s profit.</jats:p>",

The concentrations of cadmium in the global polished (white), market rice supply-chain were assessed in 2270 samples, purchased from retailers across 32 countries, encompassing 6 continents. It was found on a global basis that East Africa had the lowest cadmium with a median for both Malawi and Tanzania at 4.9 μg/kg, an order of magnitude lower than the highest country, China with a median at 69.3 μg/kg. The Americas were typically low in cadmium, but the Indian sub-continent was universally elevated. In particular certain regions of Bangladesh had high cadmium, that when combined with the high daily consumption rate of rice of that country, leads to high cadmium exposures. Concentrations of cadmium were compared to the European Standard for polished rice of 200 μg/kg and 5% of the global supply-chain exceeded this threshold. For the stricter standard of 40 μg/kg for processed infant foods, for which rice can comprise up to 100% by composition (such as rice porridges, puffed rice cereal and cakes), 25% of rice would not be suitable for making pure rice baby foods. Given that rice is also elevated in inorganic arsenic, the only region of the world where both inorganic arsenic and cadmium were low in grain was East Africa.</jats:p>",

Inexpensive sequencing promises a better understanding of parameters, such as dN/dS, but analyzing very large data sets poses a major statistical challenge. Here, I introduce genomegaMap for estimating within-species genome-wide variation in dN/dS, and I apply it to 3,979 genes across 10,209 tuberculosis genomes to characterize the selection pressures shaping this global pathogen. GenomegaMap is a phylogeny-free method that addresses two major problems with existing approaches: 1) It is fast no matter how large the sample size and 2) it is robust to recombination, which causes phylogenetic methods to report artefactual signals of adaptation. GenomegaMap uses population genetics theory to approximate the distribution of allele frequencies under general, parent-dependent mutation models. Coalescent simulations show that substitution parameters are well estimated even when genomegaMap’s simplifying assumption of independence among sites is violated. I demonstrate the ability of genomegaMap to detect genuine signatures of selection at antimicrobial resistance-conferring substitutions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and describe a novel signature of selection in the cold-shock DEAD-box protein A gene deaD/csdA. The genomegaMap approach helps accelerate the exploitation of big data for gaining new insights into evolution within species.</jats:p>",
