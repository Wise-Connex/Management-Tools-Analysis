      "abstract": "<jats:p>MSMEs that previously only relied on human resources are now forced to keep up with the times by utilizing IT in every process, from raw material procurement, production processes to distribution processes in order to remain competitive in facing a business world full of challenges. Information Technology, which is closely related to digitalization, can help companies gain sustainable competitiveness in the supply chain by improving certain asset relationships, facilitating information exchange, and building long-term cooperative relationships as a form of implementing Supply Chain Digitalization. The ability of MSMEs to implement green supply chain management is a unique ability to improve company performance. For example, a company can reduce production costs by involving its suppliers in several green initiatives, such as material recycling, environmentally friendly packaging, and efficient use of energy. Companies with high supply chain resilience will be strong and grow significantly in the face of crises, thereby minimizing losses. Therefore, companies with good supply chain resilience will have a competitive edge so they can grow faster and win the competition from their competitors. For this reason, this study aimed to examine the effect of supply chain digitization, green supply chain, and supply chain resilience on competitiveness. This research is Explanatory Research. Data collection uses a questionnaire. The sampling technique uses purposive sampling. The total sample was 400 MSMEs Managers in Pamekasan Regency, and used data analysis, namely Structural Equation Model (SEM) with AMOS software. The results highlighted that Supply Chain Digitalization, Green Supply Chain and Supply Chain Resilience has a direct and significant influence on MSMEs Performance. Moreover, Competitiveness partially mediates the relationship between Supply Chain Digitalization, Green Supply Chain and Supply Chain Resilience and MSMEs Performance. The findings of this study suggest that managers should be made aware that Supply Chain Digitalization, Green Supply Chain, Supply Chain Resilience can be an important driver for Competitiveness which in turn would enhance MSMEs Performance.</jats:p>",

To ensure its stability and sustainable development, it is essential to conduct optimization research on the supply chain network. This article analyzes the types of interruptions in the supply chain of fresh agricultural products and proposes three targeted resilient strategies. Focusing on the fresh agricultural product supply chain with agricultural wholesale markets at its core, a resilient optimization model considering supply chain interruptions is constructed. An improved NSGA-II algorithm is also designed to solve the model. Finally, the correctness of the model is validated using the case of the Nanjing Agricultural Wholesale Market. The results indicate that the application of resilient strategies not only reduces the supply chain costs by around 11% but also significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The sample unit is the consumer household of the public health divisions. The sample size is 181. A multistage random sampling procedure was adopted to choose the sample household. Descriptive statistics and structural equation models are used to analyse the data. This study found that consumer satisfaction is influenced by water supply quantity, pressure, timing, and visual aspects. The main factors causing interruptions include pipeline breakage, cyclone impact, summer water depletion, construction work, motor damage, and reservoir cleaning. Households are not well-informed about advance payment, its benefits, and the proper procedure for obtaining a receipt. Household income, education, satisfaction with water quality, the period of the service association, supply water price, and sufficiency of water during summer directly affect consumers’ willingness to pay. Discontent with appearance and taste affects quality dissatisfaction and indirectly willingness to pay.</jats:p>",

Drawing on theories of social networks and organizational climate, this study examines the role of buying firms' organizational climate for innovation. It uses several structured and unstructured datasets for S&amp;P 500 firms and applies count regression models to test hypotheses. Supply network data from FactSet were analyzed to determine the degree centrality of a buying firm. Computer‐aided content analysis was used to capture the organizational climate of buying firms based on online employee reviews collected from Glassdoor. The results suggest a positive relationship between the degree centrality and the innovation performance of buying firms. Moreover, certain facets of the organizational climate related to learning, including rewards and career progress, as well as work pressure management, affect the link between the degree centrality of a buying firm and its innovation performance. In conclusion, this study enhances the understanding of the connection between supply networks and innovation. It highlights the crucial role of a firm‐level factor, specifically the influential facets of organizational climate for learning, in determining innovation performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In today's environment, special attention is paid to various methods of intensifying natural and wastewater treatment processes, improving existing treatment technologies, and introducing new methods and techniques to improve the quality of wastewater treatment and reduce the anthropogenic impact on the ecosystem. It is important to take into account not only the effectiveness of cleaning, but also its environmental friendliness and compliance with modern standards and requirements for environmental protection. This approach helps to ensure the sustainability of ecosystems and preservation of water resources for future generations.\r\nThe article highlights the issues related to the use of physical methods of water treatment in water supply systems. To intensify the processes of ion exchange in water supply systems, a method of adjusting the mineral composition of natural and waste water using modified ion exchangers is proposed, which involves the simultaneous action of a magnetic field on the ion exchanger and the water to be treated. The use of magnetic modification of ion exchangers allows to increase the productivity of water treatment facilities by an average of 25-30%, with the receipt of filtrate of the required quality, to increase the duration of the filter cycle, to reduce the consumption of regenerative solutions, which indicates an increase in the efficiency of water treatment as a result of the use of magnetic modification.\r\nAn increase in the dynamic volume capacity of ion exchangers by 15-20% was found, which indicates an improvement in ion exchange capacity due to the intensification of ion exchange processes in water supply systems. The intensification of ion exchange processes during the adjustment of the mineral composition of natural and wastewater using a magnetic field is determined by the following main factors: the effect of the magnetic field on the structure and properties of water filtered through the ionite and the effect of the magnet field on the activity and mobility of the exchanged ions, their diffusion and hydration, ion-exchange equilibrium, and other factors.</jats:p>"

While this work is not intended to negate experiential or intuitive decision making, leaders are encouraged to examine operational decision making through a lens of how experience can be supported by organisationally derived information yielding more effective operational decisions. While experiential learning is beneficial in determining how organisational decisions are being made, data presents why such decisions are made in the first place. More important still, what impact might decisions have on healthcare operations if grounded in ill-informed, ill-defined decision-making processes? Especially within healthcare supply chain operations, decision making should be a collaborative, multidiscipline, multistakeholder process that is best grounded in data-driven approaches. Healthcare supply chain data and analytics can and do provide a valuable framework within which operational decisions should be viewed. Potentially gleaned from this paper will be a perspective relatable to evidence-based analyses permitting the evolution of better-informed leadership decision criteria contributing to tangible organisational resilience, agility and flexibility.</jats:p>"

It is still impossible to systematically understand the transient synchronization mechanism of the wind power grid-connected system from the perspective of the whole fault stage. Therefore, this study uniformly reveals its temporary synchronous stability problem and proposes a large/small disturbance adaptive synchronous stability control method, which improves the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine through the control of the inverter itself to improve the system stability—using different scenarios, such as single doubly-fed wind turbines. The experimental results show that the small disturbance on the AC side significantly impacts the system characteristics, followed by a bit of annoyance on the DC side. The DC side fault will cause a change in system frequency characteristics, especially at the receiving end. However, compared with the Voltage Source Converters-High Voltage Direct Current (VSC-HVDC)system, Modular Multilevel Converters-High Voltage Direct Current (MMC-HVDC) systems operate at a much higher frequency and produce less low-frequency harmonics. This makes them less likely to induce subsynchronous oscillations in the system.</jats:p>",

However, Kenya faces significant post-harvest losses, mainly attributed to challenges in first and last-mile logistics. In the era of technological advancements, this research paper explores the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance the Kenyan agri-food supply chain. Building on existing information, the study focuses on AI's role in monitoring and controlling farmland outputs, optimizing supply chain logistics, and addressing fraud and counterfeiting. The research objectives include assessing AI's utility in monitoring and controlling outputs in farmlands improving supply chain efficiency, and combating fraud in agricultural inputs. Research methods involve a comprehensive literature review, analyzing case studies such as Project FARM and FAO's Fall Armyworm Monitoring and Early Warning System, and reviewing scholarly articles on AI applications in agriculture. The research results highlight the benefits of leveraging AI in farmland monitoring, climate change adaptation, supply chain logistics, and fraud prevention. AI technologies can enhance agricultural productivity, reduce transportation costs, and eliminate corruption in the supply chain. The findings suggest that integrating AI systems into the agri-food supply chain is vital for achieving sustainable agriculture in Kenya. The study concludes that AI offers innovative solutions to address the challenges faced by smallholder farmers, enhance supply chain efficiency, and contribute to achieving zero hunger and sustainable agricultural practices.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, despite the efforts made by companies, supply chains are vulnerable to various risks. If not managed efficiently, their consequences will directly impact the achievement of supply chain performance.\nThe literature dealing with risk is innumerably abundant. It should be noted that authors generally define it either to designate undesirable losses and negative results or to assess it in a positive aspect. Our purpose here is simply to carry out a theoretical analysis related to the risks inherent in the supply chain.\nAfter researching to clarify the meaning of the words used, we proceeded to study the various categories of risks inherent in the supply chain.

An optimization algorithm is constructed, and the authors investigate related properties to analyse the consequences of alternative shipment strategies and associated profits through three models. They demonstrate that a firm's optimum inventory level varies according to currency exchange rates and that differing shipment policies can lead to greater total profit in the supply chain.

Analyses of development trends in logistics and production management were used to create the new logistics and supply chain concept. Conclusions were used from the analyses of how the modern concepts of Industry 4.0, Logistics 4.0, Supply Chain 4.0, and 5.0 work. Analyses of the benefits of applying modern management concepts in these areas were carried out and criticised because of their inadequacies, which became apparent during the recent crises in the world. Although the sources of the crises were different, they could be eliminated by reconfiguring logistics systems and supply chains. The results aim to answer three questions: (1) Has the time come to change the current way of looking at logistics and supply chains? (2) What could Supply Chain 4.0 look like using Industry 4.0 tools? (3) How should Supply Chain 4.0 address the logistics and supply chain challenges? The presented answers do not exhaust the topic but rather open up a discussion on logistics and supply chains of the future. The presented concept allows for a completely new global and local view of logistics chains. The structure of the presented model can be subjected to scenario analysis using agent-based simulation modelling due to the structure’s emergent nature. The new approach can significantly benefit the development of local production centres and global supply networks. The benefits mainly come from reducing the environmental impact of manufacturing and logistics processes from the moment the new product idea is conceived.</jats:p>",

Consumers are aware of this, so they are increasing demand for green products. This study considers a two-level supply chain, comprising just one manufacturer and one retailer, applying Industry 4.0 technologies, and supplying a market that prioritizes green products. Each lot of the manufacturer's single product is shipped to the retailer in several batches of unequal sizes. The batch sizes are determined by an arithmetic progression. The manufacturer's Industry 4.0 investment level influences their cost and greenness level. Demand for the product is influenced not only by the retail price, but also by the level of investment in Industry 4.0 and consequently the product's greenness. The authors construct both a non-coordinated decentralized model and a coordinated model under a cost sharing contract, as well as a centralized model. The analysis illustrates that the supply chain's sustainability in both economic and environmental sustainability terms is increased by coordination.</jats:p>",

This article challenges this assumption and argues for simultaneous attention to knowledge interdependencies at the product, supplier, and buyer–supplier levels. Component modularity, supplier knowledge modularity, and knowledge complementarity are focal concepts at each respective level. Theorizing from a knowledge‐based multilevel perspective, this article constructs a typology of effective coordination. Interrelationships among the concepts reveal patterns of required coordination embedded in the system before product development, enabling partners to effectively direct coordination efforts during development. The framework exposes a dilemma overlooked in the single‐level coordination view. For example, when there is low component modularity and high supplier knowledge modularity (i.e., opposing forces for and against coordination), it is difficult to reason how to coordinate SIPD. Proposing that each high/low modularity configuration calls for a specific type of knowledge complementarity, this article contributes to resolving this dilemma.</jats:p>",

Adopting GSCS will ensure maximum utilization of resources but significantly reduce lead-times and climate emissions. The GSCS defines the green techniques for executing RE plants without leverage risk. An exploratory approach has been applied to demonstrate green policies with realistic evidence, which will help to gain knowledge of successful implementation of GSC policies to intensify financial growth and green environmental safety.

This crisis started a discussion about SC sustainability and performance. Therefore, the implementation of advanced technologies and supply chain collaboration could mitigate this disruption with the help of government support and policies. Considering this situation, this paper examines how COVID-19 influences advanced technologies (Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, Digital twins, and Big Data Analytics) and supply chain collaboration (SCC) with a moderating role of government support and policies (GSP) in Pakistan.  The study encompasses a comprehensive assessment carried out via structural equation modeling and data collected from Pakistani companies engaged in SCM or those operating within the SC divisions of manufacturing enterprises. According to the empirical findings, it is evident that COVID-19 outbreaks have a significant influence on SSCP; However, they do not show a similar impact on advanced technologies (AI, IoT, Blockchain, DT, and BDA) and supply chain collaboration, the influence of COVID-19 on SSCP was effectively mediated through advance technologies (AI, IoT, Blockchain, DT, and BDA) and supply chain collaboration. This research contributes to the existing literature on SSCP by emphasizing the importance of the resource-based view, dynamic capability view, and institutional theories. SC and logistics managers can apply the theoretical framework proposed in this study to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic or disruptions in logistics and SC operations, thereby improving profitability in the context of an epidemic.</jats:p>"

To ensure the substantive adoption of labor standards throughout its supply chain, we argue that the retail firm must improve their degree of “supply chain labor compliance integration” by minimizing cross-functional tensions in human capital, identities, processes and goals. We define supply chain labor compliance integration, identify its determinant organizational practices that reduce cross-functional tensions, and explain the mechanisms by which it improves the retail firm’s supply chain labor standards performance. This work offers theoretical and practical insights on the retail firm’s capacity for managing socially responsible supply chains, and more broadly, on how systematically minimizing intra-organizational tensions arising in the pursuit of competing organizational priorities is a prerequisite for their simultaneous execution in inter-organizational business exchanges. </jats:p>",

Research on the perception of public opinion risks has become an indispensable and increasingly important part of emergency management research in transboundary watersheds. Based on relevant literature and interview materials, an exploratory theoretical construction was conducted using the grounded theory research method. The research results indicate that four main categories of public opinion risks, namely, political, economic, ecological and environmental, and socio-cultural, have a significant impact on the perception of public opinion risks among decision-makers in transboundary watershed emergency water supply. The formation mechanisms of decision-makers’ perception of public opinion risks vary in each of these four categories. This research not only enriches the relevant research on the influencing factors of decision-makers’ perception of public opinion risks in theory but also provides decision-making reference and guidance for transboundary watershed water resource management in practice.</jats:p>",

Environmental uncertainty creates the need for swift supply chain adjustments in response to these external changes. Supply chain agility (SCA) has been recognized as a key capability for firms working to achieve superior performance in uncertain business environments. SCA is challenging to achieve, however, because it requires the firm and its supply chain partners to collaborate closely yet flexibly across organizational boundaries. Considering interorganizational systems (IOS) have been widely deployed to establish digital connections across organizational boundaries, this study aims to explore to what extent and how IOS as boundary objects, characterized by standardization and adaptability, affect SCA under different levels of environmental uncertainty. This study provides guidance for information technology (IT) and business directors on how to achieve SCA through the design or implementation of IOS, provides guidance for business directors on how to invest more effectively to capture opportunities and deal with risks, and advises business and IT directors on how to respond appropriately to different levels of environmental uncertainty (e.g., IT directors should design adaptive IOS and business directors should invest in supply chain collaboration when environmental uncertainty is high). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: In a multistage model of a bilateral supply chain, we study two postponement strategies that the downstream retailer may adopt to mitigate the supply yield risk originating from the upstream production process. The retailer could either postpone the procurement payment until after the yield is realized and pay only for the delivered amount; postpone the pricing decision to better utilize the available supply; or do both. Although both strategies have been separately studied in literature, there is little research on their combined effect and system-wide implications in a decentralized setting. Methodology/results: Taking a game-theoretic approach, we formulate a Stackelberg game and solve for the equilibrium in four scenarios, respectively, in which the retailer uses different combinations of the postponement strategies. There are three main findings. First, when the production cost is low and the yield loss is highly likely, the retailer never strictly benefits from either postponement strategy; with relatively high production cost, the retailer is more likely to adopt payment, rather than pricing, postponement. Second, we uncover a situation where postponing payment and postponing pricing are strategic complements for the retailer. That is, the use of one strategy may increase the benefit of using the other. Third, we identify conditions under which the postponement strategies can be Pareto optimal to the entire supply chain, making the firms’ profits and the consumer surplus simultaneously higher. Managerial implications: These results can be applied in many practical settings to provide guidance for firms to better design the procurement contract and properly use marketing instrument (pricing) to effectively mitigate supply risk and increase profit. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: G.

Methods: This research was conducted at the tobacco products industry PT. XZ in Pasuruan Regency. Respondents focused on company managers (focal firms), namely product development, raw material management, research and development pilot plant and tobacco clue management who knew about supply chain risks. Supply chain network integration uses a snowball method approach. Data collection methods use primary and secondary data. At the interview stage, the Delphi method was used to identify risk events and risk sources. Furthermore, the results of the interview were identified using the Supply Chain Operation Reverence (SCOR) and House of Risk (HoR) models. Results: There are 39 risk events and risk agents in the IHT in Pasuruan Regency. There are eight risk priority levels for tobacco supply chain risk agents using the SCOR approach and the Pareto diagram, namely workers not paying attention, problems with machines, high rainfall/high rainfall, production machines need to be repaired, workers' skills are not good, production machines are old, handling bad goods, and errors in the machine. Conclusion: The results of the IHT supply chain risk mitigation strategy formulation are tightening the use of work SOPs, checking production machines regularly, strengthening information between agents and factories, checking machines every 4 hours, conducting worker training, using Google Maps technology in delivering goods, cleaning machines, maintaining product quality, drying/air-drying tobacco leaves, improving quality control during transactions with farmers, and increasing coordination with the Government.</jats:p>"

Therefore, an integrated research model based on strategic human resource management and artificial intelligence was developed to determine the agility and resilience of logistics firms. Empirical data were collected from 221 employees working in manufacturing firms in Saudi Arabia. For the data analysis, a structural equation modeling approach was used. The results indicated that joint leadership, employee skills, organizational culture, competitive intensity, human capital development, and artificial intelligence had substantial explained variance R2 of 80% for supply chain agility. Similarly, an importance performance analysis revealed that, within the integrated research model of supply chain agility, the factors of leadership, human capital development, and organizational flexibility had greater importance in determining supply chain resilience. Practically, this research shows that factors like leadership, employee skills, organizational culture, competitive intensity, human capital development, and artificial intelligence are positively associated with supply chain agility and, hence, require policymakers’ attention. The value of this research lies in its integration of artificial intelligence, organizational flexibility, and strategic human resource management to explore supply chain agility and its examination of the impact of these factors on supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

In particular, the role of government customer concentration—how extensively a firm incorporates government entities as part of its customer base—emerges as a pivotal factor with the potential to both bolster and burden firm performance. Analyzing 3,643 firm‐year observations from the U.S. Federal Procurement Data System‐Next Generation, Compustat, and FactSet Revere reveals an inverse U‐shaped relationship between government customer concentration and firm performance. Excessive or insufficient government customer concentration adversely impacts performance, suggesting that a strategic balance is essential. Firm size, absorptive capacity, and network embeddedness are crucial in navigating this complex relationship, guiding a firm toward optimizing its government customer portfolio. This research advances the discourse on customer base management, underscoring the essential strategic considerations for firms interacting with government buyers.</jats:p>",

Analysing the qualitative field data collected from observations, 89 semi-structured interviews (field notes), 6 focus group discussions and 12 expert interviews, water supply systems, the utilisation in slum communities and power and politics around it are exposed. Even if people can afford to pay the bills, the provision of urban services by state actors (or commissioned firms) is erratic and often not available. The daily infrastructure provision remains the responsibility of individuals and groups, mostly organised in complex yet fragile and changing networks. Drawing from the research on the existing, largely informal water supply in slum communities, this article argues for the recognition and pro-active implementation of hybrid approaches in the planning, implementation and administration of urban infrastructure. It calls for co-production and ‘hybrid water governance’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Significant, long-lasting performance gains may be achieved by integrating digital applications with adjustments to business processes. Despite firms' best efforts, only a small fraction of them have fully realised the benefits of digital technology in optimising their supply chains. According to a recent McKinsey analysis, supply chain digitalization lags behind the other four industries studied by a wide margin. Only 2% of business leaders polled said that supply chain management was the primary goal of their digital initiatives. Do they have their priorities mixed up? Perhaps. McKinsey found that the yearly growth rate of EBIT for firms that actively digitised their supply chains was 3.2%, the highest rise from digitising any business segment, and that annual revenue growth rate was 2.3%. This research shows that a lack of adequate technology and poor management decisions are mostly to blame for the gap between expected and realised benefits of supply-chain digitalization.</jats:p>",

We also propose multiobjective mathematical programming that considers all three models simultaneously and suggests the solution approach.

Findings show sustainability considerations increasingly driven by cost, risk, reputational and regulatory factors, with vertical coordination initiatives helping transfer knowledge to assist suppliers on compliance and emissions reductions. Yet substantial obstacles persist around monitoring, coordination, transparency and technical capabilities, especially amongst lower tiers. The paper discusses how common reporting standards, ethical sourcing certification and partnerships can accelerate electronics supply chain sustainability.

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach that seeks to create insights into disruptions, allowing managers to mitigate supply chain risks using an integrated risk-mitigation tool. In the first phase, the problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that maximizes the expected long-run revenue induced by supply chain risks, given the current state of the risk score. We map four decision states to four specific managerial actions: \"do nothing,\" \"track the supplier,\" \"monitor the supplier,\" and \"change the supplier.\" If the optimal policy is \"do nothing\", then the supply chain risk scores are continued to be monitored. In the case of \"track the supplier\", the firm will track the supplier’s performance internally, however, in the case of \"monitor the supplier\", the firm will hire an external contractor to monitor the external supply chain risks in the supplier’s country and macroeconomic factors. Lastly, if the optimal policy from phase 1 is to ’change the supplier,’ the best-performing supplier is identified using an integrated best-worst goal programming (BWGP) method as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. This second phase of decision support can help allocate supply contracts to the least risky supplier. We demonstrate the integrated risk-based model and the proposed best-worst goal programming (BWGP) method on a global automation technologies company and share the risk-mitigating capability as a case study. Results based on consistency ratio, conformity, and total deviation show that the BWGP performs better than the other MCDM methods and can be used effectively in the integrated two-phase approach with MDP as a supply chain risk mitigation tool.</p>"

This research explores the integration of different SuDS with the aim of significantly reducing both flow volume and celerity of floods in a residual urban catchment area of metropolitan city of Querétaro (Mèxico), where extreme rainfall frequently occurs. This catchment is a representative suburb of urban pressure and environmental degradation problems. Currently, managing storm water under climate uncertainty through a multi-disciplinary approach is a major concern in this urban area. \nA 1D-2D coupling model of shallow water equations, finite volume method, unstructured meshing method, and hybrid parallel computing application defined the optimal configuration of SuDS at catchment scale to reduce the flood vulnerability in Querétaro. Specifically, in this paper we explore the management issues of the proposed SuDS configuration that acts as a water resource system with multiple purposes. A generic simulation model called MODSIM was applied to simulate the designed urban drainage system under a balanced IPCC future climate scenario in terms of reliability, resilience and vulnerability against water scarcity.</jats:p>"

Deep learning models, including those applied to tasks in the life sciences, depend on the quality and size of training or reference datasets. Given the large knowledge gap we experience when it comes to life on earth, we present a data-centric approach to improving deep learning models in Biology: We built partnerships with nature parks and biodiversity stakeholders across 5 continents covering 50% of global biomes, establishing a global metagenomics and biological data supply chain. With higher protein sequence diversity captured in this dataset compared to existing public data, we apply this data advantage to the protein folding problem by MSA supplementation during inference of AlphaFold2. Our model, BaseFold, exceeds traditional AlphaFold2 performance across targets from the CASP15 and CAMEO, 60% of which show improved pLDDT scores and RMSD values being reduced by up to 80%. On top of this, the improved quality of the predicted structures can yield better docking results. By sharing benefits with the stakeholders this data originates from, we present a way of simultaneously improving deep learning models for biology and incentivising protection of our planet’s biodiversity.</jats:p>"

Big data analytics (BDA) can help achieve sustainability goals by extracting meaningful information from past data to help create sustainable strategies. However, in the sustainability literature, BDA's role in enabling sustainable FSC innovations is not explored. Thus, this study investigates how data‐driven analytics might improve FSC innovation by adopting creative tactics in every triple bottom line (TBL) component – green, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and financial – to gain a competitive edge. A resource‐based view (RBV) perspective was used to evaluate the links between supply chain (SC) innovation capabilities and competitive advantage (CA) in FSC innovation and sustainability. Indian food processing enterprises were surveyed using a questionnaire to collect data from 200 respondents. Adopting a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, six hypotheses were evaluated for significance on the surveyed data using AMOS V.20. Since both goodness and badness fit indices were above cut‐off values, the measurement model was robustly evaluated and found to fit the survey data well. Structural model findings supported all study hypotheses. The results indicate that BDA strongly impacts food supply chain TBL and FSC innovation. Data‐driven innovative TBL methods were shown to boost FSC competitiveness. With the growing demand for value‐added innovation in FSC sustainable development, this study uniquely contributes to the current literature by linking BDA and TBL practice innovation to FSC CA.</jats:p>",

World supply is currently vulnerable to disruptions in China for both chemistries: 80% [71% to 100%] of NMC cathodes and 92% [90% to 93%] of LFP cathodes include minerals that pass through China. NMC has additional risks due to concentrations of nickel, cobalt, and manganese in other countries.

Three case studies help make this argument: the rise of the virtuoso musician in western Europe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and their management by concert agents; the history of provenance as a form of value in the visual arts; and the process of designating a cultural practice as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO, which shows how bureaucracies create a stored form of capitalist value as symbolic capital.</jats:p>",

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in digitalising the meat supply chain in India to address these challenges and enhance efficiency, transparency, and traceability. Digitalisation enables real‐time monitoring of environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, during storage and transportation, ensuring optimal preservation of meat products. Government initiatives, such as the Digital India programme and the Atma‐Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, provide support and incentives to foster digitalisation in the meat industry and other sectors. This study analysed the implementation of digital technologies and supply chain performance as the involvement of top management commitment is crucial while carrying out this task. It supports that the implementation of digital technologies would lead to an increase in supply chain collaboration and it further would lead to an increase in supply chain performance. This study will help robust and more unified supply chain by connecting the stakeholders digitally as well as by applying digital technologies for smooth industry operations.</jats:p>",

In Maribor, a contested border town occupied by Slovenian troops and annexed to the newly established State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs, expectations were even higher. A part of the population opposed the town's annexation to the newly established state and compared the living conditions at home with those in Austria. As early as November 1918, the Slovene City Food Council was established in Maribor to feed the city's population. It introduced measures similar to those introduced during the war, such as food ration cards. Despite these measures, food shortages and hunger were part of everyday life, especially in the winter of 1918–19. This article discusses civilians' survival strategies, as well as continuities and discontinuities between wartime and postwar measures to improve the food supply. It shows that despite the efforts of the new Yugoslav authorities, they often continued wartime practices and food remained of poor quality and difficult to access for most of the population throughout 1919.</jats:p>",

Several studies showed that there are many benefits to using Blockchain technology in SCM such as enhanced security, confidentiality, traceability, transparency, data accuracy, privacy, efficiency, accountability, and trust. At the same time, there are many limitations and challenges like scalability, interoperability, legal (regulatory) issues, high implementation and maintenance costs, standardization and information, lack of trust in technology, high energy consumption, limited awareness, integration with current systems, and privacy. Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but there are still several issues that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.

The inventory costs and transportation costs constitute a large proportion of the overall costs. In a competitive world efficiency of manufacturing would be to reduce the cost of manufacturing to increase profit rather than increase selling price to increase the profit. It is true that customer would be displeased with a product in case it is damaged or tampered. So for reduced inventory, transportation cost and safety and security of the product transported packaging is an important aspect. With the emphasis on Green supply chain efforts are being made to reduce the dependency on packaging materials, more so an effort to go in for reusable packaging materials. The proposed research work has the aim of analyzing the importance of packaging in supply chain management. Review of literature indicates that the aspect of packaging is crucial in the field of supply chain management. Studies carried out on the financial aspects of supply chain management have brought out factors such as lack of attention given to packaging of products. A descriptive research methodology is adopted. In the past such a correlation has not been attempted realistically, thus it was found that a study would be enriching, useful and interesting. The findings will give an insight on to the relevance of practicable methods to undertake innovation in the field of packaging not only at the industry level but also at global operations level and may serve as input in improving profitability, ensuring efficiency in business methods and support further research on the subject.</jats:p>",

Findings reveal several barriers these communities face, such as societal mindsets, limited financial support, lack of skills, and logistical challenges, which can impede their participation in supply chains. To address these challenges, this study suggests actionable strategies to create sustainable, inclusive supply chain models, highlighting the role of consistent training, transparent communication, and impact-oriented partnerships. The research underscores the significant socio-economic benefits of inclusive supply chains, offering valuable insights and models for stakeholders aiming to empower marginalized communities, improve social cohesion, and drive local development through equitable business practices.</jats:p>"

During the global pandemic, supply chain managers were forced to rely on short-term solutions with little to no impact on their operations. This paper aims to assess the effect of collaboration, visibility, velocity, and flexibility on supply chain resilience. A total of 66 respondents constitutes the sample of the study, consisting of middle management employees across all depots nationwide. Eight research questions and eight hypotheses were generated and tested at 0.05 significance level using descriptive statistics and path analysis to quantify the relationships among multiple variables. Data were then analyzed through partial least squares - structural equation modeling. Results showed that collaboration, visibility, and flexibility have a significant impact on supply chain resilience. However, velocity did not have a significant impact on supply chain resilience. The research concludes that the supply chain capabilities play a crucial role in the supply chain resilience of the company and its supply chain partners. The key recommendations of the paper help enhance these capabilities to improve the resilience of its supply chain.</jats:p>"

The objective is to design a biomass supply chain network that maximizes the profit of a power plant. Given the uncertain electricity demand, a two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed. A hybrid of risk-neutral and risk-averse modeling frameworks is proposed to analyze the alternative biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain design scenarios. The mathematical model has been proven to be effective in justifying the supply chain design based on a case study of the biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain in Iran.

To analyze heat supply models in Russia, Kazakhstan, USA and China, as well as strategic features in heat supply models of different countries; to identify strategically significant actors that play a leading role in the heat supply industry in different countries; to compare and reveal the features that can contribute to the growth of efficiency of strategizing the domestic heat supply industry.Methods. The research is carried out in accordance with the strategy theory and strategy methodology developed by academician V.L. Kvint in the aspect of analyzing the external environment, interest groups and assessing the influence of strategic actors in the industry.Results. In all the studied countries the state plays the role of regulator and controller, as the industry directly affects the economy of any country and the well-being of citizens. However, the level of regulation and influence of the state on the industry differs. The population as an actor shaping the strategic feature is identified only in the USA. This is due to the high decentralization of the industry and complicates strategizing, because in accordance with the methodology of V. L. Kvint, everyone who will subsequently implement the developed strategy should participate in the strategizing process. Each model has advantages and disadvantages. The US model of heat supply takes into account the opinion of the actors most fully, although it is the most decentralized and has the least population coverage. In contrast, China’s ultra-high centralization model achieves efficient growth and predictable planning in the heat sector. However, this model focuses on achieving quick results through the wholesale supply of heat to industrial enterprises and the use of cheap, unecological fuels such as coal.Conclusions. Most of the models analyzed tend to decentralize the heat supply system. For effective strategizing in the Russian industry it is necessary to increase the role of consumers and generating companies as strategic actors in the heat sector.</jats:p>"

The aim of the DSS we propose is to help a group of agents (in our case, farmers) to pool collect and delivery facilities by proposing (i) an optimal solution for the transportation problem and (ii) a practical method to allocate induced costs among the agents in an explainable and fair way. We argue that the semicore is a seemingly reasonable solution concept for this particular context. Finding allocations in the semicore is less computationally demanding than in other solution concepts such as the core while conveying fairness concepts that can be arguably easily understood without a deep understanding of mathematical language, as opposed to other methods from cooperative game theory (such as the Shapley value or the nucleolus). Applying this concept to the context of a DSS naturally raises the question of whether there could be instances of the TSG that can have an empty semicore (like it can be the case for the core). In this paper we first provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the semicore of an instance of the TSG to be empty. Then, we prove that the set of cost functions that characterize Symmetric TSGs is a union of polyhedra. With this characterization in hand implemented in the form of an SMT program, we are able to exhibit instances of the symmetric TSG where the semicore is indeed empty, and to give some insights on other cases where the solver cannot find any. We advocate that precisely knowing when the semicore can be empty is crucial for the DSS we aim to develop, to warn the stakeholders in some situations that a fair allocation might not exist. Finally, we conclude by giving a short feedback on the proof of concept of a first version of our DSS, tested in practice by members of an association of farmers.</jats:p>"

By establishing an index system to gauge regional digital trade development levels, the article examines the impact mechanism and spillover effects of digital trade on carbon reduction from both the supply and demand perspectives. The research results show that: (1) Digital trade can effectively promote regional carbon reduction, with a more pronounced effect in China's central and western regions and lower carbon emissions regions. (2) Digital trade further suppresses regional carbon emissions through green technological innovation and upgrades in residential consumption structure. (3) Digital trade has spillover effect on carbon emissions, and this “neighborhood effect” is greater than the “local effect”. Digital trade provides strong support for carbon reduction and sustainable development and also provides a strategic direction for government policy formulation.</p>"

The study focuses on EDEKA, the leading grocery retailer in Germany, and its membership in AgeCore, the largest European international retail buying group. The empirical analysis is based on an extensive EDEKA scanner dataset, including over 6 million observations of monthly consumer prices for 138,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) across 20 food categories, over a six-year period. The analysis shows that EDEKA’s membership in AgeCore led to reduced prices for its customers. These findings are consistent with recent studies on the influence of retail buying groups on consumer prices and contribute to an increasing body of evidence that international retail buying groups reduce consumer prices. The paper shows that international buying groups are a force for the good, as they contribute to reduce consumer prices while simultaneously offering a cost-efficient mechanism for retailers to create scale to obtain competitive buying conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ongoing challenge to ensure a sustainable and affordable energy supply forces industrial companies to implement appropriate measures. These measures typically lead to an increased system complexity, which has to be addressed during operation. Whereas existing approaches from the field of supervisory and optimal control appear to be capable of mastering this issue, these are still not adopted in industry. Therefore, this work presents a procedure model for the systematic development of application-oriented operating strategies for industrial energy supply systems. The procedure model combines research approaches from the fields of sequencing control and approximate MPC to extract rule-based operating strategies. By splitting the procedure model into five phases, expert knowledge can be integrated in a target-oriented manner. Subsequently to the description, the procedure model is exemplary applied to the example of an industrial heating supply system. Throughout an optimization study, the developed operating strategy is compared to a MPC strategy as well as a baseline strategy. Whereas the conventional MPC approach is the upper bound with regard to optimality, the developed operating strategy is able to generate comparable results. Compared to the baseline strategy, a relative reduction in operating expenses of 5.4 % to 37.0 % are achieved in this specific use case.</jats:p>"

My entry point is the rising wave of seafarer abandonments, which I approach not as isolated incidents of mismanagement but as an intensification of the flexibilising tendencies underpinning contemporary capitalism. I trace the recent history of these dynamics, examining their effect on shipping labour. I then investigate some of the specific legal and economic mechanics of shipping, focusing on debt, insurance, and bordering. Using supply chain mapping software, I study supply systems in a way that centres labour rather than the commodities being moved. I close by claiming that abandonments are not an accident, but an inevitable endpoint of a system designed to precaritise labour while protecting shipowners’ profits. Against this, I sketch out a new way of conceiving of supply chains—as supply nets, matrices of interconnected lines, prone to becoming tangled.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study addresses the prediction of recurring failures in water supply networks, a complex and costly task, but essential for the effective maintenance of these vital infrastructures. Using historical failure data provided by Companhia de Água e Esgotos da Paraíba (CAGEPA), the research focuses on predicting the time until the next failure at specific points in the network. The authors divided the failures into two categories: Occurrences of New Faults (ONF) and Recurrences of Faults (RF). To make the predictions, they used predictive models based on Machine Learning, more specifically on MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) neural networks. The study revealed that, by analyzing data from past failures and considering factors such as altitude, number of failures on the same street and days between failures, it is possible to achieve an accuracy greater than 80% in predicting failures within a 90-day interval. This demonstrates the feasibility of using fault history to predict future water supply outages with significant accuracy. These forecasts allow water utilities to plan and optimize their maintenance, minimizing inconvenience and losses. The article contributes to the field of water infrastructure management by suggesting that the data-driven approach can be applied in other cities or in networks of different types, such as energy or communication networks. The conclusions highlight the importance of data collection and analysis in preventing failures and optimizing water utilities’ resources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The modern supply chain (SC) is growing in terms of data, devices, users, and stakeholders, which introduced new security challenges and threats, especially with the reliance on centralized servers or cloud platforms. In addition, increased trust among system participants exposes the SC to a higher risk of vulnerabilities which require strong security measures. This article proposes a hybrid security framework for SC systems, BC-DRLzSC, that integrates Blockchain (BC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) designed to operate in a zero trust (ZT) environment. In particular, we propose a decentralized BC-based approach integrated with smart contracts to manage system participant registration and authentication and to control access to system resources. BC-DRLzSC adopts a ZT architecture to reinforce SC security, which can be achieved with an advocate to verify each entity&amp;rsquo;s trustworthiness before granting or retaining access to system resources. Incorporating the ZT architecture, with BC and DRL, can potentially and significantly bolster SC system security. DRL is employed to develop a proactive attack detection model that continuously monitors the incoming traffic from authenticated nodes within the network and predicts any malicious actions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed DRL solution using the NSL-KDD dataset.</jats:p>"

Therefore, a system dynamics model was developed to analyze the WEF system resource flow relationship to achieve sustainable resource development. First, the subsystems of WEF resources were created and their dynamic relationship was formed in the form of a logical loop in a 10-year time frame. The evolution of 7 years (from 2015 to 2022) was taken into consideration to predict the 3-year period (from 2023 to 2025). The results showed that the reduction of water resources exploitation rate in China in interaction with agricultural productivity has automatically improved energy consumption and the nexus index. In China, a dynamic balance between WEF with a focus on water is recommended for planning.</jats:p>",

Similar patterns have been observed in organic pulses, oil, turmeric powder, and jaggery markets. SC-III (Producer - Retailer - Consumer) in organic pulses stands out for its direct and cost-effective approach. Challenges include procedural formalities and time involvement in the certification process, pest attacks and low yields in production. At the same time, awareness gaps and a lack of a proper market platform are critical issues in marketing.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the context of the continuous development of the digital economy, studying the role of supply chain finance in mitigating supply chain risks and enhancing enterprise risk-bearing capacity is of great significance for promoting sustainable development. This study uses data from 2007 to 2019 as samples to empirically analyze the impact of supply chain finance on enterprise risk-bearing capacity. The research results show that supply chain finance plays a positive role in improving enterprise risk-bearing capacity. Mechanism tests reveal that supply chain finance functions through alleviating financing constraints and enhancing innovation capabilities in influencing enterprise risk-bearing. Further exploratory research finds that the influence of supply chain finance on enterprise risk-bearing is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises, while executive incentives do not show significant differences. These findings highlight the important role of supply chain finance in mitigating supply chain risks and enhancing enterprise risk-bearing capacity, providing valuable insights for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

Initiatives leading the implementation of traceability technologies must choose the least-costly set of firms—or seed set—to target for early adoption. Choosing this seed set is challenging because firms are part of supply chains interlinked in complex networks, yielding an inherent supply chain effect: benefits obtained from traceability are conditional on technology adoption by a subset of firms in a product’s supply chain. We prove that the problem of selecting the least-costly seed set in a supply chain network is hard to solve and even approximate within a polylogarithmic factor. Nevertheless, we provide a novel linear programming-based algorithm to identify the least-costly seed set. The algorithm is fixed-parameter tractable in the supply chain network’s treewidth, which we show to be low in real-world supply chain networks. The algorithm also enables us to derive easily computable bounds on the cost of selecting an optimal seed set. We leverage our toolbox to conduct large-scale numerical experiments that provide insights into how the supply chain network structure influences diffusion. These insights can help managers optimize their technology diffusion strategy. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Chung Piaw Teo, optimization. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendix and data files are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2022.01759 . </jats:p>"

The study utilizes the literature review method, examining articles published from 2016 to 2022 and exploring the factors influencing the adoption and implementation of Blockchain in SCM. Multiple scholarly insights have shown no more hacking or cherry picking of options given for presenting data with high confidence and, therefore, reliability, as well as an ability to see everything in a highly limited way. An SCM looking at these multi-party evolutionary models shows that for Blockchain, the key advantages center on significantly increased security, confidentiality, traceability, transparency, data accuracy, privacy, efficiency, accountability, and trust. In contrast, the review has also detailed several limitations and challenges that must be overcome by firms and industries looking to adopt Blockchain within their SCM processes, which include problems with scaling, lower performance as a result of interoperability issues, legal and regulatory matters, very high initial implementation and ongoing maintenance costs, a struggle with standardization of the technology and the needed surveillance of this space, avoidance of technology adoption because of trust, the substantial energy used, low awareness, complexity of integrating with existing systems, being in its last mile in partnerships, and privacy. Even with this potential to transform and be disrupted across industry and its sectors, there are still very significant challenges for Blockchain. For those looking to actually utilize SCM and other sectors, understanding this from a variety of perspectives is of great interest to understand if the technology is fit for that sector and what strategies or networks need to be established or linked into with existing firms. Regardless, if these challenges can be overcome and responded to, then the greater protection and efficiency of current and future SCM processes will not only occur, but it can be the first significant node for broader industry-wide innovation and gains in efficiency.</jats:p>"

The state-space model of the supply chain network is considered to have as state variables the customer's demand and the inventories of the manufacturer, of the retailers and of the distributors. The control inputs of the model are the manufacturer's production and the retailer's ordering quantities. The model is subject to time-delays. It is proven that the dynamic model of the supply chain is differentially flat. This model undergoes approximate linearization around a temporary operating point that is recomputed at each time-step of the control method. The linearization relies on Taylor series expansion and on the associated Jacobian matrices. For the linearized state-space model of the supply chain a stabilizing optimal (H-infinity) feedback controller is designed. This controller stands for the solution to the nonlinear optimal control problem under model uncertainty and external perturbations. To compute the controller's feedback gains an algebraic Riccati equation is repetitively solved at each iteration of the control algorithm. The stability properties of the control method are proven through Lyapunov analysis. The method achieves fast and accurate tracking of the targeted setpoints by the state variables of the supply chain system under moderate variations of the control inputs.</jats:p>"

The research findings suggest that senior executives with military experience can significantly enhance the level of commercial credit supply by the company. The mechanism analysis indicates that top executives' military experience promotes the provision of greater business credit through two pathways: mitigating the level of information asymmetry within the company and strengthening the effectiveness of internal controls. Heterogeneity tests reveal that the positive impact of top executives' military experience on the acquisition of commercial credit supply is particularly pronounced in eastern region companies as well as state-owned holding companies. This study addresses the existing research gap by shedding light on the specific effects and pathways of top executives' military experience in promoting the provision of business credit, thus enhancing our understanding of their personal traits and life experiences.

These events will probably occur again, but they are black swan events and difficult to predict. How can firms manage these events to minimise disruption to their supply chains? This paper proposes that a blockchain architecture has the potential to build resilience in supply chains and give them the flexibility to withstand the challenges of black swan events. The decentralisation ability of blockchain technology enables separation of the discrete elements of a sustainable supply chain so contagion does not impact the overall sustainable supply chain. To achieve flexibility in a sustainable supply chain ecosystem requires governance, leadership, and management. Also, artificial intelligence (AI), in conjunction with blockchain, is a technology that can enhance the flexibility and resilience of the supply chain. Thus, AI can act as a controller, co-ordinator, and an integrator in sustainable supply chain systems.</jats:p>"

By leveraging resources such as predictive analytics systems operated by big data and social media, firms tend to enhance their market demand precision as the selling season approaches, aligning with market practices. With this background, we aim to address the strategic behaviors of competing retailers in timing their orders, filling the aforementioned research gap. We construct a non-cooperative game-theoretical model to analyze the strategic behaviors of competing retailers in timing their orders. The model incorporates factors such as imperfect and evolving information landscapes, considering how firms leverage resources to enhance their market demand precision as the selling season approaches. Our analysis shows two primary equilibria, each shedding light on distinct strategic choices and their implications. First, the better-informed firm decides to execute early orders, capitalizing on the first mover’s advantage, particularly when initial information imprecision exceeds a specific threshold. Conversely, a second equilibrium emerges when the better-informed firm delays its orders, yielding the first mover’s advantage to the less-informed competitor. These equilibria highlight the correlation between order timing strategies and the trajectory of information evolution within the competitive landscape. Additionally, our study extends beyond equilibrium analysis to investigate these strategic choices on supply-chain performance.</jats:p>"

Modern slavery legislation in New Zealand is anticipated in the near future and the University of Otago must be prepared to meet their obligations under this law. This report introduces and advises on four proposals of varying cost and practicality that the University of Otago may implement in their procurement operations. Data to inform these proposals was gathered through interviews conducted with experts, and through a questionnaire sent to all of the University of Otago’s suppliers. These findings not only inform the University’s procurement practices but also contribute to broader discussions on corporate responsibility and supply chain ethics. By anticipating and proactively addressing modern slavery risks, the University of Otago sets a precedent for ethical procurement practices in the academic sector and beyond.\nSupervised by: Ray O’Brien, Stephen Hall\nScholarship Project Funded by: University of Otago Procurement Department</jats:p>"

An important source of pollution emitted in ports involves exhaust gas emissions from ships powered by ship engines while they are berthed in seaports. One of the ways to reduce the level of pollution and nuisance caused by ship engines is to equip ships with Onshore Power Supply (OPS). Unfortunately, still few ports can boast this type of systems at their quays. There are many publications devoted to the analysis of this phenomenon in the technical and engineering terms, but a significant part also concerns the economic, financial, logistic and organizational aspects. The aim of this research is to identify the directions of development as for research into OPS, to organize the terminology devoted to OPS, and to define scientific disciplines of research in the field of OPS. This research was conducted on the basis of the data mining method using the Scopus, EBSCO and Web of Science databases, applying the multi-stage selection of criteria.

The findings of the research indicate that short food supply chains are a necessary condition for the sustainable development of rural areas. Unfortunately, there is a conflict between the pursuit of narrowly defined economic efficiency of farms and the preservation of the social potential of rural areas, which stems from the fact that the principle of price competition does not favor the development of local supply markets, especially when it comes to high-quality food.</jats:p>"

The key objective is to assess the impact of monetary policy, specifically money supply, on inflation dynamics in the country. To achieve this, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach is employed, which is suitable for analyzing cointegration among variables with mixed integration orders. The results reveal both short and long-run cointegration between inflation, money supply, unemployment, and interest rates. Notably, unemployment demonstrates a negative correlation with inflation, while money supply and interest rates exhibit a positive relationship. These findings underscore the importance of dedicated policy measures to manage inflation effectively. The paper concludes by recommending the establishment of a policy implementation body and collaboration between the government and the central bank to ensure financial stability and control inflation through well-calibrated monetary and fiscal policies.</jats:p>"

In this paper, a non-serial telecom supply chain consisting of an infrastructure supplier, a content provider and a telecom operator is formulated under environmental regulation. The telecom operator aims to find the optimal green procurement ratio between traditional and green equipment. Some common real-life situations are assumed, and the service capacity greenness problems are solved by game theory regarding coordination and interaction among supply chain partners. The results show that the prevailing concern of managers’ “energy saving is not money saving” is the direct reason for a mixed purchase strategy. Further, when diseconomy of purchasing energy-saving equipment reaches a certain threshold, tightening environmental regulation may cause telecom companies to reduce the proportion of energy-saving equipment purchased. Finally, the telecom sector is characterized by its booming service capacity per equipment, which benefits green purchase ratio greatly. When the other six influencing factors are relatively stable, the driving force of telecommunication technology update will push the telecom sector to a greener future.</jats:p>"

History reveals that every new technology-based tool faces barriers before becoming widely and successfully adopted, and AI tools are no exception. While numerous studies have already confirmed the benefits of these tools for multinational corporations, many retailers are facing significant barriers in adopting them. A review of the literature showed that the primary barriers are in the areas of human resources, strategic planning, project management and legacy IT systems. To build on these findings and find the AI adoption barriers, an international study of 13 retail and retail technologies experts from eight different countries was conducted. The results suggest that there is a preferred way for retail organisations to be structured and act in order to be successful at adopting AI tools. Based on the literature review and empirical results, a conceptual model for successful AI tools adoption is proposed. This model with broader research results contributes to the literature on AI tools adoption in retail organisations, suggests the steps organisations can take to be more successful, and highlights the importance of company culture and potential return on investment (ROI) of the AI solution for successful adoption.</jats:p>"

Taking this approach, we focus on which institutions contribute to or hinder efficiency, by which we mean the efforts of economic agents to generate maximum welfare from the available (meager) resources. For social reasons, the supply of public catering for children is a statutory obligation on the part of local authorities, where efficiency must be combined with social considerations. The study reviews the rationing mechanism of school meals catering as a public service, looking first at the main factors determining the level of demand for public catering for children, and then at the main factors that influence supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Efficient transportation of fruits and vegetables is crucial for proper storage, handling, and distribution directly influencing their quality, shelf life, and ultimately the price. Maintaining optimal storage conditions during the transport of fruits and vegetables is of utmost importance to preserve their freshness and quality. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a real-time assessment system that can ensure the highest quality and safety of fruits and vegetables throughout the supply chain network. This paper introduces an Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled sensor network designed to address these challenges. The sensors are strategically deployed within the storage containers that continuously assessing real-time critical environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, pH, and air quality. These parameters significantly affect the storage of fruits and vegetables throughout the supply chain network. Furthermore, we have employed machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and Support Vector Machine, to measure performance in terms of accuracy, F1-score, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. The results indicate that the Support Vector Machine algorithm outperforms with the other algorithms with an impressive accuracy of 98.05%. Future research endeavors will focus on optimizing food supply chain loss.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply Chain as a Service (SCaaS) represents an innovative approach for businesses to outsource various aspects of their supply chain, including manufacturing, procurement, warehousing, quality assurance, and logistics. Within the apparel industry, the supply chain encompasses five key categories: design, textile manufacturing, apparel manufacturing, distribution, and end-user purchase. Due to its consumer-centric nature, the apparel supply chain experiences fluctuating demand, posing challenges for effective management. Small apparel businesses often struggle with planning and implementing efficient supply chain strategies, resulting in significant losses, wasted labor, and missed deadlines. This paper proposes the implementation of SCaaS as a tailored solution for apparel units. The primary aim is to offer comprehensive end-to-end management services, ranging from strategic planning to product delivery. By leveraging SCaaS, companies can optimize their time allocation, focusing on customer interactions and the innovation of new products. This approach streamlines operations, enhances efficiency, and mitigates the risks associated with supply chain management, ultimately enabling apparel businesses to better adapt to market dynamics and meet consumer demands effectively.</jats:p>"

The results show that, when the manufacturer has enough capital, both the production quantity and the expected profit in the decentralized system with wholesale price contract are less than that in the centralized system, and the gap between in the decentralized system and in the centralized system is increasing on the own capital. The option contract can coordinate the supply chain with budget-constrained, and in the presence of supply chain coordination, both the manufacturer and the retailer can become better off by setting reasonable option contracts.

The most important sustainability indicators were also grouped and presented in the literature review into the main seven assessment groups of the SSCM construction industry and ranked by experts from Northern Italy and Lithuania in several different ways. Based on the data from the Table 3, it can be inferred that a harmonious work environment among ecological sustainability indicators appeared as the most crucial indicator for respondents. Environmental education was among the most important social indicators. In the legal group, work efficiency emerged as the most significant indicator, while in the physical group, sustainable resource use was crucial. In the political realm, economic and political stability was the most important, and among technological indicators, innovation stood out. Among economic indicators, profit was the most significant sustainability indicator for respondents. A general indicator importance method combined results obtained from expert surveys using various methods. The ranking of sustainability indicators in each group was not included in the calculation of the overall indicator importance, but the results were similar in both cases. The determined importance of indicator values could be adapted for further analysis, specifically for multicriteria evaluation, as per the conceptual model shown in Figure 1. This article provides members of the construction industry with detailed calculations and results of the evaluation of key sustainability indicators related to supply chain groups. This study explores several possible ways to measure the importance of sustainability indicators, which could provide further theoretical insights into SSCM in the construction industry and help develop an accurate sustainability index model.</jats:p>",

For this study, researchers opted for a survey approach. The majority of the data came from surveys that were both well-structured and selected using Cochrane sampling methods. The data was analysed using the discrete response approach and the logistic model. Results showed that SMEs' storage of goods, productivity, and revenue were all negatively impacted by the short duration of the public power supply.

The goal of this article is to present the results of a European Delphi study on enabling factors and barriers to developing robustness within food distribution networks. The paper also aims to identify ways to ensure food security and build resilience in supply chains for European Union (EU) citizens, as well as strategies to protect the agricultural sector. The Delphi theses, the expected timing of their implementation and their impact on selected stages of supply chains were assessed. The paper employs a literature review, the Delphi method and STEEPED analysis to identify factors for increasing the robustness of European food distribution networks. The research findings highlighted crucial factors in enhancing food supply chain resilience, including financial aid to farmers, the use of advanced technologies (like AI, remote sensing, GIS, VR, or drones), and the encouragement of conscious consumption practices. The study revealed that severe weather, inadequate financial support for farmers and insufficient favourable legislation at the national level are the main barriers to achieving resilience in food supply chains. The main recommendations for building food resilience include encouraging localised food supply chains and, advocating for eco-friendly, sustainable production approaches and small-scale agriculture and reducing unnecessary food losses. The originality of the study is reflected in the presentation of the opinions of international experts on developing robustness within food distribution networks in view of the disruption caused by COVID-19 and the geopolitical situation.</jats:p>"

The results show that blockchain technology-driven supply chain financing positively influences financial capital availability. Also, innovation capability positively impacts the strength of the effect of blockchain technology-driven supply chain financing on financial capital availability. In detail, the impact of blockchain technology-driven supply chain financing on financial capital availability is positively dampened by investment in new information systems, methods, and processes when compared to the adaptation to new information systems, methods, and processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The prefabricated construction business is growing quickly, and maintaining the industry's steady growth depends on strengthening the supply chain. However, as the supply chain for prefabricated buildings grows and external risk factors become more prevalent, there will inevitably be occasional construction delays or even disruptions. Additionally, the operational management of the entire supply chain will become more challenging. The purpose of this project is to investigate how blockchain technology might be used to improve the robustness of supply chains for prefabricated buildings. The fundamentals of blockchain technology and the variables influencing supply chain resilience were thoroughly investigated by employing the literature analysis approach and methodically classifying and evaluating pertinent local and international literature. Taking into consideration the features of supply chains for prefabricated buildings, the study also examined the benefits of blockchain technology in terms of boosting information exchange, optimizing resource allocation, and improving supply chain transparency. The study's findings suggest that applying blockchain technology to prefabricated building supply chains can strengthen their resilience, lower risks associated with them, and increase the effectiveness of collaboration within them. Additionally, a thorough integration of blockchain technology with prefabricated building supply chains will open up new development opportunities for the sector. This paper offers some innovation and useful suggestions for applying blockchain technology to improve the resilience of supply networks for prefabricated buildings. It also gives a theoretical foundation.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the CCHP(combined power/heating/cooling) characteristics of AA-CAES are modeled in detail. Its operation constraints are also established. Secondly, bi-level programming method is employed to solve the problem. Capacity is optimized in the upper level with the objective of minimizing the sum of benefit brought by AA-CAES and the fixed cost. Dispatch cost and the treating cost of carbon are optimized in the lower level. Finally, the obvious method proposed in this paper is simulated and analyzed with an industrial park .</p>"

Traditional supply chain management methods, due to their highly integrated and lean production characteristics, often lack resilience and are difficult to cope with such interruptions. The vulnerability exposed by recent global events highlights the urgent need to develop strong strategies to ensure continuity and rapid recovery. This paper aims to explore emergency management and response strategies for resilient supply chain systems in the face of unexpected events, providing systematic solutions to ensure stable operation and rapid recovery. The study delves into various aspects critical to enhancing supply chain resilience, including risk assessment, early warning systems, and emergency planning. It examines the role of advanced technologies such as big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in predicting and mitigating risks. Additionally, it addresses the importance of effective communication and information sharing across the supply chain network, emphasizing the need for transparency and real-time data exchange. By adopting a multi-faceted approach, this paper also explores supply chain design enhancements, such as multi-sourcing strategies and redundancy, which are crucial for minimizing disruption impacts. The rapid response and decision-making frameworks are discussed to highlight the need for swift and coordinated actions during crises. Furthermore, the importance of collaboration and coordination with supply chain partners is underscored as a means to build collective resilience. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive framework for emergency management and response in supply chains, offering practical recommendations and best practices to ensure resilience in the face of unforeseen disruptions. The insights presented aim to guide practitioners and researchers in developing and implementing robust strategies to safeguard supply chain integrity and performance amidst an ever-changing risk landscape.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;#160; &amp;#160; The increasing intensity and severity of droughts, coupled with the challenge of generating reliable forecasts, significantly contribute to food insecurity in developing countries. Enhanced agricultural drought forecasts offering early, impact-based warnings can assist communities in preparing for the detrimental effects of drought, thus diminishing the number of individuals impacted. Drought Early Warning Systems (DEWS) convert physical drought observations into actionable insights, guiding decisions about water-intensive agricultural practices and alternative irrigation water sources. These systems require extended lead times, ideally spanning months or seasons, due to the time-sensitive nature of decisions aimed at mitigating drought vulnerability.&amp;#160;\n\n\n&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Prior research on impact-based forecasting primarily concentrated on precipitation indicators, frequently neglecting the integration of vegetation health, climatic, and hydrological factors, which are crucial in determining crop conditions. This study addresses the limitations of current DEWS by investigating the application of machine learning models, specifically Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), to identify agricultural impact triggers well before the harvest period. These algorithms forecast agricultural drought impacts by constructing decision trees from a comprehensive set of drought indicators. We illustrate the efficacy of machine learning models in predicting maize yield failures and anomalies in the Water Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), a vital measure of crop performance during the growth season.&amp;#160;\n\n\n&amp;#160; &amp;#160; This paper presents the outcomes of a pilot DEWS project, InfoSequia-4CAST, executed by the World Food Programme (WFP) in Mozambique in 2022. The user-end model successfully provided monthly DEWS bulletins for Tete and Gaza provinces with satisfactory reliability. End users had the flexibility to modify various parameters, including input variable selection, lead times of interest (up to six months), optimization statistical metrics, the geographic scale for model development, and the threshold method or value for alert initiation. Furthermore, we discuss prospects for enhancing the reliability of these impact-based forecasts by contrasting the applied and transparent FFT model with the more complex, 'black box' XGBoost model. While simpler approaches like FFTs may be more appealing to decision-makers due to their straightforwardness, their potential for oversimplification might limit their effectiveness, stemming from their restricted use of variables. XGBoost exhibits superior performance over FFTs in identifying drivers of agricultural drought and providing more reliable, data-driven forecasts. Nevertheless, FFTs hold value in contexts where transparency is required, as this can strengthen trust in the forecasts, which is equally crucial for their adoption and the initiation of responsive actions.&amp;#160;</jats:p>"

We show that the duration of starvation determines whether Drosophila melanogaster forms appetitive short-term or longer-lasting intermediate memories. The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and adipose tissue influences how intensely sucrose associated information is stored. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. Octopamine, in turn, suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, because octopamine-deficient mutants can form appetitive short-term memory for sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose at high internal glycogen levels combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to prolonged periods of starvation could lead to increased food intake.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Eskom’s power plants in South Africa face frequent breakdowns due to a lack of maintenance and increasing energy demand. The high dependence of South Africa on coal for power generation, which is a resource that significantly contributes to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that impact the environment negatively, could be reduced by considering renewable energy sources. Renewable energy supply, dependent on private sector funding and economic growth, is seen as a solution to energy and environmental problems. The study aimed to examine if financial development and economic growth impact renewable energy supply in South Africa and to discover if co-integration exists between these variables, including the variables defined as the determinants of renewable energy supply, namely: CO2 emission by coal power generation; secondly, coal electricity supply; thirdly, coal price changes; and lastly, load shedding levels. The research gap identified for the study is twofold. Firstly, there is a lack of research on the relationship between renewable energy supply, financial development, and economic growth, specifically in South Africa. Furthermore, the existing research on these variables in other countries has produced inconclusive results. Secondly, minimal research has been conducted on how economic growth impacts renewable energy supply in emerging markets. Thus, the present study sought to bridge the gap and contribute to the scientific body of knowledge related to the drivers of renewable energy supply. The autoregression distributed lag (ARDL) model was employed to test if economic growth and financial development have a statistically significant impact on renewable energy supply, as well as to test the direction of the relationship, for an observation period from 1990 to 2021. The results proved that financial development and economic growth were reported to have a statistically significant positive impact on renewable energy supply in the long run and the short run. A study on the relationship between financial development, economic growth, and renewable energy supply in South Africa can influence policy reforms and assist the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) and the government in developing and implementing renewable energy policies that encourage the deployment of renewable energy infrastructure to increase renewable energy supply, particularly regarding factors associated with addressing challenges in financial development and economic growth.</jats:p>"

After experimental comparison, the preferred scheme for automatic switching between magnetic coupling transformer and thyristors is preferred. The main circuit of this scheme adopts magnetic coupling transformer and thyristor control method, and the control circuit adopts a three way drive circuit based on MCU control, while adopting the strategy of instantaneous voltage tracking control. This scheme achieves stable operation of the output DC power supply voltage at 24V when the input AC power supply voltage varies from 80 to 850 V. The experimental results showed programme was stable and reliable, and it’s worth applying and has practical significance.</jats:p>",

After the marketing risk reaches a certain level, enterprises would encounter various risks such as blocked marketing plans and failure to meet the estimated marketing goals. Enterprise marketing is affected by economic and market risks such as lack of information, decision-making errors, natural disasters, human factors, and other natural and social risks. This article combined information technology with supply chain management, applied radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to supply chain management, and controlled enterprise marketing risks through reasonable management of the supply chain. It also compared the effectiveness of enterprise marketing risk control between an information technology intelligent supply chain combined with RFID and a supply chain managed by ordinary artificial structures. The experimental results showed that the highest value of goods loss rate in the supply chain based on RFID technology and using traditional technology was 5% and 15%, respectively, according to the sample of goods loss experiments. For the information verification process of goods in supply chain management, the information identification accuracy rates of barcode and RFID technology were 89.98% and 97.7%, respectively. Therefore, applying the information technology intelligent supply chain management model combined with RFID technology to enterprise marketing risk control can save money for enterprises, ensure product quality, and effectively reduce the risks encountered in enterprise marketing by reducing information gaps, and reducing transportation and storage costs.</jats:p>"

In all WQI models, selected parameter data are transformed into many steps to a single number. Since the first model was developed in 1965, a lot of WQI models have been developed. However, all models suffer from many problems such as they are introduced based on site-specific standards for a particular region and give eclipsing, dichotomous, ambiguity, rigidity, and uncertainty problems. In the present work, an effort is made to test many of the applicable WQI models using many logical conditions. The results showed that no one of the tested models satisfies these conditions. The aim of the present work is to develop a WQI model that can be used universally (regardless of the standard used) and covers different uses of water (drinking, recreational, irrigation, or industrial). Moreover, it can overcome the previously mentioned problem. The suggested new WQI model developed in this work succeeded in achieving these two goals.</jats:p>",

Methods: The epsilon-constraint method is utilized for solving the model and further extracting the Pareto solutions. Results: The result of the research clearly shows an optimal trade-off between the conflicting objectives, where, by paying more attention to the social and environmental aspects of sustainability, the total costs are increased or by optimizing the number of facilities, a better balance between the dynamics associated with the short-term and long-term goals is reached. The results of the sensitivity analysis also show that increasing the demand of the supply chain has the greatest impact on the supply chain costs compared to other objectives. Conclusions: Consequently, investigating such comprehensive sustainable objectives provides better insights into the impact of design variables on the expectations of stakeholders.</jats:p>"

Supply chain costs fluctuate due to factors such as sourcing, transportation, and inventory management. Therefore, improving the operational efficiency of the supply chain is crucial for boosting profitability in today's context. Supply chain operations are inherently complex, with uncertainties impacting various costs, thereby affecting return on investment and profitability. To address this, supply chain cost optimization should ensure that the supply chain is responsive, agile, and adaptable for both current and future operations. Optimizing these costs enhances operational efficiency, leading to increased revenue and profits. This article examines various supply chain cost parameters, including total operating costs, profit, revenue, logistics costs, and information sharing costs, through the lens of multi-objective optimization. It assumes a generic three- stage supply chain model comprising suppliers, manufacturers, and customer zones. A trade-off curve among the selected objective functions and relevant constraints is developed and presented. This trade-off curve aids decision- makers in understanding the impact of supply chain optimization on the selected objectives, thereby fostering enhanced profitability and revenue generation in both present and future supply chain operations.</jats:p>",

The present study conducts a comparative analysis, evaluating the effectiveness of four multi-objective optimization algorithms implemented within the EPANET framework for the optimal design of three distinct WDNs taken from the literature. The networks were optimized considering three objectives: maximizing network resilience, and uniformity coefficient (CU, a measure of uniformity), alongside minimizing the cost of the network. Further, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis is carried out, encompassing various MCDM techniques and weighting methods, to explore the sensitivity of solution rankings. In Network 1, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA-II) produced suboptimal solutions with CU and In values below 0.4, while caRamel, multi-objective particle swarm optimization based on crowding distance (MOPSO-CD), and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition (MOEA/D) showcased increasing CU and In values towards 1, paralleled by a rise in network cost. The performance of NSGA-II in Network 3 was unsatisfactory (CU &amp;lt; 0.32), while the other algorithms demonstrated satisfactory values (&amp;gt;0.98) for reliability and (&amp;gt;0.5) for CU. The findings offer valuable insights into cost-effective strategies for achieving equity in water supply without substantial impact on overall network cost. The findings of the study also underscore the sensitivity of ranking outcomes in MCDM analysis to the choice of technique and weighting method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The mismatch between supply and demand caused by asymmetry of market information has long been an issue. This paper studies a two-tier supply chain model consisting of automaker and chip suppliers with unstable supply and fluctuating prices. First, an analysis is conducted on how the manufacturer’s order strategy is affected by the supplier’s wholesale price and reliability when the supplier dominates the market. Then a set of supply chain coupling mechanisms is designed to analyze its feasibility in solving the supply shortage issue. Finally, the coupling coefficient is solved to maximize the revenue of the supply chain. Theoretical analysis results show that there is a threshold point for the supplier’s effort cost coefficient, and when the effort cost coefficient exceeds the threshold point, the supply is no longer stable, and it triggers a sharp increase in supply price. This threshold point is affected by the supplier’s production cost, manufacturer’s order quantity, and asymmetry of demand information. According to simulation studies, there is always a supply chain coupling coefficient that optimizes the total benefit of the supply chain. In this coupling coefficient, the supplier’s reliability and the manufacturer’s order quantity reach the maximum. Finally, compared with vertical integration, a coupling mechanism is more advantageous in coordinating the supply chain in the field of high-end chips.</jats:p>",

Constant bombing and damage to critical infrastructure facilities, including water management facilities, endangers the stability and quality of the country's water resources. In this context, conducting research on the identification of man-made risks in water treatment systems using various technologies, as well as developing strategies to increase the reliability and safety of operation of water supply systems are becoming relevant for the industrial sector of Ukraine. In order to increase the reliability of water treatment units and their operational safety, man-made risks were investigated when using ion exchange, electrodialysis, and water distillation technologies at thermal power plants. It is shown that during normal operation of the ion-exchange water purification system with an average productivity of 400 m3/h, in the case of frequent changes in the concentration of salts at the inlet, the risk of receiving underpurified water is 0.0783. This value must be taken into account for the assessment of economic and social-ecological risks, since it exceeds the generally accepted value of 0.01. When using electrodialysis water purification and frequent changes in the concentration of salts at the inlet, the risk of receiving underpurified water is 0.0271. This value is also greater than 0.01 risk accepted as acceptable. The water distillation technology has enough margin to compensate for any deviations in the purification process and gives a very low risk. However, the distillation process is more effective in removing only soluble impurities, while in the case of suspended substances, in particular of organic origin, there is a risk of exceeding the limit of 0.01.</jats:p>"

We develop and solve multi-stage stochastic programming models that incorporate demand and supplier disruption information updates, while considering both risk-neutral and risk averse (CVaR) objectives. These models assist organizations with varying risk attitudes in achieving maximum performance by optimally selecting a procurement portfolio based on the availability and quality of updated information.

Minimising waste, environmental effect, and resource efficiency are its goals. In a circular supply chain, green innovations can include product design that facilitates recycling or reuse, process improvements that reduce energy consumption and emissions, logistics solutions that optimise transportation for lower carbon footprints, and service innovations that promote sustainability. These green ideas improve supply chain efficiency and competitiveness while helping the environment. Businesses may reconcile economic growth and environmental stewardship by rethinking and rebuilding linear supply models into circular and sustainable ones, paving the way for a more sustainable future. This study examines how green innovations affect circular supply chains in Andhra Pradesh's durable goods industry. It analyses how product, process, logistical, and service green innovation improves supply chain efficiency. The quantitative research uses structured surveys to obtain data from 150 industry professionals and customers. Convenience sampling was used to acquire varied supply chain performance metrics responses.  SPSS is used for rigorous regression analysis in the study. This method lets you study how green innovation affects circular supply chain performance. All green innovations improve supply chain efficiency, but green service innovation has the greatest benefit. This research provides strong evidence for green innovations in durable goods industry circular supply networks.

Within this model, a combined approach of game theory and prospect theory is employed, integrating prospect value functions and weight functions to create an information sharing prospect value matrix. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on the strategic choices and benefits of entities considering the psychological perception of information sharing, and critical factors influencing the stability of information sharing evolution results are explored through numerical simulations using Matlab. The key findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, from the perspective of supply chain collaboration, the probability of entities evolving into information sharing is negatively correlated with the cost of information sharing and positively correlated with the benefits generated by information coordination. Secondly, looking at supply chain collaboration, entities are more likely to engage in information sharing behavior when they exhibit a lower level of risk aversion, indicating greater rationality, when facing profits; conversely, they are more likely to participate in information sharing when they display a higher degree of risk preference, indicating less rationality, in the face of losses. Furthermore, the lesser sensitivity of suppliers and retailers to losses is more likely to drive the system towards an information-sharing state. Based on the primary findings mentioned above, this study offers recommendations for enhancing trust, constructing information exchange platforms, and adjusting psychological awareness. These suggestions contribute to improving information sharing among entities within the supply chain, thus enhancing the overall efficiency and collaboration of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

This, in turn, is determined by the functionality and sustainability of the system components, such as the pipe networks, pumps, and other appurtenances, which must be analyzed from an environmental perspective. The aim of the present study is to analyze the sustainability of two different types of water supply pipe materials that are commonly used, polyvinyl chloride and high-density polyethylene, using a comparative Life Cycle Analysis methodology. The functional unit was established in accordance with the water supply system that serves an Italian metropolitan city with a dimension of 9240 km, as one meter of water supply infrastructure, with 40 years as a life span. A cradle-to-gate analysis was conducted, starting from the production phase of the water pipelines to the maintenance phase, excluding the end of life and disposal phases. The chosen methodology was CML, justified by the fact that the results are more understandable and reproducible. Results comparison revealed a higher environmental impact during the production phase, while the maintenance phase had a very low impact. Notably, PVC pipe in comparison with HDPE material had a higher impact, except in two categories of impact: abiotic depletion and photochemical oxidation. The study contributes to the future development of alternative approaches for sustainable and eco-efficient water supply infrastructure designs and materials.</jats:p>"

In addressing this critical aspect, this article presents a methodology for analyzing and predicting key performance indicators (KPIs) within supply chains characterized by limited, imprecise, and uncertain data. Drawing upon an extensive literature review, this study identifies 21 KPIs using the balanced scorecard (BSC) methodology as a performance measurement framework. While prior research has relied on the grey first-order one-variable GM (1,1) model to predict supply chain performance within constrained datasets, this study introduces an artificial intelligence approach, specifically a GM (1,1)-based artificial neural network (ANN) model, to enhance prediction precision. Unlike the traditional GM (1,1) model, the proposed approach evaluates performance based on the mean relative error (MRE). The results demonstrate a significant reduction in MRE levels, ranging from 77.09% to 0.23%, across various KPIs, leading to improved prediction accuracy. Notably, the grey neural network (GNN) model exhibits superior predictive accuracy compared to the GM (1,1) model. The findings of this study underscore the potential of the proposed artificial intelligence approach in facilitating informed decision-making by industrial managers, thereby fostering economic sustainability within enterprises across all operational tiers.</jats:p>"

In this scope, the GWFdomestic was calculated as the amount of water required to reduce the total nitrogen concentrations of domestic wastewater released into receiving media from 81 cities in Türkiye. GWFdomestic values were estimated based on the data on wastewater amount and applied wastewater treatment process. GWFdomestic was calculated by dividing the pollutant load of discharged water by the critical concentration in the surface water. The empirical results showed that (a) the produced wastewater amount increased up to 125 m3/year in some cities. (b) GWFdomestic values showed a difference between 330 and 1,900 depending on the level of treatment, and the average value was about 750 m3/ca.year. (c) A total of 81 cities were grouped under four categories, and applied water treatment technology was the main characteristic of this classification. (f) GWFdomestic has not statistically significantly changed over time in a large part of the country. It can be concluded that country-scale GWFdomestic accounting can assist water managers in developing prevention measures by analyzing spatio-temporal differences in the water footprint of domestic discharges.</jats:p>",

The forecast was developed via hybrid RNN (recurrent neural networks) incorporating LSTM (long short-term memory) and GRU (gated recurrent unit) layers. This research utilized hybrid recurrent neural network designs with deep learning methods to build several power factor models. These layers have advantages for time series forecasting. After conducting time series forecasting, qualitative indicators of the prediction were identified, including the sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) and regression coefficient.

Despite the rapid growth of green supply chain management research, scholars have not fully examined supplier development in the context of the adoption of environmentally sustainable practices. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between green supplier development strategies and supplier adoption of natural resource‐based view (NRBV) strategies, as well as their impact on green supply chain management (GSCM) practices. We make a significant contribution in this field by integrating a natural‐resource‐based view and a dynamic capabilities perspective to investigate how firms in developing economies overcome the environmental sustainability capability deficiencies of small and medium‐sized enterprises and are able to develop and implement environmentally sustainable practices. Based on a survey of 167 manufacturing companies in Kenya, the findings reveal that focal firms' indirect environmental sustainability supplier development strategies significantly impact environmental sustainability practices among suppliers and that the focal firm‐supplier dyadic relational capabilities significantly affected suppliers' implementation of environmental sustainability practices. Furthermore, focal firms' resource investment (financial and capital) in environmentally sustainable supply chain management programs to develop suppliers has a significant impact on suppliers' implementation of environmental sustainability practices.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the petroleum industry as a main industry plays a vital role in Iran’s economy as well as CO2 emissions. This paper aims to propose a new mixed integer linear programming model for a closed-loop supply chain network design in an Iranian petroleum complex. We consider a four-echelon supply chain network including input feed suppliers, primary petroleum manufacturers, secondary petroleum manufacturers, and customers. In addition, collection and recycling centers are also considered for products that have reached the end of their life. To close the problem to real-world conditions, we consider different technologies and different types of capacity for candidate petrochemical complexes and different types of vehicles for transportation. All types of vehicles have a given capacity and differ in terms of cost and CO2 emissions. Two objective functions are considered for simultaneous optimization, which include total expected cost and total CO2 emissions. The model's efficiency is validated based on data from a real case in the production and distribution chain of a petroleum complex in Iran. The result represents the conflict between the two objective functions and the proposed model provided several options as Pareto solutions for decision makers. Moreover, sensitivity analysis represents the effect of variations in the capacity of domestic refineries, the capacity of vehicles, and the capacity of secondary petrochemical complexes on two objective functions and the final values of decision variables. Specifically, we find that changes in the capacity of refineries, causes a 12% change in the value of the emitted CO2 but the total expected cost doesn’t change significantly. Finally, managerial insights are gained through the numerical results.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global business landscape has witnessed a paradigm shift towards sustainability in recent years, with an increasing focus on responsible business practices. Maximum environmental impact is created at the value chain rather than the final producers. One crucial aspect of this shift is the adoption of sustainable supply chain management by companies worldwide. This abstract explores the role of companies in adapting to regulations such as the business responsibility and sustainability reporting (BRSR) frameworkand other similar initiatives aimed at enhancing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. Sustainable supply chains play a pivotal role in mitigating traditional business operations’ environmental and social impacts. The BRSR framework and other regulatory mechanisms provide a structured approach for companies to disclose their sustainability efforts and demonstrate transparency in their supply chain activities. This study delves into the critical components of these regulations and how companies arenavigating the complexities of compliance. Companies increasingly recognize that integrating sustainability into their supply chains aligns with regulatory expectations and enhances long-term business resilience. This study will examine the role of sustainable supply chains in their procurement, production, and distribution processes to mitigate risks associated with climate change, resource scarcity, and social inequality. The study also explores companies’ challenges in implementing sustainable practices and innovative strategies to overcome these hurdles. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the evolving landscape of sustainable supply chains and the proactive measures companies take to adapt to regulatory frameworks like BRSR. By embracing sustainability as a core business value, companies comply with regulations, foster innovation, improve stakeholder relationships, and contribute to a more resilient and responsible global business ecosystem.</jats:p>"

The effectiveness of the use of concessions is proved on the example of Voronezh and Perm energy companies. The renewal of the Russian heat supply system is, unfortunately, extremely slow. Despite the measures taken, the dynamics of equipment failures, accidents and heat losses have not yet been changed: their number is still gro wing. In a year, it is possible to update only half of the fixed assets from the need. The reasons for this are their sharp moral and physical ageing and lack of investors who would finance reconstruction, modernisation and erection of new heating system objects. The owners of the systems in many Russian regions are municipalities whose budget funds are insufficient to upgrade them. Mechanisms of public-private partnership (concession agreements are one of its manifestations) together with the “alternative boiler house” mo del should contribute to rectifying the situation. However, unconscientiousness of some investors, the failure to fulfill their obligations for construction and reconstruction of heat supply systems question the effectiveness of the mechanism and reduces them to lease agreements involving only operation of leased worn equipment. According to the research, the authors concluded that it is necessary to improve the discussed mechanism, monitor implementation of the agreements and strengthen administrative responsibility for non-compliance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large, powerful corporations were formerly solely and exclusively responsible for supplies, manufacturing, and distribution; however, the supply chain has undergone significant transformations over the last half-century. Almost all supply chain processes are currently outsourced, owing to the initiatives of cutting-edge, contemporary businesses. According to a compilation of studies, analysts, and news sources, the level of risk associated with modern supply chains is considerably higher than the majority of supply chain managers believe. Supply chain vulnerabilities continue to pose a substantial obstacle for a great number of organizations. Neglecting to adequately address these risks—encompassing natural disasters, cyber assaults, acts of terrorism, the credit crisis, pandemic scenarios, and war—could result in substantial reductions in metrics such as profitability, productivity, revenue, and competitive advantage. Unresolved concerns persist with respect to the risk assessment of the supply chain. The purpose of this article is to propose a framework for risk evaluation that can be efficiently applied to the evaluation of hazards within the supply chain. This research study significantly enhances the existing knowledge base by offering supply chain managers a pragmatic tool to evaluate their processes, regardless of the mathematical foundations or the variety of variables utilized in risk assessment. The outcomes of multiple aggregation methods are compared using a case study from an automotive EMS production; the conclusions are validated by risk and FMEA specialists from the same factory.</jats:p>"

The adoption of digital warehousing and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain management are examined in this study, with particular attention to how these developments may affect product pricing and warehouse maintenance expenses. Utilizing a comprehensive literature review and empirical analysis, this study identifies the primary factors driving the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital warehousing into supply chain processes. The results illustrate the tactical implications for supply chain professionals in terms of refining maintenance procedures, streamlining warehouse management procedures, and product pricing strategies. For any given business, a smoothly running supply chain is essential to success. Possessing a highly accurate inventory estimate gives you a significant competitive edge. The operation of the entire supply chain is affected by an extensive variety of external as well as internal variables, including the environment, excessive volatility, shifts in customer perception, and media coverage. Examples of internal elements that impact supply chain performance are product releases and distribution network expansion. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated in recent years to be a brain extension, allowing us to operate at levels above our wildest expectations. Contrary to common perception, artificial intelligence (AI) will not replace individuals; rather, it will enable us to achieve our full innovative and tactical potential.

Ships hoteling at ports account for a large portion of the power demand at ports. Today, ships hoteling at ports meet their energy needs with their own auxiliary engines running on fossil fuels. In order to achieve decarbonization and zero emissions targets, it is essential to minimize the use of fossil fuels in ports and to increase the use of renewable energy. In this context, meeting the ship's power needs in port through a renewable energy-based microgrid will help reduce emissions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study conducted in Davangere district of Karnataka has analysed the factors affecting on agricultural labour supply. The study is based on the primary data collected from 200 sample agricultural labours. The study revealed that socio-economic factors like age, education, caste and land holding are negatively influenced on agricultural labour supply. As far as age is concerned, young labours of the rural area are reluctant to work as agricultural labourer even though they have no alternative works available in their locality. Participation in agricultural activities is the lowest   among the young labours compared to middle age group labours. Education plays a vital role in selection of employment. Labours participation in agricultural works is found to be relatively more among the illiterate labours compared to educated labours. Educated youths are not willing to work as agricultural labour and they want to work as salaried employee in urban areas or government employee.  Agricultural labour supply is also affected by the caste. This study revealed that labour participation in agricultural activities is more in scheduled caste followed by scheduled tribe and other category. And, the most significant feature is that among the all castes labours are engaged in non-agricultural works. Another important factor is land holding of the family. Labours participation in agricultural activities is more in land less (having no land) families compared to land holding (&lt;than 2acres) families. For all these reasons agricultural labour supply has been declining drastically and it has affected the farm productivity. On the other hand wages are increasingly for agricultural operations due to labour scarcity and it has increased the production cost for the farmers.</jats:p>",

Thermodynamic analysis provided insights into the adsorption process, demonstrating the feasibility, non-spontaneous behavior, and exothermic nature of chloride ion adsorption onto activated vetiver root powder. The batch adsorption of chlorides adhered to the Langmuir equation and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, demonstrating a monolayer adsorption capacity of 17.58 mg/g for activated vetiver powder. An artificial neural network (ANN) was used to develop a predictive model for estimating the percentage removal of chloride ions. The values of R2 and mean squared error were used to determine the predictive performance of the ANN. In the near term, prospective commercial uses of activated vetiver powder merit further investigation through in-depth research using real wastewater containing salinity-inducing ion.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>City health examinations are integral to China’s urban planning, construction, and management. They effectively identify potential risks and vulnerabilities in urban development, ensuring safety resilience—a critical component. This resilience enhances the city’s ability to withstand internal and external shocks, promoting the safety of urban residents and fostering sustainable city development. Drawing on the Japanese disaster prevention strategy, the disaster prevention life circle emerges as a rescue and protection system during urban disasters, fortifying urban safety resilience. However, smaller and mid-sized cities, constrained by limited resources, significantly need to catch up in disaster prevention planning. Consequently, bolstering safety resilience in these cities becomes a pressing concern. This study focuses on Lindian County in Heilongjiang Province as the urban area under consideration for resilient city objectives. Leveraging the ArcGIS network analysis tool, we optimize the placement of emergency shelters, aligning with urban disaster assessments and the equilibrium of disaster prevention facility supply and demand. Accessibility analysis of emergency shelters was conducted using the Gaussian two-step floating catchment area method. Ultimately, we integrate the range of demand points assigned to each shelter, along with the effective land area reflecting the supply of shelters, as weights into a weighted Voronoi diagram. This diagram is combined with a reference to the entire region to delineate the disaster prevention life circle. Findings reveal that, under the premise of minimizing government construction costs while maximizing coverage and evacuation utilization rates, the optimal resident emergency congregate shelters in the study area are 8, with 98 emergency evacuation and embarkation shelters. Striking a balance between disaster prevention facility supply and demand and regional accessibility, the urban area of Lindian County is segmented into 3 resident disaster prevention life circles and 24 emergency disaster prevention life circles. The objective of this study is to optimize shelter siting and establish disaster prevention life circles in diverse urban areas. This endeavor aims to bolster urban resilience and foster sustainable urban development.</jats:p>"

This paper analyzes the composition and operation principles of this structure. To assess the economic benefits brought by the integration of photovoltaic and energy storage systems, a bilevel optimization model is established, with the objectives of optimizing energy storage capacity configuration and photovoltaic energy integration. The KKT (Karush–Kuhn–Tucker) method is employed to transform the model into a single-layer mixed-integer linear programming model, which is then solved using the CPLEX solver in MATLAB. The research findings indicate that, with the configuration of the ESS, the optimal PV consumption rate achieved is 96.8749%. Compared to a 100% PV consumption rate, the ESS capacity configuration is reduced by 13.14%, and the overall operational cost of the TPSS is at its lowest. The study suggests that the proposed bilevel optimization algorithm can more effectively consider PV consumption, leading to enhanced economic performance of the TPSS operation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Background\n With the ageing population, the increasing prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases, and the diversified needs for primary health care (PHC) medicines, it is necessary to rethink the functional role of the supply of PHC medicines. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the supply of PHC medicines and the status of meeting PHC medicine needs.\nMethods\n We did a mixed-methods study to evaluate the supply of PHC medicines in Shandong Province. In the qualitative study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the pharmacy managers, physicians, and patients in county hospitals, township hospitals, and village clinics; in the quantitative study, survey questionnaires were distributed to county hospitals, township hospitals, and patients, and a prescription review was performed in township hospitals. A senior pharmacist from a tertiary hospital accompanied us on a visit to inspect the PHC pharmacies. These quantitative assessments were triangulated with qualitative pharmacy managers, physicians, and patients and discussions.\nResults\n The supply of PHC medicines based on the existing medicines list was relatively good, and shortages occurred sporadically and locally, resulting a minor impact on clinical medication. 211 county hospitals and 1,581 township hospitals participated in the survey, revealing an average annual frequency of medicine shortages of 8.6 times for county hospitals and 5.7 times for township hospitals. Nonetheless, off-list medicines were in short supply, failing to meet patients’ need as determined by health outcome. Of the 6,323 patient medication surveys, 945 (14.9%) indicated medicine shortages, with half of these attributable to organizations lacking required medicines. On average, the prescription qualified rate of 37 township hospitals was 72.2%. The study revealed the need to optimize the list of PHC medicines and strengthen the capacity of healthcare services.\nConclusions\n The discrepancy between patients’ need for PHC medicine and present medicine supply is noteworthy. The supply of PHC medicines should shift its focus from providing medicines based solely on an existing list to prioritizing health outcomes to adequately meet patient medicine needs. Integrated health care may be a novel strategy to establish unified medicines lists and achieve uniform pharmaceutical services in PHC.</p>"

This work presents the design of a low-cost system for the Internet of Things (IoT) real-time water supply monitoring. A system with several sensors is utilized to measure the water’s flow rate. These sensors are controlled by a controller that has the ability to process the gathered data from the sensors. For the purpose of supplying water to the users, the system is additionally connected with an electrically controlled solenoid valve. The water flow rate is regularly monitored using the flow sensor and updated to the cloud platform which is implemented using Thingspeak. This platform is also monitored by government officials who perform data analysis and storage. When the water flow rate exceeds a pre-determined threshold, the solenoid valve that controls the flow of water is shut down and a water theft alert message will be sent to the customer to his registered mobile number using the telegram application. The excess flow rate is observed by government officials who can take up necessary legal action.</jats:p>",

In addition, the adoption of ESG frameworks in investment decision-making gained momentum in 2018. However, ESG practices are still limited in many companies, and their relationship with internal areas such as the supply chain lacks sufficient research. The exploration of how ESG and agility affect supply chain resilience is in its preliminary stages, leading to a lack of extensive literature on the subject. This study aims to conduct a bibliometric review and qualitative content analysis to explore the interplay between concepts that have not been integrated so far. A total of 58 articles published between 2013 and October 2022 were subjected to descriptive and content analysis, resulting in the main trends, research gaps, and future research directions, alongside the classification of the study approach for the authors and their correlation between ESG pillars. The qualitative analysis of the content revealed that the most eligible articles classified the resilience–agility concepts as interdependent, emphasizing the common aspects of these concepts. Regarding ESG, the analysis shows the focus of existent research relies on financial performance and operational performance within the supply chain. Each study approach highlights one pillar of ESG, the dependent study approach emphasizes the significance of financial performance, while the independent approach places a stronger focus on operational performance.</jats:p>"

Deficiency of soil nutrients and invasion of plant pathogens or insects are the main destroyers of the world’s food production. Synthetic fertilizers and chemical-based pesticides are frequently employed to combat the problems. However, these have negative impacts on microbial ecosystems and ecosystem functioning. Rhizosphere microorganisms have demonstrated their potency to improve or manage plant nutrients to encourage plant growth, resulting in increased yield and quality by converting organic and inorganic substances around the rhizosphere zone into available plant nutrients. Besides regulating nutrient availability and plant growth enhancement, rhizobacteria or fungi can restrict plant pathogens that cause disease by secreting inhibitory chemicals and boosting plant immunity to combat pests or pathogens. Thus, rhizosphere microorganisms are viewed as viable, alluring economic approaches for sustainable agriculture as biofertilizers and biopesticides. This review provides an overview of the role of rhizosphere microorganisms in soil nutrients and inducing of plant defenses. Moreover, a discussion is presented surrounding the recent consequences of employing these microorganisms and a sustainable strategy towards improving fertilization effectiveness, and encouraging stronger, more pest-resistant plants.</jats:p>"

We differentiate three types of public policy regimes—laissez-faire, regulatory, and transformative—and analyze how each differentially affects DEI practices in OSCM. Our analysis suggests that the laissez-faire type may not offer sufficient incentives to trigger a comprehensive change in DEI practices, while the regulatory and transformative types offer more incentives but, in many instances, do not work as expected. By analyzing the effects of distinct public policy activities for DEI-related practices—for example, through comparative empirical studies or modeling and simulation—OSCM scholars can make important contributions to a more comprehensive implementation of DEI practices. </jats:p>"

To this end, multiple machine learning technologies have recently been applied to estimate feedstock yield, biodiesel productivity, and biodiesel quality. This study aims to identify the machine learning technologies useful in particular areas of supply chain management by review of the scientific literature. As a result, nine machine learning algorithms, the Gaussian process model (GPM), random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost regression, multiple linear regression (MLR), linear regression (LR). and multilayer perceptron (MLP), are used for feedstock yield estimation, biodiesel productivity prediction, and biodiesel quality prediction. Among these, RF and ANN were identified as the most appropriate algorithms, providing high prediction accuracy.

Challenges facing these nations in embracing CSCM include a lack of waste infrastructure, limited awareness and education, financial constraints, a shortage of technical expertise, barriers to accessing global markets, and a dearth of data and information. These challenges underscore the need for tailored, context-specific solutions to establish a robust foundation for CSCM. The study looks ahead and predicts that soon there will be more circular business models, less waste management and more resource optimization, more local circular ecosystems, and more streamlined circular supply chains. Technological advancements, such as blockchain, the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics, are poised to revolutionize CSCM.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected physical items (sometimes known as \"things\") that are implanted with sensors, software, and other technologies to communicate and share data with other devices and systems over the Internet. However, research on IoT adoption in the supply chain domain is scarce, and its acceptance in industries is also very limited due to the various challenges that come with it. The objective of this study is to gain an understanding of the impact that IoT has on supply chain performance through its integration or adoption. A quantitative approach was pursued in this study, and a questionnaire survey of 200 respondents from the supply chain domain with managerial experience was collected and analyzed using the SPSS tool. The results indicate that IoT positively and significantly affects supply chain performance. Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature about supply chain integration and technologies. This research can help those who want to specialize in IoT and its applications in supply chain management. Organizationally, the research findings tell managers about the potential IoT investment that will lead to a positive supply chain performance outcome.</jats:p>",

This article develops an integrated spatial assessment model based on estimates and locations of conventional oil resources and socio-environmental criteria to construct a global atlas of unburnable oil. The results show that biodiversity hotspots, richness centres of endemic species, natural protected areas, urban areas, and the territories of Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation coincide with 609 gigabarrels (Gbbl) of conventional oil resources. Since 1524 Gbbl of conventional oil resources are required to be left untapped in order to keep global warming under 1.5 °C, all of the above-mentioned socio-environmentally sensitive areas can be kept entirely off-limits to oil extraction. The model provides spatial guidelines to select unburnable fossil fuels resources while enhancing collateral socio-environmental benefits.</jats:p>"

Rubber parts are widely used in the auto parts industry. There are a variety of product models and material types as well as produced by several subcontractors in the 2nd Tier companies. However, the whole chain controls overall cost management as the 1st Tier company. Cost-effective models are more important in the competitive era.The research methodology combined linear programming (LP) with sharing cost (SC) and was applied to inventory management. The LPSC model is developed to deal with Tier 1 companies linked with Tier 2 companies of the subcontractors. The LPSC is combined with the EOQ inventory management model.A new approach has been developed to reduce the cost of raw material management in the rubber part supply chain.The limitation of the model development is that it does not yet have real-time control of the supply chain management system.The conceptual idea was introduced to Thailand's automotive rubber part supply chain and accepted for testing with the pilot test of actual orders.The paper presents the new conceptual raw material cost management model in the automotive rubber part supply chain. The LPSC combined with EOQ is effective, increases value to the supply chain, and simultaneously reduces waste and overproduction.</jats:p>",

We utilise variational inequality techniques within a multicriteria decision-making framework and validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations using a machine learning augmented algorithm. By employing this approach, we position the Agricultural Sector Roadmap, aimed at capping global warming at 1.5°C, within the wider agricultural sector’s climate action framework. Our results demonstrate that environmental taxation emerges as the most effective approach for addressing climate change. Eco-taxation leads to a 57.87 per cent reduction in global emissions, whereas climate pledges only account for a 20.59 per cent reduction at the same level of production. Furthermore, eco-taxation results in a 45.68 per cent greater reduction in emission intensity compared to climate pledges. In contrast to climate commitments, an eco-fiscal policy is capable of achieving the objectives established by the European Union.</jats:p>",

To remain competitive, attract and satisfy customers, manufacturing SMEs must adopt innovative practices within their supply chain. This research investigates the influence of supply chain innovative practices (SCIPs) on customer satisfaction within the context of manufacturing SMEs. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was utilised to collect the data from 172 customers of manufacturing SMEs in Mwanza, Tanzania to gain comprehensive insights into the influence of SCIPs on customer satisfaction. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression (BLR) were used for data analysis. The research findings revealed that manufacturing SMEs adopt SCIPs, including digitalization and IoT integration, vendor-managed inventory, customisation, Just-In-Time, collaborative relationships, and lean manufacturing to a moderate extent. Moreover, the findings demonstrate a significant and positive correlation between SCIPs and customer satisfaction. We conclude that SMEs that successfully adopt SCIPs experience higher levels of customer satisfaction, which, in turn, positively influences customer loyalty and brand reputation. Therefore, manufacturing SMEs can capitalise on customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sustainable growth by strategizing SCIPs along their supply chain. The study contributes to the existing knowledge by providing valuable insights into the importance of SCIPs in improving customer satisfaction in manufacturing SMEs.</jats:p>",

Souk El Arbaa is a Moroccan city located in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Morocco in the Kenitra Province. Its economic activities depend mainly on agriculture and livestock raising. This study aims to assess the groundwater status of a basin in a semi-arid climate in the Souk El Arbaa for drinking purposes by collecting 14 samples in 2022 from different locations and analyzing their physicochemical characteristics. The quality assessment was made by estimating electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonates, chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. The results showed that most of the groundwater in the study area is very hard, and all groundwater in the study area, according to the Moroccan Standards for drinking purposes, exceeds the permissible limits for nitrate and ammonium.</jats:p>",

To overcome low precision and significant errors in the traditional single prediction model, a novel autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-sparrow search algorithm (SSA)-long short-term memory (LSTM) combination model is proposed to accurately predict residual chlorine, turbidity, and pH in drinking water. First, the ARIMA model is used to extract the linear part of water quality data and output the nonlinear residual. Then, the LSTM model is used to predict the residual, and the SSA is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of the LSTM model, which plays an essential role in reducing the error of the model. To prove the superiority of the model developed, the ARIMA-SSA-LSTM model is compared with SSA-LSTM, whale optimization algorithm-LSTM, PSO-LSTM, ARIMA-LSTM, ARIMA, and LSTM. The results show that the coefficient of determination (R2) of the combination model for residual chlorine, turbidity, and pH are 0.950, 0.990, and 0.998, respectively, which are greater than all comparison models. Therefore, the model is more suitable for the prediction and analysis of water quality data.</jats:p>",

In this study, we have considered green production in the light of various co-ordinations and contracts. This is a two-echelon Supply chain consisting of one manufacturer who designs and develops a green product and the retailer sells it to the environmentally aware customers and the awareness is converted to actual purchasing behaviour by the retailers marketing strategy and the manufacturer’s product design and development which includes technology usage to develop the greenness,packaging and several other factors which were not studied earlier. All these factors are involved in our demand function which is distinct from the existing literature. The model is developed under three contracts, Price-only, green marketing cost sharing and two-part tariff contracts. This is an well-established fact that co-ordination enhances the economic benefits to every tier member of a chain. Our findings also establish that co-ordination and co-operation among members will enhance their environmental sustainability. In this way they can carry out their social responsibilities towards our environment. It is also noticed that as the environmental consciousness of the consumers increases, the cost sharing contract is more profitable for manufacturer than that for retailer whereas the price only contract is profitable for the retailer.</jats:p>",

First, a multi-level relational reflective model was built based on four dimensions using the fuzzy Delphi method and the model was validated by factor analysis. Then, 50 service items were placed in 16 clusters of the portfolio model. For each category of services in the model, the pertinent supplier relationship management practices were proposed using the literature review accompanied by a focus group. The presented model contributed to the development of previous theoretical trends in supply management portfolio models by introducing a new dimension, called “pace of innovation in technology”, to those extracted from the literature review, such as “strategic importance of the items”, “supply risk”, and “extent of buyer captivity”. Despite the classical models targeting tangible goods and products, our model was customized for the service industry context and can be considered a starting point towards service supply market segmentation procedures according to the attributes of each service item category.</jats:p>",

Green agricultural products are popular for their low carbon, quality, and safety, and they flow from the production side to consumers through a traceable supply chain. Therefore, ensuring the reliable and stable operation of the traceable supply chain for green, low-carbon agricultural products is an important issue. In view of the difficulty of obtaining information in previous coordination mechanisms in multi-person cooperative games, this article proposes an optimal pricing decision and constructs a profit-distribution model based on an improved Raiffa value to make the profit-distribution mechanism more conducive to the stability and sustainable development of the supply chain, and empirical analysis was carried out. The empirical analysis shows the following: (1) The centralized decision-making selling price of green and low-carbon agricultural products based on the quantitative cost–benefit analysis and demand function can realize the optimal profit of the supply chain. (2) Using the improved Raiffa value, considering the investment cost and risk to allocate the optimal profit of centralized decision-making, optimizes the profit distribution of supply chain members and overcomes the problem of the difficulty in acquiring information in multi-player cooperative games. (3) For investment costs and risks, the corresponding profit-distribution adjustment value weight vector can be obtained using the AHP; for risks that are difficult to quantify, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method and the risk-factor-based method can be used to determine the risk coefficient of each member of the supply chain. The optimized profit-distribution mechanism of supply chain members is more reasonable than decentralized decision-making, which has a significant reference for promoting the sustainable development of a traceable supply chain of green and low-carbon agricultural products.</jats:p>"

In further research, it is found that government support and supply chain digitalization complement each other to enhance enterprise value. The conclusions provide important policy implications for promoting the effective transformation and efficiency improvement of supply chain digitalization of market enterprises.</jats:p>"

As insect production is an emerging sector, current economic research is scarce and very diverse. Thus, the aim of this research was to develop a simulation model that enables the analysis of full industrial scale costs of producing dLM and to provide insight in the distribution of these costs in the insect supply chain. The deterministic supply chain model is built on three modules, technical, transition and economic module, which all follow a previously defined supply chain structure and allow to extract quantity and price information for intermediate or final products. The model was parameterized and checked for plausibility in multiple consultation rounds with the INSECTFEED consortium and business partners. Additionally, model behaviour was checked with scenario, sensitivity, and break-even price analyses. In the default situation 5.57 tDM raw substrate and 26.7 million neonates are required to produce 1 tDM dLM for a price of €5,116/tDM. Most costs are added in the raw substrate delivery (€1,952/tDM) and production and collection (€821/tDM) step. Important cost factors are the raw substrate (€1,939/tDM) and building and inventory (€1,459/tDM). Parameters with high relative response rate towards the price of dLM are the feed conversion rate, dry matter percentage of larvae, raw substrate price, larvae density, labour wage and growth rate. To reach break-even prices for substituting fish meal with alive grown larvae (AGL) (€1,318/tDM AGL), improving production parameters is not sufficient. Just changing prices of raw substrate to −€78/tDM or frass to €1,175/tDM would enable a profitable operation. However, these are not deemed as realistic in mass production. Although there is some insecurity in data, the model results are the most realistic representation of industrial scale production amounts and costs.</jats:p>",

However, there is the potential for considerable nitrogen loss to occur. This study assesses the nitrogen retention of acidic tea plantation’s soil and the role of biochar in improving nitrogen dynamics, highlighting the need for innovative technologies to streamline and enhance nitrogen supply management.\n<bold>Methods:</bold>\nAdopting a modified two-week aerobic incubation and ion-exchange membrane technology, this research offers a novel approach to evaluate soil nitrogen supply and to monitor the nitrogen dynamics of tea plantation soil following early-summer supplementary fertilization.\n<bold>Results:</bold>\nThe study revealed that the surface soil of tea plantation had the ability to provide 48 mg N·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil as inorganic nitrogen for 130 days. The utilization of a small amount of biochar (10 t·ha<sup>-1</sup>) had no impact on the soil's effective nitrogen availability. Nonetheless, the application of biochar at rates of 20 and 30 t·ha<sup>-1</sup> resulted in a significant enhancement in soil effective nitrogen availability as measured using ion exchange membranes, with an increase of 65%–81%. Furthermore, the utilization of biochar-based organic fertilizers, when used at appropriate rates, has the potential to enhance the availability of nitrogen in the soil, thereby increasing its effectiveness.\n<bold>Conclusion:</bold>\nThe study's findings underscore the efficacy of the employed methodologies in capturing the nuanced impact of biochar on nitrogen retention and availability in tea plantation soils. The use of aerobic incubation and ion-exchange membrane technology has proven effective in elucidating the potential of biochar to significantly improve nitrogen dynamics.</p>"

Primarily for distribution companies whose primary business model is “buy and sell products and earn a profit margin,” the supply chain transformation has placed higher demands on inventory cost control. In this study, we propose an integrated approach for optimization of inventory cost control of internal supply chain management. The integrated approach includes an improved ABC inventory classification method, spare parts demand forecasting, and an adapted inventory management method. We then select a small and medium-sized home appliance distribution company as the case study because the company is at its early stage of inventory transformation due to the supply chain transformation. Using the case study and field research methods, we analyzed the specific impact of supply chain transformation on the company’s inventory cost control and demonstrated the efficiency of the integrated approach. This study finds that the case company can control inventory costs more efficiently and effectively after implementing the improved ABC inventory classification method. The proposed different demand forecasting plans can help improve the accuracy of spare parts demand forecasting. Finally, different inventory management methods based on different classifications of spare parts can help determine the appropriate spare parts ordering point and procurement quantity.</jats:p>",

Firms are struggling with the supply chain dynamics needed to increase revenue and mitigate risk, and improve resilience after COVID-19. With the setting of strong competition and firms' business models shifting to digital transformation, this study examines the link between organizational culture (OC) and digital supply chain management practices (DSCMP) in generating a positive impact on firm performance (FP), including both direct and indirect influences via customer development (CD). Smart PLS 3.3.3 was used to analyze data from 326 respondents who registered as business managers who operate their supply chains using digital technologies. The findings indicated that DSCMP, CD, and OC had a favorable impact on FP, while DSCMP and OC had a beneficial impact on CD. It was also determined that DSCMP and CD played a mediating role in both of the above-mentioned associations.  DSCMP and OC are two essential enablers for developing a firm’s customer base and improving performance efficiency in digital supply chains. Based on the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT), this study found that digitalization-related capabilities in supply chain management practices must be developed inside the company to improve the firm’s efficiency. Firm culture, accompanied by dominant characteristics, organizational leaders, organizational glue, and strategic emphasis should become essential components of DSCMP in organizations.</jats:p>",

A comprehensive solution to these problems is provided by a geoinformation automated water supply network management system. Automated network management is carried out using geoinformation technologies, mathematical and geoinformation models of the water supply network. The work proposes a mathematical model of the topological structure of the water supply network, defines geospatial data bases about network objects and the interrelation-ships of these objects, taking into account the topological structure of the network to provide geoinformation and mathematical modeling of the hydraulic state of the water supply net-work, solving problems of emergency processing, monitoring the quality of drinking water, and optimizing the network, energy saving. To construct a digital model of the branched-ring structure of a topological graph, digital vector topographic maps are used as follows: - based on the results of geodetic surveys, water supply network facilities are marked on the topog-raphic map with symbols; - analysis of information-graphic diagrams of well details indicates the presence of pressure/flow regulators and hydrants. If there are regulators, their symbols are applied to the polyline of the water supply section at the symbol of the well at the point where the water pipe is inserted into the well, their diameters and the percentage of opening are indicated; - if there is a hydrant, the symbol for a well without a hydrant is replaced with the symbol for a well with a hydrant; - for all objects of the water supply network, the values of technical and graphic parameters are determined; - the orientation of the graph is deter-mined - the direction of water flow; – a matrix of incidents of vertices and contours is formed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As economic fluctuations and market uncertainty intensify, supply chain members face enormous challenges. To explore the role of revenue-sharing contracts in supply chain members with different risk preferences, we study the risk-averse two-stage supply chain coordination in a revenue-sharing contract under three different scenarios: the supplier is risk-averse and the retailer is risk-neutral, or the retailer is risk-averse and the supplier is risk-neutral, or both are risk-averse. We find that the revenue-sharing contract mechanism allows the supplier to offer a lower wholesale price, effectively bearing part of the retailer’s cost risk. In return, the retailer compensates the supplier with a larger portion of their revenue, and the lower wholesale price also stimulates the retailer’s desire to order more products. In addition, risk aversion always reduces the optimal order quantity in the supply chain. Interestingly, when the retailer’s risk aversion level is low, the supplier charges a higher wholesale price under the risk-averse supply chain than that under the risk-neutral supply chain. However, if the retailer’s risk aversion level is high enough, the supplier should charge a lower price to stimulate the retailer under the risk-averse supply chain to retain the order size to maintain the channel profit.</jats:p>"

For this review article, the data was collected from file records Port Sudan Oncology Center, Port Sudan, Sudan. Through a comprehensive analysis of drug supply frequencies during distinct conflict periods, the study reveals fluctuating availability and challenges in sustaining the supply chain. Grouping chemotherapy drugs according to their availability patterns elucidates the varying degrees of accessibility during conflict, ranging from consistent supplies to complete absence. The impact of these shortages on cancer patients is profound, resulting in compromised treatment outcomes, increased morbidity and mortality rates, and substantial socioeconomic burdens. Real-life patient accounts underscore the emotional, physical, and financial toll imposed by interrupted access to vital medications. Despite efforts by healthcare institutions, NGOs, and governmental bodies, persistent challenges hinder effective mitigation strategies during conflict, including logistical constraints, inadequate funding, and political instability. The socioeconomic and psychological implications of drug shortages are significant, pushing patients deeper into poverty and exacerbating psychological distress. Addressing these challenges necessitates sustained efforts to fortify drug supply chains, enhance infrastructure, and foster multi-stakeholder cooperation. The study emphasises the critical need for sustained interventions to ensure continuous access to chemotherapy drugs in Sudan and conflict zones globally. Immediate actions are imperative to alleviate the burdens faced by cancer patients and fortify healthcare systems to withstand the challenges of conflict-induced drug scarcity.</jats:p>"

However, the pandemic was not the only reason why supply chain risk management has become more crucial than ever before. In the last decade, the occurrence of previously merely theoretical risks has emphasised the importance of risk management in supply chains. This has increased interest in risk assessment and management, COVID-19 and other disaster impact studies and proposals for more stable and resilient supply chains. This article addresses the problem of transport risk in supply chains in the context of COVID-19. Particular attention is paid to quantitative approaches. Identifying and quantifying risks and modelling their interdependencies contribute to the stability of the supply chains. The analysis presents the current state of knowledge and can serve as a guide for further research. It highlights transport risk management in supply chain management as an important area of investigation. In light of the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, the article proposes an approach to transportation risk assessment based on quantitative assessment and interconnection of risk factors.</jats:p>",

This research examines a multi-objective ALWAB Type-2 problem, simultaneously evaluating cycle time and squared load assignment objectives. The study is conducted based on a real-life scenario in a sub-industry automotive industry that manufactures cable equipment. To solve this problem, a multi-objective genetic algorithm approach is proposed. Recognising that the selection of parameter values will influence the algorithm’s performance, parameter calibration has been performed. A full factorial experimental design and the irace method have been utilised for this purpose. The results are compared with those using parameter values utilised for similar problems in the literature. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out to examine the impact of various relative weight values of the objectives on the result. The results indicate that the experimental design generally yields superior results compared to other methods.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The electrolysis of CO2 into value-added products holds great potential for closing the carbon cycle. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) that uses solid polymer electrolytes is a critical technology for enhancing the energy efficiency for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) because a thin electrolyte layer can effectively reduce the ohmic resistance. The stable operation of the CO2RR in MEA-based cells with an anion-exchange membrane (AEM), however, is hindered by the accumulation of bicarbonate salts, which are derived from alkali-metal cations in anolytes, on the cathode side. Therefore, for stable operation of CO2 electrolysis using an MEA-based cell, the amount of alkali-metal cations needs to be reduced. However, the minimal amount of alkali-metal cations required to operate the reaction system has not been elucidated. Quantitative analysis of the amount of alkali-metal cations transported from the anode to the cathode is essential to obtain the insight into the necessary amount for the operation. In this study, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the production of high-value C2+ compounds, such as ethylene and ethanol, and the transported alkali-metal cations. As a result, although the presence of transported alkali-metal cations on the cathode surface significantly contributes to the generation of C2+ compounds, the rate of K+ ion transport did not match the selectivity of C2+. This result suggests a continuous supply of high amount of K+ to the cathode surface is not required for C2+ formation. On the basis of these findings, we achieved a faradaic efficiency (FE) and a partial current density for C2+ of 77% and 230 mA cm−2, respectively, even after switching the anode solution from 0.1 M KHCO3 to a dilute K+ solution (&lt;7 mM) in an MEA-based cell using AEM and Cu nanoparticles as the cathode catalyst. These values of FE and partial current density were almost identical to those when 0.1 M KHCO3 was continuously supplied as the anode solution. Based on this insight, we successfully improved the durability of the system against salt precipitation. The FE for ethylene remained constant for as long as 60 h at 150 mA cm−2 when continuously flowing 0.1 M KHCO3 as anolyte. However, the FE suddenly decreased after 60 h due to the cessation of CO2 gas flow, caused by salt precipitation in the cathode flow channel. On the contrary, by intermittently supplying 0.1 M KHCO3, we confirmed that the amount of visible K+ salt in the cathode flow field remained negligible even after more than 90 hours of stable operation.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of strategic procurement practices on performance of Kenya Power and Lighting Company in Mombasa County. The specific objectives were to determine the effect of outsourcing, negotiation, tendering, and inventory control on performance of Kenya Power and Lighting Company in Mombasa County. The study had the resource-based view theory and transaction cost theory. It used a research approach and descriptive research design on a target population of 113 staff of four KPLC offices located in Mbaraki, Mombasa CBD, and Nyali. This study selected the staff using census method and issued questionnaires to all the respondents. The secondary data was generated from income statements and cash flow reports dating from 2020 to 2022. The questionnaire was pre-tested at the KPLC Kilifi county office. Face, content, and criterion validity were measured whereas Cronbach alpha was used to measure reliability. Descriptive statistics like frequencies, mean and percentages were analysed. The study used a thematic method to analyse the open-ended questions and tables, and explanations as main methods of data presentation. The study’s finding on outsourcing practice was that there was occurrence of delays in providing urgent services and products. On negotiation practice, KPLC’s negotiation process was affected by corruption by rogue staff with selfish interests. On tendering practice, there was low incorporation ICT into the tendering process. On inventory control methods, there was inconsistency of policy systems towards guiding quality warehouse management. The study recommendations on outsourcing practice are that the procurement department management conducts a thorough check on the potential products and services outsourced. On negotiation practice, KPLC senior management should develop and implement anticorruption policies on corrupt staff. On tendering practice, senior management should provide funds, increase awareness, and strengthen the ICT implementation policies. On inventory control practice, the procurement department staff undergo training on warehouse management and disposal management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Probabilistic selling (PS) is a business model whereby, in addition to selling transparent products, a firm sells an opaque good, which is unknown to buyers until after purchase. We examine how PS affects retailer-manufacturer interactions in markets for physical goods and how upstream competition impacts channel members’ incentives to facilitate PS. Methodology/results: Using a Hotelling-based model of a multiproduct retailer, we find that a retailer maximizes its profit by assigning equal probability to each product even when the products have different wholesale prices. We also find that PS mitigates the inefficiencies caused by the double-marginalization problem. Although the potential benefit from PS is greater for a decentralized channel than for a centralized one, the market conditions for which PS arises are narrower for a decentralized channel. Furthermore, PS shifts channel power toward the manufacturer. However, it is possible for a win-win-win outcome to arise in which the manufacturer, retailer, and consumers benefit from PS. As expected, upstream competition shifts channel profit toward the retailer. However, competition also has surprising effects: It shrinks, rather than expands, the viability of PS and makes it possible for each manufacturer to benefit from its rival’s cost reduction. Managerial implications: A manufacturer should induce the retailer to offer an opaque good if its production costs are sufficiently low and the products are sufficiently close substitutes. It is optimal for the manufacturer to increase (decrease) its wholesale prices in response to the retailer’s ability to offer opaque goods if product differentiation is low (modest). Setting a wholesale price below cost sometimes maximizes a manufacturer’s profit. Furthermore, a retailer can achieve a strategic advantage by using products from multiple manufacturers to construct opaque goods. However, the retailer’s ability to leverage this advantage is curtailed because its use of equal-probability assignments relaxes competition between manufacturers. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: S.

Also, the considerations of kaizen costing systems, in addition to the new movements towards the concern of the customer, should come first as a result of the new movements towards the customer profit analysis. In a JIT supply chain, suppliers are responsible for informing their cus-tomers of their products. Within the context of the current research, it was suggested to use the sys-tems of Back-flush costing as well as throughput accounting systems to simplify the application of just-in time systems and agile systems to satisfy the requirements of achieving the policy of continu-ous improvement. Furthermore, the continuous debate between the different parties of the game supposed here will be realized and considered. The integration of competitors into various aspects of the supply chain has been made possible by the emergence of intelligent supply chains. Additionally, the rapid advancements in the industrial and technological landscape have placed a significant bur-den on the movement of goods and information, requiring efficient and cost-effective solutions to meet time-sensitive requirements and customer demands. It is even more promising to consider the potential for surpassing competitors in terms of achievements and capabilities. The continuous advancements in artificial intelligence have further emphasized the need for progress in both production quality and cost optimization. The rapid progress in both the just-in-time/agile and resilient systems has led to additional requirements for the implemented accounting system and the selected level of automated accounting system. Extensive analysis of various arguments within the scope of the present study has been conducted, promoting the adoption of a more reality-sensitive model for the application.</jats:p>"

However, seaweed cultivation is gaining attention as a restorative aquaculture that could contribute to ocean health by serving as blue carbon or nurturing seagrass beds. Commercial restorative aquaculture may provide market-based solutions for improving ocean health. The Onna Village Fisheries Cooperative producers have been restoring corals, knowing empirically that when the coral weakens, the yield of Mozuku seaweed drops. Furthermore, measures taken to reduce red soil run-off prevent the reduction in Mozuku quality and quantity and protect seagrass beds, since Mozuku cultivators have continued to use them as an important nursery. The fishery cooperative and the seaweed processing company, Igeta Takeuchi Co., Ltd., have jointly developed high-quality Mozuku that is resistant to climate change and extreme weather conditions through strain selection. Based on this case, this paper examines the following questions: (1) What quality assurance technique is necessary to continue restorative aquaculture as a market-based solution over the long term? (2) What social platforms and communication channels are available to stakeholders to maintain restorative aquaculture in the long run? To answer these questions, Japanese consumer cooperatives that established “the Mozuku Fund” are also examined. This case study of Mozuku highlights how the sustainability and quality of marine products are maintained throughout the whole supply chain, focusing on the power of the Japanese consumers’ cooperative.</jats:p>"

Timber is an environmentally friendly construction material and a potential mean to reduce carbon footprint produced every year by the building sector. In addition to its sustainability benefits, reversible strengthening interventions can be attained for existing structures. As such, timber can be efficiently used to preserve and protect historical buildings which are, due to architectural and aesthetic values, fundamental components of the Italian cultural heritage. In this study, the use and potential of novel cross-laminated (X-Lam or CLT) timber panels made of Italian hardwood (i.e., beech) for strengthening of existing timber floors is investigated. A quantitative comparison between the mechanical performances of the proposed wood-based product and common retrofitting techniques, such as double-crossed timber planks and reinforced concrete slabs, is carried out in terms of bending stiffness (which is evaluated according to Eurocode 5), influence of weight and reversibility of intervention. It is shown that CLT panels represent a good compromise/alternative for the realisation of reversible and sustainable reinforcing interventions, with rather well promising performances.</jats:p>"

The approach is based on analyzing a system of differential equations describing fluid flow with a variable flow rate in the investigated pipes. The study explores the most general case of distributor operation, considering a horizontal groundwater level above the pipeline. The analysis of the original equations includes a scenario where a constant average fluid flow rate is maintained along the length of the pressure channel. The velocity magnitude is influenced by the granulometric features of the surrounding soil and the filtration characteristics of the pipeline's side walls material. The investigation employs the concept of a conditional distribution infinitely long pipeline or a pipeline with limited length and infinite permeability of the side walls surface. This allows assuming a pressure close to zero at the pipeline's final cross-section, which minimally impacts the obtained results. The analysis is presented in a dimensionless form, and the resulting computational formulas are both simple and convenient.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Access to contraceptives empowers women to not only exercise their reproductive rights and avert unintended pregnancies, but also to prevent a spectrum of adverse societal and health outcomes (e.g., unfulfilled career aspirations, unsafe abortions, maternal deaths.) However, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources are limited and women are under-represented as decision-makers in national governments, reproductive health has not traditionally been prioritized. Motivated by past research showing that female decision-makers tend to prioritize issues in ways that align more closely with women's needs and preferences, we examine the relationship between female decision-makers in national governments and contraceptive procurement. Specifically, we focus on female decision-makers at two levels, as health ministers and parliamentarians, and examine their impact on the procurement quantity of contraceptives by LMICs. Our empirical analysis, based on a comprehensive compilation of data across six distinct sources, shows that a female (vs. male) health minister is associated with an average 66% increase in the procurement quantity of contraceptives. Notably, this relationship is strengthened with an increase in the proportion of female representatives in national parliaments. Together, these findings demonstrate that female (vs. male) decision-makers exhibit greater commitment to contraceptive procurement, an issue that has a disproportionate impact on women's health and well-being. As ensuring good health and well-being for all and increasing gender parity in leadership positions are two of the key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, our study on examining the relationship between female decision-makers and contraceptive procurement constitutes a timely and consequential line of inquiry. </jats:p>"

With the goal of developing a new multi‐criteria decision‐making framework, this article examines how several multi‐criteria decision‐making approaches can be used to facilitate the selection of sustainable product‐package designs. Using a case study, the multi‐criteria decision‐making method analyses package design, helping decision‐makers to determine and minimize the percentage of food losses at each step of the supply chain. Furthermore, the design of both the product and its packaging must encompass the entire life cycle, including materials sourcing, production, transportation, use and disposal. Achieving sustainability requires a collaborative effort among all supply chain agents, from producers to consumers. Consequently, this study aims to explore the challenges and opportunities of attaining sustainable product and packaging design in the food supply chain, emphasizing the need for a long‐term, collaborative approach to sustainability. This study concludes that sustainable packaging is highly relevant in the circular food supply chain due to its direct contributions to reducing food waste, conserving resources, mitigating carbon emissions, and meeting consumer preferences for eco‐friendly products. Given the consideration of relevant criteria, the multicriteria method appears to be suitable for analysing food supply chains, thanks to its systematic approach in managing the application of sustainable packaging throughout the entire process, including the production, processing, distribution, and consumption of food products.</jats:p>",

The literature shows that bargaining can be seen as an adversarial approach to negotiation (in contrast to more integrative/collaborative ones) and also the back-and-forth discussion over price and other variables between buying and supplying organisations to reach an agreement. In addition, many will move between fundamentally distributive and integrative approaches as the discussions play out. A systematic literature review of the Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, JSTOR and Web of Science databases was undertaken to address this gap, identifying 427 relevant journal papers that were systematically analysed. First, descriptive techniques identified the trajectory of published papers, methods, theories and their industrial context. Second, content analysis identified the key constructs and associated operational measures/variables of bargaining. Third, the constructs have then been ordered temporally and by areas of location (organisational/departmental and individual levels) to generate a model and inform a series of practice-based recommendations at different stages of the bargaining process. The findings will allow future researchers to use the constructs either directly in developing focused hypotheses to test relationships or as a basis for refinement and extension in cumulative theory building and testing. In addition, a series of focused research gaps have been identified, such as addressing the current contradictory findings of the effect of purchasing volume or organisational size on bargaining power.</jats:p>",

The success in this domain relies on the characteristics of managers, their management practices, and their leadership style. This study aims to investigate the requirements of management and leadership in hospital services’ supply chain.\r\nMethods: This study employed a two-stage mixed-methods approach carried out from 2018 to 2021. In the first stage, a qualitative study was conducted using purposive sampling and semi-structured in-depth interviews with 15 experts in various leadership positions. The data collected in this stage were analyzed using framework approach. Subsequently, the primary themes that emerged from the analysis were presented to 8 experts  in the form of a questionnaire. The experts' responses were then analyzed to determine the level of agreement on different topics using Delphi method, Kendall's coefficient of agreement, and the mean was compared through SPSS 21.\r\nResults: The experts identified transformationalism, planning capability, crisis management, and creativity as the most crucial factors. Furthermore, there was a high level of agreement regarding the influence of managers (4.62 ± 0.51), maintaining distance from mundane routines (4.50 ± 0.53), and attending to various incidents in hospital services supply chain (4.50 ± 0.53). Considering that Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (w) was 0.53 in the first round and 0.72 in the second round and was statistically significant, there was a strong consensus among the expert panel.\r\nConclusion: According to the results of the present study, it is necessary to pay serious attention to the change in management style and hospital services supply chain, there should be a special focus on the possibility of occurrence or impact of sudden accidents. Also, routine and ineffective actions should be eliminated and the managers and employees should be more creative to improve this chain. Transformational leaders should try to manage the hospital services supply chain by forming specialized teams and using the capabilities of employees with the reasonable use of financial resources and appropriate infrastructures, including information technology.</jats:p>"

Understanding the impact of aging on carbon emissions is imperative for steering the next phase of sustainable development. This study, focusing on China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, delved into the intricacies of how population aging influences carbon emissions using a dynamic panel threshold model and a mediated effects model. Geographic heterogeneity within China was also considered. On the one hand, this study incorporated three consumer-side intermediation mechanisms: energy consumption, residential consumption and medical consumption. It was found that the positive driving effect of consumption-side variables on carbon emissions was characterized by an inverted “U”-shaped change in China’s highly aging regions, while an asymptotic upward trend of 7.65% was observed in regions with moderate and low aging. On the other hand, this study scrutinized three supply-side mediating mechanisms: industrial structure, R&amp;D innovation and labor supply. The mechanism of supply-side variables on carbon emissions exhibited a shift from robustly positive driving to more nuanced weak positive driving or even negative inhibiting in highly aging regions, while inhibiting effects dominated in regions with moderate and low aging. This study offers a dual perspective encompassing both the production and consumption sides, which lays a foundation for exploring the internal mechanism of aging on carbon emission.</jats:p>"

According to the content of the provisions of the Code of the Gas Transportation System and the Code of the Gas Distribution System, it is understood that, in order to supply natural gas to consumers, its supplier purchases this gas from a wholesaler at a virtual point of sale, and consumers receive it directly from the operator of gas distribution networks at the limit of the balance sheet ownership of their facilities (at destinations). In the context of updating the civil legislation of Ukraine and its harmonization with the law of the European Union, the study of the peculiarities of the execution of the gas supply contract as a type of contract for the supply of energy and the other resources through the connected network is relevant. Taking into account the specifics of the supply object, namely that natural gas is a commercial product that is a mixture of hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbon components in a gaseous state under standard conditions, the legal nature of the supply contract has certain peculiarities. At the same time, under the contract for the supply of energy and the other resources through the connected network, one party (supplier) undertakes to provide the other party (consumer, subscriber) with energy and the other resources provided for in the contract, and the consumer (subscriber) undertakes to pay the cost of the received resources and to comply with the mode of its use stipulated by the contract, as well as to ensure safe operation of energy and the other equipment.&#x0D;\nThe peculiarities of the execution of the contract for the supply of natural gas have been determined by the legal regime of the commercial product, which is natural gas, and the peculiarities of its supply (no other than through the gas transportation and gas distribution systems in which natural gas is received from various economic entities, as a result of which it is mixed and changes in physical chemical parameters).</jats:p>"

In this study, hyperspectral imaging was used to assess the effect of N supply on symptoms of rice leaf blast under greenhouse conditions. Three rice genotypes differing in blast susceptibility grown at low, medium, and high N supply were inoculated at the four-leaf stage with three M. oryzae isolates differing in virulence. The reflectance spectra (400 to 1000 nm) of healthy and symptomatic leaves were analyzed using the spectral angle mapper algorithm for supervised classification. Mineral N supply increased the contents of chlorophyll and total N. The number and area of lesions and total blast severity varied depending on rice genotype—M. oryzae isolate interactions and the amount of mineral N applied. The reflectance spectra of healthy tissue and of blast symptom subareas differed with N supply; rice genotypes differed in the response to N supply. Infected plants at high mineral N supply could be distinguished from those at low N supply due to higher differences in the spectra of symptom subareas. Results reveal the potential (and limitations) of hyperspectral imaging for quantifying N effects on rice leaves, disease severity, and symptom expression. The impact of these findings on plant phenotyping and remote sensing under field conditions is discussed.</jats:p>"

Capturing the complex interactions of output and investment decisions made by multiple profit-maximizing PVB and CCGT firms, our model yields the market’s long-run equilibrium of capacity mix and short-run equilibrium of electricity generation and price levels. Accounting for the sun’s irradiation that determines solar generation level, our model computes the battery cost reduction necessary for batteries entering the optimal capacity mix. Using Israel as a case study, we show how declining battery cost may cause PVB firms to displace CCGT firms, resulting in carbon-free electricity supply as a market-based outcome. The battery cost threshold initiating this outcome is ~24% of CCGT’s capacity cost, implying that natural gas is a transitional fuel in Israel’s pathway to deep decarbonization. </jats:p>",

A descriptive qualitative study using the phenomenological technique explores managers' views on supply chain and human capital resilience. Results reveal that supply chain resiliency—the essence of resilience—is substantially correlated with human capital. Supply chain resilience requires human capital resilience. Strong personnel can handle crises, adapt, collaborate, contribute, innovate, and build a strong supply chain. This study identifies supply chain-human capital resiliency nexus factors to help firms improve supply chain performance. Outperforming competitors in volatile markets enhances corporate performance.

This complex scenario prompts an exploration of the viability of hydrogen as a transformative energy solution. The continent's diverse renewable resources, from abundant solar and wind potential to hydropower capabilities, provide fertile ground for hydrogen production. However, Africa's energy transition journey is further complicated by the challenge of retrofitting or establishing sustainable energy systems in regions heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The tension between these established energy supply backbones and the imperatives of reducing carbon emissions necessitates innovative solutions. Hydrogen, with its potential for clean energy storage, emissions-free power generation, and industrial applications, offers a promising bridge between the need for modern energy access and environmental stewardship Drawing from case studies, the study delves the technological feasibility of harnessing hydrogen, considering existing energy infrastructure and emerging renewable technologies, the infrastructural challenges and opportunities presented by establishing hydrogen supply chains across diverse African regions.

Based on a theoretical analysis of the impact mechanisms of the agricultural digital economy on agricultural exports, this study empirically examines the impact and mechanism of the agricultural digital economy on agricultural exports using Chinese agricultural export data from 2011 to 2016. The relevant findings are threefold. (1) The agricultural digital economy significantly enhances the growth of China's agricultural exports, and the result remains robust after a series of robustness tests. (2) The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the agricultural digital economy has a greater role in promoting exports from quality frontier firms, primary agricultural products and exports to developed countries. (3) The mechanism analysis demonstrates that the agricultural digital economy promotes exports of agricultural products on the supply side most strongly through quality–enhancing and the information cost effects, improving product quality and reducing information expenditure to achieve export growth. On the demand side, domestic demand traction and external–demand creation effects exert a local market effect and stimulate import market demand to promote export growth.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, sustainability and environmental concerns have become increasingly significant topics of discussion. This article aims to propose a conceptual framework of a research model including the correlations between government regulations and legislations, Green Human Resource Management (GHRM), Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The methodological approach adopted in this study included conducting a review of the relevant literature and accessing databases and search engines to gather information. The current article presents a novel approach to understanding how organizations and regulators can collaborate to drive sustainable development in this domain. This study also adds significant value due to its unique contribution in connecting GHRM, GSCM, and government regulation and legislation, particularly in the context of sustainable development and its link to promoting decent work and economic growth (SDG8), responsible consumption and production (SDG12), and addressing climate action (SDG13). The rarity of articles addressing these interrelated topics, especially within the specific context of Jordan, where such research has been largely absent, underscores the distinctive nature of this study. Furthermore, this article stands out for its comprehensive incorporation of legal and regulatory aspects into the discourse on organizational GHRM and GSCM practices and their alignment with the pursuit of SDGs. By providing valuable insights for decision makers and organizations, including a thorough examination of the barriers involved, this article serves as an essential resource for understanding and navigating the complex interplay between environmental sustainability, GHRM, GSCM, and governmental regulations. Based on the analysis of the findings, a conceptual framework is proposed based on three environmental dimensions and six green practices that have discernible effects. Finally, it is envisaged that this study will offer directions for future research work to use another approach and another environment.</jats:p>"

Currently, food security, as an integral part of national security, has become the cornerstone for maintaining economic stability and political autonomy in the country. With increasing geopolitical volatility and private food crises, this topic is becoming increasingly relevant, and maintaining national food security has taken a leading position among the priorities for each State. At the same time, the analysis of scientific research on this topical issue proves that the formation of national food security depends on its regional food security, therefore it is also especially important to study and improve regional food supply systems. It is determined that food security is an active integration process of interaction between internal and external factors, such as agricultural production, grain stocks, import and export of grain, international food aid, etc. It is noted that the modern food supply system must be considered as a complex system of macroeconomic organization that ensures a balance between food and the demand of the population. The analysis of the elements and characteristics of this system makes it possible to identify the most important problems of its functioning and development, the solution of which contributes to improving the efficiency of work and, as a result, to guarantee the necessary and sufficient level of national food security in conditions of high variability of the surrounding environment. At the same time, the national food security system is closely interrelated with the level of regional food management systems, and the modern concept of food security implies the need to ensure constant access to physical and economic nutrition for every citizen.</jats:p>",

Building upon the Internet of Production Alliance (IoPA) work, this article explores how integrating OKRF and SCIS can enhance production flexibility and efficiency through substitutability and resource repurposing strategies. The OKRF-SCIS integration exhibits the potential to enhance Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) by empowering organizations to adapt to fluctuating demand and availability through adaptability strategies such as supplier/product substitution and resource repurposing. While this study primarily focuses on the conceptual design of OKRF and SCIS, further empirical research is needed to validate its effectiveness. Additionally, investigating the framework’s applicability across various industries and contexts would provide valuable insights. The integration of OKRF and SCIS can enable organizations to optimize supply chain operations, enhancing resilience and facilitating adaptation to changing demands through seamless substitutability and resource repurposing. This integration can also reduce transportation costs and increase responsiveness to local demand. Furthermore, it can enhance SCR and promote sustainable, resilient supply chain ecosystems by improving data transparency and resource utilization efficiency. This paper illustrates the potential of OKRF and SCIS in healthcare supply chains.</jats:p>"

However, the inherent complexity of supply chain systems introduces various risks and uncertainties that can significantly impact factory performance and the broader business sector. This research addresses the challenges faced by a brick manufacturing factory in Aceh Besar Regency, highlighting the absence of a well-structured risk management framework, inadequate mitigation planning, and suboptimal risk identification methods within the supply chain. To address these shortcomings, this study employs the House of Risk (HoR) methodology, utilizing it to identify risk events and agents within the supply chain. Mitigation strategies are designed based on the Aggregate Risk Potential (ARP). Data for the study were gathered through interviews and questionnaires completed by 12 respondents from three brick manufacturing factories and consumers. A combined quantitative and qualitative analysis approach, incorporating severity and occurrence risk levels assessed by each respondent, was used. The application of the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model revealed 21 risk events and 23 risk agents. Notably, risk agents such as adverse weather conditions, weak contractual agreements with suppliers, adverse weather during production and delivery processes, and damaged products displayed the highest ARP values (649, 826, 1521, 473, 276) across key business processes (plan, source, make, deliver, return). In response to these findings, proposed mitigation strategies include executing tasks during inclement weather, managing raw material inventory, establishing fair long-term contractual agreements with suppliers, selecting appropriate transportation during adverse weather, and choosing high-quality suppliers. This research contributes to the field of supply chain management by addressing gaps in risk mitigation within the brick manufacturing sector. The combination of the HoR methodology and ARP provides a comprehensive framework for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks, thereby enhancing the resilience of the supply chain. The results are particularly relevant for practitioners seeking effective strategies to manage risks in brick manufacturing and other similar industries.\n</jats:p>"

This sector mobilizes key industrial activities of many economies, such as agriculture, production, handling, storage, logistics, certification, and packing of a variety of mangoes (e.g., with over 1,500 varieties, of which at least 30 are grown commercially in Pakistan). From local, regional, and national, to international levels, many businesses in this sector are involved in extensive mango supply networks fulfilling the demands of many consumers and markets (e.g., B2B, B2C, etc.) locally worldwide. Currently, 43% of total farmers in Pakistan are smallholder farmers, as they possess less than 2.6 hectares of land. Intermediaries dominate the entire supply chain in Pakistan, due to which small to average farmers face several challenges. This can be avoided by developing a user-friendly system to link farmers directly to the market or consumers. The proposed system identifies the gaps in the process model of Pakistan’s mango supply chain system. It creates a platform to link farmers directly to the market or consumers through a seamless online system using blockchain technology for performing reliable transactions using smart contracts. The proposed system is implemented through Ethereum, a permissioned blockchain network using Smart Contracts. It is a distributed ledger accessible to participants of the supply chain with permission to ensure the trust and authenticity of the information. By using this system, the farmers will attain increased profit through direct access to retailers, consumers, and the international market.</jats:p>"

In this study, the protection method with one-way surge tanks in the bidirectional water delivery system is investigated. The theoretical formula for one-way surge tank setting is derived based on the theory of water hammer propagation, and the pump head and bidirectional water hammer protection constraints. Subsequently, the pump trip transient processes in an actual system are simulated. Finally, different kinds of one-way surge tank protection schemes are compared. The results show that the pressure along the pipeline after the pump trip can meet the standard when using the one-way surge tank protection scheme calculated by the theoretical formula. The proposed method can provide the effective protection strategy for the bidirectional water delivery systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This concept paper explores the integration of blockchain technology into food supply chains to enhance global food safety. In recent years, food safety has become a critical concern worldwide, with frequent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and contamination incidents. Traditional supply chain systems often lack transparency, traceability, and efficiency, leading to challenges in identifying the source of contamination and preventing its spread. Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to these challenges by providing a decentralized, immutable, and transparent ledger system. By recording each transaction and transfer of food products on a blockchain, stakeholders can trace the journey of food items from farm to fork in real-time. This enables rapid identification of contaminated products, facilitating targeted recalls and reducing the scope and impact of foodborne illness outbreaks. Key benefits of integrating blockchain technology into food supply chains include enhanced transparency, increased trust among consumers, improved efficiency in recalls and audits, and opportunities for process optimization and cost reduction. However, successful implementation requires collaboration among stakeholders, investment in infrastructure, and addressing technical and regulatory challenges. This concept paper outlines a strategic framework for implementing blockchain technology in food supply chains, including stakeholder engagement, pilot testing, scalability considerations, and regulatory compliance. By leveraging blockchain technology, we can ensure greater food safety, protect public health, and strengthen confidence in the global food supply chain.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Food Safety, Blockchain, Technology, Supply.</jats:p>"

Those striving for organizational performance by streamlining supply chain processes must assess the challenges and benefits of employing technologies for supply chain integration. This study’s objective is to analyze the supply chain integration antecedents required to enable supply chain performance, competitive advantages, and organization performance. Although prior research indicates that the Internet of Things (IoT), as one of the enabling technologies, plays an instrumental role in enhancing organization performance through supply chain integration, no empirical tests have been performed before. Therefore, this study examines the direct and indirect effects of the IoT’s impact on organizational performance through different mediating variables—supply chain integration, supply chain performance, and competitive advantages. This study uses survey data from Saudi Arabian companies that adopted IoT-based applications in their supply chains. The results from partial least squares structural equation modeling indicate that the benefits and challenges of IoT adoption significantly affect supply chain integration. Moreover, supply chain integration partially mediates the relationship between IoT, supply chain performance, and competitive advantages while supply chain performance and competitive advantages mediate the relationship between supply chain integration and organization performance. This study offers theoretical implications regarding how dynamic capabilities are associated with supply chain integration and how they influence organizational performance; it also reveals valuable managerial insights.</jats:p>"

A blockchain is a digital distributed ledger with the potential to improve transparency and trust between parties. Businesses are testing, piloting, and deploying blockchain technology across their organizations, and students show growing interest in the technology. This teaching brief proposes an exercise that uses POAPs, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) associated with an event, to help students understand blockchain technology within supply chain management contexts. Instructors can use the exercise for various purposes: as incentives for behavior the instructor wishes to encourage (such as attending class) or as prizes for games. The exercise also includes a glossary of blockchain‐related terms to introduce the language of this industry to students. Student surveys showed a significant change in their knowledge of blockchain technology, specifically, a 41% increase in understanding of how blockchain technology may benefit supply chain management and a 35% improvement in the ability to explain blockchain technology to others. This brief concludes with resources to create and distribute POAPs for courses and other settings.</jats:p>",

However, S&amp;OP has been analysed mostly in stable environments, with few implications for uncertain environments. With the current growing pressure to deal with unexpected changes in the business environment, the integration with supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities has been considered a promising direction for the next S&amp;OP generation. Within this context, this paper aims to advance the theoretical understanding of the interrelationship between S&amp;OP and SCRM under different contexts and provide a practical guidance for adapting S&amp;OP in uncertain environments. This goal is achieved by combining literature-based insights, obtained through a rigorous systematic literature review of 77 studies from academic and grey literature, with empirical insights from interviews with 15 industry experts. The research leads to a novel S&amp;OP framework for dealing with uncertain environments. It integrates SCRM activities into S&amp;OP, applying contingency theory as a theoretical foundation to address the context-specific nature of S&amp;OP. Moreover, it embraces a holistic view for S&amp;OP from an integrated people-process-IT perspective, encompassing the involved actors, the process itself and its steps, and the adopted information systems. Additionally, research findings reveal the possibility for an additional process to cope better with uncertain environments, which can run in parallel with the regular S&amp;OP process. It is characterised by a higher planning frequency and a lower planning horizon, resulting in a closer linkage with operational planning and execution.</jats:p>",

One question is whether the flood-spreading system was constructed at an inappropriate location leading to unintentional consequences. Composite soil samples were taken from three flooded areas, from three grids in each flooding area, and from two depths. Chemical characteristics of the soil including electrical conductivity, pH, concentrations of bicarbonate, chloride, sodium, calcium, and magnesium ions, and the sodium adsorption ratio in the flooded areas were measured. Because of calcareous, gypsum, shale, and marl formations in the first flooded area, dissolution of solutes of these formations increased the concentration of ions in the runoff (especially sodium and chlorine, to 19.50 and 21.90 mmol (charge) L−1, respectively). These high ion concentrations caused the electrical conductivity of the runoff to increase significantly (up to 2.03 dS/m) compared to the other areas. High amounts of lime in the soil caused increasing buffering capacity of the area soil, as a consequence the flood-spreading did not cause significant changes to the soil pH and showed a difference of only 0.3–0.2 in the first flooded area compared to other areas.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that the impact of government strategy and regulatory orientation on environmental performance is mediated by green supply chain management.\nResearch limitations/implications-For business actors, especially micro, small, and medium enterprises, it is necessary to focus on to the orientation of government strategies and regulations in their operational activities to encourage improved environmental performance. To support this, business actors must also pay attention to other factors, such as green supply chain management, to maximize efforts to achieve environmental performance.\nOriginality/value There is currently a dearth of research on the environmental performance of businesses, particularly micro, small, and medium-sized businesses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the industrial and sales processes, dosing systems of various constructions, whose operation is based on mechanical vibrations (vibratory feeders), are very often used. These systems face many problems, such as resonant frequency, flow instability of dosed product, instability of mechanical vibration amplitude, etc., because most of them are based on controlling the frequency of the electrical signal of the supply voltage. All these factors negatively affect the durability and reliability of the vibratory feeder systems. During this research, an automatic control system for vibratory feeder was created, whose control process is based on the modification of the sinusoidal signal (partially changing the signal area). In addition, such a way of controlling the vibratory feeder is not discussed in the literature. As the research conducted in this paper has shown, while using sinusoidal signal modification it was possible to achieve a stable flow rate of bulk production (the flow rate varied from 0 to 100 g/s when the frequency of mechanical vibrations changed from 1 to 50 Hz) and a stable amplitude of mechanical oscillations was achieved and equal to 1.5 mm. The control system is based on the microcontroller PIC24FV32KA302 for which the special software was developed. The thyristor BTA16 used for voltage modification of the sinusoidal signal made it possible to ensure the reliable control of the sinusoidal voltage modification process.</jats:p>"

In response, this study introduces a systematic methodology rooted in the Vulnerability Index (VI), leveraging the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to allocate weights to factors influencing pipeline seismic behavior. Through the derivation of an expression for calculating the VI based on these weighted factors, our objective is to furnish a comprehensive pipeline classification system, thereby providing a strategic overview of the networks' seismic resilience. This method's practical utility will be exemplified through the examination of concrete cases involving drinking water pipelines (DWP). Furthermore, the scope will extend to encompass sanitation pipelines, thereby validating the methodology's effectiveness across both domains. By systematically assessing the seismic vulnerability of these crucial infrastructures, we aim to fortify their resilience against seismic events, ensuring the continued provision of essential services even in the face of natural disasters. This study's significance lies not only in its contribution to the field of infrastructure resilience but also in its practical implications for urban planning and disaster management. By elucidating the factors influencing pipeline vulnerability and providing a robust framework for assessment, decision-makers can better prioritize resource allocation and mitigation efforts, ultimately enhancing community safety and well-being. Furthermore, the methodology's adaptability and scalability render it applicable to diverse contexts, facilitating its integration into broader risk management strategies. As such, this study serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, engineers, and stakeholders seeking to enhance the resilience of water supply and sanitation networks in earthquake-prone regions. Through informed decision-making and proactive measures, we can build more resilient communities capable of withstanding the challenges posed by seismic hazards.</jats:p>"

This approach aims to gauge the current value of the company's performance and offer recommendations for potential improvements. Until now, the company has not conducted performance measurement across all its business process networks, focusing solely on product sales and profit value. Therefore, the company conducted research using the SCOR (Supply Chain Operation Reference) method based on Islamic values, with the expectation of measuring supply chain performance more objectively and in detail to create competitive advantages. We use the AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) method to assign weights to each criterion in the SCOR design. The supply chain performance measurement design yields its results. We obtain 22 metrics, five of which are based on Islamic values and categorised into five main business processes: plan, source, make, deliver, and return, drawing on literature and expert opinions for guidance. We carry out the assessment using a normalisation process to equalise the scale of values on each metric. The performance measurement results are very satisfactory, with a value of 91.713144. However, four metrics still have low values, indicating the need for improvement proposals. Furthermore, the plan has the highest weight of 0.42, followed by deliver, source, and return, all of which have weights of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.14 respectively.</jats:p>"

However, fragmentation across farmlands necessitates distributed transparent automation. We developed an edge computing framework complemented by auction mechanisms and fuzzy optimizers that connect various supply chain stages. Specifically, edge computing offers powerful capabilities that enable real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making in smart agriculture. We propose an edge computing framework tailored to agricultural needs to ensure sustainability through a renewable solar energy supply. Although the edge computing framework manages real-time crop monitoring and data collection, market-based mechanisms, such as auctions and fuzzy optimization models, support decision-making for smooth agricultural supply chain operations. We formulated invisible auction mechanisms that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined with machine learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. While rule-based fuzzy systems encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, adaptable training algorithms help optimize model parameters from the data. A two-phase hybrid learning approach is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain expertise for three key supply chain decision problems. Auction markets discover optimal crop demand–supply balancing and pricing signals. Fuzzy systems incorporate domain knowledge into interpretable crop-advisory models. An integrated evaluation of 50 farms over five crop cycles demonstrated the high performance of the proposed edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network model compared with benchmarks.</jats:p>"

To supply public housing on a timely and large scale, public housing districts must be established first, which is the driving force behind the possibility of land acceptance according to public needs. Focusing on the Bogeumjari Housing Act, which first introduced the concept of public housing for sale, we examine the creation and supply of housing districts as well as the construction and supply procedures of housing and compare them with the Housing Site Development Promotion Act and the Housing Act applied to private housing. After the public housing district was established by the acceptance method, in addition to the construction of public housing in the district, a path for private housing could be developed by selling some of the district’s land to the private sector within the current legal framework. However, creating land for the public interest and then selling it to the private sector can result in the same problems as those raised in the Housing Site Development Promotion Act. The Housing Site Development Promotion Act conducted land expropriation for the large-scale new city development; however, it gradually became powerless against opposition from landowners owing to the cultivation of a sense of rights. The Roost Housing Act can be viewed as a means to bypass these problems. When a large-scale housing district is created for housing construction, measures to improve wide-area transportation must be implemented, and appropriate wide-area transportation facility charges may be imposed. At this point, it may be unclear whether the levy is imposed at the formation of a housing district or at the housing construction stage. As the Bogeumjari Housing Act focuses on the creation of a district, imposing a levy during the formation of the housing district may be more justified from the perspective of a housing site development plan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent times, numerous instances have come to light concerning farmer suicides attributed to mounting debts and meager agricultural yields. This poses a significant predicament for countries like India, which are grappling with burgeoning populations and an escalating reliance on land for residential and industrial expansion. The diminishing availability of fertile land for farming necessitates heightened agricultural output to meet the nation's demands. Despite this increasing demand, farmers continue to grapple with formidable challenges. Concurrently, consumers are also grappling with concerns over escalating commodity prices and the quality of produce available in the market. They often find themselves compelled to purchase available goods at prices dictated by sellers. Unscrupulous practices such as black market activities, hoarding, and adulteration, perpetuated by intermediaries, serve to further inflate the costs of agricultural products. Although the desire for organic products is on the rise, the absence of a robust system to trace the various stages of organic cultivation and guarantee authenticity poses a significant hurdle. Perhaps the most glaring issue in the agricultural markets is the palpable disconnect that exists between farmers and consumers. We have introduced an innovative marketplace built upon blockchain technology, designed to foster collaborative farming practices between farmers and consumers. This platform allows farmers to showcase their potential crops and projected yields on a decentralized public ledger. Consumers, in turn, gain access to this information and can assess the credibility of farmers based on their past cultivation and supply records. This pioneering approach establishes a transparent and tamper-proof digital marketplace exclusively for agricultural products. Within this framework, a consensus is established through mutual agreement between farmers and consumers. This consensus enables consumers to financially support individual crops or entire fields, in exchange for a share of the farm's yield or a percentage of the market value profit. A rating system has been implemented to enhance the credibility of both farmers and consumers, drawing from their prior interactions and experiences within the agro-market domain.</jats:p>"

Meeting the surging needs for irrigation and water supply requires a departure from the limitations of single reservoir systems. Instead, the construction of multi-reservoir systems within semi-arid river basins is imperative. The research employs an integrated reservoir operation approach that facilitates the controlled release of surplus water from upstream reservoirs to downstream ones. The novel Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) model is utilized to determine optimal irrigation releases, subsequently forming the basis for evaluating reservoir operation performance through the lenses of reliability, resilience, and vulnerability. The findings of this study shed light on the performance of these reservoirs under different models. Notably, the Aji-2 reservoir operation exhibits higher levels of reliability and resilience when the TLBO model is employed, surpassing the outcomes of the Linear Programming (LP) model. Conversely, the vulnerability of the Aji-3 reservoir operation is more pronounced with the TLBO model, albeit reduced when compared to actual release years 2005, 2009, and 2013. This study adds to the development of reservoir operation policies that favor reduced vulnerability and increased reliability.</jats:p>",

By examining three distinct case studies – garment manufacturing, high-tech manufacturing, and agriculture – the analysis reveals significant variations in adoption rates, technological focus, and strategic implementation. These disparities stem from each nation's unique economic landscape, industrial structure, and labour market dynamics. Bangladesh, characterised by low-wage labour in garment manufacturing, cautiously incorporates automation technologies like Sewbots to enhance long-term efficiency and product quality. Conversely, the U.S. garment industry strategically utilises robots for specialised tasks in niche markets, seeking a competitive advantage through precision and design innovation. In high-tech manufacturing, the U.S. leverages readily available commercial solutions and a skilled workforce for extensive robotics adoption, ensuring precision and consistency in complex processes. Bangladesh acknowledges these benefits but faces challenges related to cost and skills gaps, necessitating capability building and strategic partnerships for future integration.  Both countries recognise the high potential of robotics in agriculture; however, the U.S. combats labour shortages and enhances efficiency through advanced solutions like farming robots and UAVs. Bangladesh explores automation to increase yield and reduce manual labour dependence.  This comparative analysis contributes to understanding global manufacturing and supply chain optimisation by highlighting the diverse factors influencing robotics adoption across nations. The research suggests a future where the U.S. refines and expands advanced robotics use. Bangladesh strategically invests in and develops its workforce, potentially forming partnerships to integrate robotics into high-tech manufacturing and agriculture. As robotics and automation technologies evolve, both countries stand to benefit by embracing these advancements while navigating the challenges to ensure a smooth transition toward a more automated and efficient future for their manufacturing sectors.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on exploring how retail and recycling advertising affects the manufacturer’s cooperation strategy in a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The CLSC model consisting of a manufacturer, an online recycling platform with recycling advertising, and a retailer with retail advertising considers four cooperation strategies by a manufacturer: no cooperation, cooperation with only the retailer, cooperation with only the online recycling platform, and cooperation with the online recycling platform and the retailer. After comparing four strategies, it is found that the manufacturer collaborates with the retailer, or the online recycling platform based on retail and recycling advertising coefficients. Furthermore, cooperation between the manufacturer and the retailer increases retail advertising and sales, which incentivizes the manufacturer to collaborate with the retailer. Collaboration between the manufacturer and the online recycling platform will increase both recycling advertising and quantity, which incentivizes the manufacturer to collaborate with the online recycling platform. These results would encourage more manufacturers to improve their operational efficiency through cooperation with online recycling platforms because the online recycling platforms conveniently utilize recycling advertising to increase the quantity of used products recycled, which in turn contributes to environmental sustainability.</jats:p>",

However, before widescale adoption, a thorough cost-benefit analysis is essential for making an apt decision towards transitioning to ETs. Utilizing data of 13 ETs, a total cost of ownership (TCO) model has been developed that outlines the economic benefits of ETs by evaluating the impact of factors like energy consumption, charging strategy, annual driven distances, route optimization, etc. With acquisition costs of ETs constituting 50–55 % of TCO the study outlines that ETs have significantly lower energy costs of 6–12 % (50–58 % for IC-engine trucks) and maintenance costs of 6–8% (13–18 % for IC-engine trucks), thereby reducing the overall TCO. Subsequently, a fleet-level analysis of ET adoption in a food supply chain comprising of four heavy-duty trucks and 16 medium-duty trucks has been performed with emphasis on assessment of supply chain-specific parameters like battery-mass penalty, level of utilization, etc. Overall, this study provides insight for fleet managers, policymakers and industry leaders to promote sustainable through an extended use of ET in the present scenario for the food supply chain.</jats:p>"

The presence of dissolved hydrocarbon gases (methane and heavy hydrocarbons up to 60-90 %) in thermal waters significantly increases their energy potential. However, the presence of dissolved CO2, N2, H2S cause equipment corrosion. Therefore, degassing of thermal waters and cleaning from mechanical impurities allows increasing the reliability of exploiting of geothermal deposits. The technology provides purification of geothermal fluid from particles with a dispersion of 50 to 300 μm and carbonate-calcium mechanical impurities and removal of dissolved gases. The technology is based on the use of hydrodynamic processes of separation of impurities in the turbulent flow of a rotating liquid and gas. The device is equipped with many small-diameter vane swirlers and vortex turbulent washers. High tangential speed in swirlers ensures cleaning of liquid from impurities. Due to the rotation of the flow, the surface of the liquid is dispersed with the formation of a droplet-granular layer, through which the gas to be purified passes. When the pressure of the fluid in the device and swirlers is reduced, dissolved gases (methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) are released from the geothermal fluid. The final purification of the gases from the dripping liquid is carried out using conical vane washers. The device can be used in technologies of geothermal field development. Existing technologies do not solve the problem of protecting geothermal energy systems and devices from carbonate deposits. Testing the models showed that this design provides cleaning from mechanical particles with a size of 100-300 μm and removal of dissolved gases by 95 %. This is enough to ensure the reliability of operation of heat exchange and technological equipment.</jats:p>"

As a result, the increasing demand coupled with the reduced availability of surface water prompts scientific investigation into groundwater availability and its sustainable management as an alternative. The study attempted to determine groundwater potential zones using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and multi-influencing factor (MIF) techniques. Twelve contextually significant regulating environmental factors were selected, and their significance and influences on decision-making approaches models have been attempted to determine through the sensitivity analysis. The final GWPZ map obtained, from a combination of thematic layers, was verified using the receiver operating curve (ROC) and the area under curve (AUC) with discharge (yield) records taken from 21 bore wells. According to the ROC curve's AUC estimation, MIF can explain 82.9% of the actual groundwater situation in the region, and for AHP, an AUC value of 0.751 is relatively low. This indicates that the MIF model is the most appropriate to accurately define potential groundwater zones for emerging cities like Nava Raipur.</jats:p>",

In this edition, we update the schools and individual scholars producing the most supply chain publications from 2020 to 2022. Despite a new top‐ranked school, the top 10 list remains largely consistent with previous editions, as does the core set of top supply chain doctoral programs. In contrast, the list of the remaining top 25 schools continues to change and includes more international (i.e., non‐U.S.) schools. Additionally, the barriers to entry to become a strong supply chain research school are lower than in the past, while author concentration analyses confirm that the supply chain scholarly field has become more dispersed. Combined, the results support not only highly productive authors and schools with recognition and resource requests but also aspiring authors and schools with their research paths and benchmarking. We voice concerns, however, about both the supply of new supply chain scholars and the decreasing authorship of industry practitioners that had been a staple of our applied field. As a further contribution, we organize the most frequent keywords since 2020 to help scholars identify contemporary and understudied topics.</jats:p>",

Secondly, a needle valve based on the PCM digital valve and equal percentage flow characteristics is used to achieve accurate control of gas flow. Then, the Venturi flow meter with a honeycomb and damping network is used to accurately measure the airflow. Finally, a PID flow control algorithm based on nonlinear self-tuning is proposed. The results show that the flow regulation range of the system reaches 0.1∼8 kg/s, the absolute control accuracy is better than ±3 g/s, and the relative control accuracy is better than ±0.04%. Moreover, the system has the characteristics of short regulation time, small overshoot, and good dynamic performance, which can achieve strong support for wind tunnel air supply tests.</jats:p>",

Portable tools used to measure pH, turbidity and residual chlorine are as follows, namely pH meters (Hanna, HI98017), Turbidity Meters (Hanna, HI 98703), Residual Chlorine meters and measurements with an online system using \"Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition”. The average parameter value of the results of online daily monitoring for a month for the pH parameter was a minimum 6.92, a maximum of 7.46, a minimum turbidity of 0.08 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) and a maximum of 0.94 NTU. While the residual chlorine minimum of 0.29 mg/L and a maximum of 0.58 mg/L. To determine the accuracy of the offline measurements, measurements were also performed with a portable device four times a month. The comparison of the measurement results is very small, which is the difference in pH parameters is between 0.37-0.50, turbidity is between 0.05-0.21 NTU, and residual chlorine is 0.002-0.006 mg/L. Offline measurements using the portable device are consistent with the online daily monitoring.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We model the development of effective agricultural supply chains (agri-chains) in emerging economies for better utilization of land and intermediate processing resources for harvested export-oriented goods. We study decisions made by farmers, intermediate processors, and government officials in agri-chains. The structure and management of supply chains and government minimum guaranteed prices to farmers affect the performance of these chains and are in the domain of our study. Methodology/results: We develop models of agricultural supply chains in which yields are correlated across regions, and farmers sell to competing capacitated processors. The models have two types of fundamental decisions: determining how much land to allocate for planting before the start of a growing season and, determining the prices offered by competing processors that purchase the harvest. We develop analytical results and algorithmic approaches for finding resulting equilibria that depend on the nature of decision making and on the structure of yield uncertainty. In particular, for all-or-nothing yields, we characterize the ranges of minimum guaranteed prices that lead to farmers’ no-production, under-production, full-production and over-production equilibria. Analytical results supported by numerical experiments allow us to conclude that appropriately setting minimum price guarantees, with the exact definition of such ranges dependent on agri-chain characteristics, can lead to first-best supply chain solutions. Managerial implications: The analysis also suggests that some farmer co-operation in land allocation or regional integration of farmer-processing assets, together with moderate minimum guaranteed prices, might be implementable pathways for achieving agri-chain efficiency in emerging economies. In an interesting result, farmlands with yields of positive correlation tend to inhibit over-production, whereas those with negative correlations tend to induce over-production. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2022.0076 . </jats:p>",

Finally, the results are verified by numerical simulation It is found that the use of blockchain technology can always make the profits of supply chain enterprises higher regardless of whether subsidies are made or not. With the increase of subsidies, the profits of supply chain enterprises will increase. For consumers, general consumers can always benefit from blockchain technology, loyal consumers need subsidies under certain conditions, but the same is true. The greater the subsidies, the more consumers will benefit from blockchain technology In addition, we find that subsidies can effectively improve social welfare, but there is a certain threshold beyond which the improvement effect will be weakened.</jats:p>"

This is especially true in the wine industry. Grapes must be processed both before and after harvesting as part of the management process for supply chains in the food industry. The grape bunch identification in vineyards was performed using machine learning at various stages of growth, including early stages immediately after flowering and intermediate stages when the grape bunch reached intermediate developmental stages. The machine learning method can predict annual grape output and also identify grape harvesting. The impressive performance of the pre-trained model shows that architecture training using different algorithms differs in the performance of grape predictions. We achieved 100% accuracy in grape prediction using LR, DT, RF, NUSVC, Adaboost and gradient algorithms, while KNN and SVC lag behind with an accuracy of 83.33% each. Our model includes the color and size of the grapes to differ in grape quality using a variety of grape images as a reference. It is capable of predicting the maturity stage of grapes by predicting Brix, TA and pH values (ranging between 18.20–25.70, 5.67–9.83 and 2.93–3.77) according to the size and color of grapes.We compared different algorithms and their performances by evaluating grape quality prediction accuracy, processing time and memory consumption.</jats:p>"

The international trade and localised commercial activity, to a large extent, is dependent on the logistics and supply chain infrastructure and operational capacity. However, the area received little attention from the perspective of applied economics. The in-depth empirical studies on the impacts of logistics on trade efficiency are few and limited. The study aims to investigate the role of logistics and supply chains in international and national trade in a developing country. It uses secondary data for the analysis. The model and software used in the study are the gravity model and GTAP10a. The time horizon used spans 2014–2030.

Three distinct distribution strategies are examined: bundled-by-the-base-manufacturer (BBBM), bundled-by-the-platform, and the add-on approach within a platform supply chain context. Through comprehensive analysis, this paper investigates the optimal distribution strategy for manufacturers. Significantly, our research reveals that in cases where only bundling is feasible, base manufacturers can reap benefits from a self-bundling strategy when both the platform’s commission rate and the marginal cost of the bundled product are low. Additionally, the platform stands to gain from this approach when the commission rate is low, and the marginal cost of the bundled product is either moderate or very high. Notably, win–win scenarios can emerge for both manufacturers and platforms through specific bundling or platform bundling strategies under specific conditions. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the price of bundles under the add-on strategy will be lower, attracting more consumers, especially when the commission rate is low. Intriguingly, when the marginal cost of the base product is low, the add-on strategy consistently emerges as the optimal choice; as costs escalate, BBBM might be optimal, especially when the commission rate is low, showcasing a nuanced understanding of the interplay between costs and strategic choices in distribution. The major contribution of this paper lies in its nuanced analysis of these strategies and their implications for both manufacturers and platforms in the retail landscape.</jats:p>"

A review of publications on the problems of industry by domestic researchers is carried out. It is stated that as part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had a developed industry, which was fully integrated into the Union economy. The rupture of production chains, the loss of markets and the lack of an effective industrial policy during the period of independence led to deindustrialization and technological decline of Ukraine's industrial potential, which became a significant factor in unleashing armed aggression. The negative impact of the war on the state of domestic industry is studied: the destruction, closure and relocation of many enterprises, the curtailment of business and the primitivization of production led to a reduction in the volume of products sold by almost a third. Analysis of the dynamics of production in 2023 showed a slow and unstable recovery of industrial production, which is hindered by a number of factors. It is noted that a growing constraint is the lack of qualified personnel. The main threats to the staffing of the industrial sector of Ukraine in the wartime and post-war period are systematized: physical and migration losses of the population, brain drain, migration policy of the EU countries to create a reserve of skilled labor for their economies, low level of wages at domestic enterprises, destruction of the education system and inconsistency of vocational training with the needs of the labor market, weak participation of business in interaction with the system of vocational training and in improving personnel qualifications. At the present stage, the main tasks in the field of staffing of industry are: increasing the level of safety of living and working conditions in Ukraine; improvement of the organizational and legal principles of employment based on the principles of decent work; development of effective mechanisms and incentives for the return of forced external migrants; involvement in the sphere of economic activity of the passive part of the able-bodied population, including disabled people; use of diverse and flexible forms of work organization; modernization and development of the system of vocational and engineering education.

Economic growth is linked to the demand for high steel products, which is also connected to higher coke production. A sustainable supply of raw materials – like metallurgical coal – requires balanced, cost effective and environmentally friendly mining, to provide the best quality of coal and coke. There are various types of steelmaking coals mined in Poland (in the Upper Silesia Coal Basin), thus laboratory tests on extracted coals need to be undertaken in order to create safe mixtures of coals (coal blends) which will be processed in the blast furnace. With this mind a new tool – the safety calculation model – has been developed and implemented by the CLP-B Laboratory. This new approach taken by the laboratory is a multi-component analysis which assesses the possible risk associated with the transformation of coal blends during the coking process in the furnace. The new calculation model allows for the sustainable management of raw materials such as coking (steelmaking) coals – to produce the best quality of coke in safe conditions. In the new proposed formula, the parameters identified as critical ones for assessing the safety of the furnace feed, are moisture, ash and sulphur content, volatile matter, pressure expansion, dilatation, shrinkage, volume, CRI and CSR.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Uncertainty arising from climate change poses a central challenge to the long‐term performance of many engineered water systems. Water supply infrastructure projects can leverage different types of flexibility, in planning, design, or operations, to adapt infrastructure systems in response to climate change over time. Both flexible planning and design enable future capacity expansion if‐and‐when needed, with flexible design proactively incorporating physical design changes that enable retrofits. All three forms of flexibility have not previously been analyzed together to explicitly assess their relative value in mitigating cost and water supply reliability risk. In this paper, we propose a new framework to evaluate combinations of flexible planning, design, and operations. We develop a nested stochastic dynamic optimization approach that jointly optimizes dam development and operating policies under dynamic climate uncertainty. We demonstrate this approach on a reservoir project near Mombasa, Kenya. Our results find that flexible operations have the greatest potential to reduce costs. Flexible design and flexible planning can amplify the value of flexible operations under higher discounting scenarios and when initial infrastructure capacities are undersized. This approach provides insight on the climate change and techno‐economic conditions under which flexible planning, design, and operations can be best leveraged individually or in combination to reduce climate change uncertainty risks in water supply infrastructure projects.</jats:p>",

However, the association between the supply of primary care physicians and mortality rates in South Korea has not been thoroughly investigated.Methods: This study utilized data from 229 si-gun-gu in South Korea from 2016 to 2020. The densities of primary care physicians, physicians in functional primary clinics, specialists in primary care facilities, and active physicians per 100,000 people were independent variables. Age-adjusted all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality rates per 100,000 individuals were the dependent variables. Negative binomial regression, negative binomial regression with a pseudo-panel approach, and geographically weighted regression were used to analyze the data.Results: Our study revealed a significant negative association between the density of primary care physicians and all-cause mortality. An increase in a primary care physician per 100,000 population was significantly linked to a 0.11% reduction in all-cause mortality (incidence rate ratio, 0.9989; 95% confidence interval, 0.9983–0.9995). Similar associations have been observed between mortality rates owing to cardiovascular diseases, respiratory tract diseases, and traffic accidents.Conclusion: This study provides evidence that having a higher number of primary care physicians in South Korea is associated with lower mortality rates. Future research should consider better indicators that reflect the quality of primary care to better understand its impact on population health outcomes. These findings emphasize the significance of strengthening primary care in the South Korean healthcare system to improve the overall health and wellbeing.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the purchasing habit of the consumers has remarkably changed compared to pre-pandemic. To meet this new demand pattern, many grocery retailers have tried to adapt to the new normal. While before COVID-19 offline grocery purchasing was popular, after the pandemic, online service got tremendous attention in  market. In this study, online grocery supply chain management during the COVID-19 in Istanbul is considered. The aim is to find out how online grocery companies will serve more efficiently during the pandemics and which factors have more effect on the customer’s satisfaction. To do so, first, three popular grocery retailers in Istanbul were selected. Then, a related survey was designed to understand the consumer experience as doing online grocery shopping in COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, a result shows that 60% of the respondents did online shopping every 3-4 days in one week, and the delivery time is the most important factor for the customers. Then, the SWOT analyses were performed accordingly, and the related strategies were summarized.

Although numerous studies have evaluated impacts of climate variability on crop yields, many uncertainties are still associated with climate extremes as well as the rapid population growth and corresponding dietary lifestyle. Here, we present a food supply and demand analysis based on the relationship between climate change, crop production, and population growth in three sites from southwestern Burkina Faso to southwestern Ghana. Climate and agricultural time series were analyzed by using boxplots mixed with a Mann–Kendall trend test and Sen’s slope. Food balance sheets were calculated by estimating the demand using a population growth model linked to food supply with local consumption patterns. We found almost insignificant rainfall and temperature trends for both sites in the Sudano-Guinean savannah. Conversely, the climate regime of southwestern Ghana revealed a strong significant increasing temperature over time. Crop yield trends demonstrated that maize and sorghum were significantly enhanced in both study areas of the Sudano-Guinean savannah. Southwestern Ghana depicted a different crop pattern where cassava and plantain showed a strong upward yield trend. The grouped food balance sheets across the regions illustrated a surplus for the Sudano-Guinean savannah while southwestern Ghana exhibited a deficit. Despite the growing yield of various crops, food demand is outpacing regional production.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the era of digitization, the integration of big data technologies has become instrumental in advancing agricultural supply chain management and bolstering risk decision-making processes. Agricultural supply chains, critical to ensuring food security and bolstering rural economies, face vulnerabilities stemming from a myriad of internal and external elements, including natural disasters and market dynamics. Consequently, the urgency to adopt effective risk management strategies is paramount. Contemporary studies have explored the utilization of big data in decision-making processes specific to agricultural supply chain risks, predominantly concentrating on preliminary risk prediction and characterization. Nonetheless, there exists a shortfall in comprehensively analyzing the intricate interplay among risk factors and establishing a holistic risk management decision-making framework based on such analyses. This research addresses these deficiencies through two principal investigative components. First, this research explores the analysis of risk factors and their interrelationships in the agricultural supply chain based on a decision tree algorithm with a transition structure. This algorithm enhances decision-makers’ understanding of risk factors and their interrelationships, and guide the implementation of effective risk mitigation measures and the formulation of contingency plans. Subsequently, the research constructs a corresponding data-driven multi-criteria decision-making method, assisting managers in balancing different risk management strategies in a volatile supply chain environment, considering costs, benefits, and feasibility to formulate the optimal strategy. The innovation of this research lies in the development of a novel risk analysis tool based on the transition decision tree algorithm. This is the first time that such advanced algorithms are applied to agricultural supply chain risk management, filling a gap in the current research. The outcomes of this study not only contribute to enhancing risk management practices within agricultural supply chains but also offer novel insights and methodological tools that are applicable in research and practices across related domains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aluminium (Al) is toxic to most plants, but recent research has suggested that Al addition may stimulate growth and nutrient uptake in some species capable of accumulating high tissue Al concentrations. The physiological basis of this growth response is unknown, but it may be associated with processes linked to the regulation of carbon assimilation and partitioning by Al supply. To test alternative hypotheses for the physiological mechanism explaining this response, we examined the effects of increasing Al concentrations in the growth medium on tissue nutrient concentrations and carbon assimilation in two populations of the Al-accumulator <jats:italic>Melastoma malabathricum</jats:italic>. Compared to seedlings grown in a control nutrient solution containing no Al, mean rates of photosynthesis and respiration increased by 46% and 27%, respectively, total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations increased by 45%, and lignin concentration in roots decreased by 26% when seedlings were grown in a nutrient solution containing 2.0 mM Al. The concentrations of P, Ca and Mg in leaves and stems increased by 31%, 22%, and 26%, respectively, in response to an increase in nutrient solution Al concentration from 0 to 2.0 mM. Elemental concentrations in roots increased for P (114%), Mg (61%) and K (5%) in response to this increase in Al concentration in the nutrient solution. Plants derived from an inherently faster-growing population had a greater relative increase in final dry mass, net photosynthetic and respiration rates and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations in response to higher external Al supply. We conclude that growth stimulation by Al supply is associated with increases in photosynthetic and respiration rates and enhanced production of non-structural carbohydrates that are differentially allocated to roots, as well as stimulation of nutrient uptake. These responses suggest that internal carbon assimilation is up-regulated to provide the necessary resources of non-structural carbohydrates for uptake, transport and storage of Al in <jats:italic>Melastoma malabathricum</jats:italic>. This physiological mechanism has only been recorded previously in one other plant species, <jats:italic>Camellia sinensis</jats:italic>, which last shared a common ancestor with <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>. <jats:italic>malabathricum</jats:italic> more than 120 million years ago.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Hydrogen can be produced from water, using electricity. The hydrogen can subsequently be kept in inventory in large quantities, unlike the electricity itself. This enables solar and wind energy generation to occur asynchronously from its usage. For this reason, hydrogen is expected to be a key ingredient for reaching a climate-neutral economy. However, the logistics for hydrogen are complex. Inventory policies must be determined for multiple locations in the network, and transportation of hydrogen from the production location to customers must be scheduled. At the same time, production patterns of hydrogen are intermittent, which affects the possibilities to realize the planned transportation and inventory levels. To provide policies for efficient transportation and storage of hydrogen, this paper proposes a parameterized cost function approximation approach to the stochastic cyclic inventory routing problem. Firstly, our approach includes a parameterized mixed integer programming (MIP) model which yields fixed and repetitive schedules for vehicle transportation of hydrogen. Secondly, buying and selling decisions in case of underproduction or overproduction are optimized further via a Markov decision process (MDP) model, taking into account the uncertainties in production and demand quantities. To jointly optimize the parameterized MIP and the MDP model, our approach includes an algorithm that searches the parameter space by iteratively solving the MIP and MDP models. We conduct computational experiments to validate our model in various problem settings and show that it provides near-optimal solutions. Moreover, we test our approach on an expert-reviewed case study at two hydrogen production locations in the Netherlands. We offer insights for the stakeholders in the region and analyze the impact of various problem elements in these case studies. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: This project received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (now Clean Hydrogen Partnership) under [Grant Agreement 875090].

The object of research is the process of selecting and justifying the device circuit on a modern element base, developing a printed circuit board, manufacturing and testing the created device layout in practice. The toroidal transformer of the required power was also calculated. The test was carried out in the voltage and current stabilization mode, and the data obtained indicate the possibility of further improvement of the device's circuitry.  To build a laboratory power supply, it is desirable to use a linear circuit, because of the small pulsations that are critical when powering electronic equipment. A switching power supply can be used as an additional source when working with high-power circuits. A universal option is a bipolar power supply built according to a linear circuit with an output voltage of 0...±30 V and a current of 0...5 A. This solution will allow the device to be used for operation with most radio electronic devices, including those sensitive to RF noise, whose power consumption does not exceed 150 W. Thanks to the use of a bipolar circuit, it is also possible to work with high-quality audio frequency amplifiers that require bipolar power supply, operational amplifiers and some digital equipment. The galvanic isolation of the channels will make it possible to adjust the output parameters independently for each arm, which may be necessary when repairing digital equipment. Equipping the laboratory power supply with a current stabilization unit will make it possible to use the power supply as a battery charger and help in finding short circuits in circuits. Short-circuit protection will save the power supply in the event of an emergency and, in some cases, save the connected load.</jats:p>"

E-commerce platforms offer new opportunities for WEEE recycling, making it a subject of interest for researchers. This study focuses on the E-commerce Closed-Loop Supply Chain (E-CLSC) WEEE recycling system, led by remanufacturers, and develops a dual-sided evolutionary game model with remanufacturers and platforms as participants. The model considers the influence of factors such as green innovation, service level, recycling price, and government subsidies. A profit matrix is constructed to analyze the strategic choices of remanufacturers and platforms. Then, this paper conducts a simulation using MATLAB, obtaining data based on the sales and recycling prices of smartphones. Based on evolutionary numerical analysis, the following findings were obtained: (1) Government subsidy policies are formulated based on the required investments for green innovation and service levels, which differ at each stage. (2) The decision of whether remanufacturers engage in green innovation depends largely on the extent to which the technology can reduce remanufacturing costs. They are more inclined to choose green innovation if it can significantly lower costs. (3) Consumer sensitivity to recycling prices also influences the strategic choices of remanufacturers. The more sensitive consumers are to prices, the more waste products remanufacturers can recycle, making green innovation more attractive.</jats:p>",

The Act provides multiple fiscal incentives to entities that wish to set up, modernize or expand facilities engaged in semiconductor production related activities in the US. The Act intends to curb any nexus of beneficiaries with ‘a country of concern’ such as China and it blocks benefits for an entity dealing with such countries. Apart from reshoring capacities the Act also frontlines US strategy to friendshoring semiconductor supply chains.Measures like the CHIPS Act may clash with the international rules-based trading system. Parallelly, the innovative ways to bypass the trade rules may come with their own consequences.

Questionnaire‐based research is conducted among 264 Indian manufacturing organisations based on their certification status and MNE supplier status. Comparison of the surveyed organisations is carried out on three parameters, namely, number of targets for each SDG, fulfilment levels of these targets and extension of established targets further in the supply chain. Analysis of variance and <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐test methods are used to compare survey responses. Results show that the role of management system standards and auditing frameworks used by multinational enterprises is statistically similar in achieving SDGs. The role of management system standards in achieving each of the SDGs has not yet been attempted so far by using the aforementioned factors. The comparison of management system standards' auditing approaches with the auditing frameworks of multinational enterprises also provides a novel addition. Both multinationals and their supplier organisations can save time, money and effort by following either of the two approaches and avoiding the duplicity that is currently prevalent in practice. The research has theoretical implications for sustainability, modernisation and globalisation theories.</jats:p>",

Therefore, monitoring the quality of the supplied water is of utmost importance. To achieve this goal, there is a need to develop tools that support monitoring activities and improve efficiency. Forecasting models enable the prediction of pollution levels and facilitate the implementation of action plans. In this study, the Boosted Regression Trees method was employed to investigate the variables influencing water quality failures (WQFs) due to microbial contamination at the delivery point. The dataset used was obtained from localities across the country's distribution systems. The variables under consideration included physicochemical parameters such as pH, turbidity (NTU), and free chlorine (mg L−1), along with contextual parameters like the year, season, geographic location, and locality population. Indicators of microbial contamination assessed were the presence of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most significant variables were geographic location, free chlorine content, and the population of the locality. The model achieved an AUC value of 0.77 and provided adequate predictions in the conducted tests. It enables the exploration of key factors affecting microbiological water quality, allowing for informed action to reduce associated risks.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we first construct the disruption propagation model considering the recovery strategy based on the characteristics of the competitiveness, time delay and underload cascading failure in the supply chain network. This model uses the memetic algorithm to determine the set of recovery nodes among all disruption nodes, which can minimize the impact of disruption propagation.

We compare the proposed recovery strategy with other strategies (according to the genetic algorithm, according to the descending order of the load of failure node, according to the ascending order of the load of failure node, according to the descending order of the node degree, according to the ascending order of the node degree) and provide decision-making reference against supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into supply chain management has emerged as a pivotal avenue for enhancing efficiency and resilience in contemporary business operations. This paper explores various theoretical approaches to AI within the context of supply chain optimization, delineating pathways to achieve heightened performance and adaptability. Commencing with a historical overview, the paper delves into the evolution of AI techniques in supply chain management, elucidating how these methodologies have transformed the landscape of logistics and operations. Fundamental to this exploration is the discussion on mathematical modeling and algorithmic frameworks that underpin supply chain optimization, providing the theoretical foundation for subsequent AI applications. A key focus of the paper lies in the application of machine learning techniques for demand forecasting and inventory management, which leverage data-driven insights to optimize resource allocation and mitigate risks associated with supply-demand fluctuations. Additionally, network theory and graph algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing the structure and dynamics of supply chain networks, enabling efficient transportation, distribution, and inventory routing. Strategic decision-making in supply chains is addressed through the lens of game theory, which offers theoretical frameworks to model interactions among multiple stakeholders and optimize outcomes in competitive environments. Moreover, swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems provide innovative solutions for coordination and collaboration within complex supply chain ecosystems. Evolutionary algorithms and artificial neural networks are discussed as powerful tools for supply chain design, predictive analytics, and risk management, offering capabilities for optimizing decision-making processes across various operational domains. Furthermore, reinforcement learning techniques empower dynamic decision-making in real-time operational settings, fostering adaptive and resilient supply chain management practices. By integrating multiple AI techniques, hybrid approaches offer synergistic solutions that capitalize on the strengths of diverse methodologies to address multifaceted challenges in supply chain optimization. Through a synthesis of theoretical insights and practical case studies, this paper provides valuable insights into the current state and future directions of AI-driven supply chain optimization.</jats:p>"

The dependence of the electric power consumed by the electric drive of the pump unit on the pressure and supply of the coolant was determined. It is proved that the regulated electric drive system has advantages over the non-regulated electric drive system in the context of energy efficiency of the pumping unit and the district heating network in general. Approaches and criteria for the synthesis of a regulated electric drive system, including its automatic control system, were determined, regulation methods were analyzed, and the most acceptable version of the electric drive was chosen: a controlled frequency converter - an asynchronous motor with a short-circuited rotor, taking into account the above, an energy-saving mechanical system of a centralized heat supply network was synthesized. The peculiarity of this system is that the protection of parameters of hydraulic and temperature regimes in the network of centralized heat supply is ensured with the help of extreme automatic control systems. At the same time, the assignment of mode parameters is provided by the temperature controller of the heat exchange point of the network. Regulation of the pressure and productivity of the pumping unit is carried out by changing, according to a certain law, the frequency and power supply of the asynchronous motor.</jats:p>"

One possible strategy to address these challenges for smoothing the supply chain (SC) and logistics operations is to adopt Industry 4.0 (I4.0) based technologies in the FMCG business processes. In this regard, digitalization and automation of the FMCG supply chain can be strengthened by the alluring properties of I4.0 technologies. Methods: This study identified nine significant challenges through a literature review and expert validation. Later, the challenges were evaluated using a novel multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) framework, the Bayesian best worst method (BWM). Results: The findings indicated that “requirement for substantial investment and resources”, “incompatible technological infrastructure” and “poorly structured value chain” are the most significant challenges to implementing I4.0 in the FMCG industry. Conclusions: The study is expected to significantly contribute to improving the FMCG supply chain’s resilience, sustainability, visibility, traceability and responsiveness. Additionally, the research can provide industrial practitioners valuable insights into implementing I4.0 in FMCG and similar sectors and thus promote SC sustainability and resilience in those industries.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to explore the main strategies that manufacturing companies can utilize to identify and address obstacles in supply chain and delivery management, ultimately leading to enhanced performance and customer satisfaction. The researcher conducted surveys and interviews with the key informants such as customers and experts in the Supply Chain to gather insights into their experiences, recommended solutions to a problem, and other pertinent factors. The researcher therefore concludes that it is clear that to achieve a high level of performance in today’s highly competitive business environment, it is necessary to transform delivery and supply chain governance into an integral part of a company’s overall performance framework. Adopting cutting-edge technologies, utilizing data-driven insights, optimizing the supply chain through a Vertical Integration strategy, and adopting agile methodologies are necessary to maximize the potential of a business’s supply chain and distribution processes. Study findings benefit both companies and customers here in the Philippines by providing the potential to improve consistency in meeting customer demand without a delay in delivering complete items, resulting in customer satisfaction and business growth.

Based on expert interviews and policy and industry documents, our analysis focuses on the automotive, clothing, and electronics industries. Although concerns for resilience increasingly shape lead firms’ strategies, increased regionalization of production through re- or near-shoring is only one of several strategies. Where it does occur, it has been driven by state policies that tackle certain strategically important products, not production networks as a whole. Hence, while recent events exposed the vulnerabilities of global production, we do not observe deglobalization in the sense of a comprehensive retreat from globalized in favor of intraregional production. Nonetheless, state interventions that are geopolitically motivated and affect firms’ investment decisions have intensified particularly in the United States and the European Union. </jats:p>"

In this paper, the Wild Horse Optimizer (WHO) algorithm was used to optimize long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector regression (SVR) to estimate daily pan evaporation (Ep). Primary meteorological variables including minimum temperature (Tmin), maximum temperature (Tmax), sunshine hours (SSH), relative humidity (RH), and wind speed (WS) were collected from two synoptic meteorological stations with different climates which are situated in Fars province, Iran. One of the stations is located in Larestan city with a hot desert climate and the other is in Abadeh city with a cold dry climate. The partial mutual information (PMI) algorithm was utilized to identify the efficient input variables (EIVs) on Ep. The results of the PMI algorithm proved that the Tmax, Tmin, and RH for Larestan station and also the Tmax, Tmin, and SSH for Abadeh station are the EIVs on Ep. The results showed the LSTM–WHO hybrid model for both stations can ameliorate the daily Ep estimation and it can also reduce the estimation error. Therefore, the LSTM–WHO hybrid model was proposed as a powerful model compared to standalone models in estimating daily Ep.</jats:p>",

This reform, which advanced the compulsory children’s enrolment in primary education schools from the age of 7–6, is interpreted as the provision of free childcare. Due to the imperfect compliance of the reform implementation, children’s month of birth is used as an instrumental variable to control for the endogeneity present in any actual school enrolment. We show that the reform presented a positive effect on the labour supply of (1) the Brazilian single mothers and (2) the least educated mothers, increasing their participation in labour market by 12.9 % and furthermore a probability of becoming full time workers by 10.9 %.</jats:p>",

We study a supply chain consisting of a CCER supplier and a manufacturer that buys CCER quotas from the supplier. The supplier is a non-emissions-control enterprise engaged in clean energy projects, while the manufacturer is classified into three types: a clean, a relatively clean, and an unclean firm. We analyse the impacts of the price and offset rate of CCER quotas on firms’ emissions reductions. We find that when the price of CCER quotas is lower than the price of Chinese Emissions Allowances (CEAs): (1) for both clean and unclean manufacturers, with increasing CCER offset rate (quota price), technical emissions reduction decreases (increases). (2) The incentive for the relatively clean manufacturer to reduce emissions is not affected by other extraneous factors. When the prices of CCER quotas and CEAs are uncertain, we find that (1) the technology abatement decisions of the three types of manufacturer are consistent and the corresponding CCER suppliers price their CCER quotas in the same way. (2) When the proportion of CCER quotas purchased by the manufacturer increases, the unit technical emissions reduction increases. Confirming that introduction of the CCER scheme can reduce carbon emissions, our findings provide theoretical guidance for suppliers to make pricing decisions on CCER quotas and for manufacturers to make technical emissions reduction decisions.</jats:p>",

However, the necessity to conform to a firm's own industry CSR norm is overlooked. Conforming to one's industry CSR norm—a herding behavior known as <jats:italic>CSR conformity</jats:italic>—ensures firm in‐group legitimacy and preserves internal resources for core business activities. On the other hand, deviating from industry norms sets a firm apart from its peers, making the firm more appealing to supply chain partners. Motivated by this dilemma, this study draws on middle‐status conformity theory and explores how a firm's network prominence determines its CSR conformity. Panel data analyses of 1650 firm‐year observations reveal an inverse U‐shaped relationship between firm network prominence and its CSR conformity, indicating that firms with a mid‐level network prominence engage in higher CSR conformity. However, the inverse U is flattened when a firm's supply chain partners (and their respective industries) share similar CSR standards, suggesting that a firm can only prioritize its own industry CSR norms if its supply chain partners share a compatible CSR standard. These findings highlight the importance of understanding CSR from an organizational conformity perspective, especially in the context of supply chain network.</jats:p>",

While food shortages persisted, the Czechoslovak authorities had to deal with a situation in which food rationing laws had lost some of their power to distinguish between the legal and the criminal. Moreover, collective ideas about what was right and wrong, about the victims and perpetrators of food profiteering, and of whom to punish and how, varied according to the different social and ethnic affiliations of the population. Political instrumentalization of such ideas jeopardized the postwar consolidation based on the promise of a better future. Thus, the introduction of food profiteering courts with lay judges was an attempt to institutionalize conflicts over food profiteering and to reduce the impacts of the atomization of society until the economic situation improved.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, there is always a serious challenge for environmental issues and the impact on pastures and wildlife due to the polluting nature of this industry. In addition, considering the situation in which the amount of consumption under disruptions makes the supply chain of steel inefficient, it is necessary to design a model that is close to the real world. In this study, to obtain the optimum number and location of steel factories, material flow, and considering the sustainability approach, we design a robust three-level supply chain network for the steel industry, taking into account the sustainability approach including three objective functions. The first objective function aims to minimize logistics and production costs, the second objective function maximizes the quality score of the final selected location, and the third objective function is proposed to maximize the efficiency of product production lines. In this study, a scenario-based robust optimization model is applied to overcome the uncertainty of the proposed model. Furthermore, to incorporate the score of location into the third objective function, a decision-making method based on the sustainability approach is used.

This involves forecasting the anticipated quantity of goods or services that customers will purchase and seamlessly integrating this insight into the overall supply chain management. The primary goal is to synchronize production, procurement, and distribution activities with expected demand, thereby optimizing inventory costs, minimizing instances of under stocking or overstocking, reducing waste, and ultimately enhancing overall supply chain efficiency. The emphasis is on leveraging advanced technologies, including deep learning techniques such as CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, GRU, and machine learning techniques like Linear Regression and XGBoost, to achieve accurate predictions. By implementing these algorithms, businesses can construct a robust forecasting system capable of monitoring changes in demand and aligning supply accordingly. This proactive approach empowers retailers to enhance their inventory and planning efficiency, ultimately contributing to increased customer satisfaction.\nKEY WORDS: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, XG Boost, Linear Regression, CNN, LSTM, CNN+LSTM, GRU</jats:p>"

Existing vehicle reposition techniques often treat drivers as homogeneous agents and relocate them deterministically, assuming compliance with the reposition. In this paper, we consider a more realistic and driver-centric scenario where drivers have unique cruising preferences and can decide whether to take the recommendation or not on their own. We propose i-Rebalance, a personalized vehicle reposition technique with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). i-Rebalance estimates drivers' decisions on accepting reposition recommendations through an on-field user study involving 99 real drivers. To optimize supply-demand balance and enhance preference satisfaction simultaneously, i-Rebalance has a sequential reposition strategy with dual DRL agents: Grid Agent to determine the reposition order of idle vehicles, and Vehicle Agent to provide personalized recommendations to each vehicle in the pre-defined order. This sequential learning strategy facilitates more effective policy training within a smaller action space compared to traditional joint-action methods. Evaluation of real-world trajectory data shows that i-Rebalance improves driver acceptance rate by 38.07% and total driver income by 9.97%.</jats:p>"

In response to the escalating complexity and volatility of supply chains, accurate demand forecasting is imperative for optimizing inventory, production scheduling, and overall operational efficiency. Traditional forecasting methods often struggle to capture the nonlinear relationships and intricate patterns inherent in supply chain data. Conversely, XGBoost offers a potent machine learning technique adept at handling nonlinear relationships and delivering robust predictions. The proposed framework involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation stages. Through a case study employing real-world supply chain data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the XGBoost classifier over traditional methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability. This study underscores XGBoost's potential as a valuable tool for demand forecasting in supply chain management, facilitating informed decision-making, optimized inventory management, cost reduction, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

The crucial aspect of PV systems is the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) process, which ensures that the installed PV system generates optimal energy output. A recent study has analyzed research related to PV systems supplying power to pump motors, and the results have successfully classified these systems into two main models: the two-stage and the single-stage. The two-stage model involves separate power tracking and load consumption control processes, while the single-stage model integrates power tracking and load consumption control into a single process. A comparative analysis of these two models has revealed that the two-stage model exhibits higher stability due to the separate power tracking and load consumption control processes. Aspects such as the MPPT process, motor power consumption, and the utilization of DC-link capacitors were examined in this study. The findings of this comparative study contribute valuable insights into the effectiveness and stability of two-stage and single-stage models in PV systems supplying power to motors without batteries. The results will significantly interest researchers and practitioners working in Photovoltaic systems and motor control, providing helpful information for designing and implementing more efficient and reliable PV systems.</jats:p>"

This movement presents challenges such as the proliferation of data and the scarcity of energy. This research presents a strategy for enhancing the service provision capabilities of WSN-aided IoT applications by combining mobile edge computation with wireless signal and control transmission. In order to reduce overall system energy consumption while maintaining data transmission rate and power needs, a new optimization problem integrating power allocation, CPU frequency, offloading weight factor, and energy harvesting is devised. The non-convex nature of the problem necessitates the development of a novel ideal solution group iterative process optimization model that divides the original problem into multiple subproblems, with each subproblem being optimized in turn. According to the results of simulations with a numerical model, our proposed method consumes considerably less energy than just the two benchmark methodologies.</p>",

The gating angles required for the 30 power switches on the MLI are optimized using both the genetic algorithm (GA) and the grey wolf optimizer (GWO), in which the optimal angles are determined through solving the trigonometric equations taken from Fourier analysis to target the minimum total harmonic distortion (THD) at the MLI output. A simulation model and an experimental prototype are developed for performance analysis and validation. The results demonstrate that the MLI is effectively able to produce 31 levels of three-phase AC output voltage, with the THD not exceeding 5% when loaded with a resistive load and a three-phase induction motor. The voltage and current are measured and recorded for different loads and operating conditions, including the amount of energy consumed by the load. The results of the frequency analysis demonstrate that most of the triple harmonics, which can harm the efficiency of the inverter, are cancelled.</jats:p>"

A porous medium model for predicting the flow resistance performance of the battery modules in a battery cabinet is developed. By studying the influence of rack shapes, the effects of heat exchanger arrangements and other parameters on the airflow and battery thermal distribution are analyzed. When applying a larger bottom air channel, the inlet flow uniformity of each battery cabin in the cabinet increases by 5%. Meanwhile, temperature standard deviation decreases by 0.18 while raising the flow rate from 3 m/s to 8 m/s, indicating better temperature uniformity in the battery cabin. When the charge–discharge ratio reaches 0.5 C, the temperature deviation of the entire cabinet significantly increases, reaching 8 K. Furthermore, a rack-level thermal management scheme is proposed to effectively reduce the thermal deviation of the container electric energy storage system and improve the overall temperature uniformity. Results reveal that the rack-level thermal management of the wavy cabinet in the electric storage container can effectively improve the thermal uniformity of the distributed battery cabin, and the overall thermal deviation is controlled within 1.0 K.</jats:p>"

As the corresponding input and output criteria are not always accurately measurable, we also introduce the fuzzy version of our proposed NDEA model and apply the proposed model in a case study involving 10 Iranian supply chains of Companies Producing Soft Drinks (CPSDs). The considered-three-echelon supply chains include suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors. Mathematical analysis proves that the MPSS of the considered supply chain can be decomposed as the sum of the MPSS values of the individual stages. Thus, the supply chain is overall MPSS if and only if it is MPSS in every three stages. The results of this study reveal that the Behnoush supply chain is overall MPSS in all three stages, including supplier, manufacturer, and distributor, for any α ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1}. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to measure the impact of each criterion on the entire supply chain performance. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the social and resilience criteria significantly impact the performance and ranking of supply chains. Finally, we discuss how to improve the sustainability and resilience of non-MPSS supply chains.</jats:p>",

Both membranes are of composite polyamide construction. The study included measuring malathion rejection using both pristine membranes and membranes exposed to a simulated secondary wastewater effluent foulant before and after two types of clean-in-place procedures. Across all conditions studied, malathion rejection ranged from 84 to 95% for the ESNA1-LF NF membrane and 77 to 94% for the ESPA2 RO membrane. Contact angle measurements were also collected for each membrane exposure condition. While the contact angle measurements indicated changes to the hydrophobicity of the selective layer of the membranes, they did not correlate to changes in the performance of malathion rejection. As expected, it was observed that malathion rejection improved with the introduction of foulant. Also, the clean-in-place procedures helped restore flux while maintaining malathion rejection.</jats:p>",

However,   as   in   the manufacturing  industry,  a  'new  order'  is  emerging  for  the  way  the construction  industry  works  today.  This  study  aims  to  present  the transformation of construction supply chains (CSCs) in Industry 4.0 by considering   each   supply   chain   stage   separately,   where   the   main purpose is to determine the criteria for the integration of the CSC with the  Industry  4.0  perspective.  A  literature  review  and  a  Delphi  study were   conducted,   and   thirteen   criteria   are   proposed   to   show   the integration of Industry 4.0 aspects and CSC stages. Furthermore, one of the  multi-criteria  decision-making  (MCDM)  methods,  the  Best-Worst method, is used to prioritize the criteria for guiding future implications during the transformation of construction supply chains. Among the six CSC stages, the design stage is the most important from the Industry 4.0 perspective.  In  addition,  client  collaboration  by  ICT  (BIM)  during  the design phase is the most important sub-factors’ overall rank. Although there is a limited number of studies on the CSC, there are no empirical studies addressing the current digital age approach. As a result, there is a   significant   gap   in   the   construction   literature,   and   a   thorough assessment  of  the  building  supply  chain  in  an  Industry  4.0  setting  is lacking.

If properly implemented, departments may be able to plan their procurement activities and has the potential to convert a procurement office from a mere reactive function into a fit for purpose office which will be responsive to the needs of its stakeholders in a more efficient and effective manner. Despite its glorious intensions, many government departments are still grappling with the implementation of DM function. The guiding question is: what are the obstacles preventing demand management functions from being implemented successfully?   To find answers, the study applies a qualitative research approach, and information is obtained from literature review. Conceptual analysis is considered to analyse the data. The study aims to demystify the concept and provide a practitioner’s perspective regarding the implementation of DM. The motivation of the study is that the findings may assist procurement officials on how to implement DM effectively serving the needs of SCM. It may also serve as springboard in the body of knowledge, thus being used as a point of reference and continue to illuminate public discourse in the public sector procurement environment.</jats:p>"

Different from the existing research on DAPFSP, this study considers that each component of the final product is composed of more than one part. Components are processed in a set of identical components manufacturing factories and are assembled into products in the assembly factory. The integration of manufacturing processes is an important objective of Industry 4.0. For solving this problem with the minimum makespan criterion, we introduce a three-level representation and a novel initialization method. To enhance the search ability of the proposed algorithms, we design three local search methods and two restart procedures according to characteristics of the problem. Then, by incorporating the problem specific knowledge with the social spider optimization algorithm (SSO), we propose three SSO variants: the SSO with hybrid local search strategies (HSSO), the HSSO with restart procedures (HSSOR), and the HSSOR with self-adaptive selection probability (HSSORP). Finally, 810 extended instances based on the famous instances are used to test the proposed algorithms. In most cases, HSSOR performs the best, with an average comparison metric value of 0.158% across three termination conditions, while the average comparison metric value for the best comparison method is 2.446%, which is 15.481 times that of HSSOR. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can solve the problem efficiently.</jats:p>"

Allocation method choices for co-products are generally insignificant. Prioritizing facility-level process specification in data collection for just 20% of facilities could reduce global uncertainty by 80%. This underscores the necessity of quantifying uncertainty in petrochemical greenhouse gas emissions globally and outlines priorities for improved reporting.

However, although the trade volume is minimal and the country is highly dependent on China, North Korea also engages in trade and its foreign trade has been on the rise after the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if the influx of luxury goods prohibited by sanctions against North Korea occurs through laundering in overseas markets, no states guarantee that it may free from involving an unintentional violation of sanctions.\r\nWhen doing business with a country that is conducting trade with North Korea, great care must be taken to ensure that the goods are not ultimately transferred to North Korea.

Sincere care must be taken not to become involved in destination issues. In addition, although the amount is small, advance preparation and inspection are required to avoid involvement in unsavory secondary sanctions related to North Korea, which is expanding trade with Vietnam, Argentina, Nigeria, Netherlands, Ethiopia, India, Bangladesh, Spain, and Hong Kong in addition to China.

It is assumed that different SC decision centres (DCs) make decisions based on mixed and integer linear programming models. Two main inputs feed the proposed MPM-SC-CP, a framework and associated methodology that support the integrated conceptual and analytical modeling of the SC-CP process in which several DCs make decisions according to spatio-temporal integration.

Single-shot HPM systems usually consist of pulsed magnetic systems. However, for repetitive HPM generation, a continuous magnetic field is required. To obtain a continuous high magnetic field in the required volume usually three solutions are worldwide preferred i.e., permanent magnet, DC electromagnet with cooling arrangements and superconductor-based magnetic coil. All these three systems are bulky, expensive and technologically demanding. In this paper, a novel power supply has been suggested that discharges a charged capacitor through a magnetic coil keeping the discharging current constant for a small period like hundreds of milliseconds to a second. An IGBT switch is used to discharge the capacitor1. The duty cycle of the IGBT switch is controlled using a current feedback signal from the hall sensor, thus keeping the current steady at a preset reference value. An experimental setup has been developed using a 300mF capacitor. A constant current up to 500A is achieved for 200mS. This system is scalable. For a longer duration of operation, more capacitor modules need to be added. Details of design, development and experimental results are presented in this paper.</jats:p>"

Semi-structured interviews were then conducted with 10 industry experts to derive the solutions to manage these tensions from an Industry 5.0 perspective to achieve the full benefits of AM. This study expands paradox theory into the AM literature and provides a novel ‘both/and’ perspective (i.e. a pluralistic rather than a dualistic perspective) to look at emerging tensions encountered while implementing AM in the healthcare sector. This perspective will help decision-makers realise that these tensions can be managed over time to turn them into creative, rather than destructive, forces.</jats:p>"

In recent years, the linear economic model (“take-use-and-throw” approach) has been replaced by a circular approach, emphasizing the sustainable use and recovery of EW. The development of innovative protocols, such as Best Available Techniques (BATs), which aim at the technological and process improvement of more sustainable mining activities and at the production of renewable, highly performing green materials, has led to technological advancements, expertise in sustainability, and a reduced ecological footprint, potentially causing positive economic and social impacts and reducing environmental ones. Extractive waste and tailings, if suitably characterized, can be used to improve and make sustainable the works connected to the management of mining activities. The qualitative–quantitative characterization of EW is essential for subsequent reuse and for assessing the risk to human health and the extent of environmental impacts in the various matrices. The application areas vary according to the type of waste and mining tailings, the morphological characteristics of the deposits, and the geological, geomorphological, and logistic context of the area. Integrated protocols for sustainable EW exploitation and positive impacts on the economic, environmental, and technological/social level are analyzed. The present paper aims at providing an overview of challenges and potentialities connected to extractive waste (EW) management and potential exploitation to recover raw materials (RM), critical raw materials (CRM), and secondary raw materials (SRM).</jats:p>"

However, this expansion has resulted in drinking water shortages, which is a critical community's concern. The aim of this study was to determine households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water supply services in Adama, with factors influencing WTP. To quantify households’ WTP, a contingent valuation (CV) technique was used and data from 435 respondents was gathered through field surveys, KII, and HHs interviews. A binary logistic model was utilized to examine variables that have a significant impact on households’ WTP. The analysis revealed several independent variables, such as gender, age, marital status, education level, and monthly income, additionally, water quantity, quality, availability, and affordability. The study found that 39.77 and 26.21% of residents of the city were dissatisfied with the quality and quantity of available water supply, respectively. The study discovered that 92% of households were willing to pay an additional $7.26 USD above their average monthly water cost of $3.58 USD to improve water delivery services. Factors that influence households’ WTP for improved water supply services should be considered. The study's findings can help legislators and water supply companies to design sustainable projects that meet community needs.</jats:p>",

We set game models considering three power structures: the port dominant (port-led Stackelberg game), the ship dominant (ship-led Stackelberg game), and the port and ship on the same footing (Nash game). We compare the performances of different technologies. It is shown that, when customer low-carbon preference and carbon tax are both low, LSFO is the appropriate choice from the supply chain’s profit perspective, SP is preferred from the emission control perspective, and LSFO is preferred from the social welfare perspective. However, when customers’ low-carbon preferences, carbon tax, and environmental concerns are all low or all high, LSFO should be adopted from the view of social welfare. The profits and carbon emissions of the supply chain in the Nash game are higher than those in the Stackelberg game. While the environmental concern is low, the social welfare of the supply chain in the Nash game is greater than that in the Stackelberg game. Otherwise, it is less than that in the Stackelberg game. The obtained results can help governments formulate policies and ships make emission reduction technology decisions according to their own interests.</jats:p>"

The method is to select a capacitor connected in parallel to the induction coil and tune the correct value of the inverter frequency to the induction heating circuit resonant frequency. The proposed method can be used for heating work loads with an energy‐saving purpose in induction heating applications. The switching frequency of the single‐phase full‐bridge inverter is variable so that the inverter frequency can be matched with the coil and parallel‐connected capacitor (RLC tank circuit) resonant frequencies. To demonstrate the feasibility of the load‐matching technique proposed, we experimented with two types of loads that were both stainless steel vessel containers with almost similar size and dimensions but different magnetic properties. We conducted experiments based on the proposed technique and obtained satisfactory results that supported our synopsis. The methods used to collect and analyze the data were carefully chosen and have been described in the methodology section of the research paper.</jats:p>",

Moreover, in batch cultures, the gas supply apparatus enabled substantial improvements in microbial growth, maintaining exponential growth even at larger working volumes. Compared to the existing system, an increase in final cell mass by a factor of 3.4‐fold was observed when utilizing 20% of the flask's volume, and a remarkable 9‐fold increase was achieved when using 60%. Furthermore, the gas supply apparatus ensured consistent oxygen supply and efficient gas exchange within the flask, overcoming challenges associated with low working volumes. This approach offers a simple yet effective solution to enhance gas transfer in shake flask cultivation, bridging the gap between laboratory‐scale experiments and industrial fermenters.

This study explores the transformative role of digital technologies—such as IoT, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and real-time analytics—in modernizing ERP systems to enhance supply chain efficiency. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research analyzes primary data from industry stakeholders and secondary data from case studies to evaluate the impacts of digital transformation. Key findings reveal significant improvements in supply chain performance metrics, including reduced operational costs, better inventory management, and improved demand forecasting accuracy. This study also identifies the challenges of implementing digital ERP systems, such as cost barriers and technological integration issues, and proposes a framework for effective adoption.

We develop a supply chain model where a platform outsources production of its private label product to a manufacturer, who also sells its national brand product through the platform. The platform must decide whether to acquire consumer quality preference information at a cost and share it with the manufacturer, while the manufacturer needs to choose between the reselling mode or the agency selling mode for its national brand product. The two driving effects (<jats:italic>competition‐intensification effect</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>mode differentiation effect</jats:italic>) are identified. Our findings show that the platform will acquire and share information when the acquisition cost is sufficiently low, leading to the “<jats:italic>competition‐intensification effect</jats:italic>.” Additionally, the manufacturer prefers the agency selling mode when cost‐quality efficiency is low, and the reselling mode otherwise, driven by the “<jats:italic>mode differentiation effect</jats:italic>.” In cases where information sharing is absent, the manufacturer is more likely to choose the agency selling mode. Interestingly, when the cost‐quality efficiency of the manufacturer's product is moderate and the information acquisition cost is low, the “<jats:italic>competition‐intensification effect</jats:italic>” and the “<jats:italic>mode differentiation effect</jats:italic>” offset each other, resulting in the expansion of the region where the manufacturer chooses the reselling mode due to the platform's information‐sharing strategy. As a result, this enhances a cooperative relationship between the manufacturer and the platform. We also derive the optimal supply chain strategy, providing insights into both the manufacturer's selling mode and the platform's information strategies in online retailing.</jats:p>",

However, little is known about how supply and utilization of precursors is coordinated at the interface of plant primary and specialized metabolism, limiting our ability to efficiently produce high levels of target specialized metabolites in plants. L-Tyrosine is an aromatic amino acid precursor of diverse plant natural products including betalain pigments, which are used as the major natural food red colorants and more recently a visual marker for plant transformation. Here, we studied the impact of enhanced L-tyrosine supply on the production of betalain pigments by expressing arogenate dehydrogenase (TyrA) from table beet (Beta vulgaris, BvTyrAα), which has relaxed feedback inhibition by L-tyrosine. Unexpectedly, betalain levels were reduced when BvTyrAα was coexpressed with the betalain pathway genes in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves; L-tyrosine and 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) levels were drastically elevated but not efficiently converted to betalains. An additional expression of L-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA), but not CYP76AD1 or cyclo-DOPA 5-O-glucosyltransferase, together with BvTyrAα and the betalain pathway, drastically enhanced betalain production, indicating that DODA is a major rate-limiting step of betalain biosynthesis in this system. Learning from this initial test and further debottlenecking the DODA step maximized betalain yield to an equivalent or higher level than that in table beet. Our data suggest that balancing between enhanced supply (“push”) and effective utilization (“pull”) of precursor by alleviating a bottleneck step is critical in successful plant synthetic biology to produce high levels of target compounds.</jats:p>",

SFSCs) during the period of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus provided a lesson which might be useful for perceiving the behaviour of farmers and local food systems in potential future crises caused by various endogenous or exogenous factors. A study based on a sample of 1081 beekeepers in Western Balkan countries shows how beekeepers involved in SFSCs perceived the influence of the pandemic on the growth of demand and sale of honey through these marketing channels. On the scale from 1 (no influence) to 7 (very strong influence), the average rating of 3.53 indicated a weak to moderate influence, which was fairly consistent across the countries of this region. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney test determined that large-scale beekeepers, those in mountainous areas, those adding value to honey and beekeepers producing other bee products apart from honey stated that the pandemic had a stronger influence on the growth of demand and sale of honey through SFSCs. At the same time, a higher rating of the pandemic’s influence on sales growth was accompanied by greater limitations of beekeepers regarding the availability of family labour for selling honey, as well as by greater needs for digital marketing knowledge and skills. Binary logistic regression showed that the increase in beekeepers’ age led to the decreased rating of the influence of the pandemic on the growth of demand and sale of honey through SFSCs. It also showed that the influence rating rose with the increase in production capacity, adding value to honey and beekeepers’ needs for digital marketing knowledge and skills. The obtained results provide valuable knowledge about the potential response of SFSCs and involved producers to future crises and disruptions. It is primarily intended for policy makers, but also to practitioners and scientific and expert communities. All of them should respond proactively on behalf of society and prepare themselves for future challenges.</jats:p>",

However, integrating such methods in supply chain planning requires development efforts. In this regard, understanding user expectations is the first development step. This study scrutinizes the expectations of a data-driven forecasting method for perishable food. The intended development is a joint initiative of a consortium containing three perishable grocery handling firms. Besides planning expectations, the study identifies and ranks demand-sensing factors that can enable data-driven forecasting for food waste prevention. As the participating firms compete in the same region, horizontal collaboration implications are additionally explored in this context. Accordingly, the study extracts relevant performance measures parallelized to food waste. A two-round Delphi study is used to collect the expectations from a data-driven forecasting method. Individual semi-structured interviews with experts from the initiative firms are conducted in the first Delphi round. Based on the extracted propositions in each interview, industrial experts jointly readdressed and ranked the extracted propositions in the second Delphi round, i.e., focus group workshop. The results reveal that the perishability characteristic emerges as a common expectation in linking supply chain planning with data-driven forecasting. This empirical study contributes to the research on supply chain forecasting and addresses the pertinent aspects of developing data-driven approaches to prevent food waste.</jats:p>",

One of the main challenges is the presence of constraining load conditions, under which the train circulation variability, low-frequency harmonics and critical power transients can notably decrease the power quality and lead to instability. In order to address this, cascaded controllers based on resonant controllers are proposed to ensure the desired performance. Furthermore, balancing voltage algorithms are added to avoid stress phenomena and additional losses in the studied power conversion interface.

Results indicate KM processes (i.e., creation, sharing, utilization) significantly influence SCR, with collaborative innovation capability (CIC) mediating the relationship between KM and SCR. Interestingly, social media use positively moderates the relationship between knowledge sharing/utilization and CIC, while this effect is absent for the relationship between knowledge creation and CIC.

It is shown that most of the publications, the object of study of which are \"green\" structures, focus on the study of \"green\" roofs. It is shown that since 1981, the number of studies on green roofs has been steadily increasing: approximately 45% of articles focus on the benefits in terms of thermal impact and thermal insulation, 18% on rainwater drainage, 15% on air quality, 5% on the noise-absorbing properties of green roofs, and 17% on the costs of building and operating green roofs, recreational facilities, fire protection, and other related issues. The requirements and commonly used materials for a standard green roof are described, as well as the percentage of scientific publications, depending on the functions and layers of green roof construction involved. An analysis of the most cited scientific studies on the impact of green roof systems on wastewater quality was conducted. It is shown that the results of the studies presented in these publications indicate the need for further study of the impact of a \"green\" roof on the amount of pollution in the water flowing from its surface. It is emphasized that further research should focus on the structural layers of the roof (thickness and materials used), namely the thickness and types of substrate layers, as well as on the conditions of plant care (e.g., fertilization), especially on intensive green roofs. In addition, it should be studied and analyzed how the retention of rainwater by plants and the soil layer of a green roof affects the relative humidity of the air near the building during periods without rain. The most cited scientific studies on the reduction of air pollutants by means of green roofs are analyzed. It is concluded that future research should focus on the study of plant species that are well adapted to growing on roofs (in temperate climates) and most effectively carry out the process of photosynthesis, absorbing CO2 and releasing O2 into the atmosphere around the building. The article analyzes the most cited scientific publications on the noise-absorbing properties of green roofs. It is substantiated that it is necessary to maximize the percentage of green roofs implementation on all buildings and structures in the city so that green roofs can significantly affect the quality of the environment in urbanized areas.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change poses significant challenges to global food supply chains, impacting various facets of production, distribution, and consumption. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between climate change and food supply chain economics, focusing on its impacts, adaptations, and sustainability measures. Firstly, climate change disrupts agricultural production through extreme weather events, shifts in precipitation patterns, and changes in temperature, leading to reduced crop yields and quality. These impacts ripple through the entire food supply chain, affecting input costs, market prices, and food security. Consequently, stakeholders across the supply chain face heightened risks and uncertainties, necessitating adaptive strategies to mitigate losses and maintain resilience. Secondly, adaptation measures within food supply chains encompass a range of strategies aimed at minimizing climate-related risks and optimizing resource utilization. These may include adopting climate-resilient crop varieties, implementing precision agriculture techniques, enhancing water management practices, and diversifying sourcing and distribution channels. Moreover, investments in technology, infrastructure, and knowledge transfer play pivotal roles in enhancing adaptive capacities and fostering sustainability in the face of climate variability. Furthermore, ensuring the sustainability of food supply chains amidst climate change requires a multifaceted approach that integrates economic, social, and environmental considerations. Sustainable practices such as organic farming, agroforestry, and regenerative agriculture not only mitigate greenhouse gas emissions but also enhance ecosystem resilience and promote equitable access to resources. Moreover, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among stakeholders, including farmers, policymakers, researchers, and consumers, is essential for promoting innovation and driving transformative change towards more resilient and sustainable food systems. In conclusion, understanding the complex interplay between climate change and food supply chain economics is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate risks, enhance adaptation, and promote sustainability. By adopting a holistic approach that integrates scientific insights, technological innovations, and stakeholder engagement, the global community can work towards building more resilient and equitable food supply chains in a changing climate.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Climate Change, Food, Supply, Chain, Economics, Review.</jats:p>"

The BCR uses a 15 V/5 A transformer to lower the voltage so as not to overload the BCR components. Full control using four thyristors serves to supply voltage to the BCR, while the BCR serves to regulate battery charging. Forcing the battery to be charged at a constant voltage with the same current results in shorter battery life. Battery charging through the BCR is set to match the battery voltage, then allowing the BCR to control it by adjusting the phase voltage to 13.5 V for high voltage discharge (HVD) and 10.5 V for low voltage discharge (LVD). By using an IC Regulator combined with a relay as a voltage breaker for a fully charged battery, it will automatically disconnect to avoid overcharging the battery. Based on the performance test results of a fully controlled rectifier system using thyristors and BCR on a 12V/5Ah battery, the output voltage is as a fully controlled 12 V rectifier, the BCR switch can charge the internal battery in minutes with a current that varies between 2.1 A to 0.1 A.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This concept paper proposes the integration of accounting models with supply chain management in the aerospace industry as a strategic approach to enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in the United States. The aerospace sector faces numerous challenges, including complex supply chains, stringent regulatory requirements, and cost pressures. By combining accounting principles with supply chain management strategies, this approach aims to optimize operations, improve financial transparency, and foster collaboration among stakeholders. Key objectives of this initiative include streamlining financial processes, enhancing decision-making capabilities, and mitigating risks associated with supply chain disruptions. By leveraging accounting models such as activity-based costing, lean accounting, and performance measurement systems, organizations can gain insights into cost structures, identify inefficiencies, and allocate resources effectively across the supply chain. Moreover, integrating accounting with supply chain management enables real-time monitoring of financial performance metrics, enabling timely interventions and adjustments to achieve strategic goals. This approach also facilitates better coordination between finance and operations teams, leading to improved communication, alignment of objectives, and ultimately, enhanced organizational performance. In the context of the aerospace industry, where precision, reliability, and cost-efficiency are paramount, this integrated approach offers significant benefits. It enables companies to optimize inventory management, minimize waste, and identify opportunities for cost savings throughout the supply chain. Additionally, by fostering a culture of continuous improvement and data-driven decision-making, organizations can adapt more effectively to market dynamics and gain a competitive edge. This concept paper outlines the theoretical framework and practical implications of integrating accounting models with supply chain management in the aerospace industry. Through case studies, best practices, and implementation strategies, it provides a roadmap for organizations to embrace this strategic approach and realize its full potential in enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in the U.S. aerospace sector.</jats:p>"

The governments play a leading role but watershed residents who are the direct stakeholders are not given enough attention in the legislation and practice of WEC in most river basins. Thereupon, it is necessary to study the resident's willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA). Based on the field survey data of the Huangbai River Basin, the contingent valuation method, the Probit and Tobit models were used to explore the WTP and its influencing factors of residents in the basin. Additionally, parametric estimation methods were employed to estimate the payout level and willingness to accept (WTA) of residents in watersheds. Results show that 88.84% of the respondents intended to pay for WEC with an average price of 142.24 CNY per year. The crucial factors influencing WTP were environmental awareness, ecological compensation cognition and political outlook. In addition, attention to ecology and satisfaction with water quality are significantly related to their payment levels. Accordingly, the policy makers should balance WTP and basin economic level and explore the implementation of a comprehensive ecological compensation strategy.</jats:p>",

Using the peak ground acceleration (PGA) under four exceedance probabilities calculated via a probabilistic seismic hazard analysis method for China, the probability density function of PGA was obtained by fitting with the Cornell seismic hazard exceedance probability PGA function model. Combined with the seismic fragility function of the water supply system calculated on the basis of the empirical matrix of actual earthquake damage and the exposure of fixed assets, the expected seismic loss and expected loss rate models of the water supply system were established, and the classification standard with the expected seismic loss rate of the water supply system as the index was proposed. The seismic fragility of the water supply system was classified, and the exposure of the water supply system was analyzed. The total fixed assets in the Statistical Yearbook of Urban Water Supply, henceforth called Water Supply Yearbook, were taken as the exposure to earthquake in the region. The accuracy of the fragility model in this paper was verified through the actual earthquake damage losses in Deyang. Taking the water supply system of 720 cities in mainland China as an example, the distribution maps of expected seismic loss and expected loss rate were calculated and drawn. The expected loss rate model was verified by the key earthquake prevention areas in mainland China. The assessment model based on the expected loss and expected loss rate was taken as the seismic risk assessment model of water supply systems in mainland China.\n                    </jats:p>"

It specifically assesses the current state-of-the-art technology, economic policies, and the impact of hydrogen fuel and fuel-cell vehicles on decarbonisation efforts and economic growth, acknowledging the influence of consumer preferences, diesel prices, and technological advancements on market demand. While recognising the cost-competitiveness challenges these vehicles face, the research highlights the necessity of significant investments in infrastructure development. Methodologically, the study integrates economies of scale and technological learning rates to evaluate hydrogen fuel investment returns. Furthermore, this paper employs the Castalia-MBIE model for scenario analysis, revealing two key insights. First, it underscores the criticality of maintaining a favourable equilibrium between domestic and international production costs alongside hydrogen fuel consumption to bolster New Zealand's competitiveness on the global stage. Second, it highlights the pronounced vulnerability of fuel-cell electric vehicles to supply-side influences as compared to demand-related variables. These insights contribute scientifically to understanding the economic dynamics of hydrogen fuel adoption and its implications for New Zealand's transport sector.\n \nReceived: 18 July 2023 | Revised: 30 January 2024 | Accepted: 26 February 2024\n \nConflicts of Interest\n The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nThe data that support the findings of this study are openly available in the New Zealand Wind Energy Association at https://www.windenergy.org.nz/generation#:&amp;sim;:text=On%20an%20annual%20basis%2C%20New,the%20highest%20in%20the%20world.  \n \nAuthor Contribution Statement \nMingyue Selena Sheng: Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Data curation, Writing - review &amp; editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the first time in the work, systematic and comprehensive experimental studies of the influence of the service life of pipelines on the absorption of hydrogen by pipe steels, which is known to cause embrittlement of the metal, were carried out. In this regard, the microhardness of the structure increases sharply, and the crack resistance parameters of pipe steels also deteriorate. As an additional criterion for hydrogen exposure, the stress intensity factor K1C can be used, which characterizes the potential ability of a metal to resist brittle fracture. The curves of the temperature dependence of the K1C coefficient illustrate the change in the viscosity of steel caused by structural transformations during heat treatment and the subsequent effect of dissolved hydrogen on the metal structure during long-term operation of pipelines in corrosive and aggressive environments, in particular those used in water supply and drainage systems. It is known that the K1C coefficient is very sensitive to changes in the structure, that is, it is a local parameter of crack resistance that must be taken into account when designing and calculating pipeline structures. Additional studies established the dependence of the destruction of pipe steels of the 06G2BA brand, taking into account the preliminary stresses from 0.3σТ to 0.9σТ. Unstressed pipe steels are characterized by the highest resistance to destruction, that is, previous stresses of steel samples weaken the crack resistance of the metal. Additional studies of sulphide corrosion destruction according to the NACE methodology provided an opportunity to determine the susceptibility of pipe steels to corrosion destruction. Steels 06 G2BA and 08HMChА are characterized by the highest corrosion resistance.</jats:p>"

Through previous research, we have learned that the key challenge in the circular transformation of manufacturing firms is to encourage supply chain partners to collaborate and effectively participate in resource cycles. Drawing inspiration from social capital theory and resource‐based views, we explored how social capital effect sustainable performance through CSCM and the moderating effect of big data analytics capability (BDAC). We tested this by collecting data from 414 Chinese manufacturing firms. The results indicate that both internal and external social capital are positively correlated with CSCM. In addition, CSCM mediates the relationship between social capital and organizational environmental and social sustainability. The results also indicate that BDAC strengthen the impact of external social capital on CSCM, but the moderating effect on the relationship between internal social capital and CSCM is not significant. This essay advances the theory and practice of CSCM by offering fresh perspectives on how social capital influences sustainable performance of firms.</jats:p>",

To bridge this gap, we adopt the reductionist approach grounded from systems theory to systematically review literature. Our analysis highlights the integration of technologies in transportation, impacting ecosystems significantly. However, global progress on transportation 4.0 exhibits regional disparities.

This research investigates a two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP) approach which is developed and served as a valuable tool for analyzing uncertainties, optimizing operations, and managing risks in the fresh fruit industry, ultimately contributing to the sustainability and resilience of supply chains in the agricultural sector. A prototype is provided to illustrate the complex and dynamic nature of dragon fruit cultivation and consumption in Vietnam. Data on the selling prices of dragon fruit were collected from several sources between 2013 and 2022 in Binh Thuan Province, Vietnam. The results were obtained from the model by using three different approaches in order of their versatility and efficacy: (1) Scenario tree generation; (2) Sample average approximation; (3) Chance-constrained programming.</jats:p>"

The Binary Logistic Regression technique has been used to assess the opinions of garment workers as to whether their level of satisfaction increases by workers’ welfare facility interventions. The data were collected from compliant and export-oriented factories between July 2021 and August 2021 in three Upazilas-Savar Ashulia (Dhaka District) and Gazipur Sadar (Gazipur District) in Bangladesh. This study demonstrates that overtime facilities, medical facilities, safety measures, restroom facilities, lunchroom facilities, and childcare facilities can play a pivotal role in increasing the satisfaction level of the workers. Given the similar socio-economic and geographical backgrounds, this research can be applied to the garment manufacturing industries of other South Asian countries. It serves as a valuable tool for understanding workers' attitudes and beliefs about welfare provisions. By applying the findings of this study, one can better comprehend the needs of the workers in terms of various labor welfare motivational tools.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon contingency theory, which mandates that supply chain performance metrics should vary based on the supply chain strategy, the research methodology resulted in developing a survey instrument that has been subsequently tested in 45 large enterprises and analysed by Partial Least Square-Path Modelling using XLSTAT software v.2020.4. The results support the existing beliefs and suggest that financial and efficiency indicator sets are more applicable to the lean supply chain strategy, whereas customer service and flexibility indicator sets are more pertinent to the agile supply chain strategy. This research distinguishes itself, through its novelty, in validating an adaptable framework for supply chain performance metrics, acknowledging the necessity of developing a suitable supply chain performance system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The constant shortage of fresh water for drinking and municipal use in the Republic of Kalmykia has become critically acute recently. Both natural factors, i.e. increasing climate aridity, limited reserves of fresh surface and groundwater, lack of sufficiently long sections of large rivers with constant flow, and the deterioration of hydraulic structures are the reasons. The exploitation of groundwater in existing deposits has led to their depletion and deterioration, while large deposits of fresh and slightly brackish groundwater in the southern Caspian region cannot be used because the content of pollutants in them is rather high. Recovery of old and construction of new water pipelines from the Volga River requires permanent significant financial investments at the federal level. Therefore, recently a new way to increase the supply of fresh water suitable for drinking purposes, i.e. an artificial groundwater recharge (AGR), has been actively discussed. The article provides an actual assessment of water resources of the littlestudied surface runoff of the rivers of Kalmykia, considers the possibility and feasibility of creating infiltration basins to replenish groundwater reserves, and calculates the parameters and operating mode of five planned basins. The main source of fresh surface water in Kalmykia is the rivers of the Ergeni Upland. The average long-term flow from its eastern slope is estimated at 0,120 km3/year, from the western slope at 0,105 km3/year and from the southern slope at 0,045 km3/year. Trends in modern modification of the hydrological regime of rivers under the influence of climate change have been revealed, namely a decrease in annual runoff and its intra-annual redistribution with a reduction of spring floods, a slight increase in winter runoff and a leveling of summer low-water periods. Calculation of the operating mode of planned infiltration basins allowed us to draw the following conclusions: the maximum possible volume of total infiltration will be about 220 thousand m3/year, which is 36 times less than the presentday water intake from the Troitsk and Bayarninsky fields for public water supply; sufficiently efficient operation of pools is only possible with annual cleaning of accumulated silt deposits, otherwise the soil filtration coefficient will come down each year, resulting in the reduction of infiltration supply by dozens times. Thus, the AGR can only be a temporary measure to compensate for the subsidence of groundwater level until the reconstruction and construction of new water pipelines from the Volga River to supply the city of Elista and the surrounding area with drinking water of acceptable quality</jats:p>",

Thus, surveillance systems must use accurate and valid analytical methods to determine F concentration and, according to the literature, give preference to the ion-specific electrode (F- ISE) analysis. Aim: The objective of this study was to compare the accuracy of the ISE and SPADNS methods in the determination of the F concentration in the same water sample. Methods: Duplicate water samples were taken from 30 sampling sites in the municipality of Maringá, state of Paraná, monthly for 12 months, totaling 276 samples. An aliquot was analyzed by the FOP-UNICAMP Oral Biochemistry laboratory, using the F- ISE method, and the other one, by the SANEPAR laboratory in Maringá/PR, using the SPADNS method. Descriptive analysis and Pearson’s correlation test were applied, with a significant level of p&lt;0.05. Results: Results were expressed as ppm F (mg F/L), and a very strong positive correlation (r= 0.91; p&lt;0.001) was detected between the two methods of analysis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the determination of f luoride concentration in water can be made with accuracy by the SPADNS method, a standardized analysis protocol. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Light is a popular choice as an indoor energy source for Internet of Things (IoT) end devices. However, indoor light sources are intermittent, which can disrupt the operation of IoT end devices, potentially leading to safety concerns or inaccurate data. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop a long‐duration power supply for IoT end devices. The energy from ambient light is harnessed to charge a supercapacitor through an energy manager chip. This supercapacitor serves as the power source for IoT nodes when the ambient light is unavailable. Nevertheless, as the voltage of the supercapacitor drops below the operating threshold, the IoT end node will eventually shut down. This paper proposes a circuit that utilizes a Joule Thief circuit, booster converter, and capacitor stack‐up circuit to extract the remaining energy from the supercapacitor and boost the voltage, thereby extending the operational lifespan of IoT end nodes. Additionally, capacitor stack‐up circuits significantly enhance charging efficiency. PSpice design and simulations confirm circuit feasibility. High‐efficiency charging and long‐duration IoT nodes suggest replacing traditional batteries with supercapacitors, reducing environmental impact.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INTRODUCTION: Blockchain technology is being investigated as a viable solution due to the industry's growing requirement for accountability and traceability. This study describes a fresh method for tracking down medical products that makes use of a decentralised smart contract network set up on the Ethereum blockchain. In order to enable secure and auditable tracking of health products throughout their lifecycle, the suggested system, named \"HealthProductTraceability,\" makes use of the transparency and immutability of blockchain. \r\nOBJECTIVES: The system uses a \"Product\" struct to hold pertinent data such the product name, batch number, temperature, producer, and distributors. To quickly get product information depending on the batch number, a mapping is used. The use of tools to manufacture items, send them to distributors, and market them is one significant contribution of this research.By demanding validation tests, such as verifying that batch numbers are unique and exist before carrying out certain activities, these functions protect the integrity of the traceability system. \r\nMETHODS: In order to enable interested parties to track the product's travel and temperature changes, the system additionally emits events for product manufacture, distribution, and temperature adjustments. The suggested system is innovative because it can track the temperature of health items from beginning to end on a decentralised, open platform. \r\nRESULTS: By utilising blockchain technology, the system lessens reliance on centralised authorities, fosters stakeholder trust, and minimises the likelihood of fraud, forgery, and tampering in the supply chain for health products. The contract's architecture recognises some of the issues with blockchain technology, including scalability and privacy. By investigating solutions like sidechains, off-chain transactions, and enhancements to consensus methods, scalability issues are solved.\r\nCONCLUSION: In summary, the suggested HealthProductTraceability system offers a creative and practical solution to the traceability issues facing the health product sector. The solution provides improved transparency, security, and accountability by utilising blockchain technology, paving the path for a more dependable and trustworthy health product supply chain. To increase the system's usefulness and adoption in real-world circumstances, further research can investigate scalability and privacy issues.</jats:p>"

During the pandemic, the said regulatory body must ensure its efficiency and safety. AnyLogistix, a system software employed in Post Market Surveillance for vaccines in Norway, was discovered during the research process. This software has facilitated the efficient assessment and monitoring of vaccines in Norway. Consequently, this case study explores the potential benefits of implementing anyLogistix in the Philippines to enhance drug and vaccine cold chain management. The Grounded Theory was used to assess the readiness and acceptance of local companies and organizations responsible for managing cold chain facilities and vaccines in the Philippines, to pave the way for future advancements in the field. Ultimately, the acceptability of the comparative study validates the approval of stakeholders, cold chain facilities, and government regulatory agencies in using anyLogistix as an automated system to efficiently monitor the post-market surveillance in the downstream stages of the supply chain for vaccines spearheaded by the Food and Drug Administration-Philippines. This study conducted a survey among 14 expert panelists both male and female in which 8 out of 14 panelists expressed dissatisfaction with the current system of how the government responds to pandemic outbreaks, 10 out of 14 panelists were not familiar with anyLogistix, and 11 out of 14 panelists shows interest in using this Norwegian software to improve the efficiency in responding to vaccine supply management issues, therefore, anyLogistix could be a good development that the Food and Drug Administration could utilize.

Not only were they supposed to be the embodiment of the “national yearnings” of the formerly “oppressed nations” of the Habsburg Empire, but they were also meant to be more democratic and it was promised that their administrations would work better and their economies would flourish. In short, they were to be a decisive break with the imperial past. However, the new nation-states often could not deliver on these lofty promises, and, as a result, their legitimacy began to erode rather rapidly. In this context, the inability to quickly improve the food supply played an important role. In the Slovene part of Yugoslavia, the inadequate supply of basic foodstuffs, rationing, and increasing prices made the already volatile situation worse, as parts of the population began to grumble, protest, and yearn for the Habsburgs, looking across their northern and western borders. Police and court files, district captains’ reports, and various other sources indicate that after the proclamation of independence the mood of the population quickly soured, and that the legitimacy of the new state was often questioned.</jats:p>",

Within diverse industries worldwide, supply chains are experiencing accelerated reconfiguration, with one of the most notable transformations being the digitalization of supply chain operations. But the literature lacks empirical evidence about how digital transformation effectively contributes to it. Thus, this paper delves into the implications of the supply chain digital transformation (SCDT) and supply chain reconfigurability (SCR) on its overall performance. Cross-sectional data from 379 respondents in the machinery, electronics, and home appliance manufacturing industries were collected through a closed questionnaire. Utilizing a hybrid approach involving the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), this study employs a cross-validation of the conceptual model. Initially, the PLS-SEM is employed to unveil the direct impact of SCDT on supply chain performance (SCP), as well as the intermediary effect of SCR. Building on this foundation, the fsQCA method is further utilized to investigate the configuration paths that enable enterprises to achieve high SCP under the combined influence of SCR and SCDT. The research results affirm the significant influence of SCDT on SCP. Likewise, the findings highlight the crucial intermediary role of SCR between SCDT and SCP. Ultimately, three distinct configurations driving high supply chain performance are identified: technical, management, and flexible configurations, each playing a unique role.</jats:p>"

Second group of five human SCSGs was prepared and serially sliced for CD34 and mast cell tryptase immunostaining. The microscopic fields of two parts of the SCSGs were analyzed for the following quantifications: microvessel density (MVD), mast cell density (MCD), and ganglionic cell count and measurements. The mean number of CD34-positive microvessels in microscopic fields, the MVD, had a value of 83 for the upper parts, and 82.7 for the lower parts of SCSGs. The mean number of tryptase-positive mast cells in microscopic fields, the MCD, was 4.5 in the proximal parts, and 4.7 in the distal parts of SCSGs. The mean number of ganglionic neurons in microscopic fields was 19.5 in the proximal parts, and 19.8 in the distal parts of SCSGs. The density of CD34-positive microvessels, the density of tryptase-positive mast cells, and the density, mean diameters and mean areas of ganglionic neurons were not significantly different in two observed parts, upper and lower of the SCSGs. In conclusion, the distributions of microvessels, mast cells, and neurons in two parts of the SCSGs were uniform with no specific micromorphological variations, there is a homogenous vascular and cellular pattern within the SCSGs.</jats:p>"

We also identified each company’s characteristics: formation configuration (if the cooperative, publicly traded company, or other modality), capital stock, location, the average daily slaughter of pigs for export and sows per producer. We conclude that the organizations have concerns related to the food safety programs, as there are programs that seek transparency throughout the process in many supply chain stages.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p> Studies that relate the level of orientation to the export market with the occurrence or risk of corrupt and opportunistic behavior and the coordination mechanisms adopted may represent an interesting and important opportunity for studies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p> This study helps to understand the complexity of the Brazilian pork supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Nowadays, the adoption of digital technologies getting a significant pace. It has the potential to improve the existing dynamics of the food supply chains and improve its transparency. Many times, uncertainties prevail in the food supply chain performance systems, which cause amplification of risk. These uncertainties are due to a lack of product traceability mechanisms in the food supply chains. Hence, it becomes vital to harness the potential of digital technologies like the Internet of Things, Blockchain, and common digital platforms to improve the flow of information and products in the food supply chain. The presented work is aimed at assessing the impact of digital technologies on risk identification and its mitigation in the food supply chain dynamics. For the same, risks are assessed relative to its mitigation strategy by the two‐stage methodology of preference rating approach. Here, the impacts of risk under consideration are quantified relative to every risk mitigation strategy for a better depiction of the potential of digital transformation of the food supply chain. It yields the broadening of its implication perspectives at operational, strategic and tactical levels of the food supply chain and makes them future‐ready.</jats:p>",

The selection of the latter is an important task that has a crucial impact on the performance of the pharmacy sustainable supply chain. Studies, constituting a reference on the subject, have looked into the criteria for evaluating suppliers as well as the multidimensional aspect of the problem. The pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, and pharmaceutical companies must overcome the most common challenges to efficiently get patients the medicines they need. This paper looks at a multidimensional classification of suppliers of medical devices. First, the authors used the multi-criteria method of decision support AHP (analytics hierarchy process) for the choice of suppliers in the pharmacy with contradictory criteria. Subsequently, the authors developed a hybrid approach coupling the AHP method and the GP (goal programming) model to solve a problem dealing with the selection of suppliers in a sustainable supply chain under a set of constraints.</jats:p>",

Suppliers offer advance-cash-credit payments to retailers, while retailers provide customers with cash-credit payment options. In the current health-conscious consumer market, purchasing decisions are influenced not only by commodity prices but also by the freshness of products, particularly perishable goods. Growing awareness of climate change and the advent of carbon emission policies have raised concerns about the environmental costs of business transactions. This study focuses on perishable products whose demand is influenced by both price and freshness. It explores the adoption of various payment methods by suppliers and retailers, as well as the impact of carbon emission cap-and-trade policies or carbon tax policies on management and pricing strategies. Suitable inventory models are established to determine the optimal replenishment and pricing strategies for maximizing the current value of total profit. We illustrate that the current value of total profit demonstrates joint concavity concerning both the selling price and the replenishment time. Finally, we verify the proposed models using numerical examples and present the findings of sensitivity analyses.

Ein Fokus liegt dabei insbesondere auf jenen Firmen, die zu den Lieferketten kritischer Rohstoffe gehören, welche für verschiedene Industriezweige wie Energie und Hochtechnologie unerlässlich sind. Mit Blick auf unternehmerische Verantwortung und Forderungen nach nachhaltigen Praktiken entstand das EU-Projekt MaDiTraCe, das darauf abzielt, fortschrittliche Rückverfolgbarkeitslösungen zu implementieren. Durch einen multidisziplinären Ansatz sucht dieses Projekt, Technologien für die effektive Zertifizierung und Nachverfolgung von Mineralien von ihrem Ursprung bis zum Recycling zu entwickeln. Der Ansatz von MaDiTraCe beinhaltet die Kombination fortgeschrittener Technologien zur Materialrückverfolgbarkeit, wie einen mineralogisch-(isotopen)chemischen Material-Fingerabdruck und künstliche Kennzeichnung, sowie die Schaffung eines Zertifizierungssystems, das in einen digitalen Produkt-Pass mündet. Das Projekt konzentriert sich einerseits auf die Lieferketten von Magneten, Batterien, insbesondere in der Automobilindustrie und der nachhaltigen Stromerzeugung, und andererseits auf bestimmte kritische Rohstoffe: Lithium, Kobalt, natürlichen Graphit und Seltene Erden, mit einem besonderen Fokus auf Neodym. Es wird erwartet, dass MaDiTraCe eine signifikante Verbesserung in der Transparenz der Lieferketten bringen kann, was eine ethische und nachhaltige Beschaffung von Rohstoffen erleichtert.</jats:p>",

Then, we conduct 11 qualitative semistructured interviews with logging business owners/managers to understand better complex and interdependent logistics issues that negatively impact productivity and profitability in the upstream timber supply chain. Performing a comparative analysis of the systematic literature review results and interview findings, we propose a general conceptual framework that classifies 25 logistical challenges in three main areas. They are (1) supply chain issues, (2) company‐, and (3) industry‐specific issues. Finally, using an abductive reasoning approach, we generalize our findings by linking our conceptual framework to resource dependence theory, transaction cost economics theory, and carrier selection literature to develop propositions to guide future quantitative research efforts.</jats:p>",

Our panel suggest that the development of postwar Greece’s tobacco sector was largely determined by market forces rather than by state-led purchasing programs. However, market pressures impacted production and sales volume to varying degrees, depending on the tobacco varieties grown in different parts of the country. Given that tobacco was postwar Greece’s most important export crop, and that it was the object of considerable state support, the often-made claim that state interventionism has disincentivized the adaptation of the Greek agricultural sector to evolving markets needs to be revised.

Using a mathematical approach, these concepts can be described more quantitatively and accurately, allowing for a more in-depth analysis of the functions of demand and supply. To determine the components that influence changes in supply and demand, mathematical models such as linear regression and elasticity analysis are used. In addition, the study examines how price changes affect market balance and how the functioning of supply and demand can be influenced by things that come from outside, such as government policies and the global economic situation. Research results show that analysis of the function of supply and demand using mathematical models gives us a better understanding of market dynamics. For example, analysis of demand elasticity shows how sensitive consumers are to price changes, and analysis of supply shows how prepared producers are for price changes. Policymakers and market players can make more strategic and informational choices by knowing these mathematical relationships. The study found that mathematics improved the predictability and accuracy of economic analysis and provided essential tools for good decision-making in various economic contexts.</jats:p>"

Hence, the study done based on targets of gathering update information to examine factors affecting butter supply in the value chain and indicate optimal value addition channel for the districts. The study done at Kedidagamela districts of Kembata Tembaro zone and used cross sectional data from household survey of 101 households. The study applied multiple linear regression model and descriptive statistics for analysis. The study finding indicated that level of butter supply defined as function of agricultural and off-farm income earned, age of respondents, area of improved forage at farm land, number of cow owned and feeding and medication costs of dairy cow. The study identified the optimal value chain for producer that provokes the household to adopt value addition practise in making different products rather than selling fresh milks for consumers. The study points out that butter supply to market can be enhanced through promotion of improved forage cultivation, enabling producers to earn income from agricultural and none agricultural activities, reducing feeding and medication cost of cow rearing, owing more cows and obtain experience in production. The level of value added in dairy products and income of producers can be optimized in adopting value addition practices of daily products that experienced by more than two third households in the districts.</jats:p>"

Development and comprehensive substantiation of a pathogenetic model of chronic insufficiency of arterial blood supply (ischemia) of the limb in an experiment.  Materials and methods. The experimental study was conducted on 54 sexually mature male Wistar rats aged 6–8 months. Modeling of chronic insufficiency of arterial blood supply to the limb in a laboratory animal was performed according to the developed method by ligation and excision of a section of the femoral artery with a length of at least 12 mm with limited mobility of the rat for 28 days after surgery. In all animals before surgery, as well as on 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56 and on the 70th day after surgery, the indicators of the nociceptive response threshold, changes in gait patterns, biochemical blood analysis, and histological examination of the thigh and lower leg muscles were evaluated.  Results. The experimental model of chronic arterial limb insufficiency was characterized by a persistent decrease in the threshold of nociceptive reaction with a decrease in the area and intensity of the paw print of the operated limb, irreversible structural restructuring of the capillary bed and a decrease in the number of blood vessels per muscle fiber in the ischemic skeletal muscles of the lower leg and thigh. These signs persisted for up to 70 days of observation. Restoration of motor activity of laboratory animals with arterial limb insufficiency has a positive effect on pain sensitivity indicators.  Conclusion. The developed modeling method forms the development of chronic arterial limb ischemia and makes it possible to reliably reproduce pathogenetic circulatory disorders of muscle tissue in an experiment. The use of a new modeling method will make it possible to reasonably assess possible ways to correct this pathology using various medical technologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Parallel pipeline projects can contribute to ensuring a safe and stable water supply and preventing or mitigating losses caused by water pipeline accidents. However, because these projects require a significant investment, feasibility tests are essential prior to their implementation. Considering the public nature of the water supply, the direct beneficiaries of the project and people from other regions can place value on such projects. Thus, this study estimates the value of parallel pipeline projects using the contingent valuation method (CVM) and the swing weighting technique. We constructed two contingent valuation surveys: one asking about the willingness to pay (WTP) for a parallel pipeline project within the respondent’s region and the other asking about the WTP for a project outside the region. The results show that the annual WTP per household for projects within and outside the region was 113,669 KRW (87.98 USD) and 5493 KRW (4.25 USD), respectively. These results indicate that the value perceived by people from outside the region should be considered. Additionally, the results from the swing weighting technique and WTP analysis show that the values that respondents generally consider important and those that can leverage the overall project value are distinct. This study’s results provide insights into the implementation of parallel pipeline projects in South Korea. Furthermore, this study’s analytical framework can be used for the valuation of other public infrastructure projects.</jats:p>"

The Environmental Service of Surabaya City (DLH), that in charge of watering city parks every day is affected because this watering process utilizes water from existing water channels as its source. During the El Nino period, it is feared that the water channels will dry up, resulting in insufficient water supply for watering. The solution then is to analyze the water supply fulfillment. The method used is calculating the planned rainfall discharge to determine the water level in the rainy season and the reliable discharge to determine the water level in the dry season. Comparing the two water levels, the difference in water levels is then used to calculate the required water discharge. Through this analysis, it is found that the water demand during the dry season increases by 130 percent, reaching 676,000 liters. However, the water level in the existing channels decreased to 0 meters in July. Besides, the availability of alternative water from WWTP reaches 846,700 liters, which is sufficient to fulfill the watering water demand.</jats:p>",

The overall LCOH for the green hydrogen supply chain is estimated at a highly competitive 6.826 USD/kg, demonstrating cost competitiveness when benchmarked against analogous studies. A sensitivity analysis highlights Oman’s potential for cost-effective investments in green hydrogen infrastructure, propelling the nation towards a sustainable energy future.

Especially, the Alpine region is characterised by many small and medium water supply systems (WSSs) having neither human resources nor time for advanced planning, requiring simple methods for estimating future development. Therefore, the aim of this work is to provide future projections of water demand, resource availability, and drinking water quality for an Alpine area based on simple approaches with minimal data requirements. As the results of the case study show, linear and polynomial regression with precipitation and temperature data can illustrate the temporal variation of system input and drinking water temperature with sufficient accuracy and is suitable for an estimation of future development. The groundwater modelling, however, requires the consideration of a non-linear term depending on the depth to obtain reasonable results. Due to the usage of open-access data and the easy approaches developed and applied, a good transferability to other case studies is expected which can provide stakeholders a first assessment of the future need for action.</jats:p>",

Combining the buyback contract with a partial credit guarantee (PCG) contract and trade credit (TC) contract, we propose two financing schemes, PCG-Buyback and TC-Buyback, to provide flexible financing services for a capital-constrained retailer and obtain equilibrium strategies of each supply chain member. Furthermore, for PCG-Buyback, this paper obtains a Pareto coordination frontier consisting of the credit guarantee coefficient and the buyback price at different initial capital levels, which is more flexible to achieve supply chain coordination. Finally, we analyze the manufacturer’s strategic choices of PCG-Buyback and TC-Buyback in terms of credit guarantee coefficient, buyback price, and financing rate. Our results show that PCG-Buyback is the optimal financing scheme for the manufacturer when both the credit guarantee coefficient and buyback price (or financing rate) are low; otherwise, TC-Buyback is the dominant strategy. This study explores how the risk-sharing mechanism combination of PCG and buyback contracts can provide a more flexible approach to supply chain coordination. Additionally, it highlights the significance of the manufacturer selecting a better financing scheme based on its individual characteristics.</jats:p>",

It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to invest in carbon emission abatement technologies and that of the seller to sell such products to consumers with green preferences. The study findings reveal that (1) both monetary and symbolic incentives can contribute to reducing carbon emissions but the choice between them depends on the trade‐off between the cost‐sharing ratio and the market interest rate; (2) implementing a hybrid policy could crowd‐out carbon emission effects; and (3) the manufacturer may maximize his profits under a hybrid policy, but the seller may struggle to cover his expenses, which could hinder effective collaboration within the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the optimal strategies and the profits under centralized and decentralized modes are given by applying the optimal control theory, and the comparative analyses are carried out. Subsequently, in order to coordinate the platform supply chain, a combined contract including a two-part tariff scheme and a promotion cost sharing scheme is designed. Finally, the effects of system parameters on equilibrium strategies and coordination contract are analyzed. The results show that the respective decisions of the manufacturer and the e-commerce platform as well as the total profit of the supply chain are higher under centralized mode. Moreover, within the feasible region, the combined contract not only achieves channel coordination but also improves the economic situations of channel members. It can be also observed that the coordination capacity of the proposed contract reduces with an increase in the memory parameter and improves with an increase in parameters such as the effectiveness of the Big Data marketing and the effectiveness of the reference promotion effect.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to describe the strawberry supply chain system and analyze its efficiency level at Lumbung Stroberi, and evaluate supplier selection based on the supply chain performance efficiency results. The respondents of this study were five partner farmers who supplied Lumbung Stroberi and were interviewed directly using questionnaires. Data analysis was conducted using two methods, namely descriptive analysis and quantitative analysis using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model approach. The study’s findings revealed the occurrence of supply chain activities from suppliers to Lumbung Stroberi and the efficiency level of the strawberry supply chain, with three suppliers operating efficiently. This supplier selection based on supply chain performance efficiency results is crucial evaluation for maintaining the efficient suppliers and improving the inefficient ones.</jats:p>",

In addition, the state-space matrix of the wind turbine system has yet to be fully represented. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-signal modeling of GFWT and a method for identifying the stabilization region of a system with variable parameters. First, small-signal modeling of a GFWT based on virtual synchronous generator control is developed. Second, the bialternate sum matrix approach is used to determine the system stabilization region. The system matrix with multiple variable parameters is first decomposed into the sum of several matrices in this paper. Furthermore, the rotor-side generator control is simplified. It can reduce the dimensionality of the system matrix model. Finally, the simulation shows that the proposed method for determining the stabilization region of the variable system is accurate.</jats:p>"

Future climate data derived from obsolete climate models, featuring diminished accuracy, less-refined spatial resolution, and a limited range of climate scenarios compared to more recent models, are still in use. In this paper, a morphing-based approach is proposed for generating future scenarios, incorporating the interdependence of power generation among multiple wind and photovoltaic farms using copula theory. The K-means method was employed for scenario generation. The results of our study indicate that the average annual variations in dry-bulb temperature (DBT), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), and wind speed (WS) are projected to increase by approximately 0.4 to 1.9 °C, 7.5 to 20.4 W/m2, and 0.3 to 1.7 m/s, respectively, in the forthcoming scenarios of the four considered Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5).

We use a variant of mixed-effects discontinuous growth modeling (DGM) to test EST propositions related to initial and longer-term changes associated with implementing the monitoring system. Results indicate that while the new sustainability monitoring system is effective in reducing within-unit energy consumption on average, there are significant differences in change magnitude between units. The magnitude of change during the pre-post phase was related to between-unit differences in event duration, timing, criticality, and disruption. Longer-term change patterns were related to between-unit differences in managerial criticality behaviors. The results empirically validate several of EST’s core propositions and provide an illustration of how DGM can be modified to study events that vary in onset and duration across entities. </jats:p>",

Most engineers use an S curve to estimate the relationship between the execution time variables and the financial resources available for construction. Mathematically speaking, the functions that can be used for said estimation are those that pass through the origin of the Cartesian plane, given that at the initial time of the project the cost used is zero, they are also increasing and upon reaching the estimated execution time it is expected to have used the total amount assigned for the work. This investigation began in 2019 where the forms of several executed water supply systems were taken and with this data, the planning curve was modeled with a logistic equation adjusted with least squares and validated with new projects to analyze its effectiveness. Now in 2023, data from new projects is added and a new model was made based on the Gompertz curve that has a graph similar to the logistic curve, but with the difference that the curvature at the beginning and end of the time interval it is not always the same, as is the case with the logistic equation model, and it is expected that this characteristic will improve the approximation to the real execution curve of the project. It is concluded that the Gompertz model is indeed better than the logistic equation model for this type of approach and a tool is presented that is used for decision making.</jats:p>",

Enhancements in the observed emission are common, typically lasting 1–3 months, such that the average flux of material from Io is determined by the enhancements, not any quiescent state. The enhancements are not seen at periodicities associated with modulation in solar insolation of Io's surface, thus physical process(es) other than insolation‐driven sublimation must ultimately drive the bulk of Io's atmospheric escape. We suggest that geologic activity, likely involving volcanic plumes, drives escape.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We have combined the theory of bulk dynamics and the agronomic requirements of precision sowing with the aim of resolving the technical problems of poor seed mobility and the difficulty in controlling suction posture, which leads to an increase in the leakage rate and a reduction in seed qualification index scores. In this study, a vibrationally tuned directional seed supply method and system are proposed. We carried out a force analysis of seeds, constructed kinematic equations for seeds and seed boxes to specify the state of the seed motion, and determined the structural parameters and the range of structural parameters that affect the seed suction posture. In addition, we coupled the ADAMS-EDEM simulation of the motion process of the seed and seed boxes and analyzed the vibrational tuning process of the seeds and the angle of inclination of the bottom surface of the seed box. The speed of the eccentric wheel and the eccentric distance were used as test factors. Three-factor and three-level Box–Behnken central combination testing with a single-grain rate, multiple-grain rate, and cavity rate were used as response indicators. Mathematical models were obtained between the experimental factors and the response indicators. Multi-objective optimization of mathematical regression models was carried out with Design-Expert 10.0.4 software. The optimal parameter combination obtained was a tilt angle of 14.27°, an eccentric wheel speed of 4.48 rad/s, and an eccentricity of 1.94 mm. The rate of single grains was 90.75%, the rate of multiple grains was 3.63%, and the rate of cavities was 5.62%. In bench performance tests, using an angle of inclination of 14°, the speed of the eccentric wheel was 4.50 rad/s and the eccentricity was 2 mm. The mean value of the single-grain rate was 89.28%, the mean value of the multiple-grain rate was 3.89%, and the mean value of the cavity rate was 6.83%. The test error was within permissible limits, and reliable results were achieved for parameter optimization. The results met the technical requirements for precision sowing. The results of the study can provide academic references for theoretical research on the methodology of posturing and directional seed supply. They can also provide ideas for the design and development of seed supply systems for precision sowing machinery.</jats:p>"

This study used data from the National Survey of House Price Trends (Korea Real Estate Board) and MOLIT Statistics System (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport) for the period 2013–2021. The main findings of the analysis are as follows. In terms of a provider, publicly rented housings contribute more to price stabilization than privately rented, and in terms of a supply method, purchased-rented housings are better in price stabilization than constructed-rented housings. In terms of renting types, price stabilization effect is strongest in public purchase followed by public construction and private purchase. However, private construction is more likely to drive up prices. This suggests that rather than focusing solely on increasing inventory, rental housing supply policies should include both legal and institutional support and regulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intercropping legumes with cereals can lead to increased overall yield and optimize the utilization of resources such as water and nutrients, thus enhancing agricultural efficiency. Legumes possess the unique ability to acquire nitrogen (N) through both N2 fixation and from the available N in the soil. However, soil N can diminish the N2 fixation capacity of legumes. It is postulated that in intercropping, legumes uptake N mainly through N2 fixation, leaving more soil N available for cereals. The latter, in turn, has larger root systems, allowing it to explore greater soil volume and absorb more N, mitigating its adverse effects on N2 fixation in legumes. The goal of this study was to evaluate how the supply of N affects the intercropping of faba beans (Vicia faba L.) and peas (Pisum sativum L.) with wheat under varying plant densities and N levels. We measured photosynthetic traits, biomass production, the proportion of N derived from air (%Ndfa) in the shoot of the legumes, the N transferred to the wheat, and the land equivalent ratio (LER). The results revealed a positive correlation between soil N levels and the CO2 assimilation rate (An), chlorophyll content, and N balance index (NBI) in wheat. However, no significant effect was observed in legumes as soil N levels increased. Transpiration (E) increased in wheat intercropped with legumes, while stomatal conductance (gs) increased with N addition in all crops. Water use efficiency (WUE) decreased in faba beans intercropped with wheat as N increased, but it showed no significant change in wheat or peas. The shoot dry matter of wheat increased with the addition of N; however, the two legume species showed no significant changes. N addition reduced the %Ndfa of both legume species, especially in monoculture, with peas being more sensitive than faba beans. The intercropping of wheat alleviated N2 fixation inhibition, especially at high wheat density and increased N transfer to wheat, particularly with peas. The LER was higher in the intercropping treatments, especially under limited N conditions. It is concluded that in the intercropping of wheat with legumes, the N2 fixation inhibition caused by soil N is effectively reduced, as well as there being a significant N transfer from the legume to the wheat, with both process contributing to increase LER.</jats:p>"

It can not only make the supply chain innovative but can also further ease resource consumption and lower pollution, thereby reducing carbon emissions. However, most current research remains focused on the concept of integrating circular economy supply chains (CESCs); few studies have carried out practical research in industry, and research addressing issues regarding the rubber recycling industry is even rarer. Therefore, this study refined the existing framework by screening out key factors that a CESC applies to remanufacturing products. This study conducted an expert questionnaire survey using the FDM to select key factors. Since the 30 respondents selected for this study are all experts in related fields, the reliability and stability of the method and results can be ensured. Meanwhile, this study adopted the fuzzy DEMATEL method to rank the importance of the five selected aspects and nineteen criteria and clarified cause-and-effect relationships between the criteria. The results show that important aspects, including “the circular business model” and “enhancing the resource value in the supply chain”, are both classified as cause groups; there are four main criteria that need to be highlighted, namely, “optimizing the production process”, “effectively tracking and recycling products”, “redesigning remanufactured rubber products”, and “improving resource efficiency”. Therefore, when related industries build CESCs to manufacture remanufactured products, these criteria need to be considered first. This study combined a CESC with remanufactured products, constructed a new framework to expand the related literature, and further analyzed the rubber industry and the underlying rubber recycling industry. Accordingly, related industries can refer to the new framework and key factors to develop production strategies for remanufactured products when implementing a CESC.</jats:p>"

Here we develop a disaster footprint analytical framework by integrating climate, epidemiological and hybrid input–output and computable general equilibrium global trade models to estimate the midcentury socioeconomic impacts of heat stress. We consider health costs related to heat exposure, the value of heat-induced labour productivity loss and indirect losses due to economic disruptions cascading through supply chains. Here we show that the global annual incremental gross domestic product loss increases exponentially from 0.03 ± 0.01 (SSP 245)–0.05 ± 0.03 (SSP 585) percentage points during 2030–2040 to 0.05 ± 0.01–0.15 ± 0.04 percentage points during 2050–2060. By 2060, the expected global economic losses reach a total of 0.6–4.6% with losses attributed to health loss (37–45%), labour productivity loss (18–37%) and indirect loss (12–43%) under different shared socioeconomic pathways. Small- and medium-sized developing countries suffer disproportionately from higher health loss in South-Central Africa (2.1 to 4.0 times above global average) and labour productivity loss in West Africa and Southeast Asia (2.0–3.3 times above global average). The supply-chain disruption effects are much more widespread with strong hit to those manufacturing-heavy countries such as China and the USA, leading to soaring economic losses of 2.7 ± 0.7% and 1.8 ± 0.5%, respectively.</jats:p>",

The objectives include analyzing supply chain management, marketing margins of catfish seed production, and identifying the challenges in production and marketing systems.\nStudy Design: This study used a quantitative approach with a questionnaire data collection method.\nPlace and Duration of Study: Samples were taken from four upazilas of Mymensingh district- Gouripur, Trishal, Mymensingh Sadar, and Muktagacha. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews between mid-September and mid-October in 2019.\nMethodology: The sample size was 120 including 30 catfish seed farmers, 30 paikers, 30 wholesalers, and 30 retailers. This study employed supply chain analysis, net return and net marketing margin analysis, and descriptive statistics.\nResults: The study found that retailers had the highest net marketing margin of 1664 Bangladeshi Taka (Tk.) (15.21 US Dollars) for 10 kg spawn, while paikers earned the highest margin of Tk. 11148 (101.93 US Dollars) for 100,000 pieces of fingerling. The annual net return per acre from spawn production in hatcheries was Tk. 9,469,097 (86580.71 US Dollars), and from fingerling production in nurseries was Tk. 455,783 (4167.45 US Dollars).\nConclusion: The research indicated that catfish seed farms with hatcheries were more profitable than those with nurseries. Hatchery owners, nursery owners, and traders faced significant problems in their operations, such as a lack of information on quality seed, higher input prices and price fluctuations, non-availability of various inputs, and poor communication systems. Based on the result, recommendations were made to support the development of catfish seed farms and traders as a promising sector in agribusiness.</jats:p>"

Many challenging tasks are existed in PV based standalone systems due to random changes in solar irradiances, load and it is absent during nighttime. Innovative controllers are necessary to uphold power quality in these systems. A battery pack is required in this standalone system since solar irradiance is unpredictable and in order to provide continuous stable power to electrical loads during no irradiance. Therefore, a battery bank is connected to a standalone unit via a DC to DC bidirectional circuit. The maximum power point tracking converter, in conjunction with the perturbed and observe algorithm, is employed to optimize the operation of the PV system and enhance the overall efficiency of the system. Neuro-Fuzzy controller based novel controller is designed for both inverter as well as bidirectional circuit to supply quality power to both single and three phase loads. Comprehensive findings have been showcased and accessed via hardware-in-loop testing on the OPAL-RT platform to optimize the suggested controller for a 1MW standalone system in various scenarios.

The contact methods are expensive, complex and difficult to implement. This paper proposes a non-contact method of fault identification in the single-phase induction motor operating in different conditions by analyzing doppler ultra-wide band (UWB) radar signal. The UWB radar generates a high frequency signal, which is transmitted on to the Induction motor form transmitter and software phase locked loop (SPLL) condition received signal from the receiver. The PLL implements as low pass filter, receives reflected signal from an induction motor along with high frequency noise. The received signal filtered to remove the high frequency noise and filtered output is analyzed to identify the different faults such as over voltage faults and under voltage faults when the motor is running with high, medium and low speed. The proposed non-invasive method has advantages compared to other such as the sensor’s sensitivity will not affect with motor temperature and accuracy will not change with position of the sensor and presence of other machines.</jats:p>"

While past studies found a positive relationship between GSCM and Corporate Environmental Performance (CEP), there is no evidence of either which are the green practices that improve CEP the most or the moderating roles that affect such relationship. In order to provide clarity as to which tools are key in leading to a stronger CEP, this study aims to examine how GSCM relates to CEP, under the effect of several moderating roles. To that end, 166 articles published between 2001 and 2023 were included in our meta‐analysis sample. Our central results reveal that the link between the variables is significantly positive, with investment recovery being the practice with the strongest impact. Moreover, it is confirmed that moderators do have an impact in this relationship. Practical implications are relevant for policy makers and upper management that is willing to introduce environmental thinking in their business strategy.</jats:p>",

During drilling in particular, the MWF is transported to the contact zone through internal cooling channels of the drilling tool. The MWF supply and its associated flow behaviour in the transfer from the outlet of the cooling channels to the contact zone have not been sufficiently investigated yet. Great potential is seen in the proper delivery of the MQL into the contact zone. This work aims to visualize and quantify the cooling lubricant supply into the cutting zone using the MQL technique. The visualization of the MQL application is made possible by high-speed shadowgraphic imaging. Detailed image processing is used to evaluate the resulting images. The developed evaluation routine allows for the assessment of the impact of the main process parameters such as the varying pressure of the aerosol generator and the cooling channel diameter. It is found that the oil leaves the cooling channels at the tip of the drill bit in the form of ligaments. An increase in pressure and cooling channel diameter leads to an increase in the frequency of oil ligament separation. Three main flow regimes are identified with different separation frequencies. Low inlet pressures result in intermittently dispersed droplets. The most upper pressure levels lead to an almost continuous dispersion of the oil. At the same time, the air and oil mass flow rates also increase.</jats:p>"

Implementing deforestation-free supply chains is of growing importance to importers and exporters but challenging due to the complexity of supply chains for agricultural commodities which are driving tropical deforestation. Monitoring tools are needed that alert companies of forest losses around their source farms. ForestMind has developed compliance monitoring tools for deforestation-free supply chains. The system delivers reports to companies based on automated satellite image analysis of forest loss around farms. We describe an algorithm based on the Python for Earth Observation (PyEO) package to deliver near-real-time forest alerts from Sentinel-2 imagery and machine learning. A Forest Analyst interprets the multi-layer raster analyst report and creates company reports for monitoring supply chains. We conclude that the ForestMind extension of PyEO with its hybrid change detection from a random forest model and NDVI differencing produces actionable farm-scale reports in support of the EU Deforestation Regulation. The user accuracy of the random forest model was 96.5% in Guatemala and 93.5% in Brazil. The system provides operational insights into forest loss around source farms in countries from which commodities are imported.</jats:p>"

Water from private wells is not required to be tested after the initial startup, and thus persons using these wells may experience negative health outcomes if their water is contaminated with waste-related pollutants including bacteria, nitrate or synthetic chemicals such as hexafluoropropylne oxide dimer acid and its ammonium salt (GenX). Water samples from 18 sites with OWTSs and groundwater wells were collected for nitrate, Escherichia coli (E. coli), total coliform, and GenX concentration analyses. Results showed that none of the 18 water supplies were positive for E. coli, nitrate concentrations were all below the maximum contaminant level of 10 mg L−1, and one well had 1 MPN 100 mL−1 of total coliform. However, GenX was detected in wastewater collected from all 18 septic tanks and 22% of the water supplies tested had concentrations that exceeded the health advisory levels for GenX. Water supplies with low concentrations of traditionally tested for pollutants (nitrate, E. coli) may still pose health risks due to elevated concentrations of emerging contaminants like GenX and thus more comprehensive and routine water testing is suggested for this and similar persistent compounds.</jats:p>",

In an increasing water demand scenario related to climate change, a water distribution system must ensure equal access to water for all users. In this context, a reliable short-term water demand forecasting system is crucial for reliable water management. However, despite the abundance of studies in the scientific literature, few examples highlight complete tools for providing such models to real water utilities and water managers. This study presents AI-Forecast, an innovative tool developed to predict water demand with state-of-the-art models. Such tool is based on the data-driven logic, and it is designed to provide a complete data-driven chain that starts from the data and arrives to the short-term water demand prediction. AI-Forecast can import data, properly manage them, and assess tasks like outlier detection and missing data imputation. Eventually, it can implement state-of-the-art forecasting models and provide the forecasts. The prediction is shown through an intuitive web interface, which is designed to highlight the major information related to the prediction accuracy. Although this tool does not provide a new prediction algorithm, it proposes a complete data-driven chain that is practically designed to take such models in practice to real water utilities.</jats:p>",

In this context, this paper introduces parameters such as blockchain unit variable cost, the level of blockchain technology investment, and consumer channel preference in two dual-channel supply chain systems dominated by fresh agricultural product manufacturers: online direct sales and distribution. It compares and analyzes pricing and channel selection strategies in both cases of not using and using blockchain. The research shows that when blockchain is used, manufacturer profits are higher in the direct sales model than in the distribution model. Traditional retailers’ profits are lower in the direct sales model than in the distribution model. Total supply chain profits are higher in the direct sales model than in the distribution model, and they exhibit an inverted \"U\" shape as the level of blockchain investment increases. In the online direct sales model, if the blockchain technology unit variable cost is within a certain threshold range, manufacturer profits, traditional retailer profits, and total supply chain profits are all higher than when blockchain technology is not used. In the online distribution model, when the blockchain variable cost and blockchain usage level meet certain conditions, manufacturers, traditional retailers, and online distributors all have higher profits when using blockchain technology than when not using it. This study provides theoretical guidance for the practical application of blockchain technology in dual-channel fresh agricultural product supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Failure to control crisis conditions leads to irreparable damage to many supply chains around the world, including blood supply chains (BSCs) as critical networks in the health system. Consequently, it significantly reduces the supply of blood and its products, as vital materials, and exerts detrimental effects on the activities of blood organizations and facilities as well as the health of individuals in society. In the present study, the proposed model seeks to simultaneously minimize the operating costs and the shortage of blood products with the aim of improving the attractiveness of blood centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, by optimizing the overall cost and the attractiveness of blood donation centers, an attractive efficient environment is provided. It can help to remove barriers to blood donation and improve blood health. To this end, the model takes certain strategies into account for the proper establishment of new local blood collection centers (BCCs) and mobile BCCs. It also arranges suitable transportation vehicles for the efficient transfer of blood products to the provincial centers of the candidate country and sets various incentive policies for blood donation. In order to minimize the costs of the entire supply chain network and maximize the attractiveness of the BCCs, a two-objective mathematical model is developed. It produces Pareto solutions using the <jats:inline-formula><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mi>ε</mi></math></jats:inline-formula>-constraint method. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach and the sensitivity of the corresponding parameters are analyzed through a practical case study. The obtained results represent that a growth in the attractiveness of blood centers induces a raise in the number of donors, and, consequently, the amount of the donated blood grows. This depends on more investment at all levels of the supply chain, including collection, production, storage, and transportation. Moreover, the performance and attractiveness of a BSC can be enhanced significantly if the number of collection centers and the amount of blood sent from the receiving centers to the demand nodes are increased.</jats:p>",

The author concludes that the special legislation on heat supply does not provide a procedure for terminating contractual relations between a heat supply organization and an entity that does not meet the heat network organization criteria, even if the parties had a contract for heat energy (heat carrier) transmission services before the criteria came into force. This situation leads to different interpretations of the procedure for applying the criteria and gives rise to disputes between heat supply organizations and heat network owners. The lack of a straightforward and unambiguous mechanism for applying the criteria in price zones has resulted in the necessity for heat supply organizations and heat network owners to defend their rights in court and administratively. Analysis of the general provisions of civil legislation indicates that contracts between heat supply organizations and heat network owners that do not meet the criteria are subject to termination due to impossibility of performance. Additionally, heat supply organizations have the right to verify that heat network owners comply with the heat network organization criteria. The author concludes that developing a mechanism of interaction between the parties is necessary when concluding and implementing contracts for heat energy (heat carrier) transmission services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a comprehensive overview of sustainable supply chain practices, focusing on innovative initiatives in both the United States (USA) and Africa. As the global community grapples with environmental challenges and seeks to create a more sustainable future, the supply chain industry plays a pivotal role in driving positive change. This review explores key sustainable supply chain practices, shedding light on the distinctive approaches taken by businesses in the USA and Africa. In the USA, sustainable supply chain practices are characterized by a growing emphasis on environmental responsibility, ethical sourcing, and corporate social responsibility. Companies are increasingly adopting eco-friendly logistics strategies, such as the use of renewable energy in transportation and distribution networks. The integration of advanced technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices and blockchain, is facilitating transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain, ensuring that sustainable practices are upheld from production to delivery. In contrast, Africa presents a unique landscape where sustainable supply chain practices are often influenced by socio-economic factors, resource constraints, and the need for inclusive development. Initiatives in Africa focus on promoting local sourcing, community engagement, and fair trade practices. Innovative approaches include the use of alternative and locally sourced materials, as well as the development of eco-friendly packaging solutions. Additionally, collaboration between businesses and local communities plays a significant role in fostering sustainable practices and creating a positive impact on the social and environmental aspects of the supply chain. This review also highlights challenges faced by both regions, such as regulatory frameworks, infrastructure limitations, and the need for capacity building. Despite these challenges, the growing recognition of sustainability as a critical business imperative is driving a paradigm shift in supply chain practices. This review contributes to the understanding of sustainable supply chain practices by examining innovations in both the USA and Africa. By identifying commonalities and distinctions, it offers insights that can inform global strategies for building resilient, environmentally conscious, and socially responsible supply chains in the pursuit of a sustainable future.&#x0D;\nKeywords:  Supply Chain, Innovation, USA, Africa, Sustainability.</jats:p>"

However, it faces various risks from internal and external environments that threaten its performance and stability. This paper proposes a novel framework and system for identifying and evaluating the main risks in the GSCAP from the perspective of agricultural enterprises. The framework combines social network analysis (SNA) and an improved technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. SNA is used to analyze the correlations and influences among different types of risks, while the improved TOPSIS method is used to rank the risks of different GSCAPs and identify the key risks in each supply chain. The framework and system are verified by a case study of CDYBIT, a leading platform of food safety big data service in China. The results show that the supermarket supply chain has the highest risk, followed by the group catering supply chain, and the five‐star hotel supply chain has the lowest risk. The main risk factors for each supply chain are also discussed, and some suggestions for risk management are provided. This paper contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive and systematic risk assessment framework and system for the GSCAP, which can help agricultural enterprises improve their risk awareness and response capabilities.</jats:p>",

Herein, an S-scheme CoSx/ZnS heterojunction with dual active sites is designed as an efficient N2 fixation photocatalyst. The CoSx/ZnS heterojunction exhibits a unique pocket-like nanostructure with small ZnS nanocrystals adhered on a single-hole CoSx hollow dodecahedron. Within the heterojunction, the electronic interaction between ZnS and CoSx creates electron-deficient Zn sites with enhanced N2 chemisorption and electron-sufficient Co sites with active hydrogen supply for N2 hydrogenation, cooperatively reducing the energy barrier for N2 activation. In combination with the promoted photogenerated electron-hole separation of the S-scheme heterojunction and facilitated mass transfer by the pocket-like nanostructure, an excellent N2 fixation performance with a high NH3 yield of 1175.37 μmol g−1 h−1 is achieved. This study provides new insights into the design of heterojunction photocatalysts for N2 fixation.</jats:p>",

While these states require water withdrawal permits, exemptions for grandfathered withdrawals that allow unregulated access to surface water are common. Such permit exemptions present a challenge to water supply management, as full utilization of allowable withdrawals by permit‐exempt users could pose risks to maintaining adequate water supplies for current and projected demand. This study used reported permit exemption data in Virginia to understand the extent, volume, and potential impact of permit‐exempt withdrawals on 30‐ and 90‐day low flows. The permit‐exempt withdrawal values used in this study were obtained from Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. Maximum permit‐exempt withdrawal volumes were significantly higher than projected future demands in permitted users. The impacts of these withdrawals on drought flows were compared with the impacts presented by climate change and demand growth. Widespread reduction in flows was observed with the “dry” future climate change scenario, while impacts were more localized in the exempt users and the demand growth scenarios. The impacts of exempt users exceeded the impact of climate change and demand growth scenarios in many regions during low‐flow periods. Therefore, more comprehensive water planning, policy and research is needed to address the impact of permit exemptions.</jats:p>",

In this study, we present measurements of dissolved silicon isotopes (δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si(OH)<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>) around the Laptev Sea and surface waters of the Eurasian shelves collected in October 2018 to document terrestrial silicon modifications on shelves and their contribution to the Arctic basin. Nitrogen was found to be depleted in surface waters and the limiting nutrient to primary production in the Laptev Sea, allowing excess silicon export to the central Arctic Ocean. Heavy δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si(OH)<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> in the water column was linked to the strong biological removal of DSi on shelves, enabled by vigorous N recycling. From isotopically constrained processes, we estimate that &gt;50% of the silicon from riverine inputs is removed within the Lena River delta and on the Laptev Sea shelf. Extrapolating this to major Siberian rivers, this leads to an export of 2.5 ± 0.8 kmol/s of riverine silicon through the Transpolar Drift. An updated isotopic budget of the Arctic Ocean reproduces the observed δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si(OH)<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> signatures out of the Arctic Ocean and underlines the importance of biological processes in modulating silicon export. Given that opal burial fluxes on Artic shelves are controlled by denitrification and N‐limitation, these processes are sensitive to ongoing climate change. As a consequence of higher riverine DSi inputs and shelf denitrification responding to productivity, it is inferred that silicon export from the Arctic Ocean could increase in the future, accompanied by lighter δ<jats:sup>30</jats:sup>Si(OH)<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> signatures.</jats:p>",

Esse fator agrava ainda mais a situação de acesso à água nas zonas rurais semiáridas, onde o abastecimento convencional é deficitário.\r\nMétodo: Foi realizada uma aplicação de questionários na comunidade, passando a conhecer as fontes de abastecimento de água, suas finalidades de uso, as demandas e a destinação final.\r\nResultados e Discussão: Devido à disponibilidade e à facilidade de acesso, a água armazenada no aluvião é a principal fonte de abastecimento da comunidade, e é utilizada preponderantemente em usos menos nobres. Para os usos mais nobres, muitos recorrem à água da chuva e aos carros pipas. A maioria da população destina o esgoto sanitário para fossas sépticas e para dispositivos de drenagem superficial do tipo sarjeta, que pela proximidade do aluvião traz uma situação preocupante.  \r\n Implicações da Pesquisa: Os resultados poderão ser utilizados para auxiliar no planejamento de ações para o fortalecimento de políticas públicas voltadas à gestão dos recursos hídricos que estão disponíveis na área de estudo.\r\n Originalidade/Valor: A pesquisa apresenta uma metodologia que auxilia no conhecimento das demandas, dos tipos de usos e das fontes alternativas de abastecimento de água, podendo ser útil para nortear outras pesquisas em comunidades rurais que se reúnem pesquisas científicas.</jats:p>"

NF1 patients are susceptible to the development of neurofibromas, including plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which occurs in about half of all cases. Plexiform neurofibroma are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors originating from Schwann cells after complete loss of neurofibromin; they can be debilitating and also transform into deadly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). Here, our data indicates that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) may be useful in the treatment of pNFs. We assessed the cytotoxicity of AgNPs using pNF cells and Schwann cells derived from the same NF1 patient. We found that AgNPs are selectively cytotoxic to pNF cells relative to isogenic Schwann cells. We then examined the role of neurofibromin expression on AgNP-mediated cytotoxicity; restoration of neurofibromin expression in pNF cells decreased sensitivity to AgNP, and knockdown of neurofibromin in isogenic Schwann cells increased sensitivity to AgNP, outlining a correlation between neurofibromin expression and AgNP-mediated cytotoxicity. AgNP was able to selectively remove pNF cells from a co-culture with patient-matched Schwann cells. Therefore, AgNPs represent a new approach for clinical management of NF1-associated pNF to address significant clinical need.</jats:p>"

Water loss is considered a leading factor of pericarp browning in litchi fruit. In this study, based on the distinct structure of litchi fruit, which is a special type of dry fruit with the aril as the edible part, the effects of water supply via pedicel (WSP) treatment on pericarp browning and the fruit quality of litchi were investigated. Compared with the packaging of the control fruit at 25 °C or 4 °C, the WSP treatment was found to significantly reduce pericarp browning and the decay of litchi fruit. The WSP-treated fruit had a higher L* value, total anthocyanin content, and pericarp water content, and the pericarp was thicker. The WSP treatment significantly suppressed the increase in the electrolyte leakage of the pericarp and maintained higher ascorbic acid (AA) contents in the aril. In addition, the WSP treatment was effective in reducing the activity and gene expression of browning-related genes Laccase (ADE/LAC) and Peroxidase (POD) during the storage period. In conclusion, the WSP treatment could be an effective method to delay pericarp browning and maintain the quality of harvested litchi fruit, and this further supports that litchi fruit has dry fruit characteristics.</jats:p>"

Firstly, based on the specific sales mode of the supply chain system and the logical relationship of inventory parameters, the corresponding dynamic model of the inventory system is established under reasonable assumptions, and relevant parameters are introduced to represent the impact of contingencies, and the dynamic model of inventory system under contingencies is established with the bullwhip effect. Then, the discrete sliding mode control (SOB-DSMC) based on the state observer is designed to compensate for the impact of emergencies on the supply chain inventory system adaptively while ensuring the stability of the system. Finally, based on market research and reasonable assumptions, simulation experiments are carried out. The simulation results show that the designed control system can better cope with emergencies in different situations, and can significantly improve the supply chain within 5 days after emergencies occur. The inventory situation of upstream and downstream enterprises in the system has reduced the maximum inventory fluctuations of manufacturers, distributors, and retailers by 77.13%, 60.67%, and 44.61% respectively, and fully restored to normal operation within 20 days, effectively solving the inventory backlog of upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain and out-of-stock issues. It can be seen that the SOB-DSMC method can guide the upstream enterprises in the supply chain to formulate reasonable production, shipping, and purchasing strategies, and provide theoretical reference and coping methods for the supply chain system to smoothly survive emergencies.</jats:p>",

In addition, in this paper, the modeling and control of the proposed converter are done, and a comparative evaluation among proposed converter with similar topologies is evaluated. A prototype of 1 kW, 144 to 400 V, is developed in laboratory to validate the theoretical evaluations of proposed converter. Besides that, the proposed converter is also evaluated under different dynamic condition, which illustrates the effectiveness of the converter.

The San Joaquin Valley, chronically affected for decades by groundwater overdraft and demand hardening from permanent crops and livestock wet forages, will necesitate substantial reductions in consumptive use via permanent irrigated land idling to meet sustainable groundwater regulation. We present a wide range of scenarios including trading, deficit irrigation and water supply augmentation along with their economic impacts to explore tradeoffs among alternatives. For the Cache Valley in Utah, environmental flow requirements to regulate levels in the Great Salt Lake may require upstream diversion reductions that will likely affect irrigated forages the most. We present varios crop choice scenarios and water exchange to find least cost alternatives considering downstream sectors such as livestock. The Mesilla Valley in New Mexico, supplied by sufarce water from the Rio Grande and supplemental pumping from the underliying aquifer system in dry years, may see an overall allocation reduction presenting challenges for their high value vegetable and tree crops. We examine the impact of potential groundwater regulation and markets to secure future water access for agriculture and competing sectors.&amp;#160;</jats:p>"

Based on the laboratory studies carried out, to identify the effect of the speed and amount of filling of brake cylinders on the calculated braking distance of freight rolling stock when using brake systems with two-pipe and single-pipe supply of a spare tank. These studies are aimed at improving the technical speed and safety of freight trains, as well as improving the efficiency of the braking system during cyclic braking, in order to reduce its depletion. Methods: analysis of the filling rate of the brake cylinders, in order to determine the time of preparation of the brakes for action, depending on the method of organizing the power supply of the brake system; comparison of the length of the preparatory and actual braking distance according to the method of speed intervals proposed in the Rules of traction calculations. It was also assumed that the train was braking to a complete stop on a straight horizontal section of the track, with air leaks from the brake cylinders throughout the train. Results: it was revealed that a two-pipe braking system allows to develop a significantly greater braking effect than a singlepipe braking system with a similar technical condition of the pneumatic train system. As a result, with the new method of powering the reserve tank, there is a significant reduction in the time required to prepare the brakes for action, as well as a reduction in the length of the full braking distance. Practical significance: it has been proven that the use of a new braking system will improve the efficiency of the braking system, which leads to a reduction in braking distance. This, in turn, will improve the safety and speed of trains along the sections, as well as increase the average weight of trains.</jats:p>",

Relevance: Is due to the need for rational use of fuel for the needs of energy generation in the settlements of the Arctic and the North. Due to the absence of year-round highways, the final cost of fuel and lubricants, taking into account delivery, can increase by 2.5 times, with delivery times up to 2.5 years. Goal – is to analyze the prospects for the introduction of a heat pumping unit with a source of low-potential ground heat in the conditions of the North and the Arctic on the example of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Research methods: applied thermophysical patterns, methods of comparison of calculation results and comparative analysis of the data obtained. Results of the work: freon was selected according to the requirements of the Montreal Protocol on the effect on the ozone layer and critical parameters of temperature and pressure. The cycle of operation of the heat pumping unit is calculated taking into account the heating temperature schedule of the hot coolant, the conversion coefficient of electricity is calculated. To increase the efficiency of the heat pumping unit, the possibility of installing an additional heat exchanger after the condenser for preheating freon before the compressor is proposed. The conversion coefficient of electricity at outdoor temperatures from –50 ° C to 8 ° C varies in the range from 0.9 to 3.2. It is concluded that in order to increase the reliability of heat supply, it is recommended to install peak hot water boilers for the maximum winter mode of heat supply operation. It is more expedient to operate a heat pumping unit in the autumn and spring periods.</jats:p>",

The novelty of our approach lies in utilizing edge computing devices to monitor real-time changes in road conditions and dynamically adjust delivery routes, thereby providing an effective solution for efficient and flexible logistics. Initially, we construct a mixed-integer programming model that minimizes the total cost under constraints such as customer destinations and time windows. Subsequently, in the cloud-edge collaborative mode, edge computing devices are utilized to collect real-time road conditions and transmit it to the cloud server. The cloud server comprehensively considers customer demand and road condition changes and employs adaptive genetic algorithms and A-star algorithms to adjust the delivery routes dynamically. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate that our approach can promptly respond to changes in customer demands and road conditions and flexibly plan the optimal delivery routes, thereby significantly reducing overall costs and enhancing customer satisfaction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The traditional multi-line laser calibration method relies primarily on calibrating the spatial plane equations of multiple laser lines and reconstructing the multi-line laser in three dimensions through the plane equation and camera parameters. In traditional methods, the multi-line laser is projected as a straight line by default, but in reality, the laser line projected by the multi-line laser is not a plane due to the Diffractive Optical Element (DOE). Instead, it is a surface with a certain curvature in space. During the production process, the multi-line laser experiences significant distortion because of the DOE projecting at a large angle. Consequently, if traditional methods are used, accurate calibration of the multi-line laser cannot be achieved. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new calibration algorithm for multi-line laser based on a spatial quadric equation. By calibrating the spatial quadric equation of the multi-line laser, the spatial characteristics of the laser can be accurately captured. The algorithm involves projecting a crossed 7-line laser onto a calibration plate and changing the position of the calibration plate while capturing images. This allows for obtaining the spatial three-dimensional coordinates of each laser line in the camera coordinate system. Next, spatial quadric equations are fitted for each laser line based on the three-dimensional coordinates. Finally, 3D reconstruction is performed using the quadratic surface parameters of the multi-line laser and camera parameters. The results from 3D reconstruction demonstrate that, compared to traditional laser calibration methods based on planes, the proposed algorithm achieves higher calibration accuracy. It also improves the number of successful binocular multi-line laser matches and overall accuracy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Periglacial debris flows boosted by strong earthquakes or climatic warming in alpine mountains play a crucial role in sediment delivery from hillslopes and downslope channels into rivers. Rapid and massive sediment supply to rivers by the debris flows has profoundly influenced the evolution of the alpine landscape. Nonetheless, there is a dearth of knowledge concerning the roles tectonic and climatic factors played in the intensified sediment erosion and transportation. In order to increase our awareness of the mass wasting processes and glacier changes, five debris flows that occurred at the Zelunglung catchment of the eastern syntaxis of the Himalayas since 1950 Assam earthquake are investigated in detail by field surveys and long-term remote sensing interpretation. Long-term seismic and meteorological data indicate that the four events of 1950–1984 were the legacies of the earthquake, and recent warming events drove the 2020 event. The transported sediment volume indexed with a non-vegetated area on the alluvial fan reduced by 91 % to a stable low level nearly 40 years after 1950. It is reasonable to hypothesize that tectonic and climatic factors alternately drive the sediment supplies caused by the debris flows. High concentrations of coarse grains, intense erosion, and extreme impact force of the 2020 debris flow raised concerns about the impacts of such excess sediment inputs on the downstream river evolution and infrastructure safety. In regard to the hydrometeorological conditions of the main river, the time to evacuate the transported coarse sediments is approximately two orders of magnitude of the recurrence period of periglacial debris flows.\n                        </jats:p>"

This disease has hurt the blood supply through the reduction of blood donation and the reduction of access to suitable collection facilities due to dysfunction. Considering the importance of the subject, the purpose of this paper is to design a two-level supply chain network for blood products with the approach of reducing costs and the rate of contagion under the conditions of epidemic outbreaks (COVID-19). After examining the solution methods for multilevel supply chain networks of blood products under the conditions of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, three exact solution methods, including LP-metric, an improved version of the augmented ε-constraint (AUGMECON2), and an improved weighted Chebyshev, are proposed. They are used to solve the model in small dimensions. In order to compare the methods in the obtained solutions, several numerical examples of different sizes are generated and solved. Then, using the statistical assumption test, the obtained results are compared in all numerical examples by Tukey’s technique. Also, the TOPSIS is applied to select the best method. Finally, in order to investigate the reaction of the objectives to the changes in the contagion probability parameter, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. The results emphasize that improving the performance of the blood supply chain (BSC) can lead to a reduction in BSC costs and improved service to patients. Also, the adaptation of different components of the BSC and regular coordination between them play an efficient role in controlling and improving this disease and reducing the costs of the BSC. Also, receiving the plasma product of recovered people from type (II) donors can play a vital role in reducing the percentage of disease transmission.</jats:p>",

The statistical characterisation of disturbances inserted into the power grid by nonlinear electrical devices is useful since operators are able to establish power quality limits and assess the residual capacity of networks for new smart installations, which may include a multitude of power electronic devices. Existing standards related to emission tests recommend using a power supply source in the measurement circuit with a nominal voltage parameter. However, the range of permissible variations of relevant supply voltage parameters may have an impact on conducted emissions. It can also be considered that the symptoms of supply voltage variations may manifest themselves differently depending on the equipment’s architecture and also the range of frequency observation with reference to harmonics and supraharmonics. The purpose of this study is to measure and analyze non-intentional conducted emissions injected into the power grid by lighting devices, methodically, by numbers of studies under different supply voltage conditions within two frequency bands. The emission is evaluated separately in two ranges: up to 2 kHz and 9-150 kHz. Obtained results show that the level of conducted emission introduced into the low voltage network by modern lighting sources like fluorescent and LED lamps varies with the supply voltage level compared to the emission generated in the nominal voltage level condition. Additionally, in the case of a spectrum of higher frequencies, some trends of shifting of the characteristic frequency bands are recorded. The potential of the obtained results is to complement the knowledge of the emission of modern lighting sources, which can be further used for digital models of these devices and to estimate the impact on the grid under real working conditions.</jats:p>"

Este trabajo tiene como objetivo presentar información sobre la matriz y la oferta energética del Estado de Santa Catarina. Se realizó una revisión narrativa mediante el análisis de informes publicados por el gobierno federal, organismos de distribución de energía y entidades que hayan realizado estudios en el área, así como publicaciones científicas (artículos y capítulos de libros) que describan el escenario investigado. Se utilizaron como bases de datos Google Académico y SciElo durante el período de junio de 2022 a marzo de 2023. Como resultados, se verificó que Santa Catarina posee diversas fuentes de energía que forman una sólida red energética, sin embargo, aún se requieren inversiones, interconexión entre las fuentes, equilibrio entre las diversas regiones del estado en lo que respecta a la infraestructura y calidad de la energía recibida para lograr una planificación energética adecuada y que promueva la justicia energética.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, the global population is also growing, such that by 2050, it is estimated to exceed ~ 9 billion. While most of this expansion in population is expected to occur in developing countries, in high-income countries there are also predicted changes in demographics, with major increases in the number of older people. There is a growing consensus that older people have a greater requirement for protein. With a larger and older population, global needs for protein are set to increase. This paper summarises the conclusions from a Rank Prize funded colloquium evaluating novel strategies to meet this increasing global protein need.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Grasping the interrelationship between the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ESs) and spatial scale characteristics is the foundation for effective ecological zoning management, which helps to realize a win–win situation for both ecological protection and economic development. This paper focuses on the following three real problems: mismatch in ES supply and demand evaluation, mechanical and subjective delineation of ecological zoning, and rough management strategies, and constructs a multi-scale ecological zoning management framework for the “comprehensive evaluation of supply and demand, ecological zoning, and enhancement of human well-being”. This study integrates the InVEST model, SOM, Z-score quadrant matching, and coordination degree method, and applies them to the ecological management zoning of Hangzhou. The results show that (1) the spatial differentiation of ESs in Hangzhou is significant. The spatial pattern of the five types of ES supply varies at the county scale and the grid scale on which ES demand is concentrated and is consistent at different scales. (2) ES supply–demand matching in Hangzhou is at the basic coordination and can be divided into four modes including HH, LH, LL, and HL at both the county and grid scales. On the small scale, the proportion of mismatches declines slightly, but the severity rises. (3) ES supply is divided into four categories as follows: the food production bundle, the carbon storage bundle, the ESs balancing bundle, and the ESs depleting bundle, and clarifies the priority of ES management. (4) Construct an ecological management practice path, delineates 6 ecological management zones at the county scale and 19 secondary management zones at the grid scale. Targeted measures are proposed in terms of supply–demand adjustment strategies, ecological management strategies, and key implementation areas. This study helps to incorporate the interaction between the supply and demand of ESs into the planning framework and provides decision-making support for refined ecological management.</jats:p>"

The network characteristics we study here (e.g., clustering coefficient, scalar index, node type, etc.) are exceptionally important for real-life SCNs, but are not sufficiently considered in the previous research on SCNR. To this end, we first construct an SCN model with adjustable parameters for multiple network characteristics. Second, this SCN model is combined with a susceptible–infectious–susceptible model to construct an SCN risk propagation model. Third, we propose using the average (i.e., a novel SCNR metric considering node type) of the sizes of the maximum connected subgraphs (which contain all node types) over a period of time after risk propagation reaches a steady state. Fourth, the parameters of the SCN model are adjusted to generate SCNs with different network characteristics, and then the resilience of these SCNs is addressed accordingly. The simulation results mainly show the following: the larger the scalar index of an SCN is, the higher its resilience; the larger the clustering coefficient of an SCN is, the smaller its resilience; and the more uniform the distribution of node types is in an SCN, the higher its resilience. Our research work will help optimize SCNs’ structure, which has important implications for society and practice.</jats:p>"

Documents of court proceedings, official state reports, and findings of individuals with deep understandings of the situation on the ground reveal that this rural political mobilization was not so much a reflection of Hungarian propaganda or a “lack of appropriate national identification” among the local population—although, of course, these two factors cannot be ignored in a contested and linguistically and ethnically diverse region—but rather an outcome of the impoverishment of large sections of the peasant population.</jats:p>",

Prior research on climate impact of ICT devices and services mostly makes use of life cycle assessment and energy modeling frameworks focused on embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Because these perspectives emphasize the GHGs emissions associated with the construction and distribution of digital devices along production supply chains, not much is known about the GHGs emissions monitored or facilitated by digital device use. In this study, we propose the concept of digital use supply chains (DUSCs) as an orthogonal dimension of digital devices’ life cycle. DUSC refers to the production activities and resource consumption recorded by digital devices. We propose a framework to conceptualize and quantify digital behavior-related GHGs emissions through use of the Screenomics paradigm, where users’ digital screen data are unobtrusively collected moment-by-moment. Through Screenomics’ granular recording of users’ digital behavior, we evaluate behavior-based GHGs emissions traced by the digital devices. DUSC connects individual’s digital behaviors to their global climate change impact, contributing to a more nuanced and complete evaluation of the climate impacts of the digital economy. Our single-case study indicates the estimated scale of the GHGs emissions linked to a user’s one-day digital activities could be three orders of magnitude (1000 times) higher than the emissions associated with the device life cycle alone. DUSC could enable climate change mitigation at a meaningful, actionable level through personalized educational or behavior change programs, and also facilitate novel data-driven feedback loops that may provide digital device users with insights into their personal climate impacts. Recognition and future study of DUSC could accelerate the quantification and standardization of a ‘carbon handprint’ of digital devices and create positive climate impacts from digital products and services.</jats:p>",

Given the International Energy Agency's (IEA) role in supporting national energy sustainability and reviewing Indonesia's energy policies, a pertinent question arises regarding its role in Indonesia. This study aims to analyze the concrete role of the International Energy Agency (IEA) in supporting the sustainability of renewable energy supply in Indonesia with reference to SDG 7. This study finds that the role of the IEA in striving for a renewable energy transition in Indonesia centres on providing analysis of the potential and challenges as well as policy recommendations to direct the government in developing strategies for implementing renewable energy. The IEA also facilitates international cooperation, technology transfer, and investment in the renewable energy sector. Indonesia is committed to achieving the targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which focuses on universal access to affordable, clean, and sustainable energy. Cooperation with the IEA will continue to be key in achieving this goal, especially to achieve the net-zero emissions target by 2060 and ensure the availability of a sustainable renewable energy supply.</jats:p>",

Results - the main signs of instability in economic situation in the world, their characteristics, main causes and consequences are revealed. The average annual growth rate of agricultural production for 2000-2020, 2020-2022 is shown and their impact on per capita supply of basic products and consumption rates. Comparison of these indicators allows to identify actual level of food support in Kazakhstan for specific years. The authors note that in the last two decades, physiological dietary and calorie standards for certain food products have not yet been achieved. Food security is also determined by the share of imports in consumer demand. Conclusions - it is recommended in the near and medium term to take effective measures to increase main types of products to volumes that will allow to move to import substitution and per capita consumption to the standards of physiological needs. Measures of state support to create favorable economic and organizational conditions for doing business in agricultural sector of the republic are proposed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: This article aims to discuss the importance of incorporating sustainable transportation practices into the supply chains of the Brazilian agro-industry, highlighting their potential to reduce costs, increase operational efficiency, and enhance companies' reputation in an increasingly sustainability-focused global context.   Theoretical framework: Agribusiness plays a vital role in the Brazilian economy, converting agricultural raw materials into higher value-added products and driving economic gains and job creation. However, transportation in this chain has a significant environmental impact, with Brazil heavily reliant on road transport, contributing to carbon emissions. Companies from various sectors are adopting sustainable transportation practices to address these challenges, recognizing the growing importance of sustainability as a business strategy to ensure competitive advantage in the global market.   Method: The literature review was conducted in five detailed stages: formulation of the research question, identification and careful selection of relevant studies, analysis and synthesis of data, and description and dissemination of results. Scientific articles, book chapters, and technical reports published between 2015 and 2023 were considered, ensuring a solid and updated basis for analysis.   Results and conclusion: The analysis of 102 studies highlighted the relevance of implementing sustainable transportation practices, such as the use of electric vehicles and bioenergy, in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and optimizing logistics costs. Intermodality also emerged as an effective strategy adopted to mitigate environmental impacts and strengthen competitiveness. However, there is a continuous need for future research to understand the nuances of sustainable transportation strategies in different segments and regions of the Brazilian agro-industrial supply chain. Research implications: This study emphasizes the urgency and importance of transitioning to sustainable transportation practices in the Brazilian agro-industry, highlighting the need for government intervention and investment in research to develop approaches tailored to the specific challenges of each sector and region. Additionally, it underscores the importance of public policies that incentivize and promote sustainability in supply chains.   Originality/value: It significantly contributes to understanding the complexities of sustainable transportation in the Brazilian agro-industry, providing insights for companies and policymakers interested in promoting sustainability in supply chains. By filling knowledge gaps and presenting innovative perspectives, this study stands out for its original contribution and practical value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Forest residues have been suggested as potential feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production through different pathways. However, the bulky density and scatter distribution require efficient size-reduction processes to enhance the feedstock supply. Thus, this study analyzes the impact of alternative preprocessing and conversion technologies on the SAF supply chains from logging residues (the predominant share of forest residues) using a two-stage mixed-integer linear programming model. The model determines the optimal location of biomass preprocessing depots, conversion facilities, and airports receiving SAF by minimizing the net present value of the total supply chain cost over 10 years. Using high-resolution spatial data in the Southeast U.S.A. as a case study, the results show that the technology and scale of the facilities heavily influenced the SAF’s breakeven cost and maximum supply quantity. The most economically efficient system that adopts a rotary shear milling system and pyrolysis conversion process could generate up to 650 million gallons of SAF from logging residues in the region, with nearly 62% of the SAF being produced from hardwood residues. Also, the most efficient system has an estimated breakeven cost of US$5.51 per gallon of SAF. </jats:p>",

The traditional retailer chooses supplier financing (SF), platform investment (PI), or non‐financing (NF) to meet uncertain demand. Examining three scenarios using CVaR, we find financing equilibrium determined by interactive impacts of dividend proportion and revenue sharing rate. Adjusting the latter achieves Pareto improvement among supply chain members, explaining why platforms invest in traditional retailers. Extending the model introduces a portfolio financing approach, combining SF and PI.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, live streaming is becoming a popular channel to sell products all over the world. Compared to traditional e-commerce channel, live streaming channel may not only bring consumers more shopping convenience, but also pose consumers more privacy concern. This paper considers a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an e-tailer who sells through dual channels (<jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., live streaming and traditional e-commerce) to explore how shopping convenience and privacy concern affect the optimal decisions. We build game models of two pricing (exogenous and endogenous) and two incentive contracts (wholesale price and two-part tariff). We find that the optimal promotion efforts are decreasing in shopping convenience while increasing in privacy concerns under the wholesale price contract, and independent of them under the two-part tariff contract when pricing is not a decision (such as iPhone); the optimal promotion efforts are increasing in shopping convenience while decreasing in privacy concern when pricing is a decision (such as the seasonal products). Whether the retail pricing is a decision or not, supply chain coordination can be achieved by the two-part tariff contract, but not through the wholesale price contract. Further, the two-part tariff contract is more favorable to the manufacturer if the exogenously given retail price is low, and the wholesale price contract is more favorable to the manufacturer if the retail price is high; the two-part tariff contract is always more beneficial for the supply chain than the wholesale price contract. Finally, we extend our analysis to relax a more realistic form with a variable effort elasticity and verify the robustness of the theoretical results.</jats:p>",

From a financial perspective, studying the impact of DUR is equally significant. This study explores the relationship between DUR and private equity (PE) financing in retail enterprises within a supply chain, which comprises a dominant supplier and a subordinate retailer. This article establishes decision models for a retailer backed by PE under three market demand conditions: range, mean, and range with mean. The study further investigates the impact of partial demand uncertainty reduction (PDUR) on the retailer and PE through comparative analysis of these scenarios. To address incomplete market demand information during the decision-making process, the study employs the minimax regret criterion to construct and solve the model. An intriguing finding of this study is that contrary to intuition, PDUR not only fails to promote PE but also reduces the retailer’s willingness to finance and decreases the asset size for both the retailer and PE. In addition, the better the growth potential for the retail enterprise, the more severe the negative impact brought about by PDUR. Moreover, the impact of PDUR on supplier and supply chain performance is two-fold. PDUR based on range information has a negative impact on the expected profit of the supplier and the supply chain, while PDUR based on mean information has a positive impact on their expected profit.</jats:p>"

The transcriptome data obtained from this study showed that the expression level of the apple basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) MdbZIP44 was up-regulated in ‘Oregon Spur Delicious’ (Malus domestica Borkh.) apple fruits under nitrogen supply. MdbZIP44 bound to the promoter of Mdα-GP2 gene and inhibited its expression, thereby promoting starch accumulation and decreasing glucose content in apple and tomato fruits. Besides, overexpression of MdbZIP44 promoted sucrose accumulation by regulating the activities of sucrose metabolism-related enzymes and the expression of sugar metabolism-related genes in apple callus and tomato fruits. Furthermore, biochemical assays indicated that MdbZIP44 directly interacted with MdCPRF2-like, another bZIP gene in apple. Meanwhile, this study found that MdCPRF2-like, along with the MdbZIP44 and MdCPRF2-like complex, could activate the expression of Mdα-GP2, respectively. In conclusion, this study provides a new reference for potential mechanisms underlying that MdbZIP44–MdCPRF2-like–Mdα-GP2 regulates starch and sugar metabolism under nitrogen supply.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to investigate the activity and diversity of arsM-carrying microorganisms in sediment samples (termed YC1, YC2, and YC5) from a low-temperature hot spring. Microcosm assays revealed that only YC1 and YC2 exhibited limited As-methylating activities, generating a maximum of 2.3–3.5 μg/L methylarsenate (MMA) and 2.2–2.8 μg/L dimethylarsenate (DMA). The addition of lactate and arsenite significantly promoted these activities, increasing the concentrations to 26.1–184.0 μg/L MMA and 38.1–204.0 μg/L DMA. The arsM gene abundance also increased by 46–276%, indicating that lactate can activate arsenite methylation. YC1 and YC2, which were closer to the hot spring hole than YC5 was, had similar patterns, and shared a similar arsM community structure, dominated by Actinobacteriota, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteriota on days 7 and 21. In contrast, at YC5, the sampling site far from the spring hole, representatives of Acidobacteriota were dominant on day 7, whereas those of Actinobacteriota were prevalent on day 21. Acidobacteriota co-occurred with dimethylarsenate production, and Mycobacterium co-occurred with DMA demethylation. These findings suggested that the low-temperature arsenic hot spring possessed diverse arsenic-methylating species, whereas demethylating bacteria preferred to inhabit niches farther from the hot spring.</jats:p>",

The authors consider skills using two approaches: the Human Capital theory including the distinction between general and specific capital, and the typology by Dobryakova and Froumin which involves the distinction of three types: competence of thinking, competence of interaction with other people, and competence of interaction with oneself. The empirical material is based on a unique sample of respondents who have both entrepreneurial experience and experience in entrepreneurship education in one of the programs in Russia. The empirical base of the study consists of 82 semi-structured interviews with respondents from 9 educational initiatives aimed at entrepreneurship education. The data was collected using the method of semi-structured interviews. The authors have identified a gap between the skills that entrepreneurs need and the skills acquired in entrepreneurship education programs. Respondents have a more pronounced demand for general human capital, while their experience in education was focused primarily on the development of specific capital.

The existing works mainly focus on the various deterministic or uncertainty problems; few works consider the CCUS SCND resilience problem in the context of utilization/storage facility disruptions due to unexpected natural disasters or other geological anomaly events. This paper aims to study the CCUS SCND resilience problem under utilization/storage facility capacity disruption risk. We propose a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming model for the considered problem. In the considered problem, the main decisions related to the following areas are taken into account: supply chain design and planning; facility disruption risk handling, including the optimal determination of facility locations and the matching of carbon dioxide emission sources and utilization/storage facilities; carbon dioxide normal transportation planning; and transshipment planning for various disruption scenarios. Finally, an experimental study comprising a case study from China is conducted to validate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed model. The obtained results show that the supply chain networks for the case study obtained by our proposed model are efficient, cost-effective and resilient in mitigating various kinds of utilization/storage facility disruption scenarios, showing the model can be applied to large-scale CCUS projects to help managers effectively deal with disruption risks. Future research should consider multiple disruption events and propose multiple effective resilience strategies.</jats:p>"

Different use scenarios were simulated, which included drinking water demands of 100, 150, 200 and 300 litres per capita and rainwater replacement for drinking water at rates of 25, 35, 45 and 55%, according to rainfall data from the last decade. The optimal and maximal volumes of each scenario were calculated using the yield after spill (YAS) behavioural method. Based on the values of the volumes obtained, the studied municipalities were grouped, and for each group, the practical models were adjusted and evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R²) and the root mean square error (RMSE). A good adherence of the models to the observed data was observed, which simplified the estimation of the volume for rainwater reservoirs; practical applications demand that designs use discreet daily rainfall values.</jats:p>"

The main objective of this paper is to explore the economic and environmental impacts of carbon cap-and-trade regulation on two competing supply chains. This paper considers two cases: (i) in the absence of cap-and-trade regulation and (ii) with carbon cap-and-trade regulation. For each case, there are three structures: centralized-centralized (C-C) structure, decentralized-decentralized (D-D) structure, and hybrid centralized-decentralized (C-D) structure. First, this paper analyzes the optimal pricing decisions of two competing supply chains for the two cases, and then explores the impacts of cap-and-trade regulation on the sale price, market demand, economy (include enterprise profits and consumer surplus), environment (<jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., carbon emission) and total social welfare. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results. By comparing the two cases, the main conclusions are as follows: (i) cap-and-trade regulation leads to the increase of unit price and the decrease of the market demand, (ii) cap-and-trade regulation leads to the reduction of both carbon emission and the consumer surplus, (iii) the impacts of cap-and-trade regulation on the profit and social welfare depend on the carbon cap.</jats:p>",

Due to the lack of knowledge and guidance in this area, the adoption of smart technology throughout the supply chain is limited, leading to poor operational performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate how smart technology and digital supply chain transformation can improve operational performance. To test hypotheses and accomplish study goals, the Resource-Based View (RBV) theory was combined with a quantitative research strategy. The study population of companies was obtained from a manufacturing directory, and a minimum sample size of 107 companies was determined using G*Power. Additionally, 600 online surveys were sent to the manufacturing companies, resulting in a response rate of 17.83%. Data analysis was conducted using Smart-PLS 4.0 software, and eight of the 10 hypotheses were supported. The findings showed that smart technologies completely mediate the link between digital transformation and relationship performance, emphasizing the need for manufacturing organizations to focus on incorporating smart technology into their supply chain to enhance operational performance. The study concludes by presenting theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and recommendations. </jats:p>",

This study explores the relationship between nutrient supply and femoral bone health at different ages. (2) Methods: A total of 5603 participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 2005 to 2010, 2013 to 2014, and 2017 to 2018. Femoral bone mineral density and bone status were dependent variables, and dietary nutrient intake and nutrient intake status were independent variables. The relationship between dietary nutrient intake and bone mineral density was explored, and the importance of nutrients affecting bone status was analyzed through a neural network model. At the same time, we investigated the relationship between nutrient intake and bone status. (3) Results: The peak of age and femoral bone mineral density appeared at 20 years old in our study. After grouping by age, logistic regression analysis showed that before 20 years old, without adjusting other variables, high-fat diet was more likely to have normal bone mass than appropriate fat diet (OR: 4.173, 95%CI: 1.007–17.289). After adjusting for all demographic factors, niacin intake (OR: 1.062, 95%CI: 1.019–1.108) was beneficial for normal bone mass, while vitamin B6 intake (OR: 0.627, 95%CI: 0.408–0.965) was not. After 20 years old, after adjusting for carbohydrate, protein, vitamin B6, niacin, dietary fat, vitamin B2, and vitamin B12, vitamin B2 intake (OR: 1.153, 95%CI: 1.04–1.278) was beneficial for normal bone mass, while vitamin B6 intake (OR: 0.842, 95%CI: 0.726–0.976) was not. After adjusting for all confounding factors, vitamin B2 intake (OR: 1.288, 95%CI: 1.102–1.506) was beneficial for normal bone mass. In addition, we found that even if there was no statistical significance, the effects of high-fat diet on bone mass were different at different ages. (4) Conclusions: By conducting an in-depth analysis of the NHANES database, this study reveals that dietary factors exert divergent effects on bone health across different age groups, implying the necessity of implementing tailored dietary strategies to maintain optimal bone health at distinct life stages.</jats:p>"

This approach is unsustainable today. The use of digital systems capable of modeling the behavior of infrastructures and the creation of intelligent control systems can help to make drinking water supply systems more efficient and effective, while still meeting minimum service requirements. This work proposes the development of a control system, based on multi-agent systems (MAS), capable of generating an intelligent control over a drinking water infrastructure, based on the use of local interests of the agents and with an emergent behavior coherent with the needs. To validate the proposal, a simulator based on the infrastructures of a medium-sized Spanish city of 5000 inhabitants has been built and the control has been simulated using the MAS. The results show how the system can maintain the objectives set, handling unknown situations, and facilitating the development of future physical systems based on a just-in-time paradigm that guarantees sustainability, as it allows the generation of virtualizations of the infrastructures and their behavior, thus being able to study the best option for an infrastructure to resolve a supply situation. </jats:p>",

To characterize the influences of structural parameters and vortices on the hydraulic performance of PDIE, the discharge exponent, discharge rate, and emitter unit constant were analyzed via hydraulic performance experiments and numerical simulation. The key findings are: (1) Discharge exponents of PDIE ranged from 0.478 to 0.515; average high-pressure hydraulic performance exceeded low pressure by 4.882%. (2) The four key structural parameters impacted hydraulic performance from large to small as follows: the width of the perforation (a), the angle of the scalariform perforation plate (α), the distance of the two perforations (b), and the length of the channel cavity (c). Among them, the discharge exponent changes significantly with a and α. (3) Vortex-retaining PDIE exhibited a lower emitter discharge exponent versus vortex-removed versions. However, vortices increase discharge rate and reduce energy consumption of PDIE. After optimization, the emitter discharge exponent of the PDIE with the reserved vortex is 0.461, which is relatively improved by 3.556%. This study can provide a theoretical reference for the structural design of new drip irrigation emitters and functional analysis of vortices.</jats:p>",

This article analyses some features of the CBWSOs and their partnerships, based on the experience of ACUANARIÑO and ASDAL – Tres Esquinas, two CBWSOs located in Valle del Cauca – Colombia, following their participation at the local, municipal (ASOOCSAS Tuluá), subnational (Asociación de Organizaciones Comunitarias Prestadoras de Servicios Públicos de Agua y Saneamiento de Colombia (AQUACOL)), national (COCSASCOL), and transnational levels (CLOCSAS). The main findings of this work, after using a participatory approach, are that initial partnerships between CBWSOs emerge from informal agreements built on the neighbourhood logic typical of rurality; however, as moving towards higher scales, agreements become more formal to allow for dialogue and discussion with governmental organizations in the water and sanitation sector. This is also a strategy for the recognition of community water management. Thus, CBWSOPs are construed under a collaborative and non-profit approach, in the manner of water operator partnerships.</jats:p>",

The results show that (1) the combined action of reservoir level variation and rainfall has a significant influence on the stability of multistage sliding ancient landslides. (2) The sliding force calculated by the improved transfer coefficient method is smaller than the calculation result by the traditional transfer coefficient method, and the residual sliding force is larger. The different sliding body stability coefficient is reduced by about 28.84, 18.13, 19.26, and 21.01%, respectively.

In this paper, a tripartite evolutionary game model is constructed in which a network freight platform, freight shipper, and freight carrier are considered, and the evolutionary stability strategies of the parties and the tripartite system are dynamically analyzed. The reliability of the model is verified through a numerical case, and several countermeasures have been proposed to improve the stability of the system based on the sensitivity analysis of important parameters.

This model adopts power-to-gas technology to produce green hydrogen, replacing a portion of gray hydrogen and incorporates a carbon capture system to effectively reduce the overall carbon emissions of the industrial park. Meanwhile, incentive-based and price-based demand response strategies are implemented to optimize the load curve. A scheduling model is established targeting the minimization of procurement, operation, carbon emission, and wind curtailment costs. The case study of a northern industrial park in China demonstrates that the joint supply of green and gray hydrogen reduces carbon emissions by 40.98% and costs by 17.93% compared to solely using gray hydrogen. The proposed approach successfully coordinates the economic and environmental performance of the integrated energy system. This study provides an effective scheduling strategy for industrial parks to accommodate high shares of renewables while meeting hydrogen needs and carbon reduction targets.</jats:p>"

Herein, inspired by the dual‐metal pair sites in natural enzyme, the de novo design of an efficient, robust, and precise electron‐donating Cu‐modulated ruthenium clusters on porous carbon matrix (Cu@Ru<jats:sub>nc</jats:sub>‐C) is reported as a high proton supply and anti‐poisoning cathode material for superior direct seawater hydrogen production.

Channel leadership as an important factor affecting the channel profit distribution will reshape the investment motivation of enterprises. In this paper, we construct six kinds of pricing and green design decision models to explore the optimal green design strategies for sustainable supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer under different channel leadership, and investigate the interaction between channel leadership and green design strategy, and their impacts on sustainable supply chain performance, environment and consumer surplus. We find that regardless of the channel leadership, the wholesale and retail prices of products under different green design strategies are always affected by the cost effect of green design. In terms of boosting the green design level and market demand, increasing the consumer surplus and enterprises profits, only when the manufacturer is the channel leader and the green design cost effect is small, the retailer can implement green design better. Moreover, when the manufacturer implements green design, the better channel structure between the retailer-led and Nash equilibrium game depends on the green design cost effect, but both are better than the manufacturer-led. However, when the retailer implements green design, the channel structure of Nash equilibrium game is always better. We finally illustrate that under different channel leadership, which green design strategy is more conducive to reducing the total environment impact of products depends on the joint effect of green design cost effect and green design environment effect.</jats:p>",

To increase the explanatory power of the indicator system and decrease information redundancy, the coefficient of variation is applied to identify the indicators with weak interpretation intensity, the ill-conditioned index cycle method is utilized to filter out indicators with redundant information, and data on 100 Chinese listed companies from 2019 to 2021 are used as samples. A performance evaluation indicator system of sustainable supply chains with 16 indicators is ultimately established. The information interpretation strength index and cumulative information contribution rate verify the rationality of the final indicator system. The outcome demonstrates that this screening method can strengthen the representativeness of the indicator system and rapidly reduce redundancy, leading to the better discrimination of the evaluation results.

A SLR was developed and determined, which involved the selecting of keyword, developing of research question, searching and evaluation of literature for 53 research articles. The content of present of literature was reviewed, critically analysed and synthesised from the perspective of barrier and critical success factors that influence the implementation of LSCM. This study reveals that relationship with supplier, commitment and support by top management are the key critical success factor in lean implementation. Furthermore, the results showed that lack of management commitment and leadership, lack of training and skills, lack of system view or strategy are the barriers in lean implementation. Based on the extensive systematic review of literature, we found of the consistency data between Barriers and Critical Success Factor. This study extends previous studies on LSCM, strengthens the body of knowledge on the issue and consolidates the key LSCM activities, barriers and critical success factors associated with its implementation.

This study calculates EPV using a modified equivalent factor, analyzes the spatial pattern of EPV using the fishnet tool in Arc GIS, and constructs a model for realizing EPV. Finally, the driving factors for the formation of eco-industry are identified using the grey correlation analysis (GCA) method. The results show that (1) the regulatory service products in karst NRs play a decisive role in EPV, and forest ecosystems have significant EPV potential; (2) high-value grids are concentrated in the core and buffer zones of karst NRs and the spatial distribution of EPV in the experimental zone is highly heterogeneous, with high and low-value grids in mixed distribution; (3) the realization model of EPV in karst NRs follows the logic of “preservation, transformation, and appreciation”; (4) human resources (0.813), ecology (0.798), industry (0.693), policy (0.783), the market (0.778), and economy (0.715) are essential drivers for the formation of eco-industry in karst NRs.

Intense human activities, especially reservoir operation, have unavoidably altered the flow regime of the Upper Huai River, leading to further impacts on river ecosystems. It is essential to quantify hydrological alterations in flow regimes and their associated impacts on river ecosystems for effective river water management. Ecological flow indicators, namely ecological deficit and surplus, were analyzed to assess instream ecological flow. The overall degree of alteration (Do) and the Dundee Hydrological Regime Alteration Method (DHRAM) were utilized to evaluate the degree of hydrological alteration. Additionally, the Shannon Index (SI) was employed to estimate the impact of hydrological alterations on ecological diversity in this study. The results reveal that the streamflow series underwent mutation in 1987, leading to a decrease in ecological surplus and an increase in ecological deficit. The overall alteration degree is 32%, with a DHRAM level of 3, signifying low hydrological alteration and moderate ecological risk in the region. Furthermore, the biodiversity of the river has markedly declined due to human activities following the alteration.</jats:p>",

Further to this point, there is an ongoing need to collect and evaluate water quality data from drought-affected areas in the Eastern Cape. In the current study, the authors seek to achieve two aims. Firstly, there is a need to conduct an investigation of the potable water quality from the local municipalities in the Eastern Cape where such investigations have not been common recently. Secondly, the authors seek to conduct an investigation into the carbon footprint of provision of alternative bottled water into a local municipality in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Turbidity, pH and presence/levels of faecal contamination of drinking water were measured. In addition, the carbon footprint of the supply of bottled water was estimated for road transport of 5 litre bottles. Results indicate that microbial water quality is a problem and there is finite, but significant carbon dioxide emissions due to supply of alternative water sources. There is significant carbon footprint of the shipping of bottled water into the Eastern Cape Province, should the municipal water supply break down completely.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The possibilities of increasing the efficiency of heat supply turbines of CHPPs due to the choice of rational modes of operation of network water heaters are analyzed. With the help of a software and computing complex developed at the Institute of Mechanical Engineering Problems of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and adapted by the authors to the operating conditions of CHPP generating equipment with one or two network heaters, a set of calculation studies of various ways of connecting them depending on the outdoor air temperature is conducted in the paper. Areas of positive effect associated with increase in the electric power of the power plant have been established. The calculation study was carried out at typical power plant water consumption from 1000 t/h to 4500 t/h, in the range of changes in the outdoor air temperature from -11 ºС to 10 ºС (heating season) and more than 10 ºС (hot water supply). The load change of the power unit was carried out due to the consumption of fresh steam at a constant pressure and temperature at the turbine inlet. As shown by the results of the operation of the T-100/120-130 heat supply turbine in operating conditions with one or two heat supply steam selections, in the area of positive outdoor air temperatures above 2 ºС, it is advisable to use one lower selection (with the upper one turned off) for all network water consumption. At the same time, additional electric power in the area of outdoor air temperatures above 6ºС can be from 0.25 MW to 2.15 MW. However, when the outdoor air temperature is less than 2 ºС, work with one lower heating selection becomes irrational. From the point of view of choosing rational modes of operation of turbine plants, the most important are the results of determining the optimal distribution of heat load between network heaters. The gain in electrical power of the turbine can be up to 2.46 MW in the nominal mode of operation with two heaters, and up to 7.84 MW in comparison with the use of single-stage heating. The nature of the influence of the distribution of the heat load indicates that during deprivation from the instructional uniform distribution of the heat load between network heaters, it is possible to obtain additional electricity.</jats:p>",

Although the economic and social dimensions of their artistic value have been explored, few studies delve into the connection between Qing-era Guangzhou's trade culture and its color characteristics. Utilizing the HSV color model and the k-means algorithm, this study analyzes the color traits of 35 export paintings depicting Guangzhou landscapes and works from the \"Thirteen-houses commercial zone,\" revealing Qing-era Guangzhou's urban impressions and Sino-Western artistic interactions. Key findings include: (1) the hue pixel range in Guangzhou export paintings primarily spans 10°–60° and 120°–250° (dominated by red and yellow-green), saturation values range from 1–82% (primarily low saturation), and value values range from 11–94% (with a wide variance); (2) compared to traditional Chinese paintings, the transformation from pure color (正色) → inter-color (间色) → projection-perspective and light source illustrates both the blending of Eastern and Western artistic cultures and a diminishing influence of traditional ceremonial culture; (3) in contrast with Western artworks, some Guangzhou export paintings display a Westernization trend in color structures, evident in vibrant colors and stark chiaroscuro contrasts. As bespoke art commodities, export paintings microscopically reflect Guangzhou's unique trade culture and socio-political dynamics. The shifts in color schemes, integration of realistic styles, and human-centric characteristics unveil the intricate interplay between quasi-realism and transcendental aesthetics in Qing-era Guangzhou, as well as the nuanced dynamics between social capital and art within a global trade network.</jats:p>"

In this regard, the existing models and complexes for adequacy assessment may work inadequately and ineffectively in terms of the obtained results adequacy. To assess the current state of the existing models and complexes, we reviewed and analyzed the domestic and foreign software and computer systems. In particular, we considered mathematical models of minimizing the power shortage. This work is based on the problem of modifying mathematical models of minimizing the power shortage used in adequacy assessment of the electric power systems of one of the complexes under consideration. As a modification of mathematical models, it is proposed to exclude the existing method of using the line capacities and start using correct accounting for the maximum permissible active power flow in controlled sections. The experimental part reflected in the paper concerns the testing of options for models to minimize the power shortage, as well as the proposed modifications on various systems, including those consisting of three and seven reliability zones with a variable number of controlled sections and power lines included in them. The results of the study have shown that the proposed modifications are efficient and can be used in the future. The authors also obtained the most adequate results in terms of the physical laws of electric power system operation due to the model of minimizing the power shortage with quadratic losses which takes into account the limitations of power transmission over controlled sections.</jats:p>",

Because of the distinctive characteristics of IoV, such as the varied compute and communication capacities of network nodes, it is difficult to process jobs that are time-sensitive. The purpose of this study is to investigate the ways in which cloud computing may collaborate with the IoV to make the processing of time-sensitive procedures easier. We propose a vehicle design that makes advantage of cloud computing as a means of accomplishing this goal. Increasing the proportion of time-sensitive jobs that are ultimately completed was the motivation behind the development of the offloading model that we devised. Taking this into perspective, we present an adaptive task offloading and transmission method. Taking into account the ever-changing requirements and constraints on the available resources, this algorithm dynamically organizes all of the tasks into separate cloud link lists on the cloud. Following that, the tasks contained within each list are distributed in a cooperative manner to a number of different nodes, with the characteristics of those nodes being taken into consideration. Following the presentation of the simulation model, we carried out an experimental investigation into the effectiveness of the model that was proposed. It is abundantly evident that the proposed model is effective, as indicated by the findings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mining industry is highly important in the economy of each country. At the same time, the mining industry is an industry with a high level of morbidity among workers. Quarry workers are often exposed to hazardous environments, while at the same time a low level of process safety organization. This study aims to develop a mathematical description of modelling the values of harmful factors in the production environment at the workplaces of quarry workers, which will help ensure high-quality engineering control during the work shift. The initial statistical data for the development of mathematical models were obtained directly by the authors through personal observations of the technological process and measurements of the level of harmful factors in the working environment. Measurements were taken using portable digital devices. To develop mathematical description based on accumulated statistical data, polynomial regression was used. The construction of models using polynomial regression is based on the property of functional dependencies, which can be formulated as follows: with a gradual increase in the complexity of the model (polynomial degree), the magnitude of errors (approximation error, forecast error) monotonically decreases. As a result, fourth-order polynomial equations were obtained to model the values of dust concentration and noise level at certain time intervals of the work shift. The correlation coefficient of these models is R = 0.98 and R = 0.99, and the relative error is 9.76% and 6.11% of dust concentration and noise level respectively, which indicates sufficient accuracy of the model. It was established that the studied harmful factors during a normal production process, have a level of impact at which early forms of occupational diseases develop. The proposed mathematical description of modelling the values of these factors makes it possible for high-quality engineering control over current technology processes in order to avoid abnormal excesses of the values. Further research, according to the authors, should be aimed at identifying and mathematically describing other potentially harmful and dangerous factors in the working environment. The originality of the current study lies in the fact that an attempt was made to propose a non-classical approach to quickly identify deteriorating working conditions directly in the work process using mathematical modelling.</jats:p>"

Se concluye que las prácticas como acciones, discursos, reglas y recursos que se ponen en juego en el marco de relaciones históricas de violencia política y social se encuentran en el punto marginal entre lo legal y lo ilegal, moviéndose libremente entre ambas dimensiones mientras esto permita la sobrevivencia en condiciones socioambientales hostiles.</jats:p>"

According to the criteria necessary for this study, we have selected the information on 8 varieties from the Steppe zone for 11 years, 1 variety from the Piedmont zone for 3 years, and 4 varieties from the South Coast zone for 6 years. By collecting and nonlinear interpolating of long-term observations from Crimean weather stations using geoinformation and mathematical modeling methods, the values of agroclimatic factors were calculated for each selected vineyard on the dates of determining the quality indicators of grapes during their ripening at the location points of the vineyards. For this purpose, 10 agroclimatic indicators characterizing the heat supply were selected. Based on the research results, basic principles for creating an informational database of agroecological resources and quality composition of grapes were developed. Informational database can be further modified and extended with various agroclimatic indicators. Subsequently, the accumulated array of database information will be used to identify patterns reflecting the influence of agroecological conditions on the formation of grape quality parameters for various types of production, which will serve as a basis for establishing viticultural and winemaking terroirs.
