The paper presents an overview of problems associated with the process of managing construction project information and explores the key role Web‐based technology systems can play in making this process more effective. The paper also reports on the utilisation of such a system on a number of construction projects. It discusses the efficiency gained in the traditional process of architectural drawings transmittal, and reports on a questionnaire survey targeting system users to gain some insight into their perception of its usefulness, performance and role in improving communications amongst the entire project team.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A controlled study was conducted in Lebanon over a period of 12 months to determine bacterial regrowth in a small network supplying the Beirut suburb of Naccache that had a population of about 3,000. The residential area, which is fed by gravity, is supplied twice a week with chlorinated water from two artesian wells of a confined aquifer. A significant correlation was detected between the turbidity and the levels of heterotrophic plate count bacteria (HPC) in the samples from the distribution network as well as from the artesian wells. However, a negative significant correlation was found between the temperature and the HPC count in the samples collected from the source. A statistically significant increase in counts, possibly due to regrowth, was repeatedly established between two sampling points lying on a straight distribution line but 1 km apart. Faecal coliforms were detected in the source water but none in the network except during a pipe breakage incident with confirmed Escherichia coli reaching 40 CFU/100 mL. However, coliforms such as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, E. cloacae and E. skazakii were repeatedly isolated from the network, mainly due to inadequate chlorination. A second controlled study was conducted to determine the effect of storage on the microbial quality of household storage tanks (500 L), which were of two main types - galvanized cast iron and black polyethylene. The mean bacterial count increased significantly after 7 d storage in both tank types. A significant difference was found in the mean HPC/mL between the winter and the summer. Highest counts were found April-June although the maximum temperature was reported later in the summer. A positive correlation was established between the HPC/mL and pH, temperature and storage time.</jats:p>",

One option is to look at the potential of shared learning between firms, where common interests and interdependence provide motivation for experience sharing and other forms of synergy in learning. A particular version of inter‐firm learning is the use of supply chains as a mechanism for upgrading and transferring “appropriate practice” and this article reports on exploratory research on this theme. It draws on a literature survey and a detailed study of six UK supply chains at various stages of implementing supply chain learning.</jats:p>",

Their cell bodies are located in the next anterior ganglion to where the axons leave the ventral nerve cord via nerve 1. Both inhibitors have contralateral somata in the posterior ventral soma cortex, looping primary neurites and bilateral dorsal arborisations. There are homonomous (segmentally homologous) motor neurones in the fused abdominal neuromeres, the thoracic ganglia, and at least the third subesophageal neuromere.</jats:p><jats:p>These body wall inhibitors are distinctly different from the limb muscle inhibitors, CI1-3, described previously.

The extent to which e‐commerce‐based strategies, such as quick response and efficient consumer response, might have an effect on local economies depends in part on how readily they are being adopted. The dominant form of adoption of these strategies is to be found in the business‐to‐business forms of e‐commerce. To be successful, business partners must be in a position to develop customer intimacy through sharing of information, to improve their stock replenishment practices, and enhance their levels of online customer support. This paper presents the initial results of a national survey completed in the retail sector of the Australian economy, that assesses how well Australian industry is responding to these e‐commerce challenges.</jats:p>",

The fact that growing seed corn is a biological process dependent upon local weather and insect conditions during the growing season complicates production planning. In addition, customers' experiences with a particular hybrid during a given year strongly influence demand for that hybrid during the next year. To help mitigate some of these yield and demand uncertainties, Syngenta (and other seed companies as well) take advantage of a second growing season for seed corn in South America, which occurs after many of the yield uncertainties and some of the demand uncertainties have been resolved or reduced. To better manage this production-planning process, Syngenta and the University of Iowa developed and implemented a second-chance production-planning model. A trial of the model showed that using it to plan 2000 production would have increased margins by approximately $5 million. Today, Syngenta uses this model to plan production for those varieties that account for 80 percent of total sales volume. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we address the eventual supply of &lt;20 eV ions to the central plasma sheet (CPS) by tracing their trajectories using empirical models of the electric and magnetic fields. We show the flux of ionospheric origin ions across the surface bounding the CPS to be substantial and largely controlled by the convection electric field. We find that under times of enhanced convection, ionospheric ions preferentially supply the region where substorm activity is thought to originate, and that a reduction in the convection (as caused, for example, by a northward turning of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)) immediately and dramatically reduces this supply. This effect arises due to the modification of the trajectories of “in‐flight” ions. It is postulated that this sudden reduction in CPS ion supply in response to a northward IMF turning may have consequences for substorm triggering.</jats:p>",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether leptin regulates food intake when a supply of calories is provided by the systemic route. Experiments were carried out in leptin receptor−deficient obese fa/fa rats and lean Fa/fa controls. In both groups, 48 h of glucose infusion reduced food intake in proportion to caloric supply, resulting in virtually no change in total caloric intake as compared to before the infusion. This hypophagic response was reproduced without adding systemic calories, but by increasing glucose and insulin concentrations specifically in the brain through carotid artery infusion. Concomitant intracerebroventricular administration of 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, an acetyl CoA carboxylase inhibitor that precludes malonyl-CoA synthesis, abolished the restriction of feeding in carotid-infused lean and obese rats. These data indicate that a supply of calories via glucose infusion induces a hypophagic response independent of leptin signaling in the rat, and support the hypothesis that a rise in central malonyl-CoA, triggered by increased glucose and insulin concentrations, participates in this adaptation. This process could contribute to the limiting of hyperphagia, primarily when leptin signaling is altered, as in the obese state.</jats:p>",

The effects of increasing CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and nitrogen loading and of a change in water table and temperature on littoral CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes were studied in a glasshouse experiment with intact sediment cores including vegetation (mainly sedges), taken from a boreal eutrophic lake in Finland. Sediments with the water table held at a level of 0 or at −15 cm were incubated in an atmosphere of 360 or 720 p.p.m. CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> for 18 weeks. The experiment included fertilisation with NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> (to a total 3 g N m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>).</jats:p><jats:p>2. Changes in the water table and temperature strongly regulated sediment CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and cCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes (community CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> release), but did not affect N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions. Increase in the water table increased CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions but reduced cCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> release, while increase in temperature increased emissions of both CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>.</jats:p><jats:p>3. The raised CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased carbon turnover in the sediments, such that cCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> release was increased by 16–26%. However, CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> fluxes were not significantly affected by raised CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, although CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production potential (at 22 °C) of the sediments incubated at high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was increased. In the boreal region, littoral CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> production is more likely to be limited by temperature than by the availability of carbon. Raised CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> did not affect N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O production by denitrification, indicating that this process was not carbon limited.</jats:p><jats:p>4. A low availability of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> did severely limit N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O production. The NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> addition caused up to a 100‐fold increase in the fluxes of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O. The NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> addition did not increase N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O fluxes, indicating low nitrification capacity in the sediments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the absence of direct erosion measurements, the soil activity of the fallout radionuclide caesium–137 (<jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs) offers an attractive tool for the estimation of long–term (approximately 45 years) net surface and minor rill soil erosion rates for hillslopes. A transect–based soil sampling technique was applied to one woodland and five grazed pasture hillslopes in the Williams River water–supply catchment in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales. An Australian regression model (SOILOSS) relating net soil loss from runoff–erosion plots to <jats:sup>137</jats:sup>Cs deficit in soils was used to calculate a weighted net surface and minor rill erosion rate for the six hillslopes. The net median surface erosion rates ranged between 0.00 and 0.64 t ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>with the average median soil erosion rate of 0.19 t ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>(std. dev. = 0.23), indicating that these hillslopes were unlikely to be major sources of sediment to the catchment's waterways. Net soil loss rates were also shown to be low in comparison to Australia–wide data and comparable to hillslope data obtained elsewhere in the same region. Minimum and maximum error bounds were provided with each erosion rate to account for radionuclide detector count error. For one hillslope the estimated error due to detection was 1.34 t ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, while the remaining five hillslopes exhibited error of up to 0.41 t ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. Correlation analyses between the net soil loss rates and physical hillslope characteristics were non–significant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. This study highlights the role of interactions between surface and sub-surface water of the riparian zone of a large river (the Garonne, SW France). Information is given about the role of surface water in supplying Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC ) to the riparian zone for nitrate removal processes. The densities of bacteria (up to 3.3 106 cell m L-1) in groundwater are strongly conditioned by the water moving during flood events. Total bacterial densities in groundwater were related to surface water bacterial densities. In sediment, total bacteria are attached mainly to fine particles (90% in the fraction &lt; 1 mm). Spatial variations in organic carbon and nitrate content in groundwater at the site studied are correlated with exchanges between the groundwater and the river, from the upstream to the downstream part of the meander. Total bacterial densities, nitrate and decressing organic carbon concentrations follow the same pattern. These results suggest that, in this kind of riparian wetland, nitrate from alluvial groundwater influenced by agricultural practices may be denitrified by bacteria in the presence of organic carbon from river surface water.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this work a thermohydrodynamic analysis has been developed in order to investigate the influence of oil supply conditions on the performance of a journal bearing. The supply conditions considered were oil supply temperature, supply pressure, groove length and groove location. To carry out this study, the hydrodynamic pressure distribution inside the bearing has been determined using a mass-conserving cavitation model with realistic supply conditions. The energy equation and the heat conduction equation have been used for the determination of oil film and bush temperature distributions. The agreement observed between theoretical predictions and experimental published data is acceptable. Quantitative information shows that the oil supply conditions affect bearing performance parameters in different ways. Oil flowrate was markedly affected by all supply parameters studied. Power loss, maximum bush temperature and minimum film thickness were mainly dependent on oil supply temperature. The effect of supply pressure on minimum film thickness was dependent on groove location. An axial groove located at 90° to the load line gave rise to more favourable bearing performance characteristics. </jats:p>",
