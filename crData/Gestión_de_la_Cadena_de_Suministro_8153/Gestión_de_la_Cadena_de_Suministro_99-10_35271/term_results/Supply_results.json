A review is provided of the dominant ideas that currently inform “supply chain management thinking”. This paradigm is characterised as operational effectiveness and efficiency. A case is made for understanding supply chains from a strategic as well as from an operational perspective. Current supply chain management thinking is criticised for being atheoretical and descriptive, and a case is made for an analytical approach to supply chain thinking based around the concepts of power and value appropriation. A more analytically robust way of understanding supply chains is laid out.</jats:p>",

Concludes that the key to success in business is based on recognising the types of supply chains that exist and aligning strategy and operational practice with the specific properties of the supply chain that the company is positioned within. It is argued that some supply chain structures do not lend themselves to effective value appropriation, so that entrepreneurial rents may not be achievable in all circumstances. It is argued, in conclusion, that this way of thinking about supply chains and supply innovation – referred to here as procurement and supply competence – is underdeveloped in business management thinking.</jats:p>",

The first of these options is based on cost control through replicable improvements in operational efficiency. The second is based on market closure and power through the development of non‐replicable skills and competencies. This paper, on the direct‐marketing publishing supply chain, will attempt to show that strategies of efficiency are the second best option since they force the firm onto a treadmill in which value cannot be retained but instead must be passed to the customer. This abrogates the reason for the firm’s creation in the first place.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A significant feature of business management in the 1990s has been the practice of outsourcing. Firms and public sector bodies have reconsidered where the boundary of their organisation should be set, and passed to third parties responsibility for many business activities. However, many firms have been disappointed with the results they have achieved from outsourcing, not least when it has concerned high profile functions such as information technology. Part of the reason for this disappointment, it is argued, lies in the methodologies (or lack of them) which have been employed by managers. Very few have taken into account the main risks of the practice or identified the required safeguards. This article seeks to address these shortcomings by presenting a model for effective risk management. The article also provides a case study – outsourcing at Hewlett‐Packard – which shows what can be achieved if managers use the right criteria for their decisions.</jats:p>",

With this, a large portion of the workforce is working under these arrangements.

After presenting the strategy we use for satisfying customer demand, we construct an analytical model that we use to calculate relevant performance measures. Simulation shows that our model produces accurate estimates, and that the performance of the inventory system is insensitive to the lead-time distribution. After introducing a cost structure we show that the strategy we propose can result in considerable savings when compared to using only normal supply. Comparison of the results of our model with the results of other models indicates that the combined use of lateral transshipments and direct deliveries can lead to significant cost savings. </jats:p>",

A “time-inflexible contract” requires the firm to specify not only how many units it will purchase, but also the timing of the purchase. A “time-flexible contract” allows the firm to specify the purchase amount over a given period of time without specifying the exact time of purchase. Other than time flexibility, the suppliers may offer “quantity flexibility” to the firm as well, i.e., purchase quantities could be within a prespecified quantity window. Finally, “risk-sharing” features can be incorporated in the contract in terms of the purchase price that the firm eventually pays to a supplier. Within a prespecified price window the firm pays the realized price, but outside of it the firm shares, in an agreed way, added costs or benefits. </jats:p><jats:p> Given the structure of a supply contract, we study the firm's decision when to purchase and how many units in each purchase such that the expected net present value of the purchase cost plus inventory holding cost is minimized. We discuss optimal purchasing strategies for both time-flexible and time-inflexible contracts with risk-sharing features. Other interesting results include the analysis of two-supplier sourcing environments and the exploitation of quantity flexibility in such contracts. Our discussion illustrates how time flexibility, quantity flexibility, supplier selection, and risk sharing, when carefully exercised can effectively reduce the sourcing cost in environments of price uncertainty. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The level of temporary help supply (THS) employment surged during the late 1980s and the 1990s. However, we know little about where these workers were placed and, thus, there is a gap in our understanding of cyclical and trend industry employment in the U.S. To close this gap, we estimate the proportion of THS employees in each major U.S. industry during 1977-97 using information from input-output tables and from the Contingent Worker Supplements to the CPS surveys of February 1995 and February 1997. Our estimates indicate that almost all of the growth in THS employment is attributed to a change in the hiring behavior of firms, rather than to a disproportional increase in the size of more THS-intensive industries. In fact, the proportion of THS employees in each major American industry, except the public sector, increased during our sample period. These increases were particularly large in services and in manufacturing where by 1997 close to 4 percent of all employees were THS workers. The public sector, which had demanded almost 40 percent of all THS workers in 1982, hired a negligibly small number of THS workers in 1997.</jats:p>"

We point out that the magnitude and direction of the average benefit estimate obtained during such a transition period is likely to vary systematically depending upon the magnitude of the shock, the level of transaction costs and the extent to which other affected goods are substitutes or complements. We test a subset of our model's predictions using cross-sectional data on household demand for improved municipal services in post-socialist Romania. Our preliminary empirical analysis suggests that there have been substantial gains in welfare resulting from spatial adjustment following the opening up of housing markets. Furthermore, our results indicate that benefit estimates for improved water services during the transition may be substantially higher than long-run estimates. This limited evidence supports our concern that economists may recommend non-optimal levels of long-run investment, regulation, or user fees if they are unaware of the implications of future readjustment to supply or demand shocks.</jats:p>",

The objective of reconstructing dynamical attractors is to learn more about the long‐term dynamical behaviour of supply chains. Typical patterns that can be encountered through phase space reconstruction are discussed. Based on the analysis of real life supply chains first results are presented on how attractors can be used to better understand the dynamical behaviour of supply chains. The cases show that clear attractors can be identified for consumer and retailer demand. When this demand is compared with supply the phase space analysis becomes an effective tool for identifying distortion in the supply chain. The paper concludes by presenting two examples on how a better understanding of demand attractors have been used to improve operational and tactical planning.</jats:p>",

The biological traits refer to expansion, vegetative regeneration, generative reproduction, dispersal and seed bank longevity.</jats:p><jats:p>129 vegetation samples were taken in an agricultural landscape in southwestern Germany, covering a wide range of terrestrial vegetation types – but with the exception of forests and wetlands. For each site, also soil data were recorded. Mean daily soil moisture was estimated with a simple model. Soil moisture, balanced nitrogen supply and available phosphorus were combined into a factor ‘resource supply’. In addition, disturbance intensity was estimated for each site. This factor was based on (1) frequency of disturbance, (2) disturbance depth below or above the soil surface, and (3) proportion of the area affected by a discrete disturbance event. 30 plant groups with similar biological characteristics resulted from a cluster analysis, based on a compilation of 19 biological traits for a regional species pool. Logistic regression on a gradient plane of disturbance intensity and resource supply yielded response curves for 28 groups. The dependent variable was defined as the probability of encountering all members of a group in a sample. 17 groups display a significant response curve on the gradient plane. Plants with a potential for long‐ range dispersal are concentrated on sites with low or high disturbance intensities (e.g. fallow land, fields, lawns). On sites with medium disturbance intensity (e.g. meadows) and low to medium resource supply, small‐range dispersal predominates. There are no distinct trends concerning seed bank longevity. The potential for vertical and lateral expansion increases with decreasing disturbance intensity. Only at medium disturbance intensities does vertical expansion correlate positively with resource supply. Rapid detachment of daughter individuals occurs more often on productive sites than on less productive sites. Diversity of groups with similar biological traits is highest on sites with medium disturbance intensities.</jats:p>",

However, research has focused on the large firm's perspective. This paper looks at the issues from the small supplier firm's perspective. Faced with high demand uncertainty, low margins, and very high working capital requirements, such firms are unable to fully take advantage of market opportunities. Studies of small firms often take a financial or economic perspective focusing on policy or the behaviour of small clusters, and emphasize the role of networks and the diffusion of practices and technology. This paper focuses on this issue from an operations perspective, and discusses five stages in the evolution of small firms that could help them to grow and gain higher margins. The main idea is that by designing operations and the supply chain better, and by improving production practices, small firms can simultaneously handle uncertainty, overcome problems of working capital, meet market needs, and command higher prices. </jats:p>",

The fraction of UP oxygen consumption used for glucose oxidation increased by about 50% from LG to HG conditions; however, there was no change in UP oxygen consumption. Nearly half of UPGC was not accounted for by lactate, fructose, and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> production, and about two-thirds of UP oxygen consumption was not accounted for by immediate oxidation of glucose carbon just taken up by the UP. These results indicate that glucose supply directly regulates UP glucose oxidative metabolism and that there is a reciprocal relationship between UP glucose oxidation and the oxidation of other substrates. </jats:p>",

The optical mobile microrobot consists of a floating robot with a PLZT element and an air table with air nozzles and electrodes. The PLZT element is a pyroelectric element and works as a transmitter to convert energy from optical energy to electric energy. Illuminating the PLZT with UV rays generates electric energy with electrical voltage high enough to drive the robot by electrostatic force. To solve the friction problem, an air bearing helps reduce friction and the robot to move by slight force. The robot travels floating by levitation of the air bearing. These air systems make it possible for the robot to travel autonomously and to be driven by small force. This paper shows the experimental results of movement and applications of the optical mobile microrobot.</jats:p>",

By the year 2000, projected population growth will impose a peak water demand beyond available supplies. In addition, regional over‐pumping threatens the Cohansey with saltwater intrusion, placing the city wells at risk by 1998. In the early‐to mid 1990s, three broad categories of water‐supply alternatives were evaluated by regional, state, and federal agencies — additional pumping from the Cohansey, conjunctive use of the Cohansey with other aquifers, and desalination of brackish groundwater. An approach was adopted in 1996 which derives up to 2 MGD from desalination of brackish groundwater, with the remaining peak demand satisfied by short‐term pumpage from existing wells in the Cohansey. The first of two wells has been completed, yielding 1.4 MGD of brackish groundwater. Similar performance from the second well will exceed the design goal. When the initial system comes on line during the summer of 1998, New Jersey will have its first public water supply derived from desalinated groundwater. The use of desalinated groundwater balances competing demands for water resources in the southern Cape Region of New Jersey, allowing continued economic growth while reducing human impacts on a threatened aquifer.</jats:p>",

The use of the structural vector auto-regression methodology allows to identify three different shocks under the long-run neutrality assumptions implied by the vertical aggregate supply curve. An impulse response analysis shows that, for all countries considered, the dynamic adjustment of the variables in response to supply, monetary, and fiscal shocks is consistent with the considered version of the IS-LM model. In addition, the variance decompositions show that demand shocks explain a substantial part of output fluctuations at short horizons. This result stands in contrast to simple Real Business Cycle models which explain business cycles exclusively in terms of productivity shocks.</jats:p>",

In einem einfachen aggregierten Angebots-Nachfrage-Modell wird dabei zwischen Angebots- und Nachfrageschocks und ihren Wirkungen auf das reale Bruttoinlandsprodukt (BIP) sowie das Preisniveau unterschieden. Das häufig verwendete Verfahren berücksichtigt die Hypothese der temporären Wirkung von Nachfrageschocks auf das reale BIP als Vorinformation zur Berechnung der Impulse-Response-Funktionen. Diesem Vorgehen wird ein VAR-Modell gegenübergestellt, das die Annahme der langfristig senkrechten aggregierten Angebotskurve als Parameterrestriktion erfaßt. Die empirischen Untersuchungen für 18 Volkswirtschaften sowie für die EU- und die OECD-Länder insgesamt liefern teilweise brauchbare Ergebnisse. Dabei fällt auf, daß Tests der Restriktion im VAR-Modell oftmals die Ablehnung der Nullhypothese ermöglichen und zudem die Stabilität der Modelle nicht mehr unbedingt gewährleistet ist. Im Anhang werden die bei gegebenen Nullrestriktionen zulässigen Impulse- Response-Funktionen als Lösung eines Gleichungssystems vollständig beschrieben.</jats:p>",

(i) The growth stimulation in elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] was attenuated in intermediate and abolished in low nitrogen.

(iii) Elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] led to a decrease of nitrate reductase activity in low, intermediate and high ammonium nitrate and in intermediate nitrate, but not in high nitrate. (iii) At low nitrogen, starch increased relative to sugars. Elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] exaggerated this shift.

(iv) In high nitrogen, sugars rose in elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>], but there was no acclimation of photosynthetic rate, only a small decrease of Rubisco and no decrease of other Calvin cycle enzymes, and no decrease of the corresponding transcripts. In lower nitrogen, there was a marked acclimation of photosynthetic rate and a general decrease of Calvin cycle enzymes, even though sugar levels did not increase. The decreased activities were due to a general decrease of leaf protein. The corresponding transcripts did not decrease except at very low nitrogen. (v) It is concluded that many of the effects of elevated [CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] on nitrate metabolism, photosynthate allocation, photosynthetic acclimation and growth are due to a shift in nitrogen status.</jats:p>",
