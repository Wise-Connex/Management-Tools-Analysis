      "abstract": "<jats:p> Results of a greenhouse experiment, comprising soil samples taken at three depths from each of six locations in eastern Ontario, indicated that the phosphorus-supplying power of the surface was considerably greater than that of the corresponding subsurface samples of four of the soils. The relative amounts of total phosphorus in surface and subsurface samples varied with the soils, the most pronounced variation being an increase in a sandy soil with depth. The proportion of the total phosphorus found in organic form varied from 18 to 56 per cent in the surface and from 5 to 33 per cent in the subsurface samples. The amounts of acid-soluble phosphorus extracted from five of the soils increased with depth. The amounts of NaHCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-soluble phosphorus were higher in the surface than in the subsurface samples of five of the soils. The values for acid-soluble phosphorus in five of the soils and for NaHC0<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-soluble phosphorus in three of the soils were not in agreement with greenhouse results.The data from the greenhouse experiment did not indicate a pronounced difference between the potassium-supplying powers of corresponding surface and subsurface samples. Exchangeable potassium did not vary appreciably between surface and subsurface samples of four of the soils but decreased in two of the soils with depth. Water-soluble potassium decreased with depth in most instances. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Fertility investigations were conducted on samples of surface soil collected from six farms on each of five soil types occurring in the Saint John River Valley. The effect of applied potassium on the yield and potassium content of ladino clover served as a basis for evaluating several chemical methods used in assessing the potassium status of different soils.Applied potassium resulted in significant increases in yield on two soils and in the potassium content of the crop on all soils. The higher the potassium content of the crop grown without potassium fertilizer, the lower was the increase in yield from applied potassium.Soil potassium values, as determined by four chemical methods, varied significantly between soil types. Correlation coefficients relating uptake of potassium by ladino clover with the values obtained by the four methods were significant at the 1 per cent level. </jats:p>",
