This work is based upon the dividend discount model. But unlike most other uses of the model, our estimate of dividend growth is not based upon historical dividend growth. Instead, the estimate is based upon the assumption that the capital market would maintain in aggregate a constant share of gross domestic product (GDP). In order for the estimate to be correct, it is necessary that it reflect the inflows and outflows into the capital market. The inflows are the net financial new issues, and the outflows are the income generated and paid out of the capital markets. Note that the 5.4 percent real long-term forecast made here is the aggregate capital market return, not the expected return of any one asset class. Since the bond market has greater net inflows than the stock market, the stock market would have to have higher returns than the bond market to maintain its constant aggregate share of the economy.</jats:p>",

Using farm‐level panel data from Ethiopia, this study examines the effect of incorporating technical inefficiency in estimating the supply response of peasant farmers. Two systems of output supply and input demand equations are estimated and compared: the conventional model in which technical efficiency is assumed and another in which technical inefficiency is explicitly incorporated. The model with technical inefficiency is preferred on grounds of theoretical consistency and improved estimates, although model comparison tests are not conclusive. Incorporation of inefficiency generally increases the magnitudes and the statistical significance of own price elasticities, substantially so in the case of fertilizer and fertilizer‐intensive crops, and alters the priority attached to nonprice factors. An important result is that only the specification with inefficiency reveals a significant effect of access to extension services on output. Only this specification finds that output increases with household size, which one expects as the farms in the sample are largely subsistence and producing for own consumption. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that farmers' response to incentives is considerably restricted by inefficiency, suggesting that the traditional model would overstate response by excluding the efficiency variable.</jats:p>",

The asymmetric flexibility of prices appears a major factor in differentiating the expansionary and contractionary effects of fiscal and monetary shocks. Higher price inflation, relative to deflation, exacerbates output contraction, relative to expansion, in the face of monetary shocks. In contrast, larger price deflation, relative to inflation, moderates output contraction, relative to expansion in the face of government spending shocks. The growth of output and the real wage decreases, on average, in the face of monetary variability in many countries. Moreover, the growth of real output and the real wage increases, on average, in the face of government spending variability in many countries.

The technology is new to Bangladesh and becoming popular in the field of infrastructure planning and management. This study is a very preliminary endeavor in automated planning initiatives of this country. The aim of the study is to show the capabilities and potentiality of Geographic Information System (GIS) to automate and analyze the water supply system in a district headquarter, which needs information based planning for future expansion of water related services. The study analyzes the efficiency of existing water supply network system using NETWORK allocation function. The study shows that 61% of distribution path are close to the existing coverage through water pipe line. It also delineates suitable sites for setting up new overhead tanks considering the existing water supply coverage, water demands in different landuses and their relative weighted valuation using Model Builder tool of ARC View. It has been identified that 1028132 m2 (13% of the Pourashava area) in different locations is suitable for constructing new tanks. The study will assist to adopt the appropriate policy measures in order to safeguard the interest of people for drinking water supply.</jats:p>"

Moreover, shortening a supply chain has been a main issue in supply chain management. Shortening supply chain means reducing the process time required for supply chain activities, which are logistics, business, information, cash flow and design process, etc. This study proposes methods of shortening supply chain based on the activities listed above together with their classification and descriptions. To analyze the cause and effect between those solutions and methods of shortening supply chain, this study uses the cause and effect diagram as a supporting method. Additionally, to understand the efficiency of these methods, this study builds up a supply chain performance measure to evaluate the efficiency of methods of shortening supply chain. </jats:p>",

Four massive first- and second-century wells contained remains of two types of mechanical water-lifting machines or bucket-chain systems. The discoveries allowed identification of a similar bucket-chain from the Cheapside Roman baths, found 50 years earlier by Ivor Noël Hume of the Guildhall Museum. Archaeological and engineering analysis has revealed the water-lifting capacity of the machines, which could have supplied a significant proportion of the town’s population with clean water.</jats:p>",

These trends were based on data published in annual reports to Congress on the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act by the Office of Special Education Programs, U.S. Department of Education. Rapid growth in teacher demand for students with disabilities aged 3—5 years was found, whereas the growth in teacher demand for students aged 6—21 years was more gradual and paralleled the rate of growth in teacher demand in general education. Although teacher demand was mostly satisfied by growth in the supply of fully certified teachers, the shortage of fully certified teachers for students with disabilities aged 6—21 years has been chronic since 1987/1988 and has increased annually, from 7.4% in 1993/1994 to 13.4% in 2002/2003 (a shortage of approximately 54,000 special education teachers, including estimated vacant positions). </jats:p>",

The amount of Earth's net primary production (NPP) required to support human activities is a powerful measure of the aggregate impact on the biosphere and indicator of societal vulnerability to climate change. Biophysical models were applied to consumption data to estimate the annual amount of Earth's terrestrial net primary production humans require for food, fiber (including fabrication) and fuel using the same modeling architecture as satellite‐supported NPP measurements. The amount of NPP required was calculated on a per capita basis and projected onto a global map of population to create a spatially explicit map of NPP‐carbon “demand” in units of elemental carbon. NPP demand was compared to a map of Earth's average annual net primary production or “supply” created using 17 years (1982–1998) of AVHRR vegetation index to produce a geographically accurate balance sheet of NPP‐carbon “supply” and “demand” for the globe. Globally, humans consume 20% of Earth's total net primary production on land. Regionally, the NPP‐carbon balance percentage varies from 6% to over 70% and locally from near 0% to over 30,000% in major urban areas. Scenarios modeling the impact of per capita consumption, population growth, and technology suggest that NPP demand is likely to increase substantially in the next 40 years despite better harvesting and processing efficiencies.</jats:p>",

The Chinese government has recently started a bioethanol project, and has produced about 1 million tons of ethanol fuel from corn and wheat in 2005. As it has the largest population in the world and limited lands for food production, cellulosic ethanol would be a more suitable choice for China. Many research projects in China on biodegradation and biotransformation of lignocellulosics have been carried out. Furthermore, understanding the biodegradation mechanism of lignocellulosics and developing practical processes for ethanol production have been ongoing. After more than 30 years of research, several pilot scale facilities have been set up, and lots of experience has been acquired. However, the calculated production cost of cellulosic ethanol is still higher than that of corn ethanol. To overcome this problem, the biorefinery conception has been introduced into research on lignocellulosics transformation. A corncob biorefinery process has been developed in Shandong University. By combining the cellulase and ethanol production with a xylose‐related products production, the total production cost can be reduced. A scale of 50 000‐ton/year cellulosic ethanol biorefinery is being planned to be built at Yucheng.</jats:p>",

We form hypotheses using the value chain to specify the expected financial impact of SCM systems. By examining the change in financial performance pre‐ and post‐adoption controlling for industry median changes in performance, we find that SCM systems increase gross margin, inventory turnover, market share, return on sales, and reduce selling, general, and administrative expenses. We also provide a model showing how process improvements around supply chain initiatives combine to improve overall performance. Finally, we show that contextual effects such as firms in the high‐tech industry and the scope of the supply chain implementation have dramatic effects on the overall financial performance resulting from supply chain implementations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Increasing fatty acid supply in adult rat increases myocardial fatty acid oxidation. Plasma levels of fatty acids increase post-surgery in infants undergoing cardiac bypass operation to correct congenital heart defects. How a newborn heart responds to increased fatty acid supply remains to be determined. In this study, we examined whether the tissue levels of malonyl CoA decrease to relieve the inhibition on carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I when the myocardium is exposed to higher concentrations of long-chain fatty acids in newborn rabbit heart. We then tested the contribution of the enzymes that regulate tissue levels of malonyl CoA, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), and malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD). Our results showed that increasing fatty acid supply from 0.4 mmol/L (physiological) to 1.2 mmol/L (pathological) resulted in an increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation rates and this was accompanied by a decrease in tissue malonyl CoA levels. The decrease in malonyl CoA was not related to any alterations in total and phosphorylated acetyl CoA carboxylase protein or the activities of acetyl CoA carboxylase and malonyl CoA decarboxylase. Our results suggest that the regulatory role of malonyl CoA remained when the hearts were exposed to high levels of fatty acids.</jats:p>",

A number of PhACs and EDCs were detected in the WWTP effluents, at concentrations ranging from ng/L to low µ-g/L. Although these compounds were generally removed from WWTP effluents during wastewater treatment, some compounds, such as carbamazepine were more persistent. Some target PhACs and EDCs were detected at low ng/L levels in the surface and potable water in this study. Currently, there is no evidence that trace amounts of PhACs and EDCs in Calgary's waterways can have a health impact on humans, but they may pose adverse chronic effects on aquatic life.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The United States' environment and economy have been severely impacted by unintentionally introduced biological organisms for the last 100 years. Our ecosystems and biological reserves of conservation importance are regularly invaded by non-indigenous species. To help prevent future invaders from entering the ports, this project undertaken at the Port of Elizabeth proposed to: 1. Catalog the different vegetable and fruit crops entering this country; 2. Evaluate the potential risk to New Jersey crops that an introduced exotic pest might pose; and 3. Evaluate the potential that imported crops entering the U.S. have for harboring exotic pests. The New Jersey IMPORT report, or Invasive Management Promoting Open and Responsible Trade project [1], details a newly designed ecological risk assessment tool to evaluate entry potential of invasive pests at the Port of Elizabeth. Risk designations were assigned to shipments of four fruits; seven vegetables; and two field/forage crops based on: i) Country of origin; ii) Amounts of commodities imported; and iii) Endemic pests present in exporting countries. Between 5,000 and 180,000 tons of crops were imported into the Port of Elizabeth from October 2001 to 2003. Pest risk analyses were drafted for twenty-five intercepted insects taken from the Port Information Network. In addition, eighteen pest risk analyses were drafted for invasive fungi, bacteria, and viruses of global concern as alerted by ProMed Digest. It was concluded that three crops imported remain at high risk: apples, peppers, and tomatoes. Peaches, soybeans, lettuce, sweet corn, potatoes, squash, and eggplant imported were considered moderate risk. Blueberries, cranberries, and alfalfa were considered low risk. </jats:p>",

Carrière) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) in primary Michigan forests depend on decaying wood for seedling-establishment sites, but seedling densities vary across wood species (hemlock, yellow birch, and sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.)). We collected seedlings and wood from a natural field experiment and conducted a companion greenhouse experiment to determine whether seedling mass and nitrogen (N) content varied with wood species and whether they were related to wood inorganic N supply. Yellow birch seedlings were largest on hemlock wood in the field (P = 0.003) and greenhouse (but P &gt; 0.05), while hemlock seedling mass did not vary across wood species. N concentration and N mineralization rate varied by species (N concentration: hemlock &lt; yellow birch &lt; maple; N mineralization rate: hemlock &gt; yellow birch ≈ maple), but neither seedling mass nor N content was significantly correlated with wood inorganic N supply. In the greenhouse, yellow birch seedlings responded to fertilization with N when growing on hemlock and maple but not yellow birch wood and appear to be limited by phosphorus when growing on yellow birch wood. We conclude that yellow birch seedling growth varies with wood species, and is limited by both N and phosphorus, while hemlock seedlings are unresponsive to variation in wood species during the first two growing seasons. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper proposes a new method based on exact power and loss allocation for bilateral transactions under the enhanced single buyer model in the Thai electricity supply industry (Thai ESI). Generally, a transmission network is designed to transfer mainly active power. The transmission pricing for this active power charge in the Thai ESI comprises three components, namely the transmission use‐of‐system charge, the connection charge, and the common service charge. However, the calculation of transmission pricing, using marginal cost scheme, might not ensure revenue requirements of the transmission owner in case of a high reactive power demand in the network because a part of transmission line capacity is subsequently required for the reactive power transfer. Thus, the triangle method is used to segregate the transmission pricing by classifying active and reactive charges. The users are charged regarding their system usages by applying the exact power and loss allocation method. The proposed transmission pricing sends economic incentives to the users with fair charges. It ensures an investment recovery of the transmission owner in case of high reactive demand in the network. The Thai power 424‐bus network demonstrates the method exemplarily.

This stimulation was transient on low N‐supply and persisted throughout the whole vegetative growth only in high N‐supply. Acclimation on low N–high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was not associated with carbohydrate accumulation or with a strong reduction in Rubisco amount or activity. At high N‐supply, growth stimulation by high CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was mainly because of the acceleration of leaf production and expansion while other parameters such as specific leaf area, root/shoot ratio and g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub> appeared to be correlated with total leaf area. Our results thus suggest that, in strictly controlled and stable growing conditions, acclimation of <jats:italic>A. thaliana</jats:italic> to long‐term CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment is mostly controlled by growth rate adjustment.</jats:p>",
