      "abstract": "<jats:p>В статье рассматривается экономическое поведение фирмы — поставщика товара фирмам‑потребителям при определении объема поставки в зависимости от условий контракта. Рассматриваются две ситуации. Первая заключается в том, что фирма‑поставщик при возможных колебаниях относительно известного в среднем объема поставки обосновывает в контракте такой ее размер, который обеспечивает ей максимум ожидаемого дохода с учетом возможного экономического ущерба при отклонениях от значений интервала поставки, оговоренных в кон тракте. Фирма‑поставщик экономически заинтересована в поставке такого объема продукции, который не выходит из допустимого интервала. В этом случае потребитель согласно контракту приобретает весь объем произведен‑ ной продукции по определенной цене за единицу продукции. Если поставка продукции окажется меньше или больше оговоренных в контракте границ, то в этом случае потребитель вынужден будет осуществлять дополнительные трансакционные издержки. Вторая ситуация описывается моделью взаимодействия «фирма‑поставщик — фирма‑потребитель» в цепи поставок. В качестве фирмы‑потребителя рассматриваются такие, которые принимают дальнейшие решения по промежуточному товару (технологическое использование, определение цены, действия по продвижению товара), а потому влияют на прибыли фирмы‑производителя. Такие фирмы‑потребители стремятся реализовать свой экономический интерес в условиях контракта. В работе считается, что взаимоотношения между фирмой‑производителем и фирмой‑потребителем регулируются таким контрактом, в котором расчет между фирмами определяется по линейному тарифу. В случае отсутствия полной вертикальной интеграции фирмы действуют на рынке независимо друг от друга и максимизируют собственную прибыль. Также анализируется величина получаемой участниками прибыли для случая, когда фирма-потребитель осуществляет продажу товара конечному потребителю в цепи поставок со скидками</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>The article discusses the economic behavior of the sup‑ plier of goods to companies‑consumers in determining the volume of supply, depending on the terms of the contract. Two situations are considered. The first is that the supplier company, with possible fluctuations relative to the average supply volume, justifies in the contract its size that provides it with the maximum expected income, taking into account possible economic damage when deviations from the delivery interval values specified in the contract. The supplier com‑ pany is economically interested in supplying such a volume of products that does not go beyond the allowable interval. In this case, the consumer, according to the contract, acquires the entire volume of goods produced at a certain price per unit of production. If the supply of products turns out to be less or more than the boundaries specified in the contract, then the consumer will be forced to incur additional transaction costs. The second situation is described by the model of company‑supplier interaction – the company‑consumer in the supply chain. Considered as a consumer company are those who make further decisions on intermediate goods (technological use, price determination, product promotion actions), and therefore affect the profits of the manufacturing company. Such consumer firms seek to realize their economic interest in the conditions of the contract. The paper consid‑ ers that the relationship between a manufacturing company and a consumer company is governed by a contract in which settlement between firms is determined according to a linear tariff. In the absence of complete vertical integration, firms operate independently in the market and maximize their own profits. It also analyzes the amount of profit received by par‑ ticipants for the case when the consumer company sells goods to the final consumer in the supply chain with discounts</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The underlying insolvency and liquidity loss of the vast majority of banks is the presence of problem debt in them, or ‘toxic assets.’ At the same time, the presence of a significant part of the problem debt in the loan portfolio of domestic banks leads to an increase in stress assets and reduces the possibility of lending to the national economy. In addition, the growth of problem debt has constantly led to an increase in reserves for such loans. And if you add another revaluation to the hryvnia equivalent of troubled currency loans, under which also needed to form reserves, then quite logical was the activity of some banks, aimed at getting rid of troubled loans by selling to a third party (mostly factoring companies).\n\nAn analysis of expert and court practice in claims for debt collection under a loan agreement in the event of a deferral of the claim through the sale of a loan portfolio and by concluding a factoring agreement indicates that there are problematic issues due to the fact that the materials of the case submitted for research do not include the proper executed documents confirming the transition of the right of claim and its volume, and the petition of experts on cases of confirmation of arrears under loan agreements in the presence of documents in the case file overs factoring, cessions are usually partially satisfied. Input data for conducting an examination, in many cases, is reflected ambiguously in the materials provided for research.\n\nIn this article, the authors considered the relationship between banks and financial or factoring companies. But it should be noted that there are asset management companies, in addition, Ukrainian legislation allows the creation of corporate and unit investment funds.\n\nTaking into account the foregoing, in order to find solutions and work out common methodological approaches we invite all experts to professional discussion and exchange of experience. After summarizing the information on this topic, the issues that will arise will be highlighted in the following articles.\n\nKey words: loan portfolio, cession, factoring, bad debts.</jats:p>",

Owing to the randomness of transient measurements, a performance bound for the extended blockage detection exists which estimated parameters cannot exceed. The Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) theorem is utilized to compute the lower bound variance of noise-induced estimation errors. It gives the minimum mean square error of any estimator according to information obtained from measurements and quantified by Fisher information. The Fisher information matrix is computed using direct differentiation of the compatibility equations obtained by the method of characteristics. The influence of relevant physical parameters including valve closure time, measurement time length and noise level on the best possible localization of blockage is investigated. The connection between the signal bandwidth, noise level and the performance limit is quantified for a typical case study. The results demonstrate trade-off between the size and the location/length of blockage estimates subject to different maneuver times, roughly offering half the wave speed times maneuver duration as the resolution limit.</jats:p>",

Past research has focussed on the modus operandi of the technology, providing indications for wider future adoption. 3DP is predicted to complement current production processes and is anticipated to have a profound effect on the value chain and, therefore, on supply chain (SC) management.

They are supply auction model with demand resource pooling, demand auction model with supply resource pooling, and double auction model with demand and supply resource pooling. For the proposed auction models, the authors present three corresponding algorithms to allocate resources in the auction process by linear programming, and study the incentive compatibility and define the Walrasian equilibriums for the proposed auction models.

In addition, relational embeddedness mediates the positive relationship between manufacturer structural embeddedness and network rent, as the null model with no mediation appears to underestimate the direct and positive effect between manufacturer structural embeddedness and the network rent.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study makes three key contributions. First, it extends the application of both relational and structural embeddedness to grasp the network architecture of the triadic supply chain. Second, the concept of manufacturer structural embeddedness is used to elaborate on the role of the manufacturer in establishing relationships of high quality with the supplier and the customer. In connection to the previous point, the calculated network rent demonstrates that establishing collaborative relationships in triadic supply chains may bring a significant supernormal profit, derived as the outcome of mutual interplay between the relational performances of two dyads.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The study shows that manufacturers intending to use their central position to develop collaborative relationships with both partners, and the supplier and the customer, ought to appreciate the role of social ties embedded in interorganizational networks. The paper also implies that in parallel with using formal contracts as a governance mechanism, the manufacturer centrally positioned in the triadic supply chains ought to deliberately shape relational embeddedness of both dyads. Finally, managers can consider the ways to enhance relational embeddedness in a triad by improving relational embeddedness of a certain dyad.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This study provides a novel framework for studying two basic dimensions of embeddedness (structural and relational) and their impact on the network rent in triadic supply chains that goes beyond the dyadic perspective and incorporates the extended supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The objective of the research was to identify some factors which caused the lateness in delivering raw materials until it comes on time at spring bed factory, a company which produces spring beds. Within these 2 years the company has had the problem of providing raw materials which are often delivered late so that the company cannot meet consumers’ demand punctually. In consequence it suffers financial loss. The research used HOR (HOR I and HOR II) by identifying risk event and risk agent. The result of the identification with HOR I risk agent, it was found that the lateness was caused by the lateness of ship arrival, the lateness in supplying raw materials, dependency on parent company. To mitigate risk agent, mitigating strategy (HOR II) was organized such as making work contract with suppliers that came from parent company in order to communicate directly with suppliers, procuring raw materials from 2 weeks to 2 months before they were needed, and doing multiple routes.</jats:p>",

Supply chain management is one of the important issues that are a concern for companies that want to continue to increase consumer satisfaction, increase payment utility, and save expenses. For this reason, a supply chain performance measurement system is needed. The purpose of this paper is to build a supply chain performance measurement framework using the supply chain operation reference (SCOR) model as a tool for supply chain performance measurement. One of the causes of various failure of improvement programs in the supply chain is the inability to obtain an overview of the current condition of the company, including its cultural aspects. The use of the SCOR model in building the concept of supply chain performance measurement makes companies able to evaluate supply chain performance holistically in monitoring and knowing where an organization is relative to competitors. This paper focuses on the application of the SCOR model for supply chain performance measurement in manufacturing companies. Some tools are described in this paper as a proposal to build a performance measurement framework in optimizing value in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study examined the nature and structure of alternative supply of electricity in Nigeria. It has been observed that all the efforts of the Nigerian government to improve electricity supply and promote access to electricity have been proving abortive and households at various levels are confronted with the challenge of searching for alternative supply of electricity. Also, state government and some private organizations are interested in solving this challenge, but they lack appropriate empirically grounded information on the choice of alternative source of electricity. The study, which is a pure exploratory one, used primary data through well-structured questionnaire from a sample of 4,758 households across 16 local governments in Ekiti State of Nigeria. Applying descriptive statistics, the strengths and weaknesses of various alternative sources of electricity supply among households were analyzed. The results indicate that rechargeable appliances, electricity generating set, inverter and solar/inverter are the four major types of alternative sources of electricity supply common among the households. It was also revealed that out of all the positive ratings such as regularity in supply, ease of maintenance and capacity, solar powered source of alternative electricity supply appears to be the best. The only rating that is unfavorable to the solar type of alternative sources of electricity supply is in the area of affordability. Government and interested private organizations should embark on establishment of solar powered stations for some communities or distribution of solar panels and inverters at subsidized rate to households to improve their socio-economic well-being.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally, in the area of production and operations management, the financial states and decision-makers’ behaviour regarding loss have been ignored in the supply chain, which may lead to infeasible or unrealistic practices or even catastrophic losses in practical supply chain operations. Therefore, this study aims to provide a model for operational efficiency in a financially constrained supply-chain system consisting of a financially deficient retailer, a supplier, and a bank, and to analyse the impact of the behaviour of the bank and the supplier on the operational decision. It is assumed that the bank provides a loan to the retailer considering the supplier’s credit guarantee for the retailer. The supplier’s credit guarantee implies that, if the retailer goes bankrupt after the sales season, then a pre-guaranteed proportion of the retailer’s loan is repaid by the supplier. Moreover, to capture the decision-makers’ behaviour regarding loss, it is assumed that the supplier and the bank are loss-averse in their risk preference on the final profit. Under this circumstance, it is intended to draw the theoretical implications by analysing a loss-averse behaviour model for a supplier and a bank, in which a kinked piecewise linear and concave utility function is considered. The optimal decision is analytically derived for the retailer (the optimal order quantity), the supplier (the optimal wholesale price), and the bank (the optimal interest rate). In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate how the model parameters affect the optimal decision for the retailer, the supplier, and the bank under different degrees of loss-aversion. The optimal decisions are shown to be highly affected by the degree of the loss-aversion coefficient of the bank and the supplier and to be more conservative than the result in the traditional case which optimises the risk-neutral expected profit (the unit degree of loss-aversion). The analytical results can be summarised as follows. First, as the wholesale price and the interest rate increase, the optimal order quantity decreases. Second, the more loss-averse the supplier is, the higher the optimal wholesale price that is offered to the retailer by the supplier. Third, the larger the credit guarantee that is provided to the retailer by the supplier, the higher the optimal wholesale price that is provided to the retailer. Fourth, the more loss-averse the bank is, the higher the interest rate that is offered to the retailer; and the larger the credit guarantee that is provided by the supplier, the lower the interest rate that is offered to the retailer.</jats:p>"

Then, the FAHP is applied to identify the importance of each factor in the hospital supply chain, as an example of the service sector. To extract and predict the factors’ interactions, the knowledge base of the fuzzy if-then rules is constructed. The developed Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) gives insights on the supply chain features with significant impact on the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives. So, by predicting and strategically managing the affecting factors, service supply chain managers can have more effective and sustainable performance. The fuzzy surfaces indicate that the features of the macro environment, especially the government regulations, are crucial factors influencing the movement toward sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supplier development and supplier integration are two deeply interconnected strategic tools that manufacturers often employ to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of their supply chains. This paper studies the interaction of these two strategic decisions in a competitive environment. Specifically, we consider a duopoly model where two supply chains, each consisting of one manufacturer and one supplier, sell substitutable products in the market. Each manufacturer orders components from its supplier and decides whether to integrate with the supplier and how much to invest to help reduce its cost. We find that, in most cases, a manufacturer invests more on supplier development after it integrates with its supplier; and both manufacturers integrate with their suppliers at equilibrium. However, when the heterogeneity of the manufacturers’ supplier development capabilities is sufficiently high and the more capable manufacturer integrates, the less capable manufacturer would invest less on supplier development after integrating its supplier; and at equilibrium, the less capable manufacturer prefers not to integrate. Furthermore, when considering the suppliers’ incentives to be integrated, we find that the less capable manufacturer is more likely not to integrate with its supplier. We also extend our model to another commonly seen sourcing structure, that is, diversified sourcing, where each manufacturer sources from two common suppliers (but each only considers supplier integration and development for one distinct supplier). In contrast to the previous case (which we call dedicated sourcing), under diversified sourcing, supplier integration of a manufacturer always leads to its more supplier development investment and both manufacturers would integrate at equilibrium. Finally, when each manufacturer could choose whether to source from one or two suppliers, we show that dedicated sourcing is the equilibrium structure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the recent decades, fashion brands and retailers in the West have introduced supplier’s Codes of Conduct (CoC) to strengthen international labour standards in their supply chain. Drawing from the concept of workers’ agency and the theory of reciprocity, this paper examines the implementation of CoC from the workers’ perspective and identifies the mechanism used by the workers to negotiate with their employer. Qualitative data was collected from forty semi-structured interviews with mangers, union representative and workers at a garment factory in Vietnam which manufactures clothes to a few well-known fashion brands in the US and Europe. The findings show that, externally, workers are united with the management in hiding non-compliance practices to pass labour audits while, internally, workers challenge the management about long working hours and low pay. This finding highlights the active roles workers play on the two fronts: towards their clients and towards the management. Their collaboration is motivated by the expectation that the management will return the favour by addressing their demands through a reciprocal exchange principle. This paper sheds light on an alternative approach to understanding collective bargaining and labour activism at the bottom of the supply chain and provides recommendations for further research.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In health care markets, moral hazard is conventionally viewed as a demand‐side phenomenon in which insurance causes patients to use more care because it reduces the price they have to pay for care. However, demand‐side moral hazard cannot explain why U.S. per capita health care costs are much higher than those of countries with universal coverage and lower out‐of‐pocket charges. Instead, blame rests with a phenomenon that may be called supply‐side moral hazard, which occurs when third‐party payment removes the constraints the demand curve would otherwise exert over the prices providers charge, and the quantity of expensive services they can sell. Public institutions are better positioned than private entities to address supply‐side moral hazard. This helps explain why the other wealthy democracies—both those with single‐payer systems, like Canada, and those with multipayer systems and all‐payer procedures for setting provider rates, like Germany and Switzerland—spend much less per capita than the United States. Although managed care achieved some success in controlling U.S. provider prices in the 1990s, in the longer term, it motivated increasing market concentration among providers, which vitiated cost control. Furthermore, managed care exacerbates inequity and complexity, problems that public price regulation avoids.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a supply-chain (SC) coordination method based on the lead-time crashing is proposed for a seller–buyer system. By considering different transportation modes, we control the lead-time (LT) variability. For the first time, we have attempted to determine the impact of the reliable and unreliable seller in a continuous-review supply-chain model under the stochastic environment. The authors discussed two reliability cases for the seller. First, we consider the seller is unreliable and in the second case, the seller is reliable. In addition, the demand during the lead time is stochastic with the known mean and variance. The proposed approach tries to find an optimal solution that performs well without a specific probability distribution. Besides, a discrete investment is made to reduce the setup cost, which will indirectly help supply-chain members to increase the total profit of the system. In the proposed model, the seller motivates the buyer by reducing lead time to take part in coordinating decision-making for the system’s profit optimization. We derive the coordination conditions for both members, the seller and the buyer, under which they are convinced to take part in the cooperative decision-making plan. Therefore, lead-time crashing is the proposed incentive mechanism for collaborative supply-chain management. We use a fixed-charge step function to calculate the lead-time crashing cost for slow and fast shipping mode. We give two numerical examples to validate the proposed models and demonstrate the service-level enhancement under the collaborative supply-chain management in case of an unreliable seller. Concluding remarks and future extensions are discussed at the end.</jats:p>"

The main elements forming the supply chain are explored: suppliers of raw materials/materials and purchased parts, manufacturers and subcontractors, carriers, warehousing companies, logistics centers, intermediaries, distribution network companies, wholesale companies, retail companies, consumers. The structure of the mechanism of supply chain formation, based on five functions, is offered: planning, purchasing of stocks, production and sales of products, return. Planning finds out the sources of supply, the demand of consumers, the size of stocks, production volumes, raw materials and materials. Procurement is the supply management, selection and evaluation of a supplier, quality control of deliveries, contracting with suppliers. Production is the production process itself, the control over technological changes, the management of production capacities, production cycles, the quality of production, the schedule of industrial changes. Sales are the management of orders, warehouse and transportation. Return is required in case of problems with the orders. The feature of the proposed mechanism is that special attention is paid to information provision. It involves not only collecting and processing the information, but also adoption and implementation of decisions, therefore, it occupies a significant place in the mechanism. The generalization of the structure of the mechanism of the supply chain formation will increase the efficiency of establishing the logistics links of the enterprise.</jats:p>"

The research focuses on the hardware and software of the system. The hardware part consists of the embedded processor CS89712, Flash7861 memory, Ethernet, touch screen, and LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The software system is based on asymmetric information theory design and is divided into signal acquisition, input signal detection, interference signal processing, and power signal output. The experimental results show that it is compared with the traditional supply chain information system. The designed system seamlessly integrates the hardware and software components to achieve maximum information supply in the shortest amount of time. The power supply capacity is four times that of the traditional system, and the node coverage is high. When the number of data nodes is 120, the traditional supply chain system is basically unable to supply, but the supply accuracy of the intelligent supply chain is still as high as 48%. The research in this paper has certain guiding significance for intelligent technology development, supply chain system design, and enterprise information exchange.</jats:p>"

The results confirm the positive effects of collaborative activities on environmental performance and the positive relationship between collaborative activities and green certification programs in both small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large-sized firms. Contrary to general belief, firm size did not moderate the relationship between autonomous collaborative activities and green activities. However, other relationships were supported in the research model, thus firm size partially moderates the relationships of collaborative activities with implementation activities and environmental performance. The study demonstrates that implementation activities play a key role in improving collaborative activities with suppliers and vendors for sustainable supply chain innovation. Additionally, it contributes to the practice of sustainable supply chain innovation as well as to efficiency through collaborative activities in the supply chain process.</jats:p>"

Information Technology &amp;communication have made the operations of supply chain much easier and all pervasive. The demands for operating globally has increased and businesses have transformed and identified valuable hidden sources to tap liquidity from within their own processes. [1]. Supply chain finance (SCF) is a hot topic in business circles and connects with supply chain management and trade finance. Organizations the world over are trying to merge the approach of supply chain management and trade finance into tangible benefits. With cash drying up &amp; credit squeeze, Organizations are tapping new sources to finance their working capital needs and avenues for cost reduction are being explored in the entire supply chain. Financial managers have taken the lead to acquirecash and generate savings from supply chain logistics. For Organizations, working capital management is a key priority for increasing profitability without compromising on the day-to-day liquidity available for business. SCF is a niche segment in liquidity management &amp; enormous value can be derived by pulling unnecessary cash locked from the processes in supply chain. This paper is an attempt to study the various supply chain finance topics in discussion today and how it is affects the working capital of an Organization. [2]</jats:p>"

Therefore, the paper aims at presenting a novel framework to optimise LASC design while fulfilling the aforementioned gaps. The first step utilises Lean tools to identify the optimal architecture of product families through the so-called Leagile bill-of-material in product design. This phrase intends to reduce the storage keeping unit of components (leaner) while increasing their combining ability in a wider range of new products (more agile). Meanwhile, the second stage outlines the preliminary configuration of the future supply chain and transforms it into the Lean system. Next, the supplier network of this chain is matched with the product structure. The last step formulates the issue in one mathematical model to define the optimal LASC’s configuration, which includes positioning the best DP in various delivery lead time. In discussing the obtained solutions, the article complements to the theoretical basis by examining the locations of DP corresponding to the product’s complexity. The whole framework is illustrated by one specific example and solved by Priority Generic Algorithm Meta-Heuristic, programed with MATLAB.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Systems that supply medicinal gases—oxygen, nitrous oxide and medical air—serve all care units of a hospital; for example, they feed distribution systems for operating theatres, neonatal and pediatric units, dialysis, X-ray, casualty, special tests, outpatients, etc. Systems for the provision of medicinal gases are therefore critical in guaranteeing hospital sustainability, since the functionality or availability of other hospital systems depends on them. Availability of 100% in these systems would avoid the need to reschedule patient appointments. It would also eliminate repeat testing, which poses risk to staff and patients, and could avoid affecting people’s lives through unavailability of, for example, operating theatres or intensive care units. All this contributes to a more rational resource consumption and an increase in quality of care both for the hospital itself and for patients and visitors. Although these systems are of vital importance to health care organizations, no previous work has been found in the literature that optimizes the technical decisions on supply in these systems. This research describes a model for these systems via continuous-time Markov chains. The results obtained are used in a multicriteria model constructed with the measuring attractiveness by a categorical-based evaluation technique (MACBETH) approach. In order to assess reliability when incorporating doubt or uncertainty via the MACBETH approach, the model has been validated by means of the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process. The aim is to obtain the best objective decision, with respect to the design of these systems, by analyzing the use of economic resources, the risks, and the impact on hospital activity, all with the aim of guaranteeing the best quality of care. The models constructed by means of MACBETH and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process give, as the most suitable alternatives, duplicate the external supply in medical oxygen systems and maintain the original design conditions for supply systems of nitrous oxide and medicinal air.</jats:p>"

The quantity of water supplied was measured by calculating discharges from water tapes at the three selected locations in the distribution system. A total of thirty samples were collected from ten union councils out of fourteen covering urban Mardan. A number of issues are highlighted in the overall water supply infrastructure and short, mid, and long term remedial measures are recommended. The results are presented in the form of an interactive map using Google Earth and VBA based dynamic database. It was found that the overall quality of water is generally acceptable for drinking. However, the presence of bacteria is an issue in many cases which needs to be resolved. A significant decrease in discharge is observed in the distribution systems away from the source due to leakages and illegal connections. A comprehensive overhaul of both management and infrastructure is required for sustainable and satisfactory level of services.</jats:p>"

Nowadays container shipping is one of the main transport modes in the global economy. The ability to connect distant production centres with consumption centres largely influenced the acceleration of the global trade. Due to the globalization and characteristics of the global trade it is almost impossible to perceive global supply chains without maritime transport. Although the efficiency of the supply chain is a crucial factor of the economic perspective of supply chain management, not much space is devoted to that issue in the literature. The main purpose of this paper is to design and develop a model of an economic efficiency evaluation system of maritime container supply chains. Some general research methods, such as a critical literature review and methods of logical reasoning were used to achieve this goal. Additionally some economic modelling methods were adapted. Thepresented model isdeveloping the current state-of-the-art knowledge in the field of economic efficiency evaluation of supply chains. Unfortunately this model could not be confronted with real business data due to research limitations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Construction project implementation process is often found inefficiency and problems at every stage of the construction process. Inefficiencies are caused because construction projects have high levels of fragmentation. The high level of fragmentation cannot be separated from the complexity and many work items on construction projects. To reduce the problem of inefficiencies in the implementation of construction projects required good supply chain management or better known as supply chain management (SCM) on construction projects. Therefore it is necessary to study the management of SCM in the construction project to reduce the inefficiency that occurred. SCM management of construction projects is done by designing SCM performance measurement systems in construction projects. This performance measurement system produces indicators that are combined with the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method. So it helps in performing SCM performance measurement on construction projects. From the design results, obtained 14 SCM performance indicators on construction projects. The performance indicators are then used to perform SCM performance measurement of cement plant construction projects. From the measurement results obtained SCM performance value of 41 from a scale of 100. This shows the performance of SCM on construction projects for the construction of the cement plant is at a marginal level.</jats:p>"

The study sought to establish the effect of vendor management, risk management, information technology adoption and value for money effect on procurement optimization. To achieve this, the researcher reviewed both theoretical and empirical literature and proposed the research methodology that addressed the gaps identified in literature as well as answer the stipulated research questions. The study employed a descriptive research design.Methodology: The study targeted 136 respondents including the Chief Finance Officers in charge of Finance and Economic Planning, Heads of the Supply Chain Management Unit and Procurement staff at the departmental level. The researcher prefers this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The target population was the procurement staff at each county government. Pilot study was carried out to establish the validity and reliability of the research instruments. The instruments were designed appropriately according to the study objectives. The data collected were analyzed by use of descriptive and inferential statistics. The study used multiple regression and correlation analysis to show the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. The data generated were keyed in and analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) to generate information which was presented using charts, frequencies and percentages.Results: The study found that vendor managed inventory systems, material resource planning and bar coding of items were deduced to play a significant influence in cost reduction, in lead time reduction and in increasing customer satisfaction. The study concluded that information technology adoption greatest effect on procurement optimization in selected county governments in Kenya followed by vendor management then value for money while risk management had the least effect on the procurement optimization in selected county governments in Kenya in Kenya.Contribution to policy and practice: The study recommended for the county governments to ensure that there is use inventory management system and automated recording, cycle counting Inventory control; use of E.O.G and that it’s important for the county governments to Identify and deal with risks proactively.</jats:p>"

The system, including electrical and thermal loads, is connected to the upstream network. The bidirectional operation is defined for the system, and the system can buy energy from the grid or sell energy to the grid. A water electrolyzer is applied to produce hydrogen from water and store electricity in the form of hydrogen. The stored hydrogen supplies the thermal loads, as well as the fuel cell. The electrical loads are directly connected to the grid and are supplied by the grid. The electricity is received from the fuel cell at hours 17 to 22. When the price of electricity is high, the electrical loads can receive their power from the fuel cell rather than the grid. Additionally, any excess electricity may be sold to the grid. The uncertainty in the thermal and electrical loads is modeled and formulated as stochastic programming. The hydrogen is fed to the fuel cell and the thermal loads. The proposed model minimizes the daily operational cost of the system. The results demonstrate that the daily operational cost of the system is $22.274 USD/day. The bidirectional operation reduces the daily operational cost by about 79%. The unceratinty increases the cost by about 15%.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the buyer power of national retailers reduced the wholesale price, but the impact on local retailers remained uncertain. Although increasing buyer power initially increased the local retailer’s wholesale price and caused the ‘waterbed effect’, we found that this effect reverted when the buyer power reached a point at which the ‘anti-waterbed effect’ appeared. The opposite was true of the retail price. However, buyer power reduced the average retail price, and consumer welfare improved.</jats:p>"

The logistics sector has been known as a major contributor in polluting and consuming enormous amount of resources. This study therefore aims to provide insight into how sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) influences performance of organizations operating in the logistics sector. This study went further to focus on the intermediary function of competitive advantage in the SSCM and organizational performance relationship. Questionnaires were distributed to solicit information from 190 logistics managers. Data were analysed using partial least square method of structural equation modelling. Analysis of the data indicates that SSCM significantly and positively influence competitive advantage and organizational performance. In addition, competitive advantage also proved to significantly influence organizational performance. Competitive advantage indirectly has a significant impact on the SSCM and organizational performance relationship. The findings of the study provide key information to managers and academics in understanding the essence of integrating sustainability in supply chain management (SCM) and how the integration influences organizational performance in the current business and industrial setting.</jats:p>"

The study specific objectives were to establish the effect of procurement planning on performance of Government Ministries in Kenya, to assess the effect of procurement contract award on performance of Government Ministries in Kenya and to determine the effect of procurement contract management on performance of Government Ministries in Kenya.  Methodology: The study used five theories to support the literature. The study theories were Principal-Agency Theory, the Institutional Theory, Stakeholder Theory and Resource based Theory. The study employed descriptive research design. The targeted population of this study were 18 government ministries. The researcher collected primary data using both open-ended and closed-ended questionnaires. The data presentation was done using tables from both descriptive and inferential statistics analysis. The study used the multiple regression analysis models to measure the relationship between independent and dependent variables and the significant of the study.Results: R Square (R2) indicated that 51.8% of the variation on performance of government ministries could be explained by the fitted model leaving out 41.9% of variation unexplained. This indicated the presence of other factors in the surrounding, relating to procurement lifecycle towards the performance of ministries in addition to the ones identified for the study. However, the model showed goodness of fit since the R Square was above 50%. The value of the F statistic (9.146) indicates that the overall regression model was significant at the significance level of 0.05. From the finding, the study established that Tender Qualification and Selection, Procurement Contract Management and Procurement Planning were significant to the study with their P-values less than the default alpha. Procurement Contract Award was insignificant to the study with its P-value being greater that the default alpha level of significant.Contribution to policy and practice: The study recommends the Government Ministries in Kenya to consider improving procurement contract award to their suppliers by improving on the way they prepare the solicitation document, receive and evaluate bids, conducts the cost analysis, award the bid as required by the act as well as the way procurement prepares the solicitation document for better performance in future.The Government ministries to reconsider its persistence in ensuring that the procurement team develops contract administration plan, receives goods and services from the suppliers, signs the invoices to facilitate supplier payment, manages the vendors, starts up the contract in due time as required and closes the contract when it ends. By so doing, they shall ease the way in which their operational performance is conducted. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Varieties and soil moisture content are the two agronomic factors mostly pointed out as influencers of cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava. The role of soil nutrient supply is however often overlooked or minimised, despite its known influence on cyanogenic glucoside production. A pot experiment was hence carried out to determine whether soil nutrient supply had an equal influence on cyanogenic glucoside production in cassava, as varieties and soil moisture content. The cassava varieties, <jats:italic>Kiroba</jats:italic> (a sweet cassava variety) and <jats:italic>Salanga</jats:italic> (a bitter cassava variety), were used in the experiment, together with three soil moisture treatments that respectively induced severe moisture stress, moderate moisture stress and no moisture stress (optimal soil moisture conditions where plants were kept well-watered). The soil nutrient treatments used depicted conditions of low (no fertiliser), moderate (25 N mg, 5 P mg, 25 K mg /kg) and high (25 N mg, 5 P mg, 25 K mg /kg) nutrient supply. A sole K treatment was also included (25 K mg/kg). Total hydrogen cyanide (HCN) levels in cassava leaves were used to indicate the effects of the three factors on cyanogenic glucoside production. The results of the study showed that nutrient supply had a significantly (p &lt; 0.001) equal influence on cyanogenic glucoside production, as varieties (p &lt; 0.001) and soil moisture content (p &lt; 0.001). Cyanogenic glucoside production was however found to be differently influenced by soil moisture content (M) and nutrient supply (N) in both <jats:italic>Salanga</jats:italic> (M×N, p = 0.002) and <jats:italic>Kiroba</jats:italic> (M×N, p &lt; 0.001). Leaf HCN levels of unfertilised <jats:italic>Salanga</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Kiroba</jats:italic> were respectively increased by 1.8 times and 2.7 times their levels under optimal soil moisture conditions. Thus, under severe moisture stress, low soil fertility was found to have an increasing effect on leaf HCN levels in both varieties. A high supply of N, P and K, however also had an increasing effect on leaf HCN in both varieties regardless of soil moisture conditions. Leaf HCN levels in <jats:italic>Salanga</jats:italic> ranged from 95.5 mg/kg to 334.5 mg/kg and in <jats:italic>Kiroba</jats:italic> they ranged from 39.3 mg/kg to 161.5 mg/kg, on a fresh weight basis. The study managed to demonstrate that soil fertility had an equally important influence on cyanogenic glucoside production, just like varieties and soil moisture content. The study also showed that the effects of nutrient supply on cyanogenic glucoside production in various cassava varieties is dependent on changes in soil moisture content and vice versa.</jats:p>"

The method effectively solves the key problem that the power of energy harvesting based on electric field induction is limited by the transformer excitation reactance and is difficult to upgrade. In this paper, the principle of power supply technology based on electric field induction is described in detail, and the influencing factors such as the wire erection mode, polar plate installation position, and capacitance compensation characteristics are simulated and tested. The test results show that when the power supply voltage is 50 kV, the stray capacitance is 14 pF, the compensation capacitance is 0.86 nF, and the load resistance is 1 kΩ, the energy-harvesting power is 340 mW. Finally, the power supply circuit of a drive-away-birds apparatus is designed, which shows that it can provide a stable and reliable power supply for online monitoring sensors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the recent years the alternative food networks gained a significant importance, mainly due to the need of consumers to get closer to the farmers both in terms of physical distance and in number of intermediaries. The concept of building a reliable food system tries to balance the mistrust in the industrialized food production that is dominating in the developed countries. Social enterprises are enterprises pursuing primarily social objectives in business environment. In 2015, in Hungary more than 13.000 social enterprises were registered according to the statistics with many different social missions. However, the number of social enterprises in the catering sector is quite limited. The Hungarian para-gastro movement consists of 7 different organisations, operating in the catering sector and employing handicapped and/or disabled workforce. Against this background, in our paper we would like to investigate the business models of Hungarian social enterprises in the catering sector, somehow connected and related to short food supply chains. To the best of our knowledge, currently only 3 companies fulfil all these criteria: Ízlelő Restaurant from Szekszárd, Hatpöttyös Restaurant from Székesfehérvár and the Batyu-Téka from Miskolc. In order to understand the business models of these three companies, we applied an expert interview based, qualitative approach. We also analysed the publicly available financial statements of them and calculate the most important (financial) ratios. Altogether we tried to analyse the role of direct sourcing, the niche market of local foods and obviously the advantages and the disadvantages of the social entrepreneurship.  Results show that currently the social enterprises requires (state) subsidy to survive, the average share of subsidies was 19-49% of the total income among the investigated companies. However, all have their unique way to pursue the survival and the level of commitment to short food supply chains is very different. Altogether we could identify possible synergies where social gastro enterprises can benefit from direct sourcing.    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modular integrated construction (MiC) is an offsite construction technique which can improve construction quality, the certainty of the project cost, provide value for money and reduce construction time, waste generation, and carbon emissions. However, MiC is associated with a unique business model, engineering, supply chain, and stakeholder composition, resulting in bespoke uncertainties and risks. Prominent among them is the uncertainties and risk events in its linked supply chain segments. However, risks identification and allocation in the MiC supply chain segments is not well-established. This research identified and assessed 28 risk events (REs) across the manufacturing, logistics and on-site assembly segments of the MiC supply chain. A principal component analysis generated 10, 6 and 12 REs within the modular manufacturing, logistics, and on-site assembly segments, respectively. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) modeling revealed that the on-site assembly REs are the most critical set of risk events with a criticality index of 5.58, followed by the modular manufacturing risk events (5.28) and logistics risk events (5.08). These rankings and criticality assessment have profound implications for the practice and praxis MiC risks management. It is a source of relevant information to stakeholders and practitioners in understanding the MiC supply chain risk events and may prioritize the riskiest events to improve the performance of MiC projects. Again, the assessed REs contributes to the checklists of MiC risk events and may form the basis for future studies on the risk of MiC. Future studies may examine the assessed risk events in different countries using larger samples.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the analysis and assessment of water losses in water distribution systems of three water supply companies operating water supply networks in the area of effect of underground mining. The analysis of water losses was conducted based on numerous indices allowing for obtaining objective information on the condition of the water supply system. The method of the analysis of percentage water loss index was extended by the methods of determination of losses according to the International Water Association. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that with regular actions, the companies have reduced water losses in recent years to a level considered to be good compared to national data and average compared to international standards. The value of the failure intensity index for all companies in 2011 was over 1.0 while currently it is about 0.5. The decrease in Non-Revenue Water basic loss index (NRWB) from more than 20% for all analysed companies in 2008 to a few percent in 2017 and the decrease in Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) for companies A and C to less than 2.0 are evidence of the good condition of the network. This is also confirmed by the unit water loss index per capita, with its value in 2017 being 9.1 dm3/(inhabitant day) for company A, 11 dm3/(inhabitant·day) for B and 7.4 dm3/(inhabitant·day) for C. The several years of analysis and evaluation of numerous indices of water loss presented in the paper reveals the effectiveness of the adopted strategies of reducing leakages in the distribution system. It should be emphasized that the analysed companies have been involved in comprehensive initiatives aimed at reducing water leakages, resulting in a substantial reduction in water losses. GIS monitoring systems and databases are particularly helpful in reducing water losses. The basis of the activities is monitoring of flow and pressure in water supply networks and active leakage control. Network zoning with simultaneous observation of minimum night-time flows allows for preliminary location of the failure. Equipping companies with special leakage detection devices such as geophones, stethophones or correlators enables quick detection of leakages. The next step is to replace water meters with more and more accurate ones and to implement radio reading of water meters. All analysed companies perform systematic replacement of old steel and cast iron pipes which cause a large number of leakages that are often difficult to identify, thus leading to water losses.</jats:p>"

The study specific objectives were to establish the effect of procurement planning on performance of Government Ministries in Kenya, to assess the effect of procurement contract award on performance of Government Ministries in Kenya and to determine the effect of procurement contract management on performance of Government Ministries in Kenya.  Methodology: The study used five theories to support the literature. The study theories were Principal-Agency Theory, the Institutional Theory, Stakeholder Theory and Resource based Theory. The study employed descriptive research design. The targeted population of this study were 18 government ministries. The researcher collected primary data using both open-ended and closed-ended questionnaires. The data presentation was done using tables from both descriptive and inferential statistics analysis. The study used the multiple regression analysis models to measure the relationship between independent and dependent variables and the significant of the study.Results: R Square (R2) indicated that 51.8% of the variation on performance of government ministries could be explained by the fitted model leaving out 41.9% of variation unexplained. This indicated the presence of other factors in the surrounding, relating to procurement lifecycle towards the performance of ministries in addition to the ones identified for the study. However, the model showed goodness of fit since the R Square was above 50%. The value of the F statistic (9.146) indicates that the overall regression model was significant at the significance level of 0.05. From the finding, the study established that Tender Qualification and Selection, Procurement Contract Management and Procurement Planning were significant to the study with their P-values less than the default alpha. Procurement Contract Award was insignificant to the study with its P-value being greater that the default alpha level of significant.Contribution to policy and practice: The study recommends the Government Ministries in Kenya to consider improving procurement contract award to their suppliers by improving on the way they prepare the solicitation document, receive and evaluate bids, conducts the cost analysis, award the bid as required by the act as well as the way procurement prepares the solicitation document for better performance in future.The Government ministries to reconsider its persistence in ensuring that the procurement team develops contract administration plan, receives goods and services from the suppliers, signs the invoices to facilitate supplier payment, manages the vendors, starts up the contract in due time as required and closes the contract when it ends. By so doing, they shall ease the way in which their operational performance is conducted. </jats:p>"

During the most recent renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 2017-2018, the U.S. threatened to cancel NAFTA if concessions were not made to Canada’s supply management policies in agriculture. During the renegotiation, many arguments for and against supply management in agriculture were repeated, some were updated, and some newer perspectives relating to sustainability and social responsivity were more enthusiastically discussed. Most arguments critical of supply management have been developed using economic analyses of market and industry-level impacts of supply management. On the other hand, supportive arguments are often qualitative, focus on the survival of smaller farms and generally lack empirical investigation based on application of relevant theory. This paper uses management theory to investigate the impact of supply management of management and business activities on food processing firms.  We use a framework that links business activities with the broad regulatory environment to interpret evidence from a study of independent meat processors in Ontario, Canada, particularly those that processed turkey, which is a supply managed sector; and pork, which is not. Results suggest that the broad regulatory environment facing Ontario meat processors is of greater concern to managers of independent processing businesses than the specific regulatory environment of supply management. Results also suggest the value creation activities and strategies used by a business may affect how managers assess opportunities and challenges in this specific regulatory environment.</jats:p>"

It is an important part of institutional innovation to coordinate fiscal and other reforms. From the perspective of the supply side, this paper discusses whether the adjustment of fiscal and monetary policies will have a positive impact on China’s capital market and economic growth. In this paper, a windows-EBM model is constructed to test the panel data of major economies between 2008 and 2016, discuss their impact on the efficiency of the capital market, and to make a comparative analysis on the strategies to improve the vitality of China’s capital market. We find that the impact of China’s macro policies on capital market efficiency during 2008-2016 shows a huge potential space for adjusting fiscal and monetary policies, because these input factors are obviously interchangeable in China’s supply-side reform. This is in line with the expected direction of China’s supply-side reform. This paper reveals the positive effect of supply-side reform on capital activity. Tax cuts and monetary policy measures are needed to balance capital markets and to ensure their active and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, in pharmacology one of the most serious problems is counterfeit drugs. The Health Research Funding organization reported that in developing countries, nearly 10–30% of the drugs are fake. Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that, as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30% of the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health records. We also carried out a number of experiments in order to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Finally, we used Hyperledger Caliper as a benchmarking tool to conduct the performance of the designed system in terms of transactions per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization.</jats:p>"

Such actuation poses requirements that are not met by standard power electronics. These requirements are analysed in this paper and a proper schematic for the power electronics is derived.

Although the literature suggests that demand-side measures, in particular, public procurement of innovation, might be more effective in stimulating innovation than supply-side measures, empirical evidence on this proposition is scarce. To empirically test this proposition, we utilize the Eurobarometer 2014 survey to estimate the effects from public procurement of innovation as well as from the supply-side innovation measures on product and process innovations in manufacturing and service firms in the USA and Europe. Our findings suggest that the treatment effects of public procurement of innovation are indeed larger than the effects of supply-side public support on product innovation in both manufacturing and service sectors. This finding also holds for process innovation, but only in the service sector. In contrast, in manufacturing firms, the estimated effects on process innovation are only positive and significant in firms receiving public support.</jats:p>",

The study adopted VOSviewer software through the assistance of citation, co-citation and keywords analysis to present a bibliometric and network analysis. A total of eight hundred and fifty Scopus indexed articles were extracted and used for the analysis. Through the analysis we have revealed the most important authors, journals and articles supporting lean concept. Also discovered are the major school of thought related to lean construction supply chain which are; waste reduction, just in time, integration and pre-fabrication. This review points to the benefits of using bibliometric network analysis for unearthing the practices of lean construction supply chain. These findings contribute to using a new research methodology for analysing the contribution of lean concept to the construction supply chain.</jats:p>"

The liberalization of markets and the international marketplace integration have led to qualitative developments of the economic entities at various levels especially from the technological point of view. These transformations have affected most of the modern world, and Algeria is no exception to that phenomenon. Its economy is witnessing several modifications in order to move towards a modern market economy compliant with the current definition of freedom of exchange. This is the goal that Algeria seeks to reach by adhering to the World Trade Organization, whose rules are based on concept of free market, lawful competition as well as the lifting of major customs barriers. Companies have to exploit all the possibilities and strategies to improve their productivity, management and overall workflow in order to rise above the challenge and succeed in establishing themselves strongly in such a market. In this instance, the supply chain becomes the main symbol of the link between production sites and consumption locations thus making supply chain management one of the most progressive forms of dynamic and integrated management and is considered a main driver of competitive. In this paper, we attempt to prove the importance of the aforementioned concept of supply chain management under the form of a case study that assess the competitiveness of the AURAS mills in Algeria to determine the various elements that are the main contributors to the improvement of the overall position of the company on the market as well as the drivers behind the continuous progress and innovation in management of the dynamic components of the company. We expect to prove that a shift in the structure of the company towards the creation of an autonomous supply chain department will improve the competitiveness of AURAS mills as well as provide a clear development and amelioration path for the overall functioning of the company.</jats:p>",

Hence, it proposes an algorithm for automated SCF using multiple contract parameters. Moreover, it proposes a decision-making mechanism that provides means for incorporating risk in the decision-making process. To better emphasize the features of the proposed decision-making mechanism, the paper provides some insights from the petroleum industry. This industry has a strategic position, as it is the base for other essential activities of the economy of any country. The petroleum industry is faced with volatile feed-stock costs, cyclical product prices and seasonal final products demand.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The authors have modeled the supply chain in terms of a cluster graph where the nodes are represented by clusters over the contract parameters that suppliers/consumers are interested in. The suppliers/consumers own utility functions and agree on multiple contract parameters by message exchange, directly with other participant agents, representing their potential buyer or seller. The agreed values of the negotiated issues are reflected in a contract which has a certain utility value for every agent. They consider uncertainties in crude oil prices and demand in petrochemical products and model the decision mechanism for a refinery by using an inﬂuence diagram.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>By integrating the automated SCF algorithm and a mechanism for decision support under uncertainty, the authors propose a reliable and practical decision-making model with a practical application not only in the petroleum industry but also in any other complex industry involving a multi-tier supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The limitation of this approach reveals in situations where the parameters can take values over continuous domains.

As opposed to the previous decentralized approaches, this approach translates the SCF optimization problem not as a profit maximization problem but as a utility maximization. Hence, it incorporates multiple parameters and uses utility functions to find the optimal supply chain. The current approach is closer to real life scenarios than the previous approaches that were using only cost as a mean for pairwise agents because it uses utility functions for entities in the supply chain to make decision. Moreover, this approach overcomes the limitations of previous approaches by providing means to incorporate risk in the decision-making mechanism.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

This research was conducted at the Office of Public Logistics Bureau at Jln. Andi Pangeran Pettarani, Makassar. In research using data collection techniques by means of observation, literature study, interviews and documentation. Analysis of the data that has been selected is the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). The results showed that from the calculation results to determine the economical amount of inventory using EOQ calculations, it is known that the costs of South Sulawesi Bulog raw material inventory in 2017 amounted to 235.41 tons with a ordering frequency of 310 purchases in one year. Whereas from 2017 the realization of the absorption of Bulog rice procurement in South Sulawesi in 2017 amounted to 324,554 tons, with an ordering frequency of 305 times with an average of 1,064 tons per order. If the company can implement the EOQ method can provide savings on raw material inventory costs and the accuracy in managing the amount of inventory. Based on the calculation of the safety stock, it can be seen that in 2017 Bulog must have a safety stock of rice in the warehouse of 18,264 tons to avoid a stock out. Based on the reorder point calculation, Bulog must reorder when the stock is 18,383 tons. The maximum inventory of rice that can be stored in a warehouse is 18,499 tons.</jats:p>"

The data are obtained from CBN Statistical Bulletin 2017 edition and CBN Annual Reports and Ordinary Least Squares technique is employed to analyze them with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. The findings reveal that Federal Government Independent Revenue (FGIR) and State government Independent Revenue (SGIR) impact on money supply positively and significantly while the Local Government Independent Revenue has insignificant positive impact on money supply. The policy implication of the results is that government revenue under the autonomous control of the three levels of government in Nigeria has a lot of influence on money circulating in the economy and therefore, stringent monetary policies should be applied to regulate it in order to prevent inflationary economic situation in the country.</jats:p>",

Drilling is the most important margin, with price elasticities of 1.3 and 1.6 for conventional and unconventional drilling respectively. Well productivity declines as prices rise, implying smaller net supply elasticities of about 1.1 and 1.2. Despite similar supply elasticities, the price response of unconventional supply is larger in terms of barrels because of much higher production per well (∼10x initially). Oil supply simulations show a 13-fold larger supply response due to the shale revolution. The simulations suggest that a price rise from $50 to $80 per barrel induces incremental U.S. production of 0.6MM barrels per day in 6 months, 1.4MM in 1 year, 2.4MM in 2 years, and 4.2MM in 5 years. Nonetheless, the response takes much longer than the 30 to 90 days than typically associated with the role of “swing producer.” </jats:p>",

These changing boundary conditions lead to higher needs for flexibility in production processes of the chemical industry. Within this article technical solutions for an enhancement of different forms of flexibility are presented for production concepts and apparatus concepts, respectively. The latter focuses on unit operations for the separation of gas–liquid mixtures. This includes a review regarding transformable, modular production processes and a classification of their field of application. Additionally, concepts for named unit operations on different scales are presented and discussed.

The monitoring tasks include mapping of the bottom surface, inspection of hydraulic structures, search for sunken objects, control of unauthorized access to protected areas, etc.\n\nA promising direction for improving the efficiency of monitoring projects for such water areas is the use of uninhabited autonomous and remote-controlled underwater robots. However, the use of traditional types of such equipment has low efficiency because of the impossibility of the operational management of the missions of autonomous vehicles in real time and the complexity and high cost of using remote-controlled vehicles.\n\nAs an alternative to the robotic support of underwater monitoring projects in shallow water areas, it is proposed to use autonomous underwater vehicles with a radio beacon, since they make it possible to survey large areas, perform high-quality and comprehensive search and mapping work, while providing operators with real-world underwater conditions of time.\n\nA generalized structure and composition of the equipment for an autonomous underwater vehicle with a radio beacon is described, its main underwater missions and types of underwater operations are described.\n\nIn order to assess the resources for the execution time of projects for the robotized monitoring of shallow water areas, dependencies are proposed for calculating the time costs for different trajectories of the movement of the underwater vehicle-robot. Using this methodology, time expenses were calculated and the number of underwater vehicle operation cycles for the main ports of Ukraine was estimated during the examination of the mooring walls with video equipment of the underwater vehicle and examination of the shallow water area by its sonar.\n\nThe obtained results are a preliminary assessment of the time spent on the study of shallow-water offshore and port water areas, and also form the theoretical basis for the formation of a technical assignment for the creation of modern robotic support for monitoring projects in such water areas.</jats:p>",

Samples of more than 210 primary data sets are collected from population of different industries in India by a proper sampling method and by framing questionnaires. The relationship, as proposed in the hypothesis model, is assessed empirically by using statistical techniques called Structural Equation Modeling. &#x0D;\nResults: Practitioners may expect improved supply chain performance through strategic alliance between information intensive services and supply chain integration, as it is demanded industries in this Industry 4.0 era.&#x0D;\nLimitations: The hypothesis framed by western standards seems to be obvious; however, considering the Indian business scenario, where the supply chain and technology of information systems are almost a new concept in most firms, this seems to be a valid area of research.&#x0D;\nPractical Implications: Research conceptualizes and develops different dimensions of information-intensive services that offer empirical support for the adoption of proper information system to improve performance within an integrated supply chain.&#x0D;\nOriginality / Value: This survey-based empirical research will ‘coordinate and highlight the issue of integration’ of Enterprise Information Systems within the organizational supply chain. </jats:p>"

Because withholding taxes do not necessarily reflect true effective taxes, these may give false signals of net‐of‐tax pay. We test labor supply responses to such misconceptions using laboratory experiments. Withholding taxes (and the resulting tax refunds) should be behaviorally neutral, but our results show that tax adjustments lead to effort adjustments, which suggests that withholding blurs tax incentives. While there is no statistically significant response in the overall sample, the participants in the subgroup who self‐assess to be motivated by monetary incentives (about half of the total sample) reduce their effort in response to withholding taxes and increase their effort after receiving tax refunds.</jats:p>",

In this study, a bifunctional Cu2-xSe-decorated hierarchical TiO2 nanotube mesh (CTNM) was designed and synthesized successfully for both solar water evaporation and photodegradation. Cu2-xSe enhances solar light absorption and solar water evaporation performance as a low-cost absorber because of its localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect. Meanwhile, the formation of the p-Cu2-xSe/n-TiO2 heterojunction improves the photodegradation performance by increasing separation and transport of photogenerated charge carriers. Hence, CTNM has a relatively high solar water evaporation conversion efficiency of 83.06% and also can photodegrade 95% of methyl orange after 3 h under 2.5 kW m−2 simulated solar irradiation, which demonstrate the extremely high utilization ratio of solar energy of CTNM.</jats:p>",

It seeks to decipher the issue of unaffordability of homeownership from the financing perspective as offered by the financial institutions in Malaysia. By employing survival analysis via Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for the period covering Q1:2009 to Q4:2014, our findings suggest that higher inflation rate and lower house price volatility may reduce the likelihood for home loans exclusion and thus allow banks to allocate higher loan disbursements. Meanwhile, higher interest rate excludesclients from having access to finance where the compounding effects of interest shows increased hazards of exclusion among the home loans clients. Understanding the determinants of financial exclusion is, therefore, a pertinent issue to be addressed for potential house buyers to be aware of in order to increase the probability of access to financial services. To the financial institutions, identifying the determinants of financial inclusion will assist them to design products that are more marketable. For the policymakers, the findings of the study will shed some light on the policy ramifications towards promoting affordable homeownership in achieving sustainable development goals as outlined by the United Nation.</jats:p>"

SWAT model was run for two different scenarios for the 40-year period between 1973 and 2012, after completing calibration procedures under gauge-data scarce conditions. For the first scenario, 1990 dated Land cover/land use (LCLU) map and meteorological data obtained between 1973 and 2012 were used. For the second scenario, 2006 dated LCLU map and same meteorological data were used to analyze the impact of changing landscape characteristics on hydrological processes. In the selected watershed, LCLU changes started towards the end of the 1980s and reached a significant status in 2006; therefore, 1990 and 2006 dated LCLU maps are important to model human impact period in the watershed. Afterwards, LCLU changes within sub-basin level were investigated to quantify the effects of different types of land changes on the major hydrological components such as actual evapotranspiration, percolation, soil water, base flow, surface runoff and runoff. Our analysis indicated that, under the same climatic conditions, changes in land cover/use, specifically urbanization, played a considerable role in hydrological dynamics with changes on actual transpiration, base flow, surface runoff, runoff, percolation and soil water mainly due to urban and agricultural area changes. Among the different hydrological components analyzed at watershed level, percolation, ET and base flow were found to be highly sensitive to LCLU changes, whereas soil water was found as the least sensitive to same LCLU changes.</jats:p>"

However, through more intensive farming procedures, it puts a pressure on environment and sustainability of agricultural production and prolongs the distance of distributed goods. Reduction of the mentioned impacts is possible through shortening the food supply chain subsequently resulting in increase of local sale, demand for local services and increase of labour market, putting an emphasis on support of small and medium – sized enterprises and their economic viability improvement. This paper evaluates the performance of small and medium enterprises and micro-enterprises which applied for the support and supplied and distributed fruits, vegetables, milk and milk products to kindergartens and primary schools within the School Fruits and Vegetables and the School Milk programme.

Nevertheless, the present integration levels are still far from the targets. The main reason being the technical barriers arising from their non-manageable features. Photovoltaic and wind sources are the widest spread, as their maturity allows generation with a high-efficiency degree. A deep understanding of facilities’ performance and how they can match the energy demand is mandatory to reduce costs and extend the technical limits and facilitate their penetration. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to evaluate how photovoltaic–wind hybrid facilities, placed in an urban environment can give generation patterns which will be able to match the demand profiles better than facilities installed individually. This methodology has been applied to a broad number of locations spread over the whole planet. The results show that with high homogeneity in terms of site weather characteristics, the hybrid facilities improve the matching up to 15% over photovoltaic plants and up to 35% over wind.</jats:p>"

A concept and the technological elements for Supply Chain Management 4.0 (SCM 4.0) are presented. Potential applications of SCM 4.0 are reviewed as well.&#x0D;\nGoal: This paper aims at reviewing the historical development of the Supply Chain Management 4.0 concept and to propose an update for it.&#x0D;\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: The exploratory part of the paper started with a bibliometric analysis to identify relevant keywords and publications per year. Secondly, a historical review of the concepts of Supply Chain Management is presented. Additionally, the paper embraced a conceptual approach to propose a new definition of Supply Chain Management 4.0. Lastly, a research outlook and some initiatives to the practical application of the concept are presented.&#x0D;\nResults: The bibliometric analysis about Supply Chain Management 4.0 reinforce the growing importance of the topic. The main keywords related to the subject indicate that Big Data, cloud computing, and Internet of Things are the most widely explored issues within smart supply chains. Analysis indicate that smart supply chains take advantage of communication and technological advances in order to build an adaptive, efficient, and transparent network. However, the application of such concept requires the development of knowledge, not only in the hardware and software fields, but also in the managerial field, to address the question of how to use that information and communication to benefit stakeholders.&#x0D;\nLimitations of the investigation: The document reports an exploratory research applied only to the Scopus database. In addition, only English-language literature was considered.&#x0D;\nPractical implications: The review showed a lack on the development of knowledge not only in the hardware field, but also in the managerial field. It is recommendable that studies focus on areas such as required data to be exchanged, potential financial benefits, and technological and managerial challenges.&#x0D;\nOriginality/value: An overview of the historical evolution of the supply chain to the Supply Chain Management 4.0 is presented. A concept of Supply Chain Management 4.0 is proposed. Application examples illustrated the practical implementation of the proposed concept.</jats:p>"

In such a situation, the role of a manufacturer is to manage the inventory properly with optimized profit. However, the problem of unreliability within buyers still exists in real world scenarios. The manufacturer adopts the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to manage the inventory, which can control the unreliability, the inventory pooling effect, and the investment on human labor. For detecting RFID tags, a reasonable number of readers are needed. This study investigates the optimum distance between any two readers when using the optimum number of readers. As a vendor managed inventory (VMI) policy is utilized by the manufacturer, a revenue sharing contract is adopted to prevent the loss of buyers. The aim of this study is to maximize the profits of a two-echelon supply chain management under an advanced technology system. As the life of electronic gadgets is random, it may not follow any specific type of distribution function. The distribution-free approach helps to solve this issue when the mean and the standard deviation are known. The Kuhn-Tucker methodology and classical optimization are used to find the global optimum solution. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the manufacturer can earn more profit in coordination case after utilizing revenue sharing and the optimum distance between readers optimizing cost related to the RFID system. Sensitivity analysis is performed to check the sensibility of the parameters.</jats:p>"

Scientific literatures from appropriate journals, newspapers, trade data of applicable ministries and governmental agencies, data on Ebola from websites of World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Center for Disease and Control and Prevention (CDC), World Bank, the International Monetary Funds (IMF) and other relevant institutions are used extensively while also employing a market chain approach to represent the overall supply chains of these products. The review reveals, among others, the significant disruption to the flow of goods and the decrease in output of the main export commodities of Liberia. It also shows a fall in the real GDP growth rate of the Mano River Basin (MRB) countries during the Ebola years. The paper identifies that the specific mechanisms through which the supply chains were disrupted were as a result of fear and government’s regulation. Additionally, it provides a practical conduit for the diversification of the rubber industry. Given the complex web of supply chains of just a single product, this effort is in no way an exhaustive review on the impact of the EVD on supply chains of commodities dealt with herein, let alone the overall impact of EVD on the country as a whole. Obviously, this review is also limited in terms of scope and extent. This review is a useful introduction to investigators who might want to commit to research in this particular aspect of the impact of the EVD vis-a-vis its impact on supply chains in Liberia or on a broader level, the MRB Countries.</jats:p>"

Although donations are not fully within the control of blood supply chain, the blood service can marginally moderate it by postponing appointments in the case of having an overstock, or by triggering a call for additional blood when faced with shortages. Such shortages are often observed as a consequence of catastrophic events. Past studies show that the response to a call for blood after a disaster is substantive. Yet the consequential impact on the supply chain is not well understood. This is due to the perishability of blood and the fact that donors are not eligible to give blood for a certain period after a donation has been made. In this study, the donation process is modeled with a Markov chain and the impact of a call for blood resulting from a disaster is investigated. This article highlights new actionable insights that aid planners to mitigate the negative impacts of a substantial response to a call for blood.</jats:p>",

This study offers an analysis of the price formation mechanism along the Chinese fresh vegetable supply chain. It analyzes the features of market transactions in the upstream and downstream greenhouse cucumber supply chain, and presents an elastic model of pricing in the fresh and raw vegetable market in China. Based on the daily procurement price data of 78 cases in Lingyuan (Liaoning Province, China), and the wholesale price of 78 cases in Xinfadi (Beijing, China), the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) unit root test, co-integration test, and Granger test were applied to reveal the relationship between the prices. Findings indicate that the price of fresh and raw vegetables is formed at the wholesale market, where after it cascades from wholesalers to direct buyers (primary merchants) and farmers, and is passed on to retailers and consumers, where the final market price is formed. Farmers exhibit bounded rationality decision-making, that is, they can only passively accept price fluctuations. Buyers (primary merchants, wholesalers’ agents, and retailers) at each level extract fixed rewards, while making no additional contribution to the price fluctuations along the chain. The wholesalers enjoy an oligopolistic competition market and can better take advantage of the asymmetric information to accommodate market demand.</jats:p>"

This paper aimed at finding the best possible strategy for reducing GHGE in the Swedish school food supply without compromising its nutritional adequacy, affordability, and cultural acceptability. Prices, amounts, and GHGE of all foods and drinks supplied to three schools over one year were optimized by linear programming. Three models were developed: Model 1 minimized GHGE while constraining relative deviation (RD) from observed food supply; Model 2 minimized total RD while imposing stepwise GHGE reductions; and Model 3 additionally constrained RD to -75% and +200% of the observed value. Model 1 reduced GHGE by 89-95% with an average RD (ARD) from observed food supply of 480-887%. In Model 2, comparable GHGE reductions (80%-95%) at lower ARD (78%-459%) were achieved but with high RDs for individual foods. Model 3 excluded no foods, avoided high RDs, and reduced GHGE by 40% in all schools with ARDs of 7.2-8.1% at 12-15% lower cost. An omnivorous, nutritionally adequate, and affordable school food supply with considerably lower GHGE is achievable with moderate changes to the observed food supply. This method can also be applied in other settings and countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with its warm (El Niño) and cold (La Niña) phase has strong impacts on marine ecosystems off Peru. This influence extends from changes in nutrient availability to productivity and oxygen levels. While several studies have demonstrated the influence of ENSO events on biological productivity, less is known about their impact on oxygen concentrations. In situ observations along the Peruvian and Chilean coast have shown a strong water column oxygenation during the 1997/1998 strong El Niño event. These observations suggest a deepening of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) along the continental shelf. However, due to reduced spatial coverage of the existing in situ observations, no studies have yet demonstrated the OMZ response to El Niño events in the whole Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP). Furthermore, most studies have focused on El Niño events. Much less attention was given to the oxygen dynamics under La Niña influence. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the ENSO influence on OMZ dynamics. Interannual variability of the OMZ during the period 1990–2010 is derived from a regional coupled physical-biogeochemical model forced with realistic atmospheric and lateral boundary conditions. Our results show a reduction of the vertical extent and a deepening of suboxic waters (SW) during the El Niño phase. During the La Niña phase, there is a vertical expansion of SW. These fluctuations in OMZ extent are due to changes in oxygen supply into its core depth mainly from lateral margins. During the El Niño phase, the enhanced lateral oxygen supply from the subtropics is the main reason for the reduction of SW in both coastal and offshore regions. During the La Niña phase, the oxygenated subtropical waters are blocked by the poleward transport along the southern margin of the OMZ. Consequently, oxygen concentrations within the OMZ are reduced and suboxic conditions expand during La Niña. The detailed analysis of transport pathways presented here provides new insights into how ENSO variability affects the oxygen-sensitive marine biogeochemistry of the ETSP.\n                        </jats:p>"

During transient events, the dynamic response of PRVs may adversely affect pressure fluctuations in distribution networks. In this study, the dynamic response of PRVs was analyzed by developing a numerical model that coupled an existing water-hammer model and a two-parameter dynamic PRV model. PRV parameters were calibrated, and the model was validated using previous experimental observations. The model was then used to study the effect of PRV dynamics during transient events in a distribution network. To optimize the rate of PRV opening and closure and control its dynamic response, the model was interfaced with an optimization algorithm based on shuffled complex evolution. The applied objective function gave PRV parameters that accelerated damping of the transient pressure waves and minimized the root-mean-square deviation from post-transient steady pressure at all nodes in the network. The results of this study indicate the importance of accounting for PRV response when simulating transients in water distribution networks. This study also highlights the need for PRV manufacturers to include in their product catalogs dynamic PRV parameters for use in transient analysis.</jats:p>",

In contrast, central necrosis in spheroids lacking hydrogel beads was observed after day 3 of culture, even when using PDMS.

Fish captured from the Jamuna river were marketed through three types of market viz. auction market/arat, wholesale market and retail market. Operators of the fish market were the fishermen, faria, aratders, paikers or baparies, whole sellers and retailers. Ten channels were identified through which fish of the Jamuna river were shifted from the fishermen to the consumers. The shortest channel was the fishermen to consumers while the longest one was the fishermen→faria→aratders→paikers→whole seller→retailer→consumers. The highest price of fish (BDT 560/kg) was recorded for Wallago attu in retail market followed by BDT 500/kg for Tenualosa ilisha and Bagarious bagarious while, five small indigenous species (SIS) Tetraodon cutcutia, Chanda nama, Parambassis lala, Parambassis ranga, and Esomus danricus got the lowest price in retail market. Icing, weighing, transportation, capital supply were required in fish marketing channels as supporting function to overcome crisis. Major constrains prevailing in the fish marketing channels were reducing fishing areas, decreasing fish catch per day per fishermen, disturbance by illegal seasonal fishermen, lack of bargaining power and market information, lack of proper fish storage and preservation facilities in the fishing craft and fish markets, wastage of fish due to spoiling during transportation, sanitations, drainage and management problems within the market areas.&#x0D;\nRes.

The present study aimed at quantifying key vegetative and reproductive responses to plant nitrogen status over two successive seasons under different nitrogen supply levels.Methods and results: Potted plants of Sauvignon Blanc grafted onto SO4 were grown outdoors in 2017 and 2018 with no water limitation. Four mineral nitrogen fertilization levels (equivalent to 0 kg of N ha-1 or 0U, 20U, 40U, 80U) and one organic nitrogen fertilization level (40U) were imposed in 2017. These treatments were doubled in 2018 to increase the degree of nitrogen supply and consequently, the range of observed effects on plant growth and yield. Plant nitrogen status (SPAD) was monitored weekly during both growing cycles. Yield components were determined over the two seasons. Lastly, plant carbon status was addressed through dynamic measurement of plant development and photosynthesis, and destructive measurement of dry matter accumulation and carbon storage in annual and perennial organs at flowering, veraison and harvest.The SPAD values progressively decreased under lower N supply (0N) during the first year (from 31 to 16) and they were more than halved between the maximum and the minimum N treatments straight after budburst in year two (40 for 160N and 19 for 0N). Then, the differences in SPAD values among treatments were maintained up to harvest (2018). The gradient of N status resulted in a gradient of berry numbers per inflorescence (from 180 to 34 berries/inflorescence for 80N and 0N, respectively in 2018) and of individual berry dry matter at harvest (from 0.13 to 0.41 g for 160N and 0N, respectively in 2018). Quantitative relationships between N status and the relative reductions (% of reduction per %SPAD decrease) in terms of C gain (leaf area, photosynthesis), C growth (shoot, berry, trunk and root dry matter) and C storage (trunk and root) were fitted at flowering, veraison and harvest. The reduction in C gain under lower N supply was mainly related to the decrease in total leaf area before flowering (-1.64%). Although the photosynthesis rate tended to decrease under N deficiency over the season, it only poorly contributed to the reduction in C gain. The whole plant C growth was inhibited when N status decreased (-1.13% at harvest), due to the inhibition of shoot dry matter before veraison (-1.81%) and to a lower extent, to the lower dry matter in berries (-0.80%), trunks (-0.42%) and roots (-0.84%) at harvest. Part of the reduction in root dry matter was related to the lower starch reserves (-0.31%) at harvest. Interestingly, starch reserves tended to be higher under organic N supply than mineral N supply.Conclusion: The present results provided a general framework of carbon gain and use over time (within and between seasons) as impacted by N supply levels and form. Such a framework will be useful when building a model of the pluri-annual dynamics of carbon balance related to yield elaboration in grapevines.</jats:p>"

In such a context, decision-making is driven by the concerns that the companionship of children is a household public good and that family members share childcare and related domestic duties. The incentive to share children’s companionship is affected by son preference, whereas the economic motive of labor division hinges on the potential wage rate of the mother. Both channels play important roles in households with mothers whose wage rates are high, while sharing the companionship of (grand) sons is the main driving force in households with mothers whose wage rates are low. Using China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) data, we find that among less-educated mothers, the incidence of a family coresiding with the paternal grandmother is at least 8.6 percentage points higher if the firstborn is a boy. At the same time, maternal labor supply increases by 2.9 days per month. By contrast, for educated mothers, the propensity for coresidence is higher, the working hours are longer, and the impact of the child’s sex is not significant. Our study not only provides a better understanding of the demographic and economic factors determining coresidence and intrahousehold time allocations but also lends empirical support to policies aiming to increase female labor supply and improve the well-being of girls.</jats:p>",

Inverse relationships have been noted between the number of Orobanche spp. parasites infecting a host and their mass, suggesting that the parasites compete for a shared resource pool, assumed to be recently fixed carbon (C). In clover, nitrogen (N) fixation requires a high proportion of daily photosynthate and represents a potential competitor for recently fixed C. We grew Trifolium pratense, either singly or parasitised by Orobanche minor, under high or low light levels, and with or without exogenous N supply. Low light and N deficiency led to decreased host biomass, while the damage caused by parasitism was proportionate to host mass. Parasitism caused reductions in host leaf mass, area, photosynthetic rates and shoot N concentration, but did not affect starch accumulation. Parasite mass as a proportion of system biomass was significantly higher when attached to plants grown at high light, which was attributed to higher photoassimilate supply, while the N supply had no effect. While both N limitation and parasitism caused reductions in host growth, little evidence of competition for C between N fixation and the parasites was noted.</jats:p>"

Both the single channel model and three-dimensional cell model for the microvalve were established using the COMSOL Multiphysics program. The results demonstrated that in the microvalve channel, the viscosity of the solution decreased, and the flow rate at the microvalve outlet increased with the increasing temperature. Meanwhile, the geometry structure of the microvalve single channel was optimized, so that the effect of the control speed of the microvalve under temperature changes became more prominent. In the full-cell model analysis, a low-velocity methanol solution at the low current density can significantly inhibit methanol crossover. At the high current densities, an increase in the methanol solution flow rate was beneficial to an increase in the cell reaction output. The μDMFC was fabricated and the experiment was conducted, where the results showed that the power density of the self-adaptive cell reached a maximum value of 16.56 mW/cm2 in 2 M methanol solution, which was up to 7% better than conventional cell performance. The proposed microvalve structure can effectively improve the output power of the μDMFC during the whole reaction process, and it may improve the stability of the cell operation.</jats:p>"

These methods can be generalized with a less restrictive formulation that incorporates uncertainty about the identifying assumptions themselves. We use this approach to revisit the importance of shocks to oil supply and demand. Supply disruptions turn out to be a bigger factor in historical oil price movements and inventory accumulation a smaller factor than implied by earlier estimates. Supply shocks lead to a reduction in global economic activity after a significant lag, whereas shocks to oil demand do not. (JEL C32, L71, Q35, Q43) </jats:p>",

The impact on performance depends on the system's ability to discover and then recover after the disruption has occurred. In this paper, we proposed a new method to integrate probabilistic assessment of disruption risks into the Risk Exposure Index (REI) approach proposed previously by Simchi-Levi et al. and measure supply chain resiliency by analyzing the worst-case CVaR (WCVaR) of total lost sales under disruptions. We show that the optimal strategic inventory positioning strategy in this model can be fully characterized by a conic program. The optimal primal and dual solutions to the conic program can be used to shed light on comparative statics in the supply chain risk mitigation problem. This information can help supply chain risk managers focus their mitigation efforts on critical suppliers and/or installations that will have greater impact on the performance of the supply chain when disrupted. </jats:p>",

To know the performance of the company’s Supply Chain, measurement is needed. From these measurements will be obtained result, so good or not good performance of the company’s Supply Chain can be seen and can find the weaknesses of existing systems to be repaired. Given a good supply chain performance, the performance the company will increasingly focus and provide benefits, whether for the company, suppliers, and consumers. The company in this research is a company engaged in manufacturing Crude Palm Oil. The delayed raw material of fresh fruit bunches from suppliers resulted in fluctuating production numbers which need to be identified Supply Chain in the manufacturing process to maximize CPO production. By the result of supply chain performance measurement by using Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method there are 55 KPI that is 10 KPI for perspective plan, 5 KPI for perspective source, 15 KPI for perspective, deliver, 15 KPI for perspective make, and 10 KPI for perspective return. The result of scoring by using OMAX (Objective Matrix) method obtained by total index value equal to 6,1. Based on the traffic light system, the index is in the yellow category indicating that the performance of company supply chain as a whole has not achieved the expected performance even though the result is close to the target set. From KPI performance measurement result with OMAX calculation and traffic light system, it can be seen that KPI included in green category is 24 KPI, yellow category as many as 25 KPI, and red category as many as 6 KPI.</jats:p>",

Contractual arrangements to improve the functionality of urban water services in Ethiopia have included build, operate and transfer (BOT), design, build and operate (DBO), performance-based contracts (PBC) and utility development. UNICEF undertook a review of these modalities and concluded that a modified version of the BOT modality was required to both incentivize private sector engagement in urban water supply and to enhance public sector utilities. This paper describes the contractual modality developed to achieve this aim, namely an Ethiopian build, capacity build and transfer (B-CB-T) modality. This paper tests the applicability of the B-CB-T model using fuzzy logic statistical analysis and concludes that of the four tested variables (internal accountability, external accountability, operation and maintenance and financial management), the most statistically significant was the clear mandate to address complaints and maintain a positive relationship with the clients (users). This paper concludes that the B-CB-T is an effective contracting modality that should be accompanied by appropriate behavior change and social mobilization outreach to maximize tariff, billing, extension and performance of the infrastructure that is administered within the B-CB-T arrangement.</jats:p>"

In many circumstances, the empirical methods used to rank UWU performance are different between regulators of different countries, although the benchmarking basics are the same. The diversity of benchmarking methods limits the sharing of management strategies between countries. Using data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper presents a consistency analysis of the performance score method used by the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authorities of Tanzania. DEA is appropriate for this purpose because of its demonstrated flexibility in applications with diverse production environments. Thus, this paper proposes methods for benchmarking strategies to assess UWU efficiency- and management-specific goals within and between countries. The assessment shows that network DEA (NDEA) outperforms empirical methods; regulators using the proposed NDEA technique will benchmark UWU efficiency under a yardstick competition regime and, at the same time, identify the most efficient and weak UWUs using pure variable values. This innovation monitors UWU performance progress and promotes sharing of quality management strategies between UWUs and countries.</jats:p>",

Considering them simultaneously is fundamental when searching for optimal design of nearly zero-energy buildings, as encouraged by the EU in the second recast of the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD). This paper presents the application of the new energy demand and supply simultaneous optimization (EDeSSOpt) methodology to optimize the design of a single-family house in the Italian context. Both primary energy optimization and financial optimization are carried out in the context of European regulations. Robustness of the resulting optimal solution is studied through analysis of optimum neighborhoods. The resulting cost-optimized solution relies on a moderately insulated envelope, a highly efficient system, and 34% of coverage from renewables. The energy-optimized solution requires a higher level of insulation and a higher coverage from renewables, demonstrating that there is still a gap between energy and cost optimums. Beyond the results, integrated optimization by means of EDeSSOpt is demonstrated to better minimize cost functions while improving the robustness of results.</jats:p>"

Six to seven geoelectric layers were delineated from the interpreted results, the Aquifers were delineated between the fifth and sixth geoelectric layers, having an apparent resistivity above 1000Ωm, with the highest thick of 69.0m at a depth of 144.0m. Longitudinal Conductance, Hydraulic Conductivity, Transmissivity and Product Conductance range are as followings for the aquifers; 1.720 – 127.000 x 10-3Ω-1, 15.90 – 188.79m/day, 1093.3 – 1097.1m2/day and 2.590 – 252.50 x 10-3 respectively. Inferring from our hydraulic parameters, all the aquiferous zones have very high designation, wwithdrawal of great regional importance of groundwater supply potential and practically noncorrosive, soil corrosivity. 40% percentage of the aquiferous units have very good protective capacity, while for excellent and good protective capacity of the study are is 30%. All the VES points are said to be a very viable potential for safe source for groundwater exploration.  </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern organized societies require robust infrastructures, among which hydraulic projects, such as water supply and drainage systems, are most important, particularly in water-scarce areas. Athens is a unique example because it is a big city (population 3.7 million) located in a very dry area. In order to support the development of the city, large hydraulic projects had to be constructed during its history and, as a result, Athens currently has one of the largest water supply systems in the world. Could Athenians choose smaller scale infrastructures instead? Analyzing social, technical and economical historical data, we can see that large capital investments were required. In order to evaluate these investments this paper presents a technical summary of the development. An economic analysis displays historical values of these investments in present monetary values. The cost of existing infrastructure is compared to the cost of constructing smaller reservoirs and a model is created to correlate the price of water and the cost of water storage with the size of reservoirs. In particular, if more and smaller reservoirs were built instead of the large existing ones, the cost of the water would significantly increase, as illustrated by modelling the cost using local data.</jats:p>"

In the course of research, various schemes of the device of tubular heating elements for charging the channel elements of the heat accumulator were considered. Fire clay was used as a heat-accumulating material, capable of operating in a wide temperature range (up to 600 °С). Mathematical modeling of temperature change in the process of discharge over the cross section of the heat-accumulating unit has been carried out. Mathematical modeling was carried out using an application package that allows to obtain the temperature distribution over the cross section of the heat accumulator at key points of its work. The obtained simulation results were tested on an experimental setup consisting of four heat-accumulating units during the charging process and during the discharge of the heat accumulator. According to the research results, the most effective layout of the heating elements was determined, which allows to make the most of the volume of the heat-accumulating material. The dependencies to determine the exponent and the averaging coefficient of the heat flux are also found, which allow a more rational use of the volume of the accumulating nozzle.\n\nThe research results can be used to reconstruct decentralized heat supply systems for both residential buildings and public buildings. This will significantly align the schedule of electricity consumption during the day and reduce the consumption of hydrocarbon fuels.</jats:p>",

Incorporating environmental aspects in business operations is perceived to be able to create value and to achieve sustainable business performance. The manufacturing sector is the key contributor to the country’s high pollution index. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices have become more prevalent in this sector in managing the environmental issues for the effectiveness of their production requirement. Nevertheless, the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) mainly are less likely to embark on environmental practices as compared to large organisations. The establishment of certified environmental management systems (EMS) is considered as a strategic management approach that defines how organisations will address their impact on the natural environment guided by ISO 14001 as a framework. This study provides empirical evidence examining the extent of GSCM practices among the SMEs through the possession of ISO 14001 and examines the impact on sustainability performance. Data were analysed using regression analyses. Results indicate that GSCM practices have a significant positive relation with sustainability performance. Eco-design practices and environmental cooperation have a positive relationship with sustainability performance. There is no relationship between green purchasing and reverse logistics practices with sustainability performance. These results imply that Malaysian SMEs adopt GSCM practices mostly through eco-design and robust cooperation among departments in dealing with environmental issues. Green practices and reverse logistics practices are still new for SMEs and do not contribute to achieving better performance.</jats:p>"

Desalination of seawater, brackish water, and waste water is one solution to meet the demands of fresh water. Currently, reverse osmosis (RO) desalination process is one of the best methods for the desalination process. In this study, a modified controller design is proposed for RO desalination system based on symbiotic organisms search (SOS) algorithm. A multivariable model of RO desalination plant is considered for experimentation. The RO system considered here is first decoupled using a simplified decoupling process to obtain two non-interacting loops. Then, a proportional-integral-derivative controller with second order derivative (PID-DD) scheme based on SOS algorithm is proposed for each loop to find optimal control parameters of the RO system. To design the PID-DD controller for each loop, integral of squared error (ISE) is considered as fitness function. Four other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, namely, teacher-learner-based-optimization (TLBO), differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and artificial bee colony (ABC), algorithms are also tested for the considered system. To show competitiveness of the proposed SOS-based PID-DD controller, a comparative study based on time domain analysis is performed. Results show the SOS-based PID-DD controller is superior to other PID-DD controllers.</jats:p>",

The palm oil tree regularly produces FFB from its third until 24<jats:sup>th</jats:sup> year of life.The output of the farmers is measured in its weight (tonnes), so are the outputs of the trader, the CPO factory, the refinery, and the distributors/retailers. However the input to the farmer must be measured differently because the main raw materials are bought in the form of seedling or young palm-oil tree, to be planted on the field and regularly bear FFB to be later sold in tons. The objective of this study is to build a calculation model to allocate the raw material prices of the seedling. Original Hayami method to calculate single company added value was modified to facilitate calculation of the added value of supply chain network of companies. The calculation is based on the crude palm oil (CPO) factory capacity of processing 30 tons of FFB per hour, calculated for a year. The life-cycle-cost approach was used to calculate the appropriate cost of the raw material. Using this approach the raw material cost is IDR 1,012/kg, and the the total POSC added-value is IDR 13,011 per kg of product. It is expected that the modified Hayami added value calculation method can be later applied to larger and more complex industries.</jats:p>",

Phase-shifted full-bridge DC/DC converter is commonly used in medium and high power applications due to its advantages of low switching loss, high efficiency and low output current ripple. Based on the existing switching power supply and digital control technology, a digital control phase-shifting full-bridge switching power supply is designed. Its output voltage ranges from 0 to 12 V.The output current ranges from 0 to 50 A. The voltage and current level can be adjusted according to the user’s power demand, and the output mode of steady voltage or steady current can be set. The parallel operation of multiple power supply is realized by RS485 communication protocol.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The increasing number of scandals about supplier violations of environmental and social regulations has put multinational companies’ (MNCs) reputations at risk. Customers make MNCs accountable for such violations, regardless of whether the violations involve tier‐one or lower‐tier suppliers. To address this pressure, some MNCs require their tier‐one suppliers to comply with their sustainability requirements and ask them to “cascade” such requirements to their (lower‐tier) suppliers. This research investigates why this cascading effect often fails. I used inductive research to study three supply networks in the automotive, electronics, and pharmaceutical/consumer product industries. Three MNCs, 9 tier‐one suppliers, 22 lower‐tier suppliers, and 3 industry associations participated. This research (a) reveals that to cascade a buyer's sustainability requirements, the buyer's procurement unit needs to directly engage the supplier's procurement unit; (b) identifies three key interlinked procurement processes—assessing, training, and incentivizing—involving both suppliers and procurement personnel who are instrumental in building sustainable supply networks; and (c) shows how the lack of collaboration between procurement and internal (i.e., sustainability and R&amp;D) and external stakeholders (i.e., industry associations) limits an MNC's effort to promote sustainability throughout the supply network. Thus, this study highlights procurement's strategic role in building sustainable supply networks and suggests important research directions for how to achieve sustainability throughout the supply networks. </jats:p>",

This article implies that the strategic industries supply chain should be managed accordingly. The fourth amendment of the 1945 Constitution offers a macro framework as principles to conduct the supply chain. They are Togetherness, Efficiency of justice, Continuity, Environmental perspective and Self-Sufficiency. Furthermore, the framework can be used to build performance measurement indicators for the supply chain. Currently the method that is widely used to measure supply chain performance is the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR). This study studied the relations of the strategic industries principle and performance indicators within the SCOR. Twelve professionals and researchers are interviewed as respondents to investigate those relations. More than 90% respondents agreed that; (1) the principle of togetherness is strongly related to Reliability, Responsiveness and Agility; (2) Efficiency of justice is strongly related to Responsiveness; (3) Continuity is strongly related to Agility; (4) Environmental Perspective is strongly related to Green Supply Chain, and; (5) Self-Sufficiency is strongly related to Responsiveness. Therefore, SCOR performance measurement attribute is related with the strategic industries principles.</jats:p>",

Both the WSSs use groundwater as source of drinking water, and due to overpopulation and urbanization, they tend to expand their services and improve their performances, despite the fact that the primary step to do so is the performance assessment of the existing systems, lacking at the moment and needs a careful consideration. Therefore, the research study is aimed at assisting the responsible authorities of the performances being carried by their existing systems and satisfaction level of their customers against the services provided, along with their international comparisons, with similar-typed associated water supply schemes. Two sets of primary data were collected, including service-provider-driven and customer-driven, from relevant authorities and districts respectively. More specifically, for consumer-driven data collection, 66 and 75 questionnaires were distributed to the consumers of (AM-WSS) and (CK-WSS) respectively. Both the data set was classified as the input and output performance indicators (PIs), and was analyzed using SPSS, DEAP and Ms. Excel softwares, in compliance with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology.

The main aim of our study to explore the effect of supply chain risk management on organization performance in national foods Manooabad Muridke district Sheikhupura.\r\nMethodology: This study conducted in National foods Manooabad Muridke. Data were collected by using questioner from the employees of National foods Manooabad Muridke. SPSS 22 (Statistical package for social sciences) was used to analyze the collected data.\r\nMain Findings: This study is an attempt to check the effects of supply chain risk management variables to the performance of the organization. Three main supply chain risk management variables were identified namely, supply chain risk identification, supply chain risk sources and supply chain risk mitigation. We find that risk register method is mainly used for the identification of risks in the supply chain at any level. The most important risks of our study that are supplier risks, environmental risks, political risks, markets risks, warehousing risks, and financial risks. In mitigation strategies that are good to mitigate the risk in supply chain risk avoidance measures, risk control measures and risk cooperation measures.\r\nApplications: We concluded that it is important for an organization to identify risks proactively as early as possible in the decision-making process. Different types of risks need to be identified in all process of supply chains. After all the identification of risks, the organization needs to be mitigated these risks by using different mitigate strategies plan.\r\nOriginality: In the future, this study will be helpful for many organizations which deal with food items consumed by people. As in this study, we worked on supply chain risks and their management before many studies were conducted generally on risk management so this study especially focused on supply chain risks. There is a need to conduct more study in this regard in different industries so better information available to people to control risks in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, for the first time the cross-docking concept is considered in a vendor-managed inventory (VMI)-based supply chain. In this supply chain, and based on the economic order quantity (EOQ) model, a vendor prepares and sends several products to retailers. Then, retailers, based upon customers’ order, send products to the cross-dock to be delivered to the customers. Demands of retailers and customers are deterministic and shortage is acceptable as backorder. Presented mathematical model (of integer nonlinear programming type) seeks to minimize the total cost of the supply chain. Thus, a meta-heuristic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the model. In addition, a number of sample problems are analyzed to evaluate the performance of the solving algorithm. Finally, after the conclusion, some suggestions are provided for future researches. </jats:p>",

As populations and economies grow and as climatic changes alter both water supply and demand, traditional options for meeting freshwater needs are becoming less available, reliable, and effective. As we approach peak water constraints on traditional water supplies, more efforts needed to reduce water demands through a wide range of conservation and efficiency technologies and policies, and to develop alternative, non-traditional water sources. A key factor in the adoption of these strategies is their economic feasibility; yet, only limited and often confusing data are available on their relative costs. To fill this gap, this analysis evaluates the costs of four groups of alternatives for urban supply and demand based on data and analysis in the California context: stormwater capture; water recycling and reuse; brackish and seawater desalination; and a range of water conservation and efficiency measures. We also describe some important co-benefits or avoided costs, such as reducing water withdrawals from surface water bodies or polluted runoff in coastal waterways. While difficult to quantify, such benefits are economically relevant, and we highlight areas where further research and analysis are needed to improve estimates presented here. All of the water-use efficiency options are far less costly than traditional or alternative supply systems with the exception of some of the most expensive landscape water reduction options. The water treatment and reuse systems and the urban stormwater capture projects are more costly per unit of water produced but still less expensive than seawater desalination—the most expensive option evaluated.</jats:p>",

We have developed a more quantitative and practical way to determine the major sediment-supply direction (MSSD) using a new type of rose diagram based on seismic progradational sequence angles. In accordance with similar principles of the rose diagram used in structural geology, we have developed an analytical method and a workflow for a new rose diagram of seismic-based progradational sequence angles to determine MSSD. The Bozhong sag, a subbasin of the Bohai Bay Basin with two typical progradational sequences (I and II), provides a suitable example to analyze MSSD and test the new method. Our result indicates that the MSSD of the two progradational sequences (I and II) corresponds to azimuths of 10°–20° and 340°–350°, respectively, intuitively indicating two sequences derived from different provenance-transport systems. The new rose diagram of seismic progradational angles offers a powerful and quantitative method for seismic-based sedimentary provenance and paleocurrent analysis. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we analyse the application of blockchain to reduce the trade costs of producing and coordinating trusted information along supply chains. Consumers, producers, and governments increasingly demand information about the quality, characteristics, and provenance of traded goods. Partially due to the risks of error and fraud, this information is costly to produce and to maintain between dispersed parties. Recent efforts have sought to overcome these costs—such as paperless trade agendas—through the application of new technologies. Our focus is on how blockchain technology can form a new decentralized economic infrastructure for supply chains by governing decentralized dynamic ledgers of information about goods as they move. We outline the potential economic consequences of blockchain supply chains before examining policy. Effective adoption faces a range of policy challenges including regulatory recognition and interoperability across jurisdictions. We propose a high‐level policy forum in the Asia‐Pacific region to coordinate issues such as open standards and regulatory compatibility.</jats:p>",

Both the WSSs use groundwater as source of drinking water, and due to overpopulation and urbanization, they tend to expand their services and improve their performances, despite the fact that the primary step to do so is the performance assessment of the existing systems, lacking at the moment and needs a careful consideration. Therefore, the research study is aimed at assisting the responsible authorities of the performances being carried by their existing systems and satisfaction level of their customers against the services provided, along with their international comparisons, with similar-typed associated water supply schemes. Two sets of primary data were collected, including service-provider-driven and customer-driven, from relevant authorities and districts respectively. More specifically, for consumer-driven data collection, 66 and 75 questionnaires were distributed to the consumers of (AM-WSS) and (CK-WSS) respectively. Both the data set was classified as the input and output performance indicators (PIs), and was analyzed using SPSS, DEAP and Ms. Excel softwares, in compliance with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology. The findings showed that (AM-WSS) had a relative technical efficiency, te of 1 (100 %), whereas CK-WSS had a te of 0.545. As a result, CK-WSS was the only System considered and recommended for amendments. Furthermore, the analysis of the findings showed that CK-WSS needed to focus on decreasing the staff size and total expenditure by 45 % to comply with optimization. The team recommends to train their personnel and reduce the number by 45 %, and additionally recommends to collect, keep and register all the necessary data of the schemes in an organized manner for future demands, plans, rehabilitation, performance, and improvements of the corresponding components of their systems. </jats:p>"

The study consisted of 2 parts. The 1st part involved utilisation of 22 cadaveric hips for establishing the injection and histological technique. The 2nd part of the study included 4 control cadaveric hips and 12 cadaveric hips with posterior approach hip resurfacing.

In all the resurfaced heads, there was good flow to all the neck zones. 6 resurfaced specimens had no dye flow to any of the head zones. In the remaining 6, dye-stained vessels were seen variably in the anterior and middle zones but were consistently absent in the posterior zones of the head. Zones representing the antero-inferior parts of femoral head had the maximum flow of ink, followed by zones representing middle-inferior parts. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> Posterior approach for hip resurfacing arthroplasty results in vascular insult to the femoral head, with posterior zones more affected than the anterior zones.

The finding reveals that existing housing policies and government programmes have a significant role in promoting homeownership. The finding further suggests that building and completing more units of affordable homes (as captured by housing stocks) and promoting innovative home financing products (both conventional and Islamic) are the most significant variables in promoting homeownership in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

The authors focus on cogeneration system (CGS) as one of regulation resources. In order to procure adequate volume of regulation capability, an aggregator coordinates a number of CGSs efficiently and flexibly considering the wide variety of electricity/thermal demands of CGS owners. This paper proposes a novel optimal operation strategy of CGS coordinated by the aggregator considering the energy balance and operation cost of individual CGS owner. This paper also demonstrates the availability of CGSs for regulation capability by numerical case studies in which the actual consumption profile is employed.</jats:p>",

Drawing from a literature review and a stakeholder workshop attended by 68 experts, it seeks to answer three research questions: (a) What are appropriate and sustainable urban water supply and sanitation policies for a society that is adopting the basic principles of a green economy? (b) What should be the role of water supply and sanitation in a green and circular economy and what are the current challenges to meeting this objective? and (c) What actions are needed in the Finnish water and sanitation services (WSS) sector to effectively meet the requirements of a green and circular economy? The results are applied to the specific case of Finland, and recommendations and conclusions for the Finnish society and its water services are presented. </jats:p>",

This method comprises two concepts: <jats:italic>lean</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>six sigma</jats:italic>, each with its own objectives. Lean is a concept that aims to optimize the value stream process by eliminating all kind of waste. Meanwhile, the goal of <jats:italic>six sigma</jats:italic> is to increase process capability in the value stream by aiming for zero defects and reduced process variation. The supply chain performance of manufacturing companies is determined by the ongoing internal activities reflected in the value stream, therefore both lean and six sigma applications are hypothesized to have an impact on the performance. Based on the reviewed literature, this study aims to produce a framework that can be used to explain the impact of lean and six sigma on supply chain performance. In the proposed framework, lean indicators are reflected in just-in-time, quality management and employee involvement, whereas six sigma indicators are characterized by the six sigma variables. At the other end of the equation, supply chain performance is defined by four constructs which are supplier selection, production, delivery and logistic performance, and warehouse.</jats:p>",

The structural form of the CCDAF tank and its process parameters are the required conditions to achieve countercurrent collision and cocurrent adhesion. In this study, eight CCDAF tank process models were established with a flow rate of 0.5 m3/h. Flow field numerical simulation and process optimization of a CCDAF tank was conducted using Fluent software. The simulation results show that the optimal conditions for the CCDAF process are as follows: contact zone ascending velocity 10 mm/s, separation zone separation velocity 1.5 mm/s, dissolved gas pressure 0.45 MPa, and recirculating dissolved-gas distribution ratio R1/R2 1:1. Under these operating conditions, the flow state in the flotation tank is the most stable and the gas in the contact zone is evenly distributed. According to the simulation results, a 5 m3/h pilot plant was built. The structural dimensions were: B × L × H = 1,020 mm × 1,300 mm × 1,350 mm. The test results show that the CCDAF has a significant decontamination effect and is clearly superior to the cocurrent flow DAF process and countercurrent flow DAF process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The maldistribution of licensed doctors is one of the major challenges faced by the Chinese health sector. However, this subject remains underexplored, as the underlying causes of licensed doctor distribution have not been fully mapped out. To fill the research void, this study theoretically modeled and empirically measured various determinants of licensed doctor distribution from both the supply and demand sides while taking the spillover effect between the adjacent geographical units into consideration. Methods: The theory of demand and supply is adopted to construct a research framework so as to explain the imbalance in the licensed doctor distribution. Both direct effects and spillover effects of the supply-side factors and demand-side factors are empirically measured with the spatial panel econometric models. Results: The health service demand was found, as expected, to be the major driving force of the licensed doctor distribution across the nation. That is, the increase in health services demands in a province could significantly help one unit attract licensed doctors from adjacent units. Unexpectedly but intriguingly, the medical education capacity showed a relatively limited effect on increasing the licensed doctor density in local units compared with its spillover effect on neighboring units. In addition, government and social health expenditures played different roles in the health labor market, the former being more effective in increasing the stock of clinicians and public health doctors, the latter doing better in attracting dentists and general practitioners. Conclusions: The results provide directions for Chinese policy makers to formulate more effective policies, including a series of measures to boost the licensed doctor stock in disadvantaged areas, such as the increase of government or social health expenditures, more quotas for medical universities, and the prevention of a brain drain of licensed doctors.</jats:p>"

In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable “by default” without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.</jats:p>",

Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penawaran bawang merah elastis terhadap perubahan harga bawang merah dan harga umbi benih, namun kurang elastis terhadap perubahan upah tenaga kerja, serta tidak elastis terhadap perubahan harga pupuk. Permintaan input (umbi benih, pupuk, dan tenaga kerja) bersifat elastis terhadap harga masing-masing input tersebut, dan sebagian besar bersifat inelastis terhadap harga input lainnya.

The study was conducted in Raji Village, Demak Subdistrict, Demak District in September - December 2016.  Primary data was collected through survey method by interviewing 30 respondents. The data was analyzed in the form of input demand share by Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) method.  The results showed that supply of shallot is elastic to the price changes of shallot and price of seed bulbs, but less elastic to changes in labor wages and inelastic to changes in fertilizer prices. Demand for production input is elastic to the price of each input, and are largely inelastic with respect to other input prices. Therefore, to increase the shallot supply, the Government should be able to maintain the stabilization of shallot prices and encourage the use of true seed shallot as an alternative to reduce the use of shallot seeds.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This study aimed to quantify the effects of supra‐optimal temperature on growth, photosynthetic performance, and antioxidative responses in bread wheat cultivars grown under varied zinc (Zn) supply. Two bread wheat cultivars (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L., cvs. Lasani‐2008 and Faisalabad‐2008) with varied responsiveness to Zn supply and drought tolerance were cultured in nutrient solution with low (0.1 µM) or adequate (1.0 µM) Zn under optimal (25/20°C day/night) or supra‐optimal (36/28°C day/night) temperature regimes. Supra‐optimal temperature severely reduced root but not shoot biomass, whereas low Zn reduced shoot as well as root biomass. Shoot‐to‐root biomass ratio was reduced under low Zn but increased under supra‐optimal temperature. Supra‐optimal temperature inhibited root elongation and volume particularly in plants supplied with low Zn. In both cultivars, Zn efficiency index was reduced by supra‐optimal temperature, whereas heat tolerance index was reduced by low Zn supply. Supra‐optimal temperature decreased photosynthesis, quantum yield, and chlorophyll density in low‐Zn but not in adequate‐Zn plants. In comparison, low Zn decreased specific activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and increased glutathione reductase (GR), where supra‐optimal temperature increased SOD, decreased GR and did not change APX activity in leaves and roots. Moreover, supra‐optimal temperature severely reduced shoot Zn concentration and Zn uptake per plant specifically under adequate Zn supply. Overall, supra‐optimal temperature exacerbated adverse effects of low Zn supply, resulting in severe reductions in growth traits <jats:italic>viz</jats:italic>. shoot and root biomass, root length and volume, and consequently impeded Zn uptake, enhanced oxidative stress and impaired photosynthetic performance. Adequate Zn nutrition is crucial to prevent yield loss in wheat cultivated under supra‐optimal temperatures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When calculating short-circuit currents in the AC traction network, it is assumed that each of the traction substations receives power from uncoupled external power supply sources with known resistances. In some cases, especially when powering a group of traction substations from a high-voltage power line of a longitudinal power supply, the external power supply system affects not only the magnitude of short-circuit currents, but also their redistribution between adjacent traction substations of the interstation area where this circuit is considered. Such unrecorded redistribution can have a negative effect on short circuit protection. The article considers the equivalent circuit of the traction network, taking into account resistance of the external power supply system. Particular attention is paid to the fact that in replacement circuits of direct and negative sequence value of reduced resistance of one phase of a multiwinding transformer, calculated from the short circuit voltage, does not depend on the connection scheme of its windings. It is noted that in some cases it is difficult to obtain a complete scheme of an external power supply system. Considering that the short circuit in the traction network for the external power supply system is remote, it is proposed taking into account the reference network or traction substations as power sources, from which high-voltage transmission lines power the traction substations. Resistance of the supporting substations as power sources must takes into account connected equivalent power system.Such equivalenting should be carried out by known values of currents or short-circuit powers at the inputs of the reference substation or, if such information is not available, by the rated values of the switched-off currents or powers of the switches of high-voltage line connections.The following power schemes for traction substations are considered: each from its own supporting substation, which is part of an electrically uncoupled external power supply system; from the double-circuit high-voltage line of longitudinal power supply when it is powered from different supporting substations; from the supporting network substation, the traction substation receives power from two lines, and from this the traction substations receive power from two lines in a circle pattern.These three common cases cover all the most common power schemes for traction substations. For each of them formulas are given to determine the resulting equivalent resistance of the external power supply circuit, which should be taken into account in the replacement circuit of the traction network.</jats:p>"

Models for predicting indicators of drinking water based on the quality of the source water are proposed. The technological process of deodorization of drinking water is considered. The following system analysis methods were used in the models development: correlation analysis of data, the principal component method, regression modeling, and the least squares method. Hidden relationships between indicators of drinking and source water were identified. The adequacy of the obtained results was proved by comparing them with the actual values. The obtained results approximate well the actual values. The results can be used in water supply systems to improve the quality of drinking water.</jats:p>",

One important aspect of decisionmaking under uncertainty is the viewpoint of the decision maker towards risk, which is overlooked in the biomass supply chain management literature. In this paper, we address this gap by evaluating alternative supply chain designs taking into account uncertain future conditions resulting from changes in biomass availability and cost, and bioproduct and energy prices. Three decision rules, maximax, minimax regret, and maximin, representing, respectively, optimistic, opportunistic, and pessimistic perspectives, are used for evaluation. It is assumed that the decision maker has knowledge about the potential future events, but the likelihood of their occurrence is unknown. According to the results of the case study, investment in bioenergy and biofuel conversion facilities was recommended based on optimistic and opportunistic viewpoints. Production of both bienergy and biofuels would not be profitable under pessimistic conditions. Therefore, investment in only bienergy facilities was prescribed under pessimistic conditions.</jats:p>",

The retailers represent cooperative and private organizational systems with varied levels of operational integration. In light of the insights from these case studies, we theorize factors contributing to operational cost‐effectiveness and conceptualize approaches and considerations for improving the BoP community. Specifically, we clarify the usefulness of alternative supply chain alignment practices in promoting efficiency, innovation, and equitability among the BoP constituents and advance a set of propositions linking the motivations, strategies, practices, and performance in handloom supply chains.

This work highlights on the urgent need for clean, efficient, and resilient energy sources through the development of advanced optimization methods. The hybrid solar-wind systems are meant to maximize power generation. Complexity arises when determining the optimum design, size, functionality, materials, distribution, and mechanism of each system as they are combined to ensure system reliability and optimal outcomes. The development of the new optimization methods (such as genetic algorithms, heuristic approaches, and particle swarm techniques) was generated to overcome the encountered barriers in traditional or classical approaches; such as in iterative techniques and linear programming methods. Additionally, the multi-objective analysis has been involved in various studies where vectors, criteria, and alternatives are applied with respect to the main objectives. However, further research efforts are encouraged to innovatively optimize hybrid solar-wind systems; including the optimization of hybrid solar-wind sizing (HSWS), design, capacity, battery storage, energy distribution systems and techno-economical considerations.</jats:p>",

Agriculture of Ukraine has all the conditions for the development of organic agricultural production, since the soil-climatic allow to significantly expand the volume of organic farming. Co-operation of the organic agricultural sector in Ukraine is presented in the form of dairy cooperatives, which are intended for the sale of milk at more attractive prices.

Based on this, an innovative index system for the evaluation of the sustainability of power supply and demand systems is proposed based on the four elements of total amount, structure, technology and environment. Furthermore, by integrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and State Space (SS) method, a PCA-SS evaluation model is constructed to explore the development bottleneck of China’s power supply and demand system. The results show that there is still a large gap between the actual sustainability and the ideal range, and that the sustainability of structural and environmental layers needs further improvement.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Credit lines have been widely adopted by banks to grant credit to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). However, there often exists a gap between the credit lines granted by banks and the actual funding needs of SMEs. In addition, existing credit line models treat each SME as a stand-alone entity instead of considering it within its supply chain system. But an SME’s supply chain relations have a significant impact on its credit-worthiness. To offer banks a holistic assessment, this paper first constructs a base credit line model for SMEs by considering their supply chain background. Next, by accounting for the unique advantage of soft information processing in a supply chain context, we put forward an extended credit line model for supply chain enterprises with soft information. The base and extended credit line models proposed in this paper aim to reduce information asymmetry between banks and SMEs via the core enterprise in the supply chain, thereby helping banks to secure a sustainable source of profit at a lower risk level and SMEs to obtain more credit to support their sustainable growth. A case study is furnished to illustrate how the proposed models can be applied in practice and an empirical analysis further verifies their validity.</jats:p>"

As tariffs in the transport problem under consideration, depending on the purpose of the calculations, it is proposed to use the averaged actual values in a given period of time according to the energy supplying organizations (the purpose of the calculations is to reduce the cost of production and transportation of electricity), and also conditional qualitative assessments - “fines” (The goal is to improve the environmental and reliability of the system as a whole). The influence of the generated power of solar power plants on the operation modes of the power system of the Crimea is investigated. A methodology has been developed to optimize the production of solar power plants that affect the reliability and quality of power supply. The calculation of different scenarios of energy supply of the Crimea carried out, including at peak and average modes of power consumption, with different variants of solar activity, the time of year, taking into account and without taking into account the energy sources under construction, repair works of sources in the off-season. Based on the results of the calculations, conclusions are made about the reliability of the power system in the region under different scenarios of power supply, as well as the need to use the power bridge for the flow of electricity from the mainland in both directions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Determination of an optimal location for plant installation over water transmission lines leads not only to reduction in the cost of construction and energy transmission, but also to enhancement of hydrological conditions. The main objective of implementing a water supply pipelines project is not to generate power. Various economic and hydraulic attributes also play an important role during the selection of an optimal location for plant installation. Therefore, there is a need for utilising multi-attribute optimisation methods. The effective criteria include cost, maintenance and operation, and distances from both the consumption area and the main road. In this paper, six scenarios, based on the different maximum allowable pressures (in order of 10, 12·5, 15, 17·5 and 20 bar) and the current condition, were studied. The results indicated that the fourth scenario, with a maximum pressure of 17·5 bar (1750 kPa), should be regarded as the best choice for determining the optimal location. These results were in line with the ones obtained for cost analysis. Moreover, the leakage factor was mitigated by 24·1%. It is concluded that the methods of analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process are useful tools in outlining the proper location for installation of a hydropower plant on water transmission pipelines. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Understanding the full scope of human impact on wildlife populations requires a framework to assess the population‐level repercussions of nonlethal disturbance. The Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) framework provides such an approach, by linking the effects of disturbance on the behavior and physiology of individuals to their population‐level consequences. Bio‐energetic models have been used as implementations of PCoD, as these integrate the behavioral and physiological state of an individual with the state of the environment, to mediate between disturbance and biological significant changes in vital rates (survival, growth, and reproduction). To assess which levels of disturbance lead to adverse effects on population growth rate requires a bio‐energetic model that covers the complete life cycle of the organism under study. In a density‐independent setting, the expected lifetime reproductive output of a single female can then be used to predict the level of disturbance that leads to population decline. Here, we present such a model for a medium‐sized cetacean, the long‐finned pilot whale (<jats:italic>Globicephala melas</jats:italic>). Disturbance is modeled as a yearly recurrent period of no resource feeding for the pilot whale female and her calf. Short periods of disturbance lead to the pre‐weaned death of the first one or more calves of the young female. Higher disturbance levels also affect survival of calves produced later in the life of the female, in addition to degrading female survival. The level of disturbance that leads to a negative population growth rate strongly depends on the available resources in the environment. This has important repercussion for the timing of disturbance if resource availability fluctuates seasonally. The model predicts that pilot whales can tolerate on average three times longer periods of disturbance in seasons of high resource availability, compared to disturbance happening when resources are low. Although our model is specifically parameterized for pilot whales, it provides useful insights into the general consequences of nonlethal disturbance. If appropriate data on life history and energetics are available, it can be used to provide management advice for specific species or populations.</jats:p>",

The thickness of the debris layer is a key\ncontrol of the melt rate of those glaciers, yet little is known about the\nrelative importance of the three potential sources of debris supply: the\nrockwalls, the glacier bed and the lateral moraines. In this study, we\nhypothesize that mass movement from the lateral moraines is a significant\ndebris supply to debris-covered glaciers, in particular when the glacier is\ndisconnected from the rockwall due to downwasting. To test this hypothesis,\neight high-resolution and accurate digital elevation models from the\nlateral moraines of the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in Nepal are used.\nThese are created using structure from motion (SfM), based on images captured\nusing an unmanned aerial vehicle between May 2013 and April 2018. The\nanalysis shows that mass transport results in an elevation change on the\nlateral moraines with an average rate of -0.31±0.26 m year−1 during\nthis period, partly related to sub-moraine ice melt. There is a higher\nelevation change rate observed in the monsoon (-0.39±0.74 m year−1)\nthan in the dry season (-0.23±0.68 m year−1). The lower debris aprons\nof the lateral moraines decrease in elevation at a faster rate during both\nseasons, probably due to the melt of ice below. The surface lowering rates of\nthe upper gullied moraine, with no ice core below, translate into an annual\nincrease in debris thickness of 0.08 m year−1 along a narrow margin of the\nglacier surface, with an observed absolute thickness of approximately 1 m,\nreducing melt rates of underlying glacier ice. Further research should focus\non how large this negative feedback is in controlling melt and how debris is\nredistributed on the glacier surface.\n                    </jats:p>"

For example, the protection from ischemia–reperfusion (IR) in the liver that is obtained by previous maneuvers triggering beneficial molecular and functional changes. Recently, we have assessed the PC effects of thyroid hormone (T<jats:sub>3;</jats:sub> single dose of 0.1 mg/kg) and n‐3 long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n‐3 LCPUFAs; daily doses of 450 mg/kg for 7 days) that abrogate IR injury to the liver.

T<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐dependent protective mechanisms include (i) the reactive oxygen species (ROS)‐dependent activation of transcription factors nuclear factor‐κB (NF‐κB), AP‐1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and nuclear factor erythroid‐2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) upregulating the expression of protective proteins. (ii) ROS‐induced endoplasmic reticulum stress affording proper protein folding. (iii) The autophagy response to produce FAs for oxidation and ATP supply and amino acids for protein synthesis. (iv) Downregulation of inflammasome nucleotide‐bonding oligomerization domain leucine‐rich repeat containing family pyrin containing 3 and interleukin‐1β expression to prevent inflammation. N‐3 LCPUFAs induce antioxidant responses due to Nrf2 upregulation, with inflammation resolution being related to production of oxidation products and NF‐κB downregulation.

Most events were ipsilateral (9 of 12). The underlying pathologies were descending aortic aneurysm in six patients and type B dissection in six patients. An evoked-potential decrease or loss was always associated with the insertion of large bore stent-graft-introducing sheaths. The median duration of the unilaterally EP decrease or loss was 16 (10; 31) minutes (range, 2–77 minutes) with baseline values re-established at the end of the procedure after sheath removal in all cases.

This observation highlights the importance of the internal iliac arteries as one of the major spinal cord's blood supply territories, and may serve as a stimulus to reduce the duration of sheath indwelling to a minimum.</jats:p>",

The aims of the present study were to identify the provenance of the sand and dust fractions of the sediments of the Taklamakan Desert, to determine the contemporary sediment supply mechanisms of the desert, and to assess the relative importance of silt‐producing mechanisms for the desert dust. We analyzed the grain size of desert sediment samples and measured the content of major, trace, and rare earth elements within the bulk samples, sand fractions (&gt;63 μm), and dust fractions (&lt;63 μm). Our grain size and geochemical data sets suggest that the Kunlun Mountains are the main source of the sand fraction, whereas both the Kunlun and Tian Shan Mountains are the main sources of the dust fraction. Our interpretation is supported by the elevation gradient within the Taklamakan Desert and by wind data.</jats:p>",

The multiple items or products are processed and produced in a single facility of the vendor. This model developed is applied for the system consisting of a vendor and a buyer where the vendor produces multiple items and delivers apart of them to the buyer as the discrete demand and others as continuous demand to end customers. During the production time there will be some defect products where apart of them will be reworked to be a good ones and some others will be disposed of. A mathematical model is built to describe the problem studied referred to the basic inventory models. The continuous demand coming from the other customers are served at anytime while the discrete demand from the buyer are served by the vendor using a number of deliveries shipments during the cycle time. The aim of the model developed is to minimize the total operational cost of the supply chain network. The model then is solved by algorithm and optimization methods as solution procedures. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the practical usage of the model and results are discussed. Sensitivity analysis to show the changes of optimal solutions which are affected by the changes of input parameters is also performed.

Using registry data from the blood collection agency in the Netherlands, linked to longitudinal survey data from the Donor InSight study (N = 20,560), we examined whether life events are related to blood donor lapse. Childbirth, losing a job, and starting a job increase the likelihood of donor lapse, while health-related events (i.e., blood transfusion in a family member, death of a family member) decrease the likelihood of donor lapse. Moreover, results showed how social and practical concerns explain donors’ decisions to donate blood after the occurrence of life events.

In addition, to mount the system in the vehicle with no cooling–heating equipment, development of expanding the operating temperature range of the lithium-ion capacitor was conducted. Several improvements have made the capacitor operate stably in high-temperature environments above 100 °C.</jats:p>"

A Stackelberg model was built to help investigate the rate of thermal order realization, the carbon reduction strategy in the coal enterprise, and the amount of thermal energy ordered in the electric enterprise. Results show that under a green financial background, a high bank loan discount rate for investing in carbon reduction technology equates to large carbon reduction in coal enterprises, large quantities of thermal energy ordered in electric enterprises, and high profit for coal and electric enterprises. However, the realization rate of thermal power ordered decreased when the price regulation become strict, thereby reducing the profit and carbon emission in electric enterprise. Therefore, the thermal price regulation level increased, the profit on both company and the production did not respond with sensitivity, and the government could encourage a low carbon model by controlling the bank loan rate.</jats:p>"

An electroencephalogram, cerebral blood oxygenation changes, an electrocardiogram and blood pressure were recorded during rest and during a movement task. Causal coupling between them was evaluated using directed transfer function, a measure based on the Granger causality principle. The multivariate autoregressive model was fitted to all the signals simultaneously, which made it possible to construct a complete scheme of interactions between the considered signals. The obtained pattern of interactions in the resting state estimated in the 0.05–0.15 Hz band revealed a predominant influence of blood pressure oscillations on all the other variables. Reciprocal connections between blood pressure and heart rate variability time series indicated the presence of feedback loops between these signals. During movement, the pattern of connections did not change dramatically. The number of connections decreased, but the couplings between blood pressure and heart rate variability signal were not significantly changed, and the strong influence of the decreased blood hemoglobin concentration on the oxygenated hemoglobin concentration persisted. For the first time our results provided a comprehensive scheme of interactions between electrical and hemodynamic brain signals, heart rate and blood pressure oscillations. Persistent reciprocal connections between blood pressure and heart rate variability time series suggest possible feedforward and feedback coupling of cardiovascular variables which may lead to the observed oscillations in Mayer wave range.</jats:p>",

Spatial heterogeneity might arise for several reasons. For example, landowners closer to bioenergy processing plants might be more likely to be willing to supply bioenergy crops, and landowners who are more willing to supply bioenergy crops may be spatially clustered because they share similar land attributes, demographics, experiences, and/or values. Using high‐resolution <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GIS</jats:styled-content> data related to the location of pellet plants utilizing bioenergy crops and survey data related to landowners’ characteristics including spatial location, we estimate a spatial probit model to explain the variation in individual‐specific reservation prices (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RPs</jats:styled-content>)—the feedstock price at which landowners become willing to supply a bioenergy crop. We find that respondents’ <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RP</jats:styled-content> is lower the closer they live to their nearest pellet plant and spatial dependency is only present for switchgrass supply.

In this study, we evaluated two methods to enhance oxygen supply: (1) using a culture plate with a gas-permeable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane on the bottom, and; (2) embedding hydrogel beads in the spheroids. Culturing spheroids on PDMS increased cell growth and affected glucose/lactate metabolism and CYP3A4 mRNA expression and subsequent enzyme activity. The spheroids, comprised of 5000 Hep G2 cells and 5000 20 µm-diameter hydrogel beads, did not develop a necrotic core for nine days when cultured on a gas-permeable sheet. In contrast, central necrosis in spheroids lacking hydrogel beads was observed after day 3 of culture, even when using PDMS.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP) hosts the Peruvian upwelling\nsystem, which represents one of the most productive areas in the world ocean.\nHigh primary production followed by rapid heterotrophic utilization of\norganic matter supports the formation of one of the most intense oxygen\nminimum zones (OMZs) in the world ocean, where dissolved oxygen\n(O2) concentrations reach less than 1 µmol kg−1.\nThe high productivity leads to an accumulation of dissolved organic matter\n(DOM) in the surface layers that may serve as a substrate for heterotrophic\nrespiration. However, the importance of DOM utilization for O2\nrespiration in the Peruvian upwelling system in general and for shaping the\nupper oxycline in particular remains unclear so far. This study reports the\nfirst estimates of diapycnal fluxes and supply of O2, dissolved\norganic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen, dissolved hydrolysable\namino acids (DHAA) and dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) for the ETSP\noff Peru. Diapycnal flux and supply estimates were obtained by combining\nmeasured vertical diffusivities and solute concentration gradients. They were\nanalysed together with the molecular composition of DCCHO and DHAA to infer\nthe transport of labile DOM into the upper OMZ and the potential role of DOM\nutilization for the attenuation of the diapycnal O2 flux that\nventilates the OMZ. The observed diapycnal O2 flux\n(50 mmol O2 m−2 d−1 at maximum) was limited to the\nupper 80 m of the water column; the O2 supply of ∼1 µmol kg−1 d−1 was comparable to previously published\nO2 consumption rates for the North and South Pacific OMZs. The\ndiapycnal DOM flux (31 mmol C m−2 d−1 at maximum) was limited\nto ∼30 m water depth, suggesting that the labile DOM is extensively\nconsumed within the upper part of the shallow oxycline off Peru. The analyses\nof DCCHO and DHAA composition support this finding, suggesting that DOM\nundergoes comprehensive remineralization within the upper part of the\noxycline, as the DOM within the core of the OMZ was found to be largely\naltered. Estimated by a simple equation for carbon combustion, aerobic\nrespiration of DCCHO and DHAA, supplied by diapycnal mixing\n(0.46 µmol kg−1 d−1 at maximum), could account for up\nto 38 % of the diapycnal O2 supply in the upper oxycline, which\nsuggests that DOM utilization plays a significant role for shaping the upper\noxycline in the ETSP.\n                    </jats:p>"

The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method, which is naturally well suited for non-negative data of high dimension, was used to identify the latent factors and apportion the contributions from identified pollution sources to each water quality parameter. We obtained a data matrix with 11 water quality variables collected from 2013 to 2016 in the Luanhe River Basin in northern China. The results highlight the substantial contribution of industrial and livestock wastewater. All land-use types have a slightly weaker impact on surface water pollution during the dry season than during the rainy season. The aim of this study is to illustrate the practicability of multivariate statistical analysis, especially the application of NMF, which has major potential for source separation and the apportionment of water pollution.</jats:p>",

The treated wastewater was added in various dosages (0%, 50%, 75% and 100%) to the water used to produce cylindrical concrete samples. These samples were evaluated for compressive strength and water absorption tests. After these evaluations, the dosage of 100% treated wastewater for concrete production was established and ICPB were produced with this water composition. Subsequently, an area in a parking lot was replaced by ICPB produced with treated wastewater, and an equal area was replaced by ICPB produced with potable water. A comparison between parameters obtained for cylindrical samples and ICPB samples prepared with treated wastewater and those prepared with potable water indicated that wastewater reuse would be a good alternative for potable water consumption reduction in the concrete industry.</jats:p>",

This study derives the gage height mass balance (GHMB) and gage height power function (GHPF) methods using a two-component mass balance equation based on the relationship between the gage height and streamflow. The GHMB and GHPF methods are corrected by comparing the results of the conductivity mass balance (CMB), conductivity power function (CMBPF), GHMB, and GHPF methods in 20 basins in the United States. Subsequently, the corrected GHMB and GHPF methods are applied to seven other basins. The results indicate that: (1) the baseflow index (BFI) values calculated from the GHMB and GHPF methods are in good agreement with those of conventional methods; (2) the daily baseflow calculated as per the GHMB and GHPF methods can be suitably fitted with the CMB method; (3) the baseflow is significantly suppressed when the flood peak is larger, and deviations between the GHMB, GHPF, and CMB results are mainly observed for flood events with a large flood peak. As a tracer, the gage height can reasonably separate the baseflow, and the results indicate the efficacy of the methods.</jats:p>",

This research was conducted in the supply chain in Wooden Toys Industries by identifying risks using the Fuzzy Reasoning method to calculate the amount of opportunity and impact that would arise if the risk occurred. To reduce the opportunity and impact of risk, a mitigation strategy is needed to consider and can be done using the Analytical Network Process method.

This research is conducted by using data reduction method in determining quantitative data for input Stream Value Mapping and Supply Chain Management. Determination of rubber material purchase price is done by using the average trend of rubber price so that the purchase of rubber material is done flat. In order to create trusts in the supply chain, profit-sharing systems are used so that suppliers will supply the right, consistent quantity, quality, and timing of delivery. The results obtained supply chain frameworks are better able to ensure process efficiency and material availability. If applied, this framework will save up to 29.17% processing time.</jats:p>",

In this study discussed the risks that may arise in the wooden toy industry supply chain and how to manage these risks. The calculation divided into three phases; there are risk mapping, risk assessment, and risk management. House of Risk (HOR) is used in calculating potential risks and Analytical Network Process (ANP) is used to choose the best strategy for supply chain risk management. Followed by HOR calculation, risk that has the greatest value and selected as potential risk is the risk of price/cost fluctuations with an ARP value of 432. The strategy of this risk is grouped based on 2 causes, namely raw material price fluctuations and poor management. With ANP calculations, the strategy for raw material price fluctuations are understanding and determining the quantity of material used (28.14%) and combining woods with various commodities (23.23%). Then the alternative for poor management are doing strategic financial accounting (54.48%) and doing financial planning (33.07%).</jats:p>",

However, the spatiotemporal variations of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> concentration and flux at fine spatial scales in mariculture ponds are poorly known, particularly in China, worlds largest aquaculture producer. In this study, the plot‐scale spatiotemporal variations of water CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> concentration and flux, both within and among ponds, were researched in shrimp ponds in Shanyutan wetland, Min River Estuary, Southeast China. The average water CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> concentration and diffusion flux across the water‐air interface in the shrimp ponds over the shrimp aquaculture period varied from 2.29 ± 0.29 to 50.48 ± 20.91 μM and from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 2.32 ± 0.95 mmol·m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>·hr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively. The CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from the estuarine ponds varied greatly between seasons, with peaks in August and September, which was similar to the trend of water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations. There was no remarkable difference in CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> concentration and flux between shrimp ponds but significantly spatiotemporal differences in CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> concentration and flux within the ponds. Significantly higher emissions occurred in the feeding zone, accounting for approximately 60% of total CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emission flux, while much lower CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions appeared in aeration zone, contributing 14% to total flux. This study suggests the importance of considering spatiotemporal variation in the whole‐pond estimates of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> concentration and flux. In light of such high spatial variation within ponds, improving aeration and feed utilization efficiency would help to mitigate CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> emissions from mariculture ponds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fierce competition in the recycling industry and the rapid development of internet technology has prompted recycling centers to develop a dual-channel reverse supply chain with both offline and online recycling channels. After the introduction of online channels, recycling centers and third-party recyclers (TPR) have paid attention to the division of profits in supply chain systems and the behavior of fairness concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to help recycling enterprises make pricing decisions in consideration of fairness concerns. This paper is aimed at answering the following two main questions: (1) When the recycling center or TPR have fairness concerns, how does the optimal pricing and revenue of supply chain members change when both sides are neutral? (2) When the fairness concern coefficient changes, how does the overall revenue of the supply chain system change? How should supply chain members adjust their pricing decisions to maximize their own profits? In order to solve the above problems, Stackelberg game models were made from three aspects: both sides are neutral, only the TPR has fairness concerns, and only the recycling center has fairness concerns. Based on the results of the example analyses for the model, we found that when only the TPR has fairness concerns, the profit of the recycling center and the transfer price of offline channels will decrease, while the profit of TPR is the opposite. Furthermore, when only a recycling center has fairness concerns, it will lead to the reduction of not only the recycling price and transfer price of offline channels, but also the profits of the entire supply chain system. Specially, whether it is for a recycling center or TPR, a lower level of fairness concern coefficient has a stronger impact on pricing and revenue than at high levels.</jats:p>"

As a result, high demand for second‐hand items remained even at the turn of the twentieth century. Records from a local auction house from 1830 to 1900 show that, even in the 1880s, more affluent urban consumers were still active on the second‐hand market. Thereafter, they turned to the market for new goods, while potential demand from labourers and servants continued to be provided for by the second‐hand market. Mechanization meant that more items entered this market. It changed the range and quality of objects available, consequently affecting the attractiveness of second‐hand textiles and clothing. After the 1870s, falling and converging prices can be discerned, while more durable fabrics largely retained their value. We conclude that the consumer revolution (in a broader sense) had by this stage gained a foothold among ordinary Swedish urban households. The auction trade was part of a democratization of consumption. The general lesson is that understanding mass consumption requires research not only into second‐hand consumption, but also into different regional settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past 40 years, south-central Chile has experienced important land-use-induced land cover changes, with massive conversion from native forests (NF) to Pinus radiata D.Don and Eucalyptus spp. exotic forest plantations (FP). Several case studies have related this conversion to a reduction in water supply within small catchments (&lt;100 ha). In this work, we explore the impacts of NF and FP on streamflow by using a large-sample catchment dataset recently developed for Chile. We select 25 large forested catchments (&gt;20,000 ha) in south-central Chile (35° S–41° S), analyze their land cover and precipitation spatial distributions, and fit a regression model to quantify the influence of NF, FP, grassland (GRA) and shrubland (SHR) partitions on annual runoff. To assess potential effects of land cover changes on water supply, we use the fitted model (R2 = 0.84) in synthetic experiments where NF, GRA and SHR covers within the catchments are replaced by patches of FP. We show that annual runoff consistently decreases with increments of FP, although the magnitude of the change (ranging from 2.2% to 7.2% mean annual runoff decrease for 10,000 ha increment in FP) depends on several factors, including the initial land cover partition within the basin, the replaced land cover class, the area of the catchment, and the type of catchment (drier or humid). Finally, in the context of the mitigation strategies pledged in the Chilean NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions defined after the Paris Agreement), which include the afforestation of 100,000 ha (mainly native forest) by 2030, we quantify the impacts on water supply due to the afforestation of 100,000 ha with different combinations of NF and FP. We show that annual runoff is highly sensitive to the relative area of FP to NF: ratios of FP to NF areas of 10%, 50% and 90% would lead to 3%, −18% and −40% changes in mean annual runoff, respectively. Our results can be used in the discussion of public policies and decision-making involving forests and land cover changes, as they provide scientifically-based tools to quantify expected impacts on water resources. In particular, this knowledge is relevant for decision making regarding mitigation strategies pledged in the Chilean NDC.</jats:p>"

It is difficult to substantially increase the output of China’s manganese ore because it is of low grade and high impurity content. However, as a large consumer in the world, it is very important to ensure the long-term stable supply of this mineral. Collecting historical data on manganese ore in China over the past 20 years, we identified and evaluated risks during the whole process of production, supply, consumption, reserves, and trade of resources using the Volkswagen and German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (VW-BGR) method by selecting nine indicators: current market equilibrium, market price volatility, Reserve/production ratio, import dependence, import concentration, country risks, country concentration and future supply and demand trend. Furthermore, we assessed its economic importance by calculating the contribution of manganese ore involved in different value chains. It shows the same downward trend both in manganese ore consumption and economic importance, and the future demand of manganese ore will slow down, and the global supply will exceed demand. Based on the comprehensive evaluation of supply and demand trends in the past and future, it was concluded that the current market balance, import dependence and country concentration risks are the main driving factors for the supply risk of manganese ore in China, showing higher supply risk than that of the other factors; the resource and geostrategic risks are moderate, and may significantly reduce the supply risk if effective measures are implemented. As per the aforementioned analysis, to address the risk of supply interruption, this study provides some suggestions and measures, such as strengthening resource reserves and low-grade manganese ore utilization at home, actively exploring foreign markets, exploiting overseas resources, expanding import channels, extending the industrial chain, and adopting equity mergers and acquisitions abroad.</jats:p>"

Its successful application in the calibration of watershed environmental parameters has attracted researcher’s extensive attention. The dynamically dimensioned search algorithm is a kind of algorithm that converges to the global optimum under the best condition or the good local optimum in the worst case. In other words, the performance of DDS is easily affected by the optimization conditions. Therefore, this algorithm has also suffered from low robustness and limited scalability. In this work, an improved version of DDS called DDS-POBL is proposed. In the DDS-POBL, two effective methods are applied to improve the performance of the DDS algorithm. Piecewise opposition-based learning is introduced to guide DDS search in the right direction, and the golden section method is used to search for more promising areas. Numerical experiments are performed on a set of 23 classic test functions, and the results represent significant improvements in the optimization performance of DDS-POBL compared to DDS. Several experimental results using different parameter values demonstrate the high solution quality, strong robustness, and scalability of the proposed DDS-POBL algorithm. A comparative performance analysis between the DDS-POBL and other powerful algorithms has been carried out by statistical methods by using the significance of the results. The results show that DDS-POBL works better than PSO, CoDA, MHDA, NaFA, and CMA-ES and gives very competitive results when compared to INMDA and EEGWO. Moreover, the parameter calibration application of the Xinanjiang model shows the effectiveness of the DDS-POBL in the real optimization problem.</jats:p>",

Inventory expediting is allowed to alleviate demand–supply mismatches. Priority demands are commonly used in practice to provide differentiated services for customers, and inventory expediting is an effective strategy to improve the service levels of high‐priority demands. However, it is challenging to coordinate the inventory ordering, expediting and allocation decisions in supply chains. We partially characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We also derive various monotone properties of the optimal policy with limited sensitivities. Moreover, we show that a state‐dependent rationing level policy is optimal for inventory allocation and the optimal rationing levels are in fact independent of the backorder quantity of each demand class. We also show when some simple policies are indeed optimal. Numerically, we illustrate the optimal policy and investigate the performances of three proposed simple heuristics. Finally, we extend the results to more general systems, such as serial systems, systems with convex backordering costs, etc. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industry 4.0 has paved the way for a world where smart factories will automate and upgrade many processes through the use of some of the latest emerging technologies. One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag’s signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios.</jats:p>"

In contrast, our current understanding of lipid supply from uptake of exogenous lipids and its regulation by AR is limited, and exogenous lipids may play a much more significant role in prostate cancer and disease progression than previously thought. By applying advanced automated quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we provide the most comprehensive functional analysis of lipid uptake in cancer cells to date and demonstrate that treatment of AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines with androgens results in significantly increased cellular uptake of fatty acids, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein particles. Consistent with a direct, regulatory role of AR in this process, androgen-enhanced lipid uptake can be blocked by the AR-antagonist enzalutamide, but is independent of proliferation and cell-cycle progression. This work for the first time comprehensively delineates the lipid transporter landscape in prostate cancer cell lines and patient samples by analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics data, including the plasma membrane proteome. We show that androgen exposure or deprivation regulates the expression of multiple lipid transporters in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and that mRNA and protein expression of lipid transporters is enhanced in bone metastatic disease when compared with primary, localized prostate cancer. Our findings provide a strong rationale to investigate lipid uptake as a therapeutic cotarget in the fight against advanced prostate cancer in combination with inhibitors of lipogenesis to delay disease progression and metastasis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Implications:</jats:title><jats:p>Prostate cancer exhibits metabolic plasticity in acquiring lipids from uptake and lipogenesis at different disease stages, indicating potential therapeutic benefit by cotargeting lipid supply.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

To further study the production mechanism and characteristics of SMPs-DON in drinking water biological aerated filtration (BAF), Illumina MiSeq sequencing is applied to characterize the microbial community. In addition, an excitation–emission matrix combined with the parallel factor model (EEM-PARAFAC) and gel filtration chromatography (GFC) are used to analyze the component and molecular weight (MW) distribution of the SMPs-DON. Results showed that the production of SMPs-DON in drinking water BAF can be explained using Illumina MiSeq sequencing from the perspective of the microbial community. Also, according to the EEM-PARAFAC analysis, the fluorescence intensity scores of fulvic-like and humic-like substances were almost unchanged, whereas the scores of protein-like substances first increased and then decreased, which was consistent with the variation in the DON concentration. SMPs produced initially primarily consisted of macromolecules with MW &amp;gt;20 kDa, and then they were degraded and small molecular SMPs with MW &amp;lt;5 kDa accumulated. This study provides theoretical guidance and technical support for ensuring drinking water safety and reducing secondary pollution risks from drinking water biological treatment.</jats:p>",

However, conventional groundwater detection methods are inefficient and costly. To solve the difficulties of using water in water-deficient areas, the method of rapid groundwater detection based on multidimensional space was presented. First, using satellite remote sensing (RS) technology, factors related to the occurrence of groundwater, such as lithology, structure, and landforms, were obtained. Then, through quantitative inversion of aeromagnetic data, the lithology and structure were improved. Using geographic information system (GIS) as an information analysis platform, the water storage conditions of various lithologies, structures, and landforms were comprehensively studied; and a water-rich target area was delineated. Based on the above-mentioned achievements, the ground geophysical prospecting work was carried out, the optimum well-position determined, and the target area accuracy verified by drilling data. The method integrates many technical means, such as satellite RS, airborne RS, ground physical exploration, and exploration drilling to detect groundwater, incorporating the advantages of each method. Through the preliminary application in the city of Beipiao, China, the well completion rate is 72.73%. High-quality groundwater resources were exploited in this area, proving it to be an effective method for accurately detecting groundwater.</jats:p>",

It has been shown that feeding moderate amounts of concentrate during fulltime grazing did not prevent energy shortage and lipomobilization, alterations in energy metabolism, decreasing milk production and loss in body weight. As diet change and energy balance are closely related to immune reactivity, in this trial the effect of transition to pasture on specific immune parameters of cows was documented. Over a 12-week trial 43 dairy cows were observed during transition from confinement to pasture (PG; n = 22) and compared to cows fed TMR indoor (CG; n = 21). The CG stayed on a TMR based ration (35% corn silage, 35% grass silage, 30% concentrate; dry matter (DM) basis), whereas the PG slowly switched to a pasture -based ration (week 0 and 1 = TMR, week 2 = TMR and 3 h pasture·day−1, week 3 and 4 = TMR and 12 h pasture·day−1, and week 5 to 11 = pasture combined with 4.5 kg DM concentrate·cow−1·day−1). Inflammatory markers like blood haptoglobin or tryptophan to kynurenine ratio did not indicate acute phase reaction. Proportions of CD4+ (T-helper cells) and CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T-cells) remained uninfluenced as well. White blood cell concentration and its subpopulation of granulocytes increased over time in the PG. Stimulation ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to mount an oxidative burst significantly increased during the trial, too. The endogenous antioxidant state as characterized by glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in blood of the PG did not change, whereas the vitamin E concentration reached the highest level at the end of the trial. The 25-CHO metabolites of vitamin D increased as soon as the PG had pasture access, whereas the other metabolite 25-ERG decreased. The results of this study indicate that transition to pasture affects immune related parameters. However, the consequences of the observed effects on health status of the pasture group need to be clarified in further studies with a defined concurrent immune challenge.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Robustness of a demonstration potable reuse facility was evaluated through a series of system-wide chemical challenge tests spiking neutral low-molecular weight compounds (acetone, formaldehyde, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and 1,4-dioxane) which are known to be challenging for removal through advanced treatment. Two advanced treatment train arrangements were compared: O3/BAC-MF/UF-RO-AOP and RO-AOP. Ozone and biological activated carbon (O3/BAC) offered significant attenuation of the smallest and most biologically degradable compounds tested: acetone and formaldehyde. These two compounds had limited reduction across the reverse osmosis (RO) membrane barrier and the different advanced oxidation process (AOP) setups used. 1,4-Dioxane was partially reduced across the oxidation barriers: 62% across ozonation and up to 95% across AOP depending on oxidant used and oxidant dose. Both a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) based AOP (UV/H2O2) and a sodium hypochlorite (as HOCl) based AOP (UV/HOCl) demonstrated sufficient oxidation, providing no less than 0.5-log (68%) 1,4-dioxane attenuation required by regulators in the USA. NDMA was reduced across both UV/H2O2 and UV/HOCl from 157 to 267 ng/L to below the 10 ng/L established notification level for drinking water in California. Overall, addition of O3/BAC enhanced cumulative removal of all the spiked trace organic chemicals, providing greater protection against the spiked contaminants than RO-AOP alone. In addition, online total organic carbon (TOC) monitoring successfully captured the presence of the spiked chemicals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Groundwater inundation (GWI) is a particularly challenging consequence of sea-level rise (SLR), as it progressively inundates infrastructure located above and below the ground surface. Paths of flooding by GWI differ from other types of SLR flooding (i.e., wave overwash, storm-drain backflow) such that it is more difficult to mitigate, and thus requires a separate set of highly innovative adaptation strategies to manage. To spur consideration of GWI in planning, data-intensive numerical modeling methods have been developed that produce locally specific visualizations of GWI, though the accessibility of such methods is limited by extensive data requirements. Conversely, the hydrostatic (or ‘bathtub’) modeling approach is widely used in adaptation planning owing to easily accessed visualizations (i.e., NOAA SLR Viewer), yet its capacity to simulate GWI has never been tested. Given the separate actions necessary to mitigate GWI relative to marine overwash, this is a significant gap. Here we compare a simple hydrostatic modeling method with a more deterministic, dynamic and robust 3D numerical modeling approach to explore the effectiveness of the hydrostatic method in simulating equilibrium aquifer effects of multi-decadal sea-level rise, and in turn GWI for Honolulu, Hawai’i. We find hydrostatic modeling in the Honolulu area and likely other settings may yield similar results to numerical modeling when referencing the local mean higher-high water tide datum (generally typical of flood studies). These findings have the potential to spur preliminary understanding of GWI impacts in municipalities that lack the required data to conduct rigorous groundwater-modeling investigations. We note that the methods explored here for Honolulu do not simulate dynamic coastal processes (i.e., coastal erosion, sediment accretion or changes in land cover) and thus are most appropriately applied to regions that host heavily armored shorelines behind which GWI can develop.</jats:p>",
