Existing models of product differentiated markets are adapted to allow for a number of different scenarios that reflect some of the characteristics of products that may embody soft innovation. These include issues such as whether production and innovation coincide, whether the product is durable or not, whether the service flow requires hardware and software, and whether there are standards and compatibility issues. Of particular interest (because it fits the examples of books, recorded music and video games) is the consideration of models where product variants are usually only bought once and continuation of the market requires continual launching of new product variants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the incentives behind the adoption of radio-frequency identification (RFID) in a supply chain. One prominent feature of RFID technology is that once RFID tags are attached on the items at an upstream site, the same tags can be reused at its downstream sites at lower or zero variable cost. This creates an interesting, one-sided “free-rider” problem, where the downstream would wait to free-ride on the upstream's first move, but not vice versa. Using a stylized game-theoretic model, we characterize the equilibrium strategies of the two firms. Compared to the first-best solution, firms in equilibrium tend to adopt too late. We then study the dual benefits of technology coordination between the two firms and find that it would not only save redundant costs of putting tags, but also speed up the downstream's RFID adoption. We also show that the equal-cost-split arrangement shifts the benefit of free-riding to the upstream, thereby mitigating the negative impacts in many cases. But it may distort the market when it operates in the optimal manner. The general message of the model is that technology coordination and cost-split each contribute to the mitigation of the free-rider problem in RFID adoption. </jats:p>",

Ugyanakkor igen kevés elemzés, de kevés leíró jellegű munka is született a két jelenséget és menedzsmentproblémát összekapcsoló területről, azaz a szolgáltatások ellátási láncáról, ezen ellátási láncok kezelésének speciális problémáiról. A szerzők cikkükben a szolgáltatások ellátási láncának és menedzsmentjének jellegzetességeit, a klasszikus terméket előállító ellátási láncokhoz viszonyított sajátosságait foglalják össze a nemzetközi szakirodalom alapján. Ennek során bemutatják, hogy az ún. tiszta szolgáltatások széles körben ismert jellemzői hatással vannak a szolgáltatások előállítását és értékesítését végző ellátási láncok működésére is. Ezek a hatások és specialitások megjelennek az ellátásilánc-menedzsment irodalmában kiemelten tárgyalt mindhárom problémakörben, rányomják tehát bélyegüket mind az ellátási lánc felépítésére, mind az ellátási láncban együttműködő partnerek kapcsolatának kezelésére és végül, de nem utolsósorban az ellátásilánc-menedzsment folyamatok kezelésére. _________ In the last decades scholars have paid a lot of attention to both service operation and supply chain management. There is still limited research on the overlapping field of theses two management areas, on service supply chain specialties. This article gives a structured overview on the latest research results on this topic. Doing so the paper would like to draw attention of the Hungarian researchers to this field and facilitate these empirical researches. As described in the paper traditional service specialties (intangibility, perishability, inseparability, heterogeneity and the importance of human capital) create special management problems concerning (i) the structure of these supply chains, (ii) their relationship management and (iii) the management of supply chain processes.</jats:p>",

This class of lead time processes includes as special cases all lead time models from existing literature (such as Kaplan's lead times with no order crossing or independent and identically distributed lead times with order crossing, among others) but is a substantially broader class. For a system with an exogenous lead time process, we provide a method to determine base-stock levels and to compute the cost of a given base-stock policy. The method relies on relating the cost of a base-stock policy to the cost of a threshold policy in a related single-unit, single-customer problem. This single-unit method is exact for single-stage systems and for multistage systems under certain conditions. If the conditions are not satisfied, the method obtains near-optimal base-stock levels and accurate approximations of cost for multistage systems. </jats:p>",

Probabilistic performance of water supply systems is reflected by the system serviceability index (SSI), damage consequence index (DCI), and upgrade benefit index (UBI). The process is illustrated using a hypothetical water supply system subjected to a seismic damage scenario, where direct Monte Carlo simulation is used for estimating the performance indices. It is shown that probabilistic characteristics of SSI can be attributed to system characteristics (e.g., demand distribution pattern) of the water supply system. UBI is shown to be the primary index in seismic mitigation, and critical links are pipes with relatively large UBI values. It is recognized that the values of UBI corresponding to different upgrade scenarios of pipes can be estimated using conditional samples from a single run of direct Monte Carlo simulation instead of repeated runs. The concept of efficient frontier is employed to identify the system critical links. It is found that, a group of links that have the largest UBI individually do not necessarily have the largest group UBI, nor are they necessarily the group of critical links. </jats:p>",

Supply chain members can share demand information, which reduces information distortion and thus decreases their inventory holding and shortage costs. We expand the results from L&amp;P by considering dynamic (farsighted) stability concepts. We use two different allocation rules and show that under some reasonable assumptions there should always be some information sharing in this supply chain. We also identify conditions under which the retailer in a stable outcome shares his demand information with the distributor, with the manufacturer, or with both remaining supply chain members. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Inspection-driven congestion is costly, and CBP provides incentives to firms to improve security upstream in the supply chain, thereby reducing the inspection burden at U.S. ports. We perform an economic analysis of this incentive program, called Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT), modeling in a game-theoretic framework the strategic interaction between CBP, trading firms, and terrorists. Our equilibrium results highlight the possibility that a properly run program can efficiently shift some of CBP's security burden to private industry. These results also suggest that CBP may have the opportunity to use strategic delay as an incentive for firms to join. Analysis of comparative statics shows that, with increasing capacity, membership in C-TPAT systematically declines. </jats:p>",

Yet as this article illustrates some call centre customer services do not easily transfer to different local, social and cultural contexts. Call centre operations are embedded in local social relations and taken for granted skills that are difficult to reproduce outside of the locality which has produced them. Nevertheless the spatial dispersal of work can be as much a political process as it is an economic one. This article, which follows the journey of 1000 call centre jobs from the UK to India, illuminates how subcontracting service work “offshore” can facilitate a transformation of the employment relation and an escape from a difficult to discipline labour force.</jats:p>",

This is one of the strategies by which the animals cope with variations in environmental conditions such as ambient oxygen tension. The enrichment of high-affinity Hb molecules in the haemolymph of hypoxia-exposed animals is thought to reduce Hb synthesis costs due to an enhanced transport efficiency of these molecules in comparison to the low-affinity Hb molecules. How great this economic advantage is, and under which conditions this benefit disappears, is still not fully understood. Here we implemented a rigorously simplified model of the daphnid body and described the transport of oxygen from the environment via the haemolymph to the tissues in terms of the convection–diffusion–reaction equation. The model was validated by comparing various model predictions with experimental data. A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of parameter uncertainties on the model predictions. Cost–benefit analysis revealed in which way at the system's level the increase in Hb oxygen affinity improves the oxygen loading at the respiratory surfaces and impairs the release of oxygen to the tissues. The benefit arising from the improved oxygen loading exceeds the disadvantage of impaired unloading only under conditions where the ambient oxygen tension is critically low and the Hb concentration is high. The low-affinity Hb, on the other hand, provides an advantage given that the Hb concentration is low and the ambient oxygen tension is well above the critical level. Computer-aided modelling and simulation therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights into the driving forces that could have shaped the evolution of globin genes in daphnids.</jats:p>",

Today, the foreign born make up one quarter of the workforce in the life and physical sciences, one fifth of information technology, and one sixth of the engineering workforce. Yet, many observers are concerned that the United States restricts the number of skilled immigrants, although it admits roughly 70,000 skilled primary workers yearly on permanent visas and roughly 300,000 on so-called temporary visas. Recent legislation addresses the concerns over numbers, however poorly framed those concerns are in reality, but it is arguable that the concern over numbers is misleading and there should be more focus on improving the admission process to efficiently admit the best foreign workers. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research regarding learning capabilities between business partners in a cross‐border setting.

Through the development of a conceptual framework that examines how global environmental and inter‐organizational conditions influence learning capabilities, the study investigates how relationship learning influences relationship value for both supplying and buying firms. Using a survey of 126 cross‐border dyads in the industrial chemical, packaging, consumer durable, and apparel industries, the authors show how relationship learning is valued by both buyers and suppliers, and how it is critical when viewing the “supplier as a customer.” The results indicate the strategic nature of relationship learning in maintaining cross‐border business‐to‐business relationships. Simultaneously, the findings provide evidence that cultural distance is not a significant influence on the firm's propensity to share knowledge with its global partners. It helps advance our understanding of the significance of cultural‐pollination in the era of globalization.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The mean regression results indicate that the tax reform led to a statistically significant increase in hours of work for men but had no effect on work hours for women. However, we find a positive response to tax changes in both tails of the female work hour distribution. We also find that the reform increased the probability of finding a job among both men and women. Despite significant variation in individual responses, the aggregate labour supply elasticities are trivial. This suggests that reform‐induced changes in labour supply are an unlikely explanation for the amplified personal income tax revenues that followed the reform.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the impact of hurricane Ivan on Grenada's water supply. While it was found that a lack of water supply immediately following the hurricane resulted in hardship to citizens, the impact was reduced in areas where rainwater harvesting was established. The long term impacts of the hurricane on water supply may be reduced due to the rapid recovery of damaged vegetation in the water-producing watersheds, facilitated by a decline in agricultural activities in these watersheds. The absence of a national land use policy and lack of consideration for women in the management of water resources can impact negatively in the future on Grenada's ability to overcome a similar disaster. It is recommended that the National Water Authority includes the cost of insurance for its infrastructure in developing water tariffs and mainstreams disaster management and planning in its operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we study the practice of forecast sharing and supply chain coordination with a game-theoretical model. We find that in a one-shot version of the game, forecasts are not shared truthfully by the customer. The supplier will rationally discount the forecast information in her capacity allocation. This results in Pareto suboptimality for both supply chain parties. However, we show that a more efficient, truth-sharing outcome can emerge as an equilibrium from a long-term relationship. In this equilibrium, forecast information is transmitted truthfully and trusted by the supplier, who in turn allocates the system-optimal capacity. This leaves both the customer and the supplier better-off, compared to the nontruthful-sharing equilibrium.</jats:p><jats:p>We identify a multiperiod review strategy profile that supports the truthful-sharing equilibrium. The key element of this strategy is that the supplier computes a scoring index of the customer's behavior that is updated over time and used to evaluate if the customer has sufficient incentive to share his private information truthfully in each transaction of the repeated game. Compared to trigger strategies, review strategies are more tolerant but require diligence and more monitoring effort.</jats:p>",

Fluxes of sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen chloride (and probably water) are substantial from this arc volcano. Additional sources of volatiles in addition to the erupting andesite are required to satisfy the mass balance defined by gas emissions and petrological constraints. Mafic magma is intruded at depths of &gt;10 km, supplying volatiles by quenching, crystallising and vesiculating at the andesite‐mafic magma interface. Sulphur, carbon dioxide and other volatiles supplied to the system migrate to the surface and their fluxes remain high while mafic recharge at depth is sustained. Decompression degassing of porphyritic andesite supplies chlorine and water to the gas plume. Chlorine partitions into vapour from the melt during periods of active extrusion, making the HCl/SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ratio of volcanic gases a reliable indicator of the onset of eruptive activity. Studies of this volatile budget highlight the role of deep degassing and vapour production at arc volcanoes, which are important mechanisms for driving the eruption due to its effects on magma buoyancy and the advection of heat through the system.</jats:p>",

While top–down effects would increase with resource availability to plants, bottom–up effects would be stronger under low predator abundance. These predictions, however, have rarely been tested at contrasting sites while keeping the dominant plant species unchanged. Furthermore, few studies have factorially manipulated both types of forces in forest communities. For two years, we evaluated the effects of fertiliser (NPK) addition and bird exclusion on tree growth, leaf traits, insect abundance, and folivory rates in a dry/warm and a wet/cold <jats:italic>Nothofagus pumilio</jats:italic> forest in Patagonia, Argentina. Overall, we found no interaction between nutrient supply and bird predation, although the strength of bottom–up and top–down forces differed markedly between forest sites. Treatment effects were generally weak in the wet forest, where tree growth rates and insect herbivory were low relative to the dry forest. In the dry forest, fertilisation increased sapling growth, insect abundance and folivory, whereas bird exclusion increased leaf damage and reduced tree growth. In the wet forest, fertilisation enhanced leaf nutrient contents and folivore abundance but not sapling growth, while bird exclusion had little impact on insects or trees. These results imply that factors other than nutrients and birds were important in controlling tree growth and folivore activity in the wet forest. While treatment effect sizes varied widely among feeding guilds, in general, nutrient effects on folivores were stronger than predator effects. We conclude that, within the time‐frame of this study, tree growth and herbivory were additively affected by soil nutrients and predator presence, as bird exclusion effects did not change with elevated folivore activity on fertilised trees. We also show that both top–down and bottom–up cascades were weaker in a forest site characterised by slow‐growing juvenile trees subjected to low folivore pressure.</jats:p>",

Transcriptome analysis provides valuable information as to how genes are regulated. Therefore, this work aimed at investigating transcriptional regulation of starch biosynthetic genes in leaves and tubers of potato plants under various conditions. More specifically we looked at gene expression diurnally in leaves and tubers, during tuber induction and in tubers growing at different velocities. To determine velocity of potato tuber growth a new method based on X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) was established.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Comparative transcriptome analysis between leaves and tubers revealed striking similarities with the same genes being differentially expressed in both tissues. In tubers, oscillation of granule bound starch synthase (GBSS) expression) was observed which could be linked to sucrose supply from source leaves. X-ray CT was used to determine time-dependent changes in tuber volume and the growth velocity was calculated. Although there is not a linear correlation between growth velocity and expression of starch biosynthetic genes, there are significant differences between growing and non-growing tubers. Co-expression analysis was used to identify transcription factors positively correlating with starch biosynthetic genes possibly regulating starch biosynthesis.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Most starch biosynthetic enzymes are encoded by gene families. Co-expression analysis revealed that the same members of these gene families are co-regulated in leaves and tubers. This suggests that regulation of transitory and storage starch biosynthesis in leaves and tubers, respectively, is surprisingly similar. X-ray CT can be used to monitor growth and development of belowground organs and allows to link tuber growth to changes in gene expression. Comparative transcriptome analysis provides a useful tool to identify transcription factors possibly involved in the regulation of starch biosynthesis.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Low phosphorus supply markedly limits leaf growth and genotypes able to maintain adequate leaf area at low P could adapt better to limited-P conditions. This work aimed to investigate the relationship between leaf area production of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) genotypes during early pod filling and plant adaptation to limited P supply. Twenty-four genotypes, comprised of the four growth habits in the species and two weedy accessions, were grown at two P level applied to the soil (20 and 80 mg kg-1) in 4 kg pots and harvested at two growth stages (pod setting and early pod filling). High P level markedly increased the leaf number and leaf size (leaf area per leaf), slightly increased specific leaf area but did not affect the net assimilation rate. At low P level most genotypic variation for plant dry mass was associated with leaf size, whereas at high P level this variation was associated primarily with the number of leaves and secondarily with leaf size, specific leaf area playing a minor role at both P level. Determinate bush genotypes presented a smaller leaf area, fewer but larger leaves with higher specific leaf area and lower net assimilation rate. Climbing genotypes showed numerous leaves, smaller and thicker leaves with a higher net assimilation rate. Indeterminate bush and indeterminate prostrate genotypes presented the highest leaf area, achieved through intermediate leaf number, leaf size and specific leaf area. The latter groups were better adapted to limited P. It is concluded that improved growth at low P during early pod filling was associated with common bean genotypes able to maintain leaf expansion through leaves with greater individual leaf area.</jats:p>",

The rise in drug-resistant TB has compounded the situation. We analyzed 208 clinical isolates of\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            from the National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital by spoligotyping, IS\n            <jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>\n            restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and 24-locus-based mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing to assess the diversity and transmission dynamics of the tubercle bacilli in the Republic of Korea. The majority of the isolates (97.1%) belonged to the Beijing genotype. Cluster analysis by MIRU-VNTR yielded a low clustering rate of 22.3%, with most of the clusters comprising isolates with diverse drug resistance patterns. The discriminatory capacity of the typing methods was high for RFLP and MIRU-VNTR (allelic diversity [\n            <jats:italic>h</jats:italic>\n            ] = 0.99) but low for spoligotyping (\n            <jats:italic>h</jats:italic>\n            = 0.31). Although analysis of 19 MIRU-VNTR loci was needed to achieve maximum discrimination, an informative set of 8 loci (960, 1955, 2163b, 2165, 2996, 3192, 4052, and 4348) (\n            <jats:italic>h</jats:italic>\n            = 0.98) that was able to differentiate most of the closely related strains was identified. These findings suggest that 24-locus-based MIRU-VNTR typing is a likely suitable alternative to RFLP to differentiate clinical isolates in this setting, which is dominated by\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            Beijing strains. Within the study limits, our results also suggest that the problem of drug-resistant TB in the Republic of Korea may be largely due to acquired resistance as opposed to transmission.\n          </jats:p>",
