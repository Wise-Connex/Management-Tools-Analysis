      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1973 the economist E.F Schumacher wrote ‘Small is Beautiful’. In this he created the vision of a concept known as ‘intermediate technology’. Directly from this grew the popular ‘appropriate technology’ movement. An appropriate technology, in the ideal sense, is designed with special consideration of the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economical aspects of the community it is intended for. The term ‘appropriate technology’ is continually used when referring to water supply and treatment technologies in international development. The widespread provision of hand-pumps in Africa by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) fully characterises the approach and remains the most prominent display of technologies, transferred on a charitable basis, between the developed and developing countries. However, after years of NGOs working with hand-pumps in Africa the first signs are showing that there are widespread problems with the current approach. In many cases the nature of ‘appropriateness’ is determined from the perspective of an external technical expert and not by the communities themselves. The lack of appropriateness is leading to severely unsustainable projects. This paper explores the linkage that has not been clearly mapped in technology transfer, i.e., the use of scientific and technical education. The focus of the transfer is on developing the knowledge and skills necessary to evaluate ‘appropriateness’ from the perspective of the end user. It explores the concept of ‘Intermediate Education’ – a method of using experimental learning to address a systemic weakness in safe water provision in development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Against the background of price controls for drinking water supply utilities in Germany, the comparability of utilities with regard to their specific structural conditions comes into focus. Relevant structural conditions were identified for the two main technical processes, namely water production (WP) and treatment, storage and distribution (TSD). A defined clustering process for comparable utilities has been developed. At the end of the process, groups of comparable utilities are obtained including information to what extent and in which structural condition these utilities are similar. These sets of relevant structural conditions and the clustering process were verified in a data assessment study with 45 German utilities. Applying the clustering process to the sample, WP and TSD peer groups of a certain utility are obtained, where structural similarities are above a certain threshold value. Performance and cost indicators of comparable utilities have been evaluated, providing interesting data on general performance levels and spread among individual utilities. The survey underlines the high standard of German water supply in terms of reliability, quality, customer service, sustainability and economic efficiency.</jats:p>",

A measurement model of the SCM construct was developed. Operational performance was conceptualized using competitive priorities literature with four dimensions: cost, quality, flexibility and delivery. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze a sample of 103 companies, in Brazil. Results showed positive effects of SCM on all performance dimensions, offering further support for the cumulative capabilities perspective. We also found evidence of an operational competence construct mediating the effect of SCM on performance, supported conceptually by the resource-based and relational views of strategy.</jats:p>"

Due to its dimension and geographic range, this chain produces a significant carbon footprint. The present study seeks to further explore the cash logistics operation using the sustainable supply chain approach, thus analyzing the chain framework and its management and suggesting improvements to be implemented as a means of reducing the equivalent carbon emission of this chain. As a final conclusion, it is observed that the use of environmental measures to monitor and assess the global impact of the cash supply chain management framework is still very limited.</jats:p>"

While the multilateral development banks have been investing for many years with the expectation of a development impact, it is only recently that private investors have begun to be attracted to the concept of seeking to earn both a financial return, as well as creating a positive social and environmental impact. The purpose of this study is to identify opportunities for impact investments in the Caribbean with a focus on five specific countries: Barbados, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. These five highly disparate nations exemplify the opportunities and challenges faced by the region and investors within it.</jats:p>"

Performance indicators (PIs) were initially developed as an aid to the control of public service delegation by local authorities. After a long process, a group of PIs was integrated into mandatory annual reports on service quality and price, in order to better inform utility users and reinforce the regulation of the sector by local public authorities. As water utilities in France are highly fragmented, this development in isolation may have only limited effects. The additional comparison of performance is likely to improve service quality and efficiency and keep prices affordable. The French national agency for water (ONEMA) – created in 2006 – is in charge of building the monitoring system of water utility performance. This paper presents the objectives of this monitoring system, the methodology used to create it and its shortcomings. Due to the large number of utilities, the data collection process faces difficulties. Some conclusions are drawn on how to obtain stronger involvement of local authorities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objectives: Supply chain design (SCD) is a  concept that forms an integral part of supply chain management (SCM). Effective  SCD enhances supply chain integration (SCI) which in turn contributes towards  improved supply chain performance. Therefore, organisations' supply chain  designs need to be analysed. This article proposes a conceptual framework to  analyse organisations' supply chain designs. The objective of this article is to  determine whether the proposed conceptual framework is a workable instrument  with which organisations can analyse their supply chain designs. Problem  investigated: Effective SCD is a complex and demanding undertaking and has  become a major challenge for organisations. Moreover, the literature suggests  that organisations allow their supply chains to evolve rather than consciously  designing them. Although the importance of SCD is emphasised, very little  attention is given to what it entails exactly. The problem statement of this  article is thus: What are the elements of SCD and how can these elements be  included in a conceptual framework to analyse organisations' supply chain  designs? Methodology: The methodology used in this article comprised  two phases. Firstly, a literature review was conducted to identify SCD elements.  The elements were used to develop a conceptual framework with which  organisations can analyse their supply chain designs. Secondly, the conceptual  framework was tested in 13 organisations to determine whether it is a workable  instrument to analyse supply chain designs. The respondents were selected by  means of non-probability sampling. Purposive, judgmental and convenience  sampling methods were used to select the sample. Findings and  implications: As mentioned, the conceptual framework was tested empirically  within 13 organisations. The findings show that the conceptual framework is in  fact a workable instrument to analyse supply chain designs. Value of the  research: The research will make a contribution in the field of supply chain  management and more specifically in the field of supply chain design. As  mentioned, very little attention is given to the specifics of SCD. This article  provides a more structured approach to analysing supply chain designs. Conclusion: SCD forms an important part of SCM and may play a role in  improving performance. The conceptual framework proposed in this article will  assist organisations with the analysis of their supply chain designs, which in  turn may highlight potential areas in their supply chains where there may be  room for improving their SCD practices.</jats:p>"

Although most pharmaceuticals are tested for human safety and efficacy prior to marketing and distribution, the potential for adverse effects in nontarget populations exposed to minute environmental medication doses has not been established. Several recent studies have demonstrated adverse effects from longstanding, low-dose exposures in both aquatic and terrestrial wildlife, although human toxicity related to trace levels of pharmaceuticals in the water supply remains unknown. This article provides a brief overview of the routes through which pharmaceuticals are introduced into the environment; a description of the effects of longstanding, low-dose exposures in aquatic and terrestrial animals, including human health effects; an update on the current regulations and solutions regarding pharmaceutical disposal practices; and a discussion of implications for reducing pharmaceuticals in the environment for occupational health nurses and other allied health professionals. </jats:p>",

The earthquake followed by tsunami and several accidents caused a nuclear power plant in Fukushima Prefecture to release radioactive materials into the environment. Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan (MHLW) established a new review meeting to investigate subjects relating to radioactive materials in tap water such as the mechanism of influence of radioactive materials on tap water, measures to reduce the level of radioactive materials contaminated in tap water and medium- and long-term measures based on the results of monitoring. The review meeting published its interim report on 21 June 2011. The report analyzed future prospects as follows: (i) unless a large amount of radioactive materials is released again from the nuclear power plant, tap water has low probability to require measures such as intake restriction and (ii) groundwater that is not affected by surface water has low probability to be affected from radioactive materials. Based on the report, MHLW announced measures to reduce radioactive materials in tap water and also revised the future monitoring policy for more rational and effective implementation. Whilst radioactivity in tap water has not been detected or has been minute if detected since April 2011, the monitoring of tap water and announcement of results will be further continued in Japan.</jats:p>",

Manganate (Mn(VI)), like ferrate (Fe(VI)), can act as both an oxidant and a coagulant/adsorbent arising from the formation of insoluble manganese dioxide (Mn(IV)) from the chemical reduction of MnO42−. In this paper the basic properties of K2MnO4 are described, including the standard electrode potential which exceeds several oxidizing agents commonly used as water treatment chemicals. The methods of preparing K2MnO4 are outlined, and the main reaction products, which are potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and manganese dioxide (MnO2), and their use in water treatment are summarized. Some preliminary results of water treatment tests in China and at Imperial College London are presented, and alternative ways of applying K2MnO4 in water treatment are proposed. Finally, the paper provides a preliminary evaluation of the economic feasibility of using K2MnO4 in comparison with alternative chemicals, such as KMnO4. Overall, it is believed that K2MnO4 may be a useful water treatment chemical in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The point of departure in this  article is that the principles that underpin entrepreneurial networking also  apply to the establishment of supply chain relationships. The theoretical base  for the need for entrepreneurial networking can be found in Kirzner's theory of  entrepreneurship that argued that entrepreneurs identify and act upon profit  opportunities that exist in disequilibrium in order to equilibrate the economy. Problem investigated: This article explores the possibility of  implementing entrepreneurial networking in supply chain relationships in the  automotive component industry. Methodology: Kirzner's theory is used  as a theoretical base to support the case for the development of supply chain  relationships. The literature with regard to supply chain management and its  relevance to entrepreneurial networking is first dealt with. The case for  implementing entrepreneurial networking to strengthen supply chain relationships  in the automotive component industry in South Africa is then presented.Findings: The findings of this article indicate that the principles  underlying entrepreneurial networking could be applied to supply chain  relationships in the automotive component industry in South Africa. The argument  is mainly based on the sustainability and profitability potential of  entrepreneurial networking and the similarities that exist between  entrepreneurial networking and supply chain management relationships. Originality: This research is original as it explores the  possibility that the principles that underpin entrepreneurial networking also  apply to the establishment of supply chain relationships in the automotive  component industry. Furthermore, there is a need for published research in South  Africa on supply chain management, particularly relationships within the supply  chain.Conclusion: Based on the sustainability and profitability  potential of entrepreneurial networking and the similarities that exist between  entrepreneurial networking and supply chain relationships, the principles  underlying entrepreneurial networking can be applied to supply chain  relationships in the automotive component industry in South Africa. The unique  challenges facing this industry in the current global market further strengthen  the case for the implementation of entrepreneurial networking.</jats:p>"

The need for this study arises from the fact that where as SMEs form the back borne of Ugandaâ€™s economy, they have encountered poor supply chain performance. Previous researchers also indicate that studies in SMEs and their supply chains are limited and that more research is needed regarding the link between marketing and supply chain management. The proposed conceptual framework presupposes a positive relationship between market orientation and supply chain performance with organizational learning, supply chain management strategy, trust and commitment playing mediating roles.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>I survey the male and female labor supply literatures, focusing on implications for effects of wages and taxes. For males, I describe and contrast results from three basic types of model: static models (especially those that account for nonlinear taxes), life-cycle models with savings, and life-cycle models with both savings and human capital. For women, more important distinctions are whether models include fixed costs of work, and whether they treat demographics like fertility and marriage (and human capital) as exogenous or endogenous. The literature is characterized by considerable controversy over the responsiveness of labor supply to changes in wages and taxes. At least for males, it is fair to say that most economists believe labor supply elasticities are small. But a sizable minority of studies that I examine obtain large values. Hence, there is no clear consensus on this point. In fact, a simple average of Hicks elasticities across all the studies I examine is 0.31. Several simulation studies have shown that such a value is large enough to generate large efficiency costs of income taxation. For males, I conclude that two factors drive many of the differences in results across studies. One factor is use of direct versus ratio wage measures, with studies that use the former tending to find larger elasticities. Another factor is the failure of most studies to account for human capital returns to work experience. I argue that this may lead to downward bias in elasticity estimates. In a model that includes human capital, I show how even modest elasticities—as conventionally measured—can be consistent with large efficiency costs of taxation. For women, in contrast, it is fair to say that most studies find large labor supply elasticities, especially on the participation margin. In particular, I find that estimates of “long-run” labor supply elasticities—by which I mean estimates that allow for dynamic effects of wages on fertility, marriage, education and work experience—are generally quite large.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The purpose of the article is to  report on research that was completed to explore the concept of the bullwhip  effect in supply chains and to illustrate empirically the presence of the  bullwhip effect in automotive supply chains in South Africa. Problem  Investigated: This article investigates the presence of the bullwhip effect  - which was identified through an empirical study - and its causes and  implications for supply chain management in the South African automotive  component industry. Methodology: A literature study was conducted on  the causes and implications of the bullwhip effect phenomenon. This was followed  by an empirical study in the form of a survey among South African automotive  component manufacturers. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to  determine the significant supply chain problems relating to the bullwhip effect  in automotive supply chains. Findings and Implications: The results  indicate that automotive component manufacturers are dependent on  demand-forecasting information from their customers. They experience long lead  times, fluctuating orders, cancellation of orders, excess and slow moving  inventory and a lack of integration with suppliers and customers. There are also  signs of relationship problems and a possible silo mentality. The mentioned  results indicate the presence of the bullwhip effect in South African automotive  supply chains. Since the bullwhip effect can have a major impact on  organisations' costs, knowing where to invest effort and resources should be a  high priority for supply chain managers. Value of the Research: Since  the field of supply chain management is extremely dynamic, this article  contributes to the body of knowledge and provides new insight into the bullwhip  effect phenomenon. The results included in this article could assist parties in  automotive supply chains to focus their attention on problems that might be  within their control and if solved could lead to improved competitiveness.  Furthermore, there is little empirical research on this topic in the South  African automotive component industry. Conclusion: It is possible  that the bullwhip effect is responsible for inefficiencies in automotive supply  chains. Knowledge of the indicators of the bullwhip effect can enable supply  chain managers to identify it at an early stage and thus be proactive in  preventing its costly influence on the efficiency of the supply chain. The  bullwhip effect can be experienced by any industry. This is possibly the case in  the automotive component industry in South Africa.</jats:p>"

Gaza is bordered by the Mediterranean sea in the west, by Israel to the north and east and by Egypt in the south. Water and electricity consumption in the Gaza Strip is expected to increase in the future due to the increasing population. In this paper, a solution for Sinai and the Gaza Strip is suggested involving the building of a joint power and desalination plant, located in Egypt close to the border with Gaza. The suggested joint project would increase drinking water supply by 500,000 m3/d and the power supply by 500 MW, of which two thirds is suggested to be used in Gaza and one third in Sinai. The present lack of electricity and water in Gaza could be erased by such a project. But Egypt will probably gain more: more water and electricity for the future development of Sinai and Gaza; a significant value will be added to the sale of Egyptian natural gas; more employment opportunities for Sinai people; the domestic market for operation and maintenance of desalination plants can be boosted by the suggested project; Egypt may naturally and peacefully increase its cooperation with and presence in Gaza, which should lead to increased security. This type of project could also get international support and can be a role-model for cooperation and trust-building between neighbours.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Decentralised water systems are considered to be effective, beneficial and are useful in a number of urban and peri-urban settings, and have been implemented to varying degrees across much of Australia. The use of decentralised water systems has introduced a change in the style of water service delivery and often there are new actors responsible and involved in the maintenance and operation of these systems. This raises questions about how to best implement and govern the use of decentralised water systems. To understand the issues and problem mitigation approaches required for decentralised systems, collection of data on the effectiveness, difficulties, functional aspects and ongoing problems in providing water services is required. Understanding the issues involved is not necessarily straightforward, as performance can be viewed from many different perspectives and may be difficult to measure. One key perspective to consider is that of householders, in their role as end-users of decentralised water systems. This paper suggests that dedicated household surveys can provide important information on the performance of decentralised water systems based on personal understanding and experience of these systems. This is stated on the basis of householder survey trials which indeed seem to provide useful information, both in terms of feedback from the individual and in generating a coherent data set from which to statistically model the adequacy of various implementation styles and governance structures. An exploration of data sets from survey trials have contributed to collective learning, necessary in firmly establishing decentralised systems as viable options for the provision of urban water services now and into the future.</jats:p>",

Analysis of organic micropollutants as tracer compounds is costly and time-consuming, and results may be biased by processes such as sorption, degradation or even by other input pathways such as land use activities. In this study, the use of gadolinium (Gd) as an alternative conservative tracer to indicate the amount of bank filtrate in raw water from drinking water wells close to rivers was investigated. In two case studies in Germany and Luxembourg, river water and water from drinking water wells at several distances from the rivers was sampled and analysed for anthropogenic Gd as well as for some of the organic trace pollutants conventionally used as tracer compounds. The amount of bank filtrate as calculated from Gd was compared with the estimates derived by conventional tracers and by hydrological flux modelling. The results indicated that the measurement of Gd may provide a promising alternative to monitor infiltration of river water in ground water used for production of drinking water.</jats:p>",

The ecological aspect of the use of the renewable energy sources, together with the technology development and increasingly lower costs of production the photovoltaic cells, cause the increase of their application. The solar power plants are built in several places in the world, not necessarily in the areas of high light intensity. Nowadays, such developments mostly depend on the wealth of a particular country. The largest photovoltaic power stations have power of a several dozen of MW. The major disadvantage of the photovoltaic cells is that the energy production is possible only during the day. This causes a necessity of energy accumulation in large photovoltaic systems. One possibility of storing large amounts of energy gives a hydrogen fuel, generated in the electrolysers powered directly from photovoltaic cells. Hydrogen, stored in pressure tanks or in tanks with synthetic porous materials, can be again used to produce electricity in fuel cells. This paper introduces selected issues and test results associated with the use of photovoltaic cells to power the hydrogen generators. The possible connections of photovoltaic modules integrated with electrolysers were analyzed. In this article the results of the electricity daily production by polycrystalline photovoltaic cells, collected in the course of the entire year were also presented.</jats:p>",

Many sources of water that are available are contaminated with bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli and other coliform bacteria. In order to provide a means of obtaining safe drinking water in developing countries, various methods of treating water at the household level have been developed and implemented throughout the world. One of the more promising treatment mechanisms is the ceramic pot filter, which is typically applied with colloidal silver because of it supposed disinfection purposes. During this study, the bacteria removal effectiveness of 30 filters without colloidal silver was determined by adding water contaminated with Escherichia coli to the filters, and then measuring bacteria concentrations in the filter effluent. The average log reduction values of E. coli and total coliforms determined in this study are 2.1 and 2.3, respectively, and are comparable to other studies of bacteria removal of CPFs. This situation suggests that colloidal silver may indeed not be necessary for the filters to effectively remove bacteria from source water. This study was completed in a period of two weeks, however, while the effect of silver may provide disinfection for several months of use.</jats:p>",

The commercial aluminium-based coagulant PAX-16, powdered activated carbon W35 and the magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX®) were used in the study. The source of humic substances was natural water (25.0 g C/m3 as DOC) flowing out from the Great Batorow Peat-Bog (Lower Silesia, Poland). In addition to DOC, color, UV254 absorbance, specific UV absorbance (SUVA254), turbidity, pH and alkalinity were also analyzed. Regardless of the applied technology, in the phase of raw water treatment extraordinary solutions were necessary to treat the humic rich water – a high coagulant (13.1 g Al/m3) or PAC (&amp;gt;200 mg/dm3) dose or a low bed volume (200 BVs) in the case of anion exchange. MIEX®DOC pretreatment had a very positive influence on the course and effects of coagulation resulting in a higher coagulant efficiency for removing organic compounds. In this respect, MIEX®DOC pretreatment allowed the application of a required coagulant dose four times lower compared to the coagulation of raw water. In testing the sequence of processes (MIEX®DOC – coagulation – PAC-adsorption), coagulation was the main process responsible for reducing the SUVA254 value. The improvement in water quality after PAC-adsorption was not significant, although the process removed DOC fractions that could not be removed by coagulation. Each of the applied methods played a role in the treatment of humic rich water and the nearly complete removal of NOM was achieved (in the sequence of processes) under relatively rational operating conditions for the treatment techniques.</jats:p>",

For a decade, GAP principles have been applied throughout the entire agri-food supply chain by organisations promoting voluntary private standard (PS) schemes. Although the stated aim of such schemes is to provide consumers with guarantees of food safety and quality, they are strongly driven by the desire to reduce transaction costs within the chain and to limit the legal liability of chain operators and retailers in the wake of food safety lapses. They raise issues concerning their compatibility with the polluter pays principle, the legitimacy of the standard-setting process, potential duplication of the safeguards enshrined in public legislation, and the extent to which they erect barriers to market entry and impede competition. The extension of voluntary PS schemes to global food chains raises further questions about their compatibility with sustainable development goals and with WTO rules regarding import restrictions based on production methods. Current challenges include the operational coexistence of mandatory public standards and voluntary private standards in the agri-food arena, and how they might be better harmonised within national and international legal frameworks. </jats:p>",

ANNs were successfully developed to predict future settled water turbidity based on seasonal raw water variables and chemical dosages, with correlation (R2) values ranging from 0.63 to 0.79. Additionally, inverse-process ANNs were developed to predict the optimal alum dosage required to achieve desired settled water turbidity, with correlation (R2) values ranging from 0.78 to 0.89.</jats:p>",

However, rooftop runoff is not without quality issues. Microbiological and chemical contamination have been detected in several studies, well above local and international guidelines, posing a health risk for consumers. Our research explores the use of silver ions, combined with conventional filtration and settling mechanisms, as a safe and affordable model for purification that can be applied on a small scale. The complete systems were installed and tested in rural communities in a Mexican semi-arid region. Efficiencies up to 99.9% were achieved in the removal of indicator microorganisms, with a marked exception where cross-contamination from external seepage occurs. Sites without overhanging branches or with relatively clean surfaces show an absence of total coliforms in the untreated runoff, compared with others where values as high as 1,650 CFU/100 ml were recorded. Thus, given adequate maintenance, the system can successfully deliver high quality drinking water, even when storage is required for long periods of time.</jats:p>",

Knowledge about organizations is based on studies of the individual forces and their joint operation in particular contexts. The complexity of such knowledge means that no single study, methodological approach, or even discipline will be sufficient for understanding organizational phenomena. We therefore suggest conceptualizing knowledge creation in organizational research with a supply chain. In the supply chain, quality knowledge is the product of specialized communities of practice that act in a coordinated system to combine and contextualize their knowledge. This approach illuminates how knowledge is transformed from generalized parts to contextual wholes, and what our field needs to change in order to promote this. We conclude by using the supply chain metaphor to suggest field-level mechanisms that can counteract the “specialization without coordination” approach that describes our field’s current approach to scholarship. </jats:p>",

It means that work requires more competencies than before. This paper focuses on two issues of human resources:  (1) Individual competence requirements in supply chains. There are more sources for identification competence need: determination from tasks, asking employers, national regulation of professional exams (learning outcome requirements), existing job descriptions. Authors give examples for all. Results show that general competencies have greater importance than it was expected. (2) Case studies available for training purposes in order to develop competencies. They present the related results of three EU projects. During NOVALOG project they redefined jobs, indentified competencies, worked out innovative training case studies. ITS-IT project resulted case studies on operation intermodal terminals. The presently running CENTRAL project updates NOVALOG’s results and go further when works out concrete training modules. \nFindings also give an overall picture of the dominant activities and tasks on different hierarchical levels and areas of supply chains in Hungary.\nKey words: case study, CENTRAL project, competencies, HR in logistics.</jats:p>",

Logistics plays an increasingly important strategic role for organizations that strive to keep pace with market changes and supply chain integration. Logistics and supply chain management are currently evolving due to external factors such as strategic alliances, technological changes, cycle time compression and an increasingly competitive environment. The present model is flexible enough to structure this complexity by evaluating logistics strategic strategies by utilizing a systemic multi-attribute analytical technique. This paper explores and illustrates an analytical framework in a real life environment to assess an organization’s logistics strategy and challenges with varying levels of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.13033/ijahp.v3i2.76&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The widely used USEPA method 1622 to detect Cryptosporidium is time consuming, and unable to provide the information on oocysts viability and species. In order to develop a fast detection method for viable C. parvum oocysts, a 0.2 μm pore size hollow fiber membrane and 0.45 μm pore size disc membrane were used to filter tap water. Modified Immunomagnetic separation (IMS) purification was followed, and the IMS condition was optimized to shorten the purification time. Finally, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody (FMAb) staining were combined to detect viable oocysts, and results indicated that the viable oocysts detection by FISH/FMAb can be achieved in 20 min. The total viable oocysts detection time can be shortened to less than 1.5 h without affecting oocysts recovery.</jats:p>",

Effective design and management of supply chains assists in the production and delivery of a variety of products at low costs, high quality, and short lead times. Recently, data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been extended to examine the efficiency of supply chain operations. Due to the existence of intermediate measures, the usual procedure of adjusting the inputs or outputs, as in the standard DEA approach, does not necessarily yield a frontier projection. The current paper develops a DEA model for measuring the performance of suppliers and manufacturers in supply chain operations. Additive efficiency decomposition for suppliers and manufacturers in supply chain operations is proposed.</jats:p>",

The results, drawn from a multiple case study, provide evidences of a non-uniform evolutionary trajectory among the studied firms, notably regarding the strategic choice of internalizing production tasks. Additionally, the data analysis suggests that leading firms are developing an even higher flexibility and on-time delivery capabilities as a response to the increase of competitive pressures.</jats:p>"

Our analysis was based on information about VC investments in Germany between 2004 and 2009. We found that possible problems caused by the geographic distance to a portfolio firm seem to be overcome by the syndication of investments with one of the VC firms located close to the investment. The results suggest, however, that a short geographic distance between an investor and the investment has an increasing effect on the probability of syndication as well as on the number of firms that join the syndicate. Hence, local VC suppliers may assume the role of an anchor, connecting the regional economy to more distant parts of the industry.</jats:p>",

Compared with PAC, the surface area and total pore volume of SPAC were improved. Kinetics data showed that the adsorption of EDCs/PPCPs by SPAC was faster than that by PAC. The adsorption processes of two target EDCs/PPCPs on both SPAC and PAC could be fitted by the pseudo-second order kinetics model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objectives – To examine patterns of Inter-Library Loans and Document Supply (ILL) in a large network of libraries over a period of five years, in order to establish whether ILL services are being used to replace journal subscriptions. The authors also aimed to establish which journal titles were most requested in their network, to inform future acquisitions policy. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDesign – Longitudinal study using transactional data collected from the Italian Network for Inter-Library Document Exchange (NILDE) for the period 2005-2009.    &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSetting – The Italian library sector.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubjects – Member libraries of NILDE, which is the largest ILL network in Italy with several hundred libraries. These consist primarily of university libraries, but also hospitals and health research institutions, public research institutions, and not-for-profit and public organisations.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMethods – ILL request data collected from the NILDE network software were analyzed. Figures were retrieved for the number of different journal titles requested per year of the study overall and by individual institution.  Further analysis was undertaken on requests for more recent articles, those published up to five years prior to being requested. This involved creating a list of the most requested titles for each year, and then compiling a core collection of journals that were requested 20 or more times in each year of the study. These core titles were analyzed for trends by subject and publisher, and for any significant correlations between either Impact Factors (IFs) or citation counts and ILL requests for particular journals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Results – The data revealed that the number of ILLs processed through NILDE increased every year during the period of the study. The majority of journals were only requested a small number of times in the five year period of the study, with 60% being requested five times or less. In the majority of instances, institutions were not borrowing the same title regularly. Analysis of the core collection of journals revealed that these repeated requests of the same title were mainly in the biomedical sciences and science and technology subject areas, and that these journals were often produced by smaller publishers who were not included in consortia purchasing. There was no correlation between journal impact factors (IFs) and ILL requests, but there was a statistically significant correlation between citation counts and ILL requests.    &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusions – ILL numbers are increasing despite big deals and consortia purchasing. The majority of requests are for articles that are two years old or older, and the authors suggest that this indicates that ILLs do not influence journal subscriptions. The authors suggest that ILLs may have increased during the course of the study (and may continue to do so) due to the current global financial crisis and its impact on library acquisitions.</jats:p>"

Batch and continuous experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of membrane filtration as well as PAC addition on boron removal in reconstituted seawater. In batch test, two kinds of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) hollow fiber membrane, Module A and Module B, were used to assess the influence of pH and PAC on boron removal, whereas in continuous mode, two MF systems with submerged PVDF flat-sheet membrane were run in parallel. Modules A and B obtained the highest percentage boron removal at pH 9 in the batch experiment with an average value of 47.33%, and their concentration of boron was further reduced after addition of PAC increasing the removal to 51.33 and 69.33%, respectively. For the continuous operation, PAC addition decreased the boron concentration by 20–30 and 40% in the reactor and effluent, respectively. On the other hand, only 5% reduction was obtained inside the reactor and 30–40% in the effluent for the system without PAC. Thus, operating the system at high pH with PAC addition could enhance the performance of the adsorption-MF system, which can be used as a pretreatment for the SWRO process.</jats:p>",

There has been less research, however, investigating whether this bias is related to specific types of end use and/or specific types of socio-demographic and socio-demographic household profiles. A high resolution smart metering study producing a detailed end use event registry as well as psycho-social and socio-demographic surveys, stock inventory audits and self-reported water diaries was completed for 250 households located in South-east Queensland, Australia. The study examined the contributions of end uses to total water use for each group identified as ‘low’, ‘medium’ or ‘high’ water users. Analyses were conducted to examine the socio-demographic variables such as income, percentage of water efficient stock, family size and composition, that characterise each self-identified water usage group. The paper concludes with a discussion of the general characteristics of groups that overestimate and underestimate their water use and how this knowledge can be used to inform demand management policy such as targeted community education programmes.</jats:p>",

It is known that this decision is frequently taken empirically and that the methodologies available to support it are few and restricted in terms of its conceptual basis. The study of Times and Motion is one of these methodologies, but its applicability is restricted in cases of more complex production processes. The method presented here was developed as a result of a project coordinated by the authors, on demand by a large Brazilian petrochemical company. An Action Research based approach was used to develop the method, based on the generation of alternative scenarios offering different possibilities for work allocation. This paper aims to contribute to the literature on the theme, starting from a premise that it is necessary to develop a method that organizes information and, as much as possible, makes explicit the premises and the consequences that decisions on work allocation might cause.</jats:p>"

We identify two sets of opportunities for pursuing radical innovations. First, there is an opportunity to pursue all phases of science, including exploratory and qualitative research, developing theories, causation and internal validity, and testing models and theories for external validity (the ability to generalize knowledge to other situations). This would broaden the domain covered by each research effort, minimize the bias resulting from the choice of research paradigm and research domain, to enhance external validity, and to minimize the gap between our research efforts and the real world our community seeks to reshape. Second, there is an opportunity to pursue multiple perspectives because a scientific conclusion valid for a narrow domain may prove to be partially true or even false if one obtains multiple perspectives. Multiple perspectives can be obtained by investigating different parts of the system, by employing different methods of analysis, by using different sources of data, or by using different subsets of the same data. Developing scientific knowledge requires pursuit of all phases of science and of multiple perspectives. In a separate paper, we propose and analyze ways to accomplish it.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We integrate field-based student course projects with real problems that companies are facing. The projects are led by SCRC directors, faculty at the Poole College of Management, and SC managers that financially support the SCRC. The SCRC focuses on improving the caliber of students entering the SC management profession. It accomplishes this by bringing the classroom into industry and involving students in finding viable solutions to real business problems, thus facilitating interactions between students and companies. Since 2000, 1,251 students have completed 331 projects with 39 companies. The SCRC is a self-funded small business that is supported by donor companies. Its organizational structure enables us to develop and maintain long-term relationships with donor companies, which are critical for a successful student-based outreach initiative with industry. In this paper, we describe the SCRC's evolution and benefits, and provide insights that may help other institutions interested in establishing similar organizations.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose and analyze ways to accomplish this task. A network of research teams can be effective in obtaining multiple perspectives and discovering radical innovation if it conducts intensive research over an extended period. Outliers are a source of multiple perspectives and innovative ideas and can help in identifying and addressing risks. Similarly, meta‐analyses and syntheses of published works can provide multiple perspectives and lead to radical innovations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) and B. anthracis Sterne (BA) spores were used to investigate the effectiveness of the electrochemical (EC) disinfection process. We tested the quaternary metal oxide (TiO2–Sb2O5–SnO2–RuO2) as the anode material in an EC cell for the inactivation of the spores. The presence of chloride ions at low concentrations was found to be critical for the effective inactivation of BT spores. Active chlorine was produced in-situ by anodic oxidation of chloride in the solutions. Local tap water used as a realistic test solution was found to contain average chloride concentrations of 1.2 mM. High concentrations of active chlorine were generated in the range of 0.35 to 0.5 mM (25 to 35 mg/L) to ensure that the high concentrations of spores were inactivated. We showed that the amount of active chlorine produced in the EC cell can be readily controlled by the operating conditions, including potential, flow rate and chloride content. Scanning electron images of the EC treated spores indicate damage to the outer membranes resulting in disruption and leakage of the spore contents. EC water disinfection processes using inexpensive electrode materials are a promising alternative as shown by inactivation of challenging biological threats such as Bacillus spores.</jats:p>",

The effect of different S levels (0, 25, 50 and 75 kg S/ha) on growth and ionic concentration  of wheat variety Inqlab-91 directly sown on saline-sodic soil (ECe=5.65 dS/m, pH=8.57 and SAR=17.38) was evaluated in a field experiment. Treatments were arranged using randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The crop was harvested at maturity, data on tillering, plant height, spike length, number of grains/spike, 1000- grain weight and yields (grain and straw) were recorded. Na, K, Ca and S concentrations in grain and straw were estimated using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Tillering, number of grains/spike, 1000- grain weight and grain yield significantly (p :: 0.05) increased by enhancing the S application. Maximum wheat yield (4.66 t/ha) was recorded when S was applied at 75 kg/ha, which was 43% more than the control treatment. Maximum number of tillers/plant (161) and number of grains/spike&#x0D;\n(56) were recorded with sulphur applied at 75 kg/ha. Positive correlation (r = 0.85), (r = 0.88) between calcium, potassium and negative correlation (r = -0.84) between grain sodium content and wheat grain yield was recorded. It indicates that presence of significantly higher Ca and K contents of grain receiving S application might possibly help plants to attain more Ca and K and avoided sodium uptake to alleviate salinity/sodicity stress. Economical analysis showed that maximum value cost ratio (5.5:1) was achieved with the application of 25 kg S/ha.</jats:p>"

The nitrification and denitrification processes were described by modifying the Michaelis-Menten kinetic incorporating the factors of dissolved oxygen, organic carbon and pH. The model consists of seven fixed parameters out of which the maximum velocity of nitrification (Vm,ni) was found to be the most sensitive. The model can be applied to predict the best operating condition (i.e., duration of intermittent aeration period and pellet ratio (PEG-pellet in reactor/reactor volume)) for different NH4-N concentrations. The model predicts that the highest efficiency to remove 45 mg/L of NH4-N can be achieved when the PEG-pellet reactor with 0.2 pellet ratio is operated under 6 h of intermittent aerations and the efficiency is strongly affected by the pellet ratio, especially when NH4-N concentration in the influent is higher than 60 mg/L.</jats:p>",

A total of 120 shallow and deep tubewell water samples were collected in pre- and post-monsoon seasons during the year 2008–2009 and analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters. The results of the analyses show that water samples were slightly alkaline to neutral pH. The average concentrations of Pb in all samples for the post-monsoon season were above the WHO's guideline for drinking water. For both seasons, arsenic levels exceeded the drinking water standard in 25% of groundwater samples and lead (Pb) levels exceeded in about 60% samples which contained elevated levels (&amp;gt;0.01 mg/L). The major cationic and anionic orders of dominance were unusual, being Ca2+ &amp;gt; Mg2+ &amp;gt; Na+ &amp;gt; K2 &amp;gt; Fe3+ &amp;gt; Pb2+ &amp;gt; Zn2+ &amp;gt; Cu2+ &amp;gt; As (total) &amp;gt; Cd2+ and HCO3− &amp;gt; Cl−&amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; NO3−, respectively.

The present study focused on improvements in internal materials handling management, approaching the case of a large company in the automotive industry. Materials handling is intrinsically associated with production flow. Because of this, it has direct influence on transit time, resources usage, and service levels. The objective was to evaluate, in a systematic way, the impact of implemented changes in materials handling management on the internal customers' perceptions of cost, safety in service, service reliability, agility and overall satisfaction. A literature review preceded a case study in the company's manufacturing unit and the questionnaires were completed by 26 employees directly involved in the process. Analyzing the answers, it was possible to suggest that internal customers understood that the new materials handling management system enlarged service agility and reliability and reduced costs, which caused an improvement in overall satisfaction.</jats:p>"

According to the concept of fuzzy TOPSIS earlier methods use closeness coefficient which is defined to determine the ranking order of all suppliers by calculating the distances to both fuzzy positive-ideal solution (FPIS) and fuzzy negative-ideal solution (FNIS) simultaneously. In this paper we propose a new method by doing the ranking using similarity. New proposed method can do ranking with less computations than original fuzzy TOPSIS. We also propose three different cases for selection of FPIS and FNIS and compare closeness coefficient criteria and fuzzy similarity criteria. Numerical example is used to demonstrate the process. Results show that the proposed model is well suited for multiple criteria decision-making for supplier selection. In this paper we also show that the evaluation of the supplier using traditional fuzzy TOPSIS depends highly on FPIS and FNIS, and one needs to select suitable fuzzy ideal solution to get reasonable evaluation.</jats:p>",

To ensure success, the whole organization, especially executive management, need to be advocates. Illustrated by four case studies, we discuss the influence of organisational culture on buy-in and commitment to WSPs. Despite an internal desire to undertake risk management, aspects of organisational culture prevented these from reaching full potential. Enabling cultural features included: enthusiastic management; past incidents; accountability; insufficient regulations; image; learning and continual improvement cultures; stakeholder relationships; and empowerment of staff. Blocking features included: lack of awareness and recognition; complacency; poor internal relationships; competing priorities; lack of resources and skills; contrasting internal cultures and a lack of near miss reporting. Benefits of WSP implementation and how management are committed are also discussed. We offer some suggestions to those wishing to generate executive buy-in such as: understanding reasons for hesitance; demonstrate benefits; avoiding complacency; highlight building blocks of WSPs and recognising the value of using the WSP approach to inform sound investment planning. We urge water utilities to consider the influence of organisational culture on the success and sustainability of WSP adoption, and to better understand how effective leadership can mould culture to support implementation.</jats:p>",

Released water from reservoir is related to discharge of inflow to reservoir, volume of evaporation from reservoir and storage of reservoir. Water demands are includes of drinkable water and agricultural water demand. If released water from reservoir is less than water demands in a month, this month will be a defeat. After a defeat, reservoir must return to normal condition in order to supply of water demands in next months. For minimize the number of defeats and maximize return ability of reservoir to normal condition, a suitable method must be applied for optimization of volume of released water from reservoir. In this research, two optimum methods (SDP method and GA method) were applied for minimize the number of defeats and maximize return ability of reservoir to normal condition. For this purpose, reservoir of the Dez dam was considered in this research. The Dez dam locates in the south-west of Iran on the Dez River. At the end, it is observed that GA method can minimize the number of defeats and maximize return ability of reservoir to normal condition better than SDP method. But SDP method can minimize damage function better than GA method.</jats:p>"

It attempts to fill a gap in terms of explaining how these aspects determine individual and household choices or constraints regarding entering entrepreneurship as either part time, with participation in labor markets, or as full time, as well as the corresponding supply of entrepreneurial effort. The study searches for insights on the relation between motivations intrinsic in either form of entrepreneurship and their effects on the supply of the entrepreneurial effort. Part-time micro entrepreneurs respond more to non-pecuniary aspects when maximizing their life choices, which divert them from profit maximization. However, full-time micro entrepreneurs are more sensitive to pecuniary factors and their choices regarding utility maximization are more compatible with profit maximization, albeit both groups are part of simple forms of entrepreneurship. The results identify the expectations placed on enterprises run by part-time and full-time entrepreneurial households in terms of their motivation and attitude toward the goal of profit making and consequently, to entrepreneurial supply and performance. Both groups may be relevant from the policy standpoint and employment in developing economies. </jats:p>",

Inorganic ion exchangers based on individual and mixed-metal hydrous oxides (or mixed adsorbents that contain inorganic ion exchangers in their composition) are adsorptive materials that are capable of lowering the concentrations of anionic contaminants, such as H2AsO4−, H3AsO3, F−, Br−, BrO3−, HSeO4−, HSeO3− and H3BO3, to 10 μg/L or less. To achieve a higher selectivity towards arsenate, a new ion exchanger based on Mg–Al hydrous oxides was developed by a novel, cost-effective and environmentally friendly synthesis method via a non-traditional (alkoxide-free) sol-gel approach. The exceptional adsorptive capacity of the Mg–Al hydrous oxides towards H2AsO4− (up to 200 mg[As]/gdw) is due to the high affinity of this sorbent towards arsenate (steep equilibrium isotherms) and its fast adsorption kinetics. Because of the mesoporous (as determined by N2 adsorption and SEM) and layered (as determined by XRD and FTIR) structure of the ion-exchange material as well as the abundance of anion exchange sites (as determined by XPS and potentiometric titration) on its surface the material demonstrated very competitive (or very high) removal capacity towards other targeted anions, including fluoride, bromide, bromate, selenate, selenite, and borate.</jats:p>",

For a better understanding of the interaction between fractional components of NOM and polysulfone (PS) ultrafiltration membranes used for drinking water treatment, fouling and especially the physically irreversible fouling of natural organic matter were investigated. Resin fractionation, fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were employed to identify the potential foulants. The results showed that humic acid and fulvic acid of small size were likely to permeate the membrane, while the hydrophobic fraction of humic and fulvic acid and aromatic proteins tended to be rejected and retained. Organic compounds such as proteins, humic substances, and polysaccharide-like materials, were all detected in the fouling layer. The physically irreversible fouling of the PS membrane seemed to be mainly attributed to the hydrophobic fraction of humic substances.</jats:p>",

However, the necessary time, resources (human and financial), nor the detailed strategic planning required for such a fragile and crucial aspect have been dedicated to this when identifying a society, country or region. Particularly in such a globalised world as ours, it is time that the public sector truly realises the power involved in using this tool to strengthen social identity and create social capital. This project tries to throw light on the radical importance of thinking through and planning the supply of public cultural activities, as they implicitly entail values (social, cultural, individual, among others) that make up the identity of a people and make them unique in the eyes of the world. Therefore the aim of this project is to study the way in which two municipalities of the Basque Country handle their cultural activities and define what types of social values are behind those activities.</jats:p>"

It was consistently concluded that the main factors for creating knowledge sharing context are: well understanding the objectives of management and workers, a clear definition of roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved in productive activities, good communication among those involved in the production, opportunities for their professional training and improvement, and financial incentives. These factors allow managers to promote a favourable context for knowledge sharing. </jats:p>"

A classification model based on the degree of the impact is proposed, which is applied to a river affected by AMD in the Iberian Pyritic Belt, and which might serve as a reference for other dams that have to tolerate the arrival of mine water. Application of the proposed method will allow the approximate state of the water quality to be learned by simply measuring its pH. This may prove very useful during the design of hydrochemical control networks. Weighting and standardizing values allows the relative extent of the pollution to be quantified simply, still within the framework of the permitted limits for the public water supply, while the proposed graphical representation makes it significantly easier to understand the phenomenon and proves useful for comparing temporal or spatial variations over the course of a river.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Canadian Water Network, the Alberta Water Research Institute, and the Ontario Centres of Excellence have collaborated to create the Canadian Municipal Water Management Research Consortium, a new initiative to engage municipal water authorities and allow them to access research capacity to tackle mutually identified, critical issues. The challenge of managing uncertainty in the provision of safe drinking water was selected as one such issue. An international expert panel with scientists from Australia, Canada, the USA and Europe was assembled to work with a steering committee of municipal water providers and drinking water regulators. This group has posed the challenge: How best can drinking water providers address risk and uncertainty to assure safe drinking water? Five key drivers to this challenge were identified: the current large list of drinking water contaminants, the inevitable growth of that list as a result of analytical advances not matched by our ability to assess small, mostly immeasurable health risks, the lack of clarity on public expectations for safe drinking water, misunderstanding of new, small risks and a need to assure aesthetic quality. Promoting the means for achieving a common understanding of risk and uncertainty among water providers and regulators was identified as a priority objective. The project has been initiated by developing, in a Canadian drinking water context, working definitions for safe drinking water, risk and uncertainty, with appropriate illustrative examples. The limitations of sole reliance on compliance monitoring for numerical contaminant limits compared with the merits of a preventive risk management/water safety plan approach were elaborated. Based on the foundations adopted, a toolkit is being developed to assist with issues ranging from a risk hierarchy, various products to promote better understanding of how risk assessment is performed, and products to enhance communications with consumers about drinking water safety.</jats:p>",

In  an  attempt  to  reverse  this  trend,  this  study  aims  at establishing  the  relationship  between  time  overrun  and  labour  productivity  on  construction sites  in  Lagos,  Nigeria.  43  technical  and  management  staff  of  some  medium  and  large construction  firms  based  in  Lagos,  Nigeria  were  sampled  and  administered  a  questionnaire survey. The questionnaire contained 18 causes of project time overrun and  14 causes of low labour  productivity  which  had  been  identified  from  the  literature  reviewed.  With  these  a relationship between project time overrun and low labour productivity was established. Both descriptive  and  inferential  statistics  were  used  in  analyzing  the  data.  Results  indicate  that inadequate funds for the project, inadequate planning before project takeoff, inadequate tools and equipment and delay in delivery of material top the list of major causes of time overrun while   the   use   of   wrong   construction   methods,   inadequate   construction   materials   and inaccurate  drawing/specification  are  the  key  factors  causing  low  labour  productivity  on construction  sites.  Significant  negative  relationship  was  found  between  time  overrun  and labour  productivity  in  construction  sites  in  Nigeria.  The  study  concludes  by  recommending that  early  appointment  of  project  managers  could  ensure  proper  management  of  both  the human  and  material  resources  that  could  guarantee  improved  productivity  and  ultimately save projects from time overrun.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, it affects plant stress resistance and in some plants, such as grasses, it may substitute carbon (C) compounds in cell walls, thereby influencing C allocation patterns and biomass production. How variation in silicon supply over a narrow range affects nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) uptake by plants has also been investigated in some detail. However, little is known about effects on the stoichiometric relationships between C, N and P when silicon supply varies over a broader range. Here, we assessed the effect of silicon on aboveground biomass production and C:N:P stoichiometry of common reed, <jats:italic>Phragmites australis</jats:italic>, in a pot experiment in which three widely differing levels of silicon were supplied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that elevated silicon supply promoted silica deposition in the epidermis of <jats:italic>Phragmites</jats:italic> leaves. This resulted in altered N:P ratios, whereas C:N ratios changed only slightly. Plant growth was slightly (but not significantly) enhanced at intermediate silicon supply levels but significantly decreased at high levels. These findings point to the potential of silicon to impact plant growth and elemental stoichiometry and, by extension, to affect biogeochemical cycles in ecosystems dominated by <jats:italic>Phragmites</jats:italic> and other grasses and sedges.</jats:p>",

The observance of HRO principles contributed to the resilience of the organisation and toward the maintenance of a safe and reliable drinking water supply. An investigation of technical reliability in the system showed that the utility invested heavily in automated monitoring and control systems and took a differentiated, risk-based approach towards resource allocation to that of HROs, which maintain existing technology with zero tolerance of defective, substandard or malfunctioning equipment.</jats:p>",

The investigation was performed in a pilot plant using native groundwater and the same water after chlorination with sodium hypochlorite. More efficient removal of NOM and arsenic was achieved without the addition of an oxidant under a wide range of working conditions. NOM removal was more efficient with the addition of the oxidizing agent compared with the overall efficiency for 2,900 bed volumes (BV) of treated water only during the initial phase of operation. Arsenic removal from chlorinated water was more efficient up to approximately 700 BV. At higher BV values, arsenic removal was up to two times more efficient with non-chlorinated water. The results obtained for the NOM sorption affinity to the resin indicated that it is possible to achieve a sorption capacity that exceeds the performance quoted by the resin manufacturer on several occasions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite a good legislative framework, South Africa faces significant challenges in the sustainable provision of adequate and safe water services. To improve the situation, South Africa's Department of Water Affairs (DWA) and other water sector partners undertook initiatives to assist municipalities with operation and management of water services. By way of example, in 2006, the municipal engineering oriented electronic Water Quality Management System (eWQMS) was implemented, providing municipalities with a platform for loading drinking water quality data and tracking performance of key water services management functions. Following this in 2008, DWA introduced an incentive-based regulatory programme, Blue Drop Certification (BDC), and the associated regulatory drinking water quality information system, the Blue Drop System (BDS) which is, for example, populated with data loaded by municipalities onto eWQMS. An integral part of BDC is the development of Water Safety Plans (WSPs). Due to the challenges faced by municipalities in developing WSPs, the Water Research Commission (WRC) saw a need to assist municipalities, and subsequently a generic Water Safety Plan for Small Community Water Supplies was developed. The WRC also saw the need to develop an easy-to-use WSP tool for municipalities. The eWQMS was selected as the platform for making the tool available. This paper presents the development of a web-enabled WSP tool on the eWQMS which ultimately will provide the information to the BDS.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bench-scale tests were conducted to evaluate enhanced coagulation as a method for removing natural organic matter (NOM) from a surface water to reduce the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). Aluminium sulphate (alum) and two polyaluminium chloride (PACl) coagulants were used, as well as alum with pH depression. Using a PACl coagulant alone or alum with pH depression was shown to attain 35% removal of TOC at lower dosages (31 and 29 mg/L, respectively) when compared to the use of alum alone (43 mg/L). In addition to TOC and UV254, a fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (FEEM) approach and liquid chromatography–organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) were used to further characterize the removal of NOM in both untreated and filtered waters. Principal component analysis of FEEM was able to identify the presence of humic-like substances (HS), protein-like substances (PS), and colloidal/particulate matter (CPM); HS were found to have a close correlation with TOC and UV254. LC-OCD enabled the quantitative detection of hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOC; the latter was further separated into five components, the largest of which was HS. Strong linear correlations were calculated between TOC, UV254, HS, and hydrophilic DOC (r2 &amp;gt; 0.96); these parameters were also found to be closely correlated with the formation of trihalomethanes (THMs, r2 &amp;gt; 0.78) and haloacetic acids (HAAs, r2 &amp;gt; 0.92). Linear correlations with THMs and HAAs indicated that FEEM and LC-OCD provide good measures of DBP precursors when compared with TOC and UV254.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nIn 1899, the American drug manufacturer Merck &amp; Co. first published a small book titled Merck's Manual of the Materia Medica. It was meant as an aid to physicians and pharmacists, reminding doctors that \"Memory is treacherous.\" By the 1980s, the book had become the world's largest selling medical text and was translated into more than a dozen languages. In 1990, the editors of The Merck Manual introduced The Merck Manual of Geriatrics. This new book quickly became the best-selling textbook of geriatric medicine, providing specific and comprehensive information on the care of older people. In 1997, The Merck Manual of Medical Information-Home Edition was published. In this revolutionary book, the editors translated the complex medical information in The Merck Manual into plain language, producing a book meant for all those people interested in medical care who did not have a medical degree. The Merck Manual of Health &amp; Aging, published in 2004, continued Merck's commitment to education and geriatric care, providing information on aging and the care of older people in words understandable by the lay public. The world's most widely used medical reference now features expanded clinical focus on each category of disorder, as well as more specific guidance on patient examinations.\n</jats:p>",

Most of the research has been focused on the changes in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 absorption. These parameters only give a general assessment. This work studies the changes in the physical and structural properties of a commercial humic acid by size exclusion chromatography with DOC and UV254 absorption detection (SEC-DOC, SEC-UV254), and the evolution of halogenated organic compounds (AOX) and trihalomethanes (THMs) during the photocatalytic degradation with simulated solar UV irradiation and Degussa P-25 TiO2. These changes are compared with those reported for natural organic matter (NOM). The photodegradation of commercial HA and NOM proceeds in a similar and sequential manner, initially with the preferential adsorption of larger molecules, then the degradation of these larger molecular size fractions and proceeding towards smaller molecular size fractions, while decreasing THMs and AOX formation potential.</jats:p>",

We used nonlinear regression analysis of C mineralization curves to differentiate C into active and slow soil C pools. Bare ground and cultivation had large active soil C pools, 1.07 and 0.89 g C/kg soil, respectively, but showed little stabilization of C into the slow soil C pool. The use of brassica seed meal resulted in increased soil N supply, the slow soil C pool, and earthworm activity but not total soil C and N, fruit yield, or tree growth. Legume and non-legume cover crops had increased microbial biomass and the slow soil C pool but had lower fruit yield and tree growth than all other groundcovers regardless of compost rate. Soils under wood chip mulch had elevated earthworm activity, total soil C and N, and the slow soil C pool. Wood chip mulch also had the greatest cumulative C mineralization and a high C:N ratio, which resulted in slight N immobilization. Nevertheless, trees in the two wood chip treatments ranked in the top four of the 13 treatments in both fruit yield and tree growth. Wood chip mulch offered the best balance of tree performance and soil quality of all treatments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Though logistics security only took care of trading phase in the past, many countries in the world have begun to introduce logistics security system as its coverage has been extended from production stage to delivery at the final destination. Logistics security system has become indispensable element for global corporations involved in international trading and studies on logistics security keep going on. Most of the studies, however, are focused on discussion of system, cost and influence of logistics security and few of them have been specifically dealing with substantial effectiveness thereof. This study developed the models of supply chain security activities and their outcome by means of using Balanced Scorecard (BCS) which is a well known performance indicator to identify relationship between supply chain security activities and their accomplishment. In this study we have presented 8 supply chain frameworks, human resources management, information system management, facilities/freight management, security process, crisis management capability, relationship with partners, sharing of logistics information and logistics security accomplishment, with reference to standards of C-TPAT and AEO based on WCO framework, 10 supply chain security capabilities. This study further indicates that relationship with partners has more effect on logistics security accomplishment than sharing of logistic information. Just as relationship between corporations in chain of supply and sharing of information among them are important elements in management of supply chain, relationship with partners and sharing of logistic information will have positive effect on supply chain security accomplishment and raise its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this work, a supply chain with coordination mechanism consisting single vendor and buyer is considered. Further, instead of price sensitive linear or deterministic demand function, a price-sensitive non-linear demand function is introduced in this paper. To find the inventory cost, penalty cost and transportation cost, it is considered that the production and shipping functions of vendor are continuously harmonized and occur at the same rate. In this integrated supply chain, the Buyer’s Linear Program (LP), vendor’s Integer Program (IP) and coordinated Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models are formulated. Numerical examples presented in this research, which include the sensitivity of the key parameters to illustrate the models.  The solution procedures demonstrate that the individual profit as well as joint profit could be increased by coordination mechanism even though the demand function is non-linear. In addition, the results illustrate that Buyer’s selling price with consumers purchasing price could be decreased which may increase the demand of the end market. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in favor of the coordinated supply chain with non-linear price sensitive demand function.  </jats:p>"

Crystallization pressure calculation from basalts with 5.0wt%&lt;MgO&lt;8.0wt % shows that magma crystallization pressures beneath near‐EPR seamounts are positively and negatively correlated with Na<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> and Fe<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>, respectively. However, these correlations are indistinct in axial lavas, which can be explained by chemical homogenization induced by extensive mixing processes. In each segment divided by major transforms and over‐lapping spreading centers (OSCs), near‐EPR seamount lavas have higher magma crystallization pressures, higher Fe<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> and lower Na<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> than the EPR lavas, which indicate cooler lithosphere, lower degrees and shallower melting depths beneath near‐EPR seamounts than the EPR. The correlations between magma crystallization pressures and melting conditions beneath near‐EPR seamounts imply that the source thermal state controls the melting degree and melt flux, and then melting process controls the shallow lithosphere temperature and magma crystallization depth (pressure). The cooler mantle sources beneath near‐EPR seamounts produce a lower degree of melting and a less robust magma supply, which results in a deep thermal equilibrium level and high magma crystallization pressure. The magma crystallization pressure decreases significantly as spreading rate of the EPR increases from ∼80 mm/year in the north (16°N) to ∼160 mm/year in the south (19°S), while this trend is unobvious in near‐EPR seamounts. This suggests that the magma supply controlled by spreading rate dominates the ridge crust temperature and magma crystallization depth, while the near‐EPR seamount magma supply is not dominated by the axial spreading rate. Because most seamounts form and gain most of their volume within a narrow zone of 5–15 km from ridge axis, they provide good constraint on magma supply and thermal structure beneath the EPR. High magma crystallization pressures in seamounts indicate dramatic temperature decrease from the EPR. The crystallization pressures of seamount lavas are well correlated with mantle melting parameters but in a blurry relationship with axial spreading rate. Despite the adjacency of the EPR and nearby seamounts, the thermal structure beneath the near‐EPR seamounts are controlled by their own magma supply and conductive cooling, chemically and thermally unaffected by magmatism beneath the ridge axis.</jats:p>",

This was started to rectify a mismatch between what was being taught in universities and what was being done in practice. Often this gap was addressed by ad hoc, uncoordinated, costly and often ineffective training courses. This mismatch is still apparent and so researchers explored why training providers are not meeting employers' needs. The action research went behind training needs analysis to examine the dialogue between the ‘suppliers’ (universities) and the ‘demands’ of the employers (local authorities and water utilities), across the water and sanitation sector in Uganda, through a series of forums, interviews, workshop appraisals and case studies, as well as trialling innovative training techniques. The research identified areas for improvement, especially in the area of employer engagement, skill needs and the management of human resource development. </jats:p>",

Although knowledge on the mechanisms involved in fatty acid regulation of stress tolerance is scarce, it has often been hypothesised that eicosanoid profiles can influence cortisol production. Genomic cortisol actions are mediated by cytosolic receptors which may respond to cellular fatty acid signalling. An experiment was designed to test the effects of feeding gilthead sea-bream larvae with four microdiets, containing graded arachidonic acid (ARA) levels (0·4, 0·8, 1·5 and 3·0 %), on the expression of genes involved in stress response (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, glucocorticoid receptor and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase), lipid and, particularly, eicosanoid metabolism (hormone-sensitive lipase, PPARα, phospholipase A<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, cyclo-oxygenase-2 and 5-lipoxygenase), as determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Fish fatty acid phenotypes reflected dietary fatty acid profiles. Growth performance, survival after acute stress and similar whole-body basal cortisol levels suggested that sea-bream larvae could tolerate a wide range of dietary ARA levels. Transcription of all genes analysed was significantly reduced at dietary ARA levels above 0·4 %. Nonetheless, despite practical suppression of phospholipase A<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>transcription, higher leukotriene B<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>levels were detected in larvae fed 3·0 % ARA, whereas a similar trend was observed regarding PGE<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>production. The present study demonstrates that adaptation to a wide range of dietary ARA levels in gilthead sea-bream larvae involves the modulation of the expression of genes related to eicosanoid synthesis, lipid metabolism and stress response. The roles of ARA, other polyunsaturates and eicosanoids as signals in this process are discussed.</jats:p>",

A second group of authors argue the opposite: planting additional forests should raise downstream water availability and intensify the hydrologic cycle. Obtaining supporting evidence for this second group of authors has been more difficult due to the larger scales at which the positive effects of forests on the water cycle may be seen. We argue that forest cover is <jats:italic>inextricably</jats:italic> linked to precipitation. Forest‐driven evapotranspiration removed from a particular catchment contributes to the availability of atmospheric moisture vapor and its cross‐continental transport, raising the likelihood of precipitation events and increasing water yield, in particular in continental interiors more distant from oceans. Seasonal relationships heighten the importance of this phenomenon. We review the arguments from different scales and perspectives. This clarifies the generally beneficial relationship between forest cover and the intensity of the hydrologic cycle. While evidence supports both sides of the argument – trees can reduce runoff at the small catchment scale – at larger scales, trees are more clearly linked to increased precipitation and water availability. Progressive deforestation, land conversion from forest to agriculture and urbanization have potentially negative consequences for global precipitation, prompting us to think of forest ecosystems as <jats:italic>global public goods</jats:italic>. Policy‐making attempts to measure product water footprints, estimate the value of ecosystem services, promote afforestation, develop drought mitigation strategies and otherwise manage land use must consider the linkage of forests to the supply of precipitation.</jats:p>",

However,  the rapid increase in human population growth coupled with extended globalisation complexities and   associated   social/political/economic   challenges   have   placed   new   demands   on   the purveyors  and  operators  of  infrastructure  projects.  The  importance  of  delivering  quality infrastructure  has  been  underlined  by  the  United  Nations  declaration  of  the  Millennium Development  Goals;  as  has  the  provision  of  ‘adequate’  basic  structures  and  facilities necessary for the well-being of urban populations in developing countries. Thus, in an effort to finance developing countries’ infrastructure needs, most countries have adopted some form of  public-private  collaboration  strategy.  This  paper  critically  reviews  these  collaborative engagement   approaches,   identifies   and   highlights   10   critical   themes   that   need   to   be appropriately  captured  and aligned  to  existing  business  models  in  order  to  successfully deliver   sustainable   infrastructure   projects.   Research   findings   show   that   infrastructure services  can  be  delivered  in  many  ways,  and  through  various  routes.  For  example,  a  purely public approach can cause problems such as slow and ineffective decision-making, inefficient organisational  and  institutional  augmentation,  and  lack of  competition  and  inefficiency (collectively  known  as  government  failure).  On  the  other  hand,  adopting  a  purely  private approach  can  cause  problems  such  as  inequalities  in  the  distribution  of  infrastructure services (known as market failure). Thus, to overcome both government and market failures, a collaborative approach  is  advocated  which  incorporates  the  strengths  of  both of these polarised positions.</jats:p>"

WBPA was applied at 150 cpm for 45 minutes under anesthesia once a day. WBPA significantly increased blood flow recovery after ischemic surgery, as determined by laser Doppler perfusion imaging. Sections of ischemic adductor muscle stained with anti-CD31 antibody showed a significant increase in capillary density in WBPA mice compared with control mice. WBPA increased the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in skeletal muscle. The proangiogenic effect of WBPA on ischemic limb was blunted in eNOS-deficient mice, suggesting that the stimulatory effects of WBPA on revascularization are eNOS dependent. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed significant increases in angiogenic growth factor expression in ischemic hindlimb by WBPA. Facilitated blood flow recovery was observed in a mouse model of diabetes despite there being no changes in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, both a single session and 7-day repeated sessions of WBPA significantly improved blood flow in the lower extremity of patients with peripheral arterial disease.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion—</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>WBPA increased blood supply to ischemic lower extremities through activation of eNOS signaling and upregulation of proangiogenic growth factor in ischemic skeletal muscle. WBPA is a potentially suitable noninvasive intervention to facilitate therapeutic angiogenesis.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",
