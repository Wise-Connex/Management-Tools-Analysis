These objectives still remain the broad responsibilities and demands of the future, despite the greater knowledge and comprehension of the tasks confronting the industry now than when the Association was formed. Because of the tremendous scientific and technologic advances in the U.S., not only have the hazards to the nation's water resources become more numerous and complex, but also the potential of the water supply profession for service to society has been greatly expanded. The article suggests the promotion of greater research activity as a means of addressing the industry's water supply problems, including: government‐financed research in saltwater conversion; the study of the toxicity and solubility of cadmium and chromium supported by the National Institutes of Health; reduction of expenses caused by corrosion effects; adding fluoride and phosphates to the water supply to aid dental protection; legal protection of individual water rights; an equitable system of cost assessments for the industry; revision and expansion of water treatment methods and standards; process control automation; and, controlling runoff and construction of water storage facilities.</jats:p>",
