However, there has been little research to date on services supply chains. It is believed that service businesses can benefit by applying some best practices from manufacturing to their processes. However, the inherent differences in services create a need for supply chain management tools specific to the services sector. This article documents the growing importance of the services sector and of services purchasing. Next, it develops a supply chain framework appropriate for a services supply chain by comparing and contrasting the applicability of three product‐based manufacturing models: Global Supply Chain Forum Framework, SCOR and Hewlett‐Packard's Supply Chain Management Model. Finally, this research describes the challenges for procurement professionals managing purchases for a services supply chain and provides suggestions for use of supply chain management theory, and practices for improvement.</jats:p>",

Focuses on passing on and interpreting quality goals, alignment of quality goals and the existence of partnership with the connected supply chain. The main reason for the success of the supply chain is the strength or dominance of the manufacturer. Strong and frequent unidirectional communication exists between the manufacturer and the supplier and between the manufacturer and the distributor. These connections are the crux of the supply chain. From this strong relationship, the supply chain is able to remain successful while communication weakens and disappears at either end of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Combines transaction costs and principal‐agent theory in a synthesized transaction cost‐agency model that allows for predictions regarding the organizational form of vertical integration based on the degree of asset specificity, task programmability and non‐separability. Transactions for new, proprietary, novel‐trait canola varieties require a more extensive set of institutions than traditional varieties. Identity‐preserved production and marketing systems appear technically feasible for smaller units of production, but it is unclear whether they are economically viable for long‐term or larger‐scale operations.

This paper illustrates how Seagate has envisaged a climate of cooperation and collaboration to better serve its customers in the areas of technology, cost and delivery. The paper is based on observations and findings following a longitudinal case study approach at the Seagate Storage Product Group (SPG) in Singapore. The seven‐stage implementation framework adopted by Seagate in their SCM project is discussed, together with the process of how Seagate has created a paradigm shift towards a new culture of teamwork‐based collaboration.</jats:p>",

To achieve seamless supply the contract manufacturer must slip in and out of each client's network of suppliers who together build the entire product. This paper describes the development of a diagnostic instrument for contract manufacturers to align core competencies to developing value criteria. A value‐focused diagnostic instrument is created specific to contract manufacturing. The major elements were verified by surveys. Applicability and exploitability of the diagnostic instrument was validated using action research. The instrument provides sequential analysis to assist contract manufacturers in the formulation of effective value‐based strategies. Suppliers of contract manufacture who display proficiency at value delivery will enhance prospects for inclusion on client preferred supplier lists. The system offers a supply management approach from the supplier viewpoint that synthesises across TQM, customer focus and business excellence.</jats:p>",

These changes, along with the introduction of innovative shipping mechanisms, have made logistics management an important source of opportunity and risk for grain shippers. A stochastic simulation model was developed to evaluate tradeoffs and effects of key variables on logistical costs in the grain supply chain for an individual firm. Average demurrage for the supply chain was $2.14 million ($0.70/mt or 1.8 cent/bu) with the highest demurrage costs for vessels and lowest for railcars. Of the random variables modeled, unexpected changes in export demand had the greatest impact on costs. [EconLit citation: Q130.] © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It is assumed that e‐SC performances are influenced by the network ol structures, by the criteria adopted to manage relationships among involved actors, and by the critical activities that the leading company performs. At first, the variables influencing such factors are identified and the interdependencies among them are analysed to establish existing correlations. This, in turn, enables one to group the values of the influencing factors in four coherent sets which are consistent with different business environments, thus assuring the effectiveness and efficiency to the e‐SC. The obtained reference model is then tested by applying it to literature‐based case studies. The output of this model may be used to design totally new e‐SCs or to redesign the existing ones, in both manufacturing and services industries.</jats:p>",

However, donor policy has been dominated by interventions in water supply, at the expense of achieving the potential health benefits of improved sanitation and hygiene. Commitments recently made by the international community require greater emphasis on improved sanitation and hygiene and their impacts on health. This review assesses whether such a shift in emphasis is apparent in donor policy. It examines the prominence given to achieving better health in water supply and sanitation policies of three donors: the World Bank, the European Union and the Department for International Development of the British Government. It finds that health benefits are explicit and integral in recently updated policy documentation concerning water supply and sanitation. This has taken place in an environment focused on poverty reduction and demand-led, financially sustainable interventions. Mechanisms that have enabled donors to prioritise the health impacts in this environment are discussed, including adoption of an asset-based conceptualisation of poverty and a cross-sectoral approach.</jats:p>",

However, the source of AMPA receptors mobilized during LTP is unknown. We report that AMPA receptors are transported from recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane for LTP. Stimuli that triggered LTP promoted not only AMPA receptor insertion but also generalized recycling of cargo and membrane from endocytic compartments. Thus, recycling endosomes supply AMPA receptors for LTP and provide a mechanistic link between synaptic potentiation and membrane remodeling during synapse modification.</jats:p>",

Process turbulence thus indirectly has a positive effect on time‐based delivery performance, whereas demand unpredictability has no effect.

A broad conceptual model is developed that can form the basis for future research in online auctions. A review of prior research and use systems theory and empirical analysis is presented to identify the potential antecedents to online auction success. Then dimensions of the input, process, and output factors are discussed to develop the conceptual model. The conceptual model provides an impetus and direction for future research into online auctions, taking advantage of existing tradition but also forming the basis for the development and testing of research hypotheses that will expand the frontiers of knowledge in online auctions.</jats:p>",

This has led to an increase in outsourcing and the adoption of supplier alliances with key suppliers. While much has been written about when and how to form such alliances and the benefits of doing so, little evidence exists of how alliance adopters differ from non‐adopters in their attitudes towards managing suppliers and their efforts to manage quality in the supply process. This study presents results of a survey of supply management professionals that examines attitudes of adopters and non‐adopters of supplier alliances to supplier and quality management. Results indicate that significant differences in attitudes exist between alliance adopters and non‐adopters, and that differences have a direct and significant impact on key measures of a buying firm's business performance.</jats:p>",

As Fe supply increased, leaf total Fe content did not show a significant change, whereas active Fe (extracted by 2,2′-dipyridyl) content increased curvilinearly. Chlorophyll (Chl) content increased as Fe supply increased, with a greater response at the lower Fe rates. Chl a: b ratio remained relatively constant over the range of Fe supply, except for a slight increase at the lowest Fe treatment. Both CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation and stomatal conductance increased curvilinearly with increasing leaf active Fe, whereas intercellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations decreased linearly. Activities of key enzymes in the Calvin cycle, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), stromal fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and a key enzyme in sucrose synthesis, cytosolic FBPase, all increased linearly with increasing leaf active Fe. No significant difference was found in the activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) of leaves between the lowest and the highest Fe treatments, whereas slightly lower activities of AGPase and SPS were observed in the other three Fe treatments. Content of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA) increased curvilinearly with increasing leaf active Fe, whereas glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and the ratio of G6P: F6P remained unchanged over the range of Fe supply. Concentrations of glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) at both dusk and predawn increased with increasing leaf active Fe. Concentrations of starch and TNC at any given leaf active Fe content were higher at dusk than at predawn, but both glucose and fructose showed the opposite trend. No difference in sucrose concentration was found at dusk or predawn. The export of carbon from starch breakdown during the night, calculated as the difference between dusk and predawn measurements, increased as leaf active Fe content increased. The ratio of starch to sucrose at both dusk and predawn also increased with increasing leaf active Fe. In conclusion, Fe limitation reduces the activities of Rubisco and other photosynthetic enzymes, and hence CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation capacity. Fe-deficient grapevines have lower concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates in source leaves and, therefore, are source limited.</jats:p>",

The authors use a dynamic partial equilibrium model of the Queensland electricity system to examine the effects of four alternate policy scenarios: a business‐as‐usual case, a centrally planned gas‐fired case, and two carbon tax scenarios– the first in which the merit order of coal and gas plant is reversed, and the second in which fuel switching is undertaken. The results indicate that no scenario is capable of delivering sufficient cuts in emissions to meet a ‘Kyoto equivalent’ industry target. While fuel switching brought about the greatest reduction in emissions, the high cost of this scenario indicates that a more efficient outcome for the electricity supply industry in Queensland would be a broad‐based Australia‐wide approach to emissions abatement, so that carbon reductions can be accessed from industries capable of achieving lower cost emissions abatement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers supply chain management organizations with the aid of 'chaotic systems theory' developed originally in physics and mathematics. Since innovations in supply chain management are vital for organizational survival 'complex systems theory' may assist in fine-tuning managerial philosophies that provide stability in supply chain management because it is on the boundary of chaos that the greatest innovational creativity occurs. Neither 'management by rigid objectives' (MBO) nor 'management by instruction' (MBI) will be suitable for the information society of the twenty-first century because chaotic social systems will no longer be effectively managed. However, the capacity for self-organization will be derived essentially from how supply chain management members accept a shared set of values or principles for action-'management by values' (MBV). Complex systems theory deals with systems that show complex structures in time or space, often hiding simple deterministic rules. This theory holds that once these rules are found, it is possible to make effective predictions and even to control the apparent complexity. The state of chaos that self-organizes is attributable to the appearance of the 'strange attractor' and provides the ideal basis for creativity and innovation in the twenty-first century. In the self-organized state of chaos, social members are not confined to narrow roles and gradually develop their capacity for differentiation and relationships, growing progressively towards their maximum potential contribution to the efficiency of the organization. In this meaning, values act as organizers of 'attractors' of disorder, which, in the theory of chaos, are systems represented by usually regular geometric configurations that predict the long-term behavior of complex systems. In supply chain management organizations (as in all kinds of social systems) the initial principles end up as the final principles in the long term. An attractor is a model representation of the behavioral results of the system. The attractor is not a force of attraction or a goal-oriented presence in the system; it simply depicts where the system is heading based on its rules of motion. In supply chain management organizations that cultivate or shares values of autonomy, responsibility, independence, innovation, creativity, and proactivity, the risk of short-term chaos is mitigated by external complexities that organizations are currently confronting. The strategy is to alter the supply chain management's surroundings so that they can benefit from management by values (MBV).</jats:p>",

Fe distribution from the site of application within the leaf and the untreated above‐ground plant parts was evaluated. Leaf fluid Fe concentration was determined by a novel procedure based on Fe chelation by desferrioxamine E and high performance liquid chromatography separation on a reversed‐phase column. The ferrioxamine E method enabled accurate determination of small amounts of Fe present in leaf fluid. Foliar Fe‐dimerum acid and Fe (III)‐citrate treatment to chlorotic tobacco plants induced new growth re‐greening.

Rock and sand colonization and biofilm formation was intensively studied for 44 d at two stream reaches: control and experimental (continuous addition of phosphate, ammonia, and nitrate). Structural (C, N, and polysaccharide content and bacterial and chlorophyll density) and metabolic biofilm parameters ( β‐glucosidase, peptidase, and phosphatase enzyme activities) were analyzed throughout the colonization process. The epilithic biofilm (grown on rocks) had a higher peptidase activity at the impacted reach, together with a higher algal and bacterial biomass. The positive relationship between the peptidase activity per cell and the N content of the epilithic biofilm suggested that heterotrophic utilization of proteinaceous compounds from within the biofilm was occurring. In contrast, nutrient addition caused the epipsammic biofilm (grown on sand) to exhibit lower β‐glucosidase and phosphatase activities, without a significant increase in bacterial and algal biomass. The differential response to nutrient addition was related to different structural characteristics within each biofilm. The epipsammic biofilm had a constant and high C:N ratio (22.7) throughout the colonization. The epilithic biofilm had a higher C:N ratio at the beginning of the colonization (43.2) and evolved toward a more complex structure (high polysaccharide content and low C:N ratio) during later stages. The epipsammic biofilm was a site for the accumulation and degradation of organic matter: polysaccharides and organic phosphorus compounds had higher degradation activities.</jats:p>",

These prior studies, however, have not assessed the grain composition and yield potential of these strains in hybrid combinations with an elite tester, or in response to supplemental N. Our objective was to study the interactive effect of genotype and N supply on productivity and grain quality for hybrids with a wide divergence in grain protein. Hybrids derived from the Illinois Protein Strains were evaluated in a 2‐yr field experiment where N rates were varied from 0 to 235 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (in eight 34‐kg increments), along with a current commercial hybrid sharing the same female parent (FR1064). The Illinois Protein Strain hybrids produced grain protein concentrations that reflected the strain parents, with all hybrids except Illinois Low Protein showing increased grain protein in response to increasing N supply. Many other strain attributes were also manifested at the hybrid level, including the relative differences in kernel weights and the inverse relationship between grain protein to both starch concentration and grain yield. Nitrogen supply positively enhanced grain yield in all hybrids, primarily by increasing kernel number. Nitrogen supply also impacted the yield–protein relationship by stimulating protein synthesis rather than by inhibiting starch production. These results demonstrate the strong genetic control of grain composition in maize hybrids, which can be modulated by the positive effects of N on reproductive sink capacity and seed protein synthesis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS), with support from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) conducted an epidemiological study of childhood leukaemia and nervous system cancers that occurred in the period 1979 through 1996 in Dover Township, Ocean County, New Jersey. The epidemiological study explored a wide variety of possible risk factors, including environmental exposures. ATSDR and NJDHSS determined that completed human exposure pathways to groundwater contaminants occurred in the past through private and community water supplies (i.e. the water distribution system serving the area). To investigate this exposure, a model of the water distribution system was developed and calibrated through an extensive field investigation. The components of this water distribution system, such as number of pipes, number of tanks, and number of supply wells in the network, changed significantly over a 35-year period (1962–1996), the time frame established for the epidemiological study. Data on the historical management of this system was limited. Thus, it was necessary to investigate alternative ways to reconstruct the operation of the system and test the sensitivity of the system to various alternative operations. Manual reconstruction of the historical water supply to the system in order to provide this sensitivity analysis was time-consuming and labour intensive, given the complexity of the system and the time constraints imposed on the study. To address these issues, the problem was formulated as an optimization problem, where it was assumed that the water distribution system was operated in an optimum manner at all times to satisfy the constraints in the system. The solution to the optimization problem provided the historical water supply strategy in a consistent manner for each month of the study period. The non-uniqueness of the selected historical water supply strategy was addressed by the formulation of a second model, which was based on the first solution. Numerous other sensitivity analyses were also conducted using these two models. Both models are solved using a two-stage progressive optimality algorithm along with genetic algorithms (GAs) and the EPANET2 water distribution network solver. This process reduced the required solution time and generated a historically consistent water supply strategy for the water distribution system.</jats:p>",

In order to understand more completely the architecture of the EO and the branchial organ, it is necessary to examine detailed relationships regarding the origin, course and distribution of nerves innervating the EO. We thus carried out a macroscopic and microscopic anatomical study, focusing on issues, using the 18 sides of nine electric rays. The following results were obtained: (i) the EO was innervated exclusively by the facial, glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves; (ii) although these three cranial nerves consistently innervated the EO, variation in the number of the nerves innervating the EO was observed; (iii) cranial nerves innervated the EO in a segmental manner, at both entry and in the area of distribution. These results suggest that the EO of the electric ray might have differentiated from a non‐constant branchial muscle anlage but preserves the branchial segments in terms of the craniocaudal, dorsoventral and proximodistal axes.</jats:p>",

Half of the vines fertigated at each N concentration were sprayed with 3% foliar urea twice in late September while the rest served as controls. Four vines from each treatment combination were destructively sampled during dormancy to determine the levels and forms of N and carbohydrates. Nitrogen fertigation during the summer did not significantly alter vine N concentration whereas foliar urea application in the fall significantly increased vine N concentration. In response to foliar urea application, concentrations of both free amino acid-N and protein-N increased, but the ratio of protein-N to free amino acid-N decreased. Arginine was the most abundant amino acid in free amino acids and proteins, and its concentration was linearly correlated with vine N concentration. Concentrations of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) decreased slightly in response to N supply from fertigation. Foliar urea application in the fall significantly decreased TNC concentration at each N fertigation level. Starch, glucose, and fructose decreased in response to foliar urea applications, but sucrose concentration remained unaffected. Approximately 60% of the carbon decrease in TNC caused by foliar urea application was recovered in proteins and free amino acids. We conclude that free amino acids account for a larger proportion of the N in vines sprayed with foliar urea compared with the unsprayed vines, but proteins remain as the main form of N storage. In response to foliar urea application, part of the carbon from TNC is incorporated into proteins and free amino acids, leading to a decrease in the carbon stored in TNC and an increase in the carbon stored in proteins and free amino acids.</jats:p>",

An important and necessary step in the epidemiological study was the reconstruction of the historical water supply strategy of the water distribution system serving the Dover Township area, New Jersey. The sensitivity of solutions to: (1) pressure and pattern factor constraints, (2) allowable operational extremes of water levels in the storage tanks, and (3) the non-uniqueness of the water supply solution are analysed in detail. The computational results show that the proposed approach yields satisfactory results for the complete set of monthly simulations and sensitivity analyses, providing a consistent approach for identifying the historical water supply strategy of the water distribution system. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the alternative strategy obtained from the revised objective function and the variation of constraints did not yield significantly different water supply characteristics. The overall analysis demonstrates that the progressive optimality genetic algorithm (POGA) developed to solve the optimization problem is an effective and efficient algorithm for the reconstruction of water supply strategies in water distribution systems.</jats:p>",
