A pipeline within a supply chain refers to the stream of information, material, components, and assemblies that are associated with a particular product. It is typical for manufacturing plants to put considerable effort to optimize the performance of a horizontal slice of a supply chain (such as coordination among parts that share a common resource). The need to optimize the performance of the vertical slice (the supply chain connecting raw material to finished product) by controlling the transmission of schedule instability and the resulting inventory fluctuation is often overlooked. A schedule is stable if actual production requirements for a given period do not change from the forecast production requirements. Stable production schedules are important when managing supply chains as they help control inventory fluctuation and inventory accumulation. Failure to control schedule instability results in high average inventory levels in the system.</jats:p><jats:p>In this paper a simulation analysis of supply chain instability and inventory is conducted, and it is shown how supply chains can be analyzed for continuous improvement opportunities using simulation. The focus is on a stamping pipeline in an automobile supply chain based on operating data from General Motors (GM). It is shown that the techniques used in this paper are a useful tool for supply chain analysis.</jats:p>",

However, we argue that the impact of the supply of new land by the Hong Kong government is not as important as they maintain in accounting for the volatile house prices in Hong Kong. We show that there is no causal relationship between land supply and housing prices. Our estimations, based on the annual data of Hong Kong's public land sales, find that the government acts to maximise land revenue. Maximisation of revenue from land sales is, however, consistent with the efficient allocation of resources. We also show that the amount of land sales by the government and land in developers' land banks tend to decrease when market interest rates increase. Land banking behaviour is governed by economic conditions. Long-term land holding costs should cover interest costs. </jats:p>",

The work is divided into four chapters. The first one gives the concept of tourism destination as a modem expression of tourism attractiveness of higher levels and as synthesis of tourism supply entirety. The second chapter considers the characteristics and typical requests of modern tourist demands across its segments. The third chapter examines the supply structure of a tourism destination, which comprises, besides hotels, other accommodation and catering facilities, necessary traffic and public utility infrastructure, entertaining - recreational amenities, ecological qualities of natural and human environment as well as other attractive conveniences of out-of-board consumption. Crucial significance of price and quality of services are also discussed. The fourth chapter presents the process of permanent improving of supply structure, the purpose of which is its optimalization. Based on objective perceiving of adverse sides of supply, one makes and carries out short and long-term programmes for improving the supply structure, with necessary reconstructions and investments. Economic and organizational measures; tasks of local self-government, tourism associations and tourism enterprises.</jats:p>",

The inferior SH was supplied by the inferior thyroid artery. The ansa cervicalis innervated the SH inferiorly with a branch below the loop. Each arterial branch to the muscles had an accompanying venous tributary. The corrosion cast specimen demonstrated that the arterial lumen diameters were almost threefold larger in branches entering the upper SH, compared with the lower SH or OMO. Small intramuscular arteries without axial supply were found within the middle third of the upper SH, the lower SH, and the upper OMO. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>: It is possible to preserve neurovascular integrity in an inferiorly based SH flap. The superior and medial borders are released, with dissection of vascular supply laterally and deep to the muscle, and preservation of the inferior terminal ansa branch.</jats:p>",

Innovative companies in various industries are now experimenting with application of the concept in a supply chain setting. Modular production makes it possible to further involve distributors and suppliers in the manufacturing process and create a new tier of suppliers in the automotive industry; that of the “zero‐level supplier”. Expected benefits of the increased integration in the inbound and outbound flow of goods are improved responsiveness to customers and increased efficiency. It can be questioned, however to what extent manufacturers can increase the amount of control over operational activities based on networking, as opposed to control based on ownership, without becoming an empty design and marketing company. This paper assesses the impact of the new model of modular production on the dynamics in supply chains as a whole and the consequences for individual players, based on innovative cases such as that of the SMART car.</jats:p>",

The southern part of the Mariana Trench is important in that we should expect to find a transect of a typical island arc structure; that is, from east to west, the Mariana forearc, the Mariana arc proper, the Mariana Trough (active back‐arc spreading center), and the West Mariana Ridge (remnant arc). The most striking feature of peridotites from the southern part of the trench is that primary hornblende is a major constituent mineral in many specimens. Thus, the peridotite samples are divided into anhydrous (A‐type), hydrous (H‐type) and intermediate (I‐type) groups. Petrological data suggest that each type of peridotite is a residue of extensive partial melting in the upper mantle. It is argued here that the I‐ and H‐type peridotites were modified from `proto‐A‐type peridotite' by fluid infiltration. The fluid was enriched in Al, Ti, Fe, and alkalis, and may have caused changes in mineral and bulk chemical compositions of the peridotites. A‐type peridotite derives from the `proto‐A‐type peridotite' directly, without any fluid contamination. After the formation of the `proto‐A‐, I‐, and H‐type peridotites', lower‐temperature fluids, probably of seawater origin, produced retrograde metamorphism and alteration including serpentinization. The mantle wedge in the southern Mariana forearc was heterogeneous in fluid supply.</jats:p>",

In the next level, a model that incorporates efficient practices is developed to reconfigure the network. This integrated methodology allows for decision maker (DM) input throughout the process. The methodology has been implemented and tested in the reconfiguration of an outbound petroleum supply chain network for CountryMark Cooperative, Inc. In this case study, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to analyze current operations and an integer programming (IP) model that incorporates efficiency metrics is developed for selection of distribution facilities and allocation of resources to the facilities.

It is essential to perform risk‐benefit analysis of reengineering alternatives before making a final decision. Simulation provides an effective pragmatic approach to detailed analysis and evaluation of supply chain design and management alternatives. However, the utility of this methodology is hampered by the time and effort required to develop models with sufficient fidelity to the actual supply chain of interest. In this paper, we describe a supply chain modeling framework designed to overcome this difficulty. Using our approach, supply chain models are composed from software components that represent types of supply chain agents (e.g., retailers, manufacturers, transporters), their constituent control elements (e.g., inventory policy), and their interaction protocols (e.g., message types). The underlying library of supply chain modeling components has been derived from analysis of several different supply chains. It provides a reusable base of domain‐specific primitives that enables rapid development of customized decision support tools.</jats:p>",

However, these interactions are largely ignored by existing distribution system design methodologies, which assume demand is constant regardless of the firm's distribution strategy. This paper describes a multidisciplinary framework that considers these interactions in the design of “profit maximizing” distribution networks. The framework employs two major decision support methodologies: (1) binary logit models for estimating market share considering various demand‐influencing parameters such as product price and distribution service, and (2) a mixed‐integer programming (MIP) model for finding optimal distribution network designs. We applied the framework to an actual design problem facing a national distributor of industrial chemical products. The test results verify the framework's large‐scale capability and the potential benefit of the integrated solution methodology.</jats:p>",

We show-using a numerical model of the Western European natural gas market-that once the demand side of the market is liberalized, each gasproducing country has an incentive to break up its gas sellers. The model therefore suggests that there may be numerous producers in a liberalized natural gas market. Hence, in a liberalized market consumers will not be exploited by suppliers. </jats:p>",

Specifically, the research objective is to quantitatively document the characteristics and performance impact of information exchange among supply chain entities. The findings suggest that the response‐based supply chain model consistently outperforms the anticipatory model in terms of customer service delivered under conditions of both low and high demand variation. Comparisons of inventory holdings across supply chain models demonstrate that the retailers' inventory burden is significantly lower in the response‐based scenario. The inventory savings enjoyed by retailers in the response‐based model are substantial enough to lower system‐wide inventories. In sum, the study supports the feasibility of achieving both improved service and lower inventories as a result of information sharing.</jats:p>",

These data were compared with those from control pairs which we studied simultaneously to test the hypotheses that food was in short supply during the chick stage at the colony site and that in such circumstances the behaviour of adults and young is mainly responsible for the low success. Pairs whose chicks were fed with additional food until fledging showed a higher fledging success than control pairs (intermediate for pairs of first experimental group). During the first week after hatching, experimental adults of both groups were present together at the territory for longer than control pairs. In adult females of experimental pairs, the length of feeding trips was shorter than in females of control pairs, whilst the rate of chick feeding was more frequent in the experimental broods. After the chicks were 7 days old, differences were significant only for the experimental pairs whose chicks were provided with additional food until fledging. Chicks fed until fledging showed a higher daily mass and wing‐length increments and reached a higher fledging mass at an earlier age than both control chicks and chicks which were provided with additional food until day 7. Starvation occurred only in control chicks and in chicks of the first experimental group after we had stopped providing food. When food was in short supply, fledging success of gulls was adversely affected as a result of both starvation (because of the lower feeding rates of chicks) and a higher predation rate (arising from changes in behaviour of both adults and chicks).</jats:p>",

Laminae, numbering 1–8 on the main shoot, were examined for various parameters at weekly intervals from emergence through senescence. N1 resulted in gradual reduction in laminae growth from 5th leaf onwards with maximum effect on flag and penultimate laminae of both the genotypes. Chlorophyll concentration, soluble protein, rubisco concentration and rubisco activity in response to low N supply was reduced in the top two laminae in V2. Pn rate varied little with leaf position in wheat at adequate N supply. In V2, low N supply resulted in the reduction of laminae N content by about 25% with corresponding reduction in Pn rates in the penultimate and flag laminae. VI, in contrast, exhibited no significant change in leaf N concentration and hence maintained similar Pn rates at both levels of N supply throughout the ontogeny.</jats:p><jats:p>It is concluded that the two genotypes responded differently to N supply in relation to laminae growth and photosynthesis. Uniculm ‘Gigas’ (VI) responded to low N with large reduction in laminae size, adequately maintaining the metabolic constituents such as chlorophyll, soluble protein, rubisco and laminae N concentration and Kalyansona (V2), in contrast, responded with small changes in laminae size and greater reduction in synthesis and maintenance of the metabolic constituents.</jats:p>",
