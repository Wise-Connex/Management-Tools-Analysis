In order to solve that dilemma, a value‐seeking and proactive approach to greening is proposed in the (general) management literature. However, literature on the role of supply chain operations, mostly published in the area of reversed logistics, has failed to develop grounded theory and frameworks to support the application of such an approach. Furthermore, research is needed that goes beyond the partial and fragmented contribution of reversed logistics. This research note looks at challenges for research on green steps to take, and green supply chains to make in practice, as a step up to lowering the ecologic footprint of supply chains.</jats:p>",

The increasing use of automation for Multiple Parallel Synthesis (MPS) and the move to automated combinatorial library production is placing an overwhelming burden on the management of reagents. Although automation has improved the efficiency of the processes involved in compound synthesis, the bottleneck has shifted to ordering, collating and preparing reagents for automated chemistry resulting in loss of time, materials and momentum.\nMajor efficiencies have already been made in the area of compound management for high throughput screening. Most of these efficiencies have been achieved with sophisticated library management systems using advanced engineering and data handling for the storage, tracking and retrieval of millions of compounds. The Automation Partnership has already provided many of the top pharmaceutical companies with modular automated storage, preparation and retrieval systems to manage compound libraries for high throughput screening. This article describes how these systems may be implemented to solve the specific problems of inventory management and reagent supply for automated chemistry.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

This paper proposes improving the distribution function of the supply chain by employing hub‐and‐spoke network designs. Such designs have proven to be effective with third party logistics carriers such as Federal Express, UPS, Norfolk Southern, and Yellow Freight. Several models and heuristic solution techniques have been introduced in the literature in the past ten years. However, the performance of such heuristics, under different transportation environments, has not been examined. This paper acts as a first step in this direction. The performance of two heuristics to solve a hub‐and‐spoke network is compared against the performance of an optimal technique, for various configurations of data. With the results of this study, business managers can, by analyzing the structure of their data, assess the “risk” associated with applying one of the two heuristics. Heuristic developers can also exploit the results of this study to give them insight into areas where heuristics can be developed or strengthened in order to give rise to more robust heuristics.</jats:p>",

Both the material and information flows in the supply chain are subject to delays. Under the assumption that the division managers share a common goal to optimize the overall performance of the supply chain (i.e., they act as a team), we characterize the optimal decision rules for the divisions. The team solution reveals the role of information leadtimes in determining the optimal replenishment strategies. We then show that the owner of the firm can manage the divisions as cost centers without compromising the systemwide performance. This is achieved by using an incentive-compatible measurement scheme based on accounting inventory levels. Finally, we investigate the impact of irrational behavior on supply chain performance and demonstrate that it is important for the upstream members of the supply chain to have access to accurate customer demand information. </jats:p>",

Only three pools have been discovered in. the last ten years that have initial marketable reserves of greater than 1,500 E6M3. A positive correlation exists between the addition of gas reserves in the province of Alberta and the amount of exploratory drilling. Development drilling conducted for deliverability purposes does not substantially add to the reserve picture. However, exploratory drilling may result in large reserve additions. Future reserve additions translate into gas supply. By conducting scenario analysis of reserve growth based on ultimate potential estimates of 5,600 E9M3 (200 Tcf) and 7,600 E9M3 (270 Tcf), and comparing the results with current reserve growth levels, an assessment can be made of the province' sability to meet future market demand.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In this analysis outpost wells have been included as development wells.

The remainder of the wells are deemed to be successful wells(1).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Beginning in 1972 successful drilling activity in the province increased until 1980. From 1981 to 1992 there was a general downward trend in drilling activity with exceptions occurring in 1985 and 1988. Drilling in 1992 was at its lowest level since 1975 at 2,635 wells. Drilling activity in 1993 started on an upward trend that continued through to 1997. In 1994, for the first time in its history, more than 6,000 successful wells were drilled in the province. In 1997, over 11,000 successful wells were drilled, 11,036 to be exact! (Figure 1)</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Two questions that are often asked are:\"With such a large increase in successful drilling activity in the province, why do we not see more gas reserves being added?\" and,\"Will the future gas reserve additions be sufficient to meet market demand?\"</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>To answer the first question we need to dig a little deeper by exan1ining the split between development and exploratory drilling, the average-drill depth of development and exploratory wells, the per cent of drilling for gas and the type of exploratory drilling being done. A search can be made for any correlation between the type of exploratory drilling and the size of the gas reserves added.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The answer to the second question can be approached in two ways. By examining the historical average annual and cumulative gas pool size, an estimate of the number of successful gas wells needed to meet future demand can be made. In addition, by assuming an ultimate potential reserve and a specific time frame for the development of that reserve, an annual growth rate curve necessary to achieve that ultimate potential can be estimated. Comparing the annual growth rate to an estimated market demand gives a picture of if that demand can be met.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In presenting this material, we will first begin with the total drilling activity and then concentrate on gas drilling and its impact on supply.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

This is particularly the case where strategic considerations play a subordinate role and efficiency arguments are stressed. The limitations of the transaction cost approach are also discussed. In the building industry, logistics networks are not only directed towards a minimisation of transaction costs, but are also striving for joint value maximisation. Co‐operation between designing and constructing parties makes it possible to present a “total product” to the market. Opportunistic behaviour is replaced by mutual trust. Instead of bounded rationality, know‐how is transferred between firms for product development. This change will fundamentally alter the nature of competition in the building industry in the near future.</jats:p>",

This is where guest editors from the Editorial Advisory Panel for Building Services Engineering Research and Technology address current developments in building services engineering practice and research. The articles are very short, on one theme of current interest, and do not go through the longer refereeing process for conventional research papers. This is to encourage consultants and contractors to discuss their latest developments in a non-commercial manner. Academics will also be asked to outline current research areas in universities and colleges. Without the constraint of full refereeing there is scope in the articles to provoke interest and to raise issues for discussion. Consequently the Editor of BSER&amp;T is happy to receive and publish letters furthering the discussion of 'Blue Pages' articles. If you have a suggestion for an article or topic you would like to see included in the 'Blue Pages' please inform the Editor. Comments on the 'Blue Pages' are also welcome.

The laboratory environment features buyers and sellers who receive a new random value or cost in each period, so they must learn a strategy that maps these random draws into bids or asks. We focus on buyers’ adjustment of the “mark-down” ratio of bids relative to private value and sellers’ adjustment of the corresponding “mark-up” ratio of asks relative to private cost. The learning model involves partial adjustment of these ratios towards the ex post optimum each period. The model explains a substantial proportion of the variation in traders’ strategies. Parameter estimates indicate strong recency effects and negligible autonomous trend, but strongly asymmetric response to different kinds of ex post error. The asymmetry is only slightly attenuated in “observational learning” from other traders’ ex post errors. Simulations show that the model can account for the main systematic deviations from equilibrium predictions observed in this market institution and environment.</jats:p>",

To begin to examine the limits on triacylglycerol (TAG) production, developingCuphea lanceolata, Ulmus carpinifolia, and Ulmus parvifolia embryos were incubated with factors whose availability might limit oil accumulation. The addition of glycerol or sucrose did not significantly influence the rate of TAG synthesis. However, the rate of 14C-TAG synthesis upon addition of 2.1 mm14C-decanoic acid (10:0) was approximately four times higher than the in vivo rate of TAG accumulation in C. lanceolata and two times higher than the in vivo rate in U. carpinifolia andU. parvifolia. In C. lanceolata embryos, the highest rate of 14C-TAG synthesis (14.3 nmol h−1 embryo−1) was achieved with the addition of 3.6 mm decanoic acid. 14C-Decanoic acid was incorporated equally well in all three acyl positions of TAG. The results suggest that C. lanceolata, U. carpinifolia, and U. parvifolia embryos have sufficient acyltransferase activities and glycerol-3-phosphate levels to support rates of TAG synthesis in excess of those found in vivo. Consequently, the amount of TAG synthesized in these oilseeds may be in part determined by the amount of fatty acid produced in plastids.</jats:p>",

The supplier has limited capacity, and retailers are privately informed of their optimal stocking levels. If retailer orders exceed available capacity, the supplier allocates capacity using a publicly known allocation mechanism, a mapping from retailer orders to capacity assignments. We show that a broad class of mechanisms are prone to manipulation: Retailers will order more than they need to gain a more favorable allocation. Another class of mechanisms induces the retailers to order exactly their needs, thereby revealing their private information. However, there does not exist a truth-inducing mechanism that maximizes total retailer profits. </jats:p><jats:p> We also consider the supplier's capacity choice. We show that a manipulable mechanism may lead the supplier to choose a higher level of capacity than she would under a truth-inducing mechanism. Nevertheless, her choice will appear excessively restrictive relative to the prevailing distribution of orders. Furthermore, switching to a truth-inducing mechanism can lower profits for the supplier, the supply chain, and even her retailers. Hence, truth-telling is not a universally desirable goal. </jats:p>",

The noise is about 1 μVpp in a 0.1–10 Hz bandwidth, becoming, for the −10 V supply only, 1.3 μVpp at 1.5 A. The VS/R is based on commercial devices and has been designed to face the stringent requirement of very low drift systems. It features very good line regulation, less than 10 mV over 10 V at 1.5 A supply current, and very low drift, between 3 and 8 ppm/°C; it also shows large power supply rejection ratio (PSRR), &amp;gt;120 dB. The VS/R presented includes also safety circuits, to protect itself and the electronic equipment to be supplied in an actual experimental condition. It is protected against inversion of polarity and against under and over voltage at its inputs, and has a foldback current limiting circuit which shuts down the whole system if the current absorption lasts for some time. These protecting circuits acts on both outputs (±10 V), to maintain always the symmetry. From an analysis made on the data extracted from the measured noise spectra, it was possible to measure the dynamic output impedance, found mainly inductive, with a value of the order of 1 mH. The dc PSRR has been improved by about 20 dB with respect to the performances of the devices used, thanks to a very simple circuit solution.</jats:p>",

In the main food species, <jats:italic>Stipagrostis</jats:italic> spp., levels of crude protein, water content and digestibility were generally highest in the flower component while in other species, leaf was the best quality food. Crude protein content, water content and digestibility were highly correlated and all declined exponentially following rainfall. Levels remained comparatively high, even during extended drought, largely because fog and dew‐fall enabled some plants to continue to produce green leaf material. The crude protein content of rumen material from oryx that died during drought was negatively correlated with time since rainfall. Estimates of dietary crude protein derived from the protein content of rumen material were comparable to those predicted for available grass forage. The results are discussed in the context of the food and water requirements of oryx. It is suggested that during drought some grasses continue to be a source of adequate crude protein and water and of sufficient digestibility but that levels are close to minimum maintenance requirements. This and the decreasing biomass of available forage of sufficient quality lead to condition loss and death, particularly of the most vulnerable animals. Crude protein may become limiting sooner than does water.</jats:p>",

This study was carried out using the test cells at BRE Scotlab; it sought to establish the effect of climatic conditions on the operation of a Scandinavian 'double' window that was converted for use as a supply air window. A clear correlation was established between intensity of incident solar energy and the temperature gradient within the window. It was also evident that the window acted at night as a heat reclaim device. During the period of the test, the problem of reverse flow was encountered (similar to that found in 'passive stack vent' systems), and the influence of wind speed was investigated. Comparison was made between test cell measurements of the U-value of the standard (unventilated) triple glazed window and those derived from the program FRAME. By reference to recent work on ventilated photovoltaic glazing systems it was possible to derive a simulation method for predicting the temperature rise within the window. </jats:p>",

There is little information on root architecture of plants growing on semi‐arid grasslands where soil nutrient heterogeneity and defoliation might impose particular restrictions on root growth. We conducted a split‐root study to evaluate the effect of nonuniform nutrient supply and clipping on root architecture and biomass allocation of three range grasses found in the Intermountain West of the USA: ‘Whitmar’, a cultivar of <jats:italic>Pseudoroegneria spicata, Bromus tectorum</jats:italic> (cheatgrass), and ‘Hycrest’, a hybrid between <jats:italic>Agropyron desertorum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>A. cristatum</jats:italic>. Root systems of individual seedlings were equally divided between the two divisions of a partitioned 10‐l pot, and each of the divisions was independently supplied with ‘high or ‘low’ nutrient solution. Plants were either clipped or not. Characteristics of root architecture (topology and link length), root size (root length and number of root tips), and biomass distribution (specific root length and root mass∶root volume ratio) were evaluated. Root topology (branching distribution) changed with nutrient treatments and defoliation in all three species. Length of links (a segment of root between two branches, or between a node and a root tip) responded to nutrient treatment only in defoliated plants of ‘Whitmar’, in which relative growth rate was associated with changes in architectural traits (external–external and internal–internal link length), while biomass accumulation and relative growth rate in cheatgrass and ‘Hycrest’ maintained allometric relationships with root length. Our results suggest that large plasticity in root architecture, together with inherently low relative growth rate are adaptations that allow ‘Whitmar’ to grow well in heterogeneous and poor soil‐nutrient conditions. Cheatgrass and ‘Hycrest’ exhibited characteristics suggesting capability for rapid exploitation of nutrient patches.</jats:p>",

Both velocity and supply rate of RBCs increased, by approximately equal amounts, as arterial hematocrit was reduced from 44 to 15%.

Calculated lineal density of RBC, an index of capillary hematocrit, did not change with hemodilution.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The contribution of the sternocleidomastoid branch of the occipital artery (superior arterial pedicle - SAP) to the irrigation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) was evaluated in fresh human cadavers by injecting radiological dye and a resin for microvasculature corrosion casts. From its insertion in the mastoid process of the temporal bone, the SCM was divided into superior, medium, and inferior thirds. In most of the SCM, The SAP are formed by two longitudinal parallel branches. In all specimens, the radiological dye injected into the SAP reached or trespassed the middle part of the studied SCM. The SAP was poorly distributed in the lowermost region of the inferior third of the SCM, suggesting the contribution of other arteries or pedicles. The corrosion casts of the microvasculature showed a profuse network of microscopic vessels in those levels where the SAP was detected.</jats:p>",

In experiment 1, the in situ degradation characteristics\n                  of N and OM for 16 food ingredients was determined. The foods varied considerably\n                  in their chemical composition and degradability coefficients of N and OM. Based on\n                  this information, four diets were formulated to differ in their rate of N and OM\n                  release in the rumen but to have a similar content of metabolizable energy (10·4\n                  MJ/kg dry matter (DM)), crude protein (140 g/kg DM), daily ratio of N: OM released\n                  (34 g N per kg OM) and digestible undegradable protein (32 g/kg DM) but to be\n                  synchronous or asynchronous with respect to hourly N: OM ratio. The four diets\n                  were slow energy, synchronous (SS), slow energy asynchronous (SA), fast energy,\n                  synchronous (FS) and fast energy asynchronous (FA).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In experiment 2 the four diets were offered ad libitum to 24 ewe lambs of an\n                  initial live weight of 25 kg in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Lambs were slaughtered\n                  at 40 kg live weight. Animals offered diets FS and FA had a higher growth rate\n                  than those offered diets SA and SS (266 v. 225 g/day respectively; P &lt; 0·05).\n                  There was a significant interaction between rate ofOM and N release on DM intake\n                  (DMI) with lambs offered diet FS consuming less than those offered FA (1·47 v.\n                  1·67 kg DM per day; P &lt; 0·05). Rate of energy release and synchrony had an\n                  effect on food conversion efficiency (FCE; kg gain per kg DMI) with lambs offered\n                  diets FS and FA having a greater FCE than those offered SS and SA (0·170 v. 0·146\n                  respectively; P &lt; 0·001) and those offered diets SS and FS had a greater FCE\n                  than those offered diets SA and FA (0·164 v. 0·152 respectively; P &lt; 0·05).\n                  Diet had little effect on carcass composition. The proportion of propionate in\n                  rumen fluid was greater in lambs offered diets FS and FA than in those offered\n                  diets SS and SA (222 v. 168 mmol/mol respectively; P &lt; 0·01). Plasma urea\n                  concentrations exhibited a cyclical trend throughout the day with highest\n                  concentrations occurring 2 h after fresh food was offered. Lambs offered diet FS\n                  had lower plasma urea concentrations at 6, 10 and 14 h after feeding. Plasma\n                  concentrations of ß-hydroxybutyrate were lower throughout the day in lambs offered\n                  diet FS. The current findings are consistent with the view that a rapid release of\n                  OM and synchronizing hourly N: OM release in the rumen can improve the efficiency\n                  of growth through improvements in protein and/or energy metabolism.</jats:p>",
