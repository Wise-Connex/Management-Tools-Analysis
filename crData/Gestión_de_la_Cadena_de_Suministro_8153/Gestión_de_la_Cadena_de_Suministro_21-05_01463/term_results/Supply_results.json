      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global order has suddenly changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many countries, including Indonesia, have applied lockdown policies to stop the spread of COVID-19. Lockdown policies have disrupted the supply of raw materials and the demand for finished goods. The manufacturing industry is one of the sectors that has suffered most in this situation, and they have struggled to reconfigure their internal and external supply chain network and partnership. This study examined the impact of internal integration, supply chain partnership, supply chain agility, and supply chain resilience on sustainable advantage. The participants of this study were from manufacturing companies in Indonesia. For data collection, a questionnaire was used, with a five-point Likert scale to obtain the respondents’ opinions. Using Google Form link, the questionnaire was distributed via email and the WhatsApp social media application to the predetermined set of manufacturing companies. Respondents filled out 672 questionnaires, and 456 respondents (corresponding to 67.86%) filled it out correctly and were considered valid for further analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to analyze the data using the SmartPLS software version 3.3. The results supported all nine hypotheses proposed. Internal integration through interdepartmental data sharing affects supply chain (SC) partnerships, SC agility, and SC resilience. Moreover, SC partnerships, through the on-time delivery of materials and by coping with changing demand, improve SC agility, SC resilience, and sustainable advantages. SC agility, in keeping the production process running normally and regulating the production capacity, affects SC resilience and sustainable advantage. SC resilience improves sustainable advantage by providing timely product delivery and reliable sales volumes in pandemic conditions. These results provide insights for managers into enhancing the sustainable advantage by improving supply chain agility, supply chain resilience, and supply chain partnerships. This study could contribute and extend the acceptance of previous studies in the context of the manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

Results were analysed through one-way analysis of variance, to appraise the differences in the perceptions of the various actors of the FMCG supply chain (Manufacturers, Logistics Service Providers, Retailers).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>While a certain degree of alignment of the perceptions across the FMCG supply chain exists, the study found that Logistics Service Providers can play a crucial role as orchestrators of the CSCRM process towards a more “supply chain-oriented” response to cyber threats and risk events. The research also highlights the necessity to see people as key elements for improving cyber resilience in the supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Through a vertical analysis of a supply chain, the study extends the existing theory on CSCRM, which contains isolated case studies. It also contributes to extending the current theory with the proposal of the paradigm of Logistics Service Providers as orchestrators of the CSCRM process. The study combines different classifications of CSCRM initiatives and embraces theories external to the supply chain literature.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Through the empirical analysis, this study helps practitioners in streamlining the design of cyber security strategies and actions that span across the supply chain for better alignment. This could mean more coordination of efforts and more targeted/accurate investments in CSCRM initiatives. The study invites practitioners to ponder the perceived relevance of the human factor as a source of risk and the perceived importance of countermeasures aimed at mitigating risk events stemming from that source.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>By focusing on an entire supply chain, this is one of the first studies on CSCRM that goes beyond the dyad. Its originality also lies in its use of the investigations of perceptions along the supply chain as pillars for the alignment of CSCRM strategies and mitigation initiatives. This original perspective allows for discovering the role of Logistics Service Providers in driving the alignment of the efforts towards better outcomes of the CSCRM process.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The chapter analyses the difficulties of this complicated exchange, especially if there are two or more transplants. With such awareness, the chapter reviews the innovative program that was recently initiated at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center, which allows people to donate a kidney today in exchange for a voucher that a designated recipient can redeem for a kidney in the future if and when a kidney is needed. Even though the new and more complex elaboration of paired exchanges or vouchers increased the pool of people who can donate and increased the chances for people on transplant waiting lists to get an organ, the chapter explores how they begin to look more and more like markets. And, in most countries, markets in organs are illegal.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: Western Kenya is the largest producer of sugar in Kenya, supporting about 170,000 smallholder farming households and contributing about 80 percent of the total sugar produced in Kenya. This contribution is however threatened given that the sugar firms in that region are producing sub optimally with obsolete technology. Comparing to related sector, other firms in Kenya such as the tea manufacturing firms have implemented energy efficiency practices so as to manage energy wastage and reduce production costs. Were they to employ effective production methods, they could increase their production significantly. While that is the case, scholars have suggested that adoption of lean manufacturing practices is a panacea to quality addition and waste minimization. Perhaps what these firms need are lean practices.&#x0D;\nPurpose: This study interrogated the extent to which the firms have adopted lean manufacturing practices, just-in-time and total quality control and if they have, its effect on supply chain performance.&#x0D;\nMethodology: The study targeted and conducted a census on the 11 sugar manufacturing firms in the Western Kenya belt where the procurement managers, line managers, finance managers, production managers, production engineers, quality assurance officers and operations managers of each of the 11 firms (total 87) were targeted. The study employed a descriptive research design to collect quantitative data. Quantitative primary data was collected through questionnaires and analyzed using statistical package for social sciences.&#x0D;\n Findings: The findings of the study indicated that the just in time productionand total quality control are positively and significantly associated with supply chain performance of the sugar manufacturing firms.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Practice and Policy: The study recommended adoption of just in time production practices such as availing labor on demand in order to manage labor costs, availing resources on demand in order to manage wastage, production on demand in order to manage inventory costs, ordering raw materials from the suppliers only when there is demand for production from customers, having a simplified production design to ensure timely production and having multiple skilled workers to ensure faster production. In addition, in order for the sugar manufacturing firms to increase supply chain performance, there is need to adopt total quality control practices such as having manageable defect prevention costs related to quality planning, putting in place manageable defect prevention costs related to investment in quality related information systems, having manageable appraisal costs related to test and inspection of purchased materials, having manageable appraisal costs related to quality audits, having controllable internal failure costs related to reworks and having manageable internal failure costs related to scrap.</jats:p>"

Water pipe failures resulting in a lack of water supply for a long period pose a threat to the water consumers safety. The aim of the work was to present the methodology and develop a risk map of lack of water supply to consumers. The article presents a failures simulation of the main pipes transporting treated water from the water treatment plant to the city carried out using the EPANET 2.0. software. The simulation results made it possible to determine the consequences of failures by determining the number of inhabitants (consumers) affected with lack of water supply as a result of failure of the main pipes near the water treatment plant WTP which, together with the failure rate, were used to prepare risk maps of lack of water supply. The developed method was presented on the water supply network located in Central and Eastern Europe. It was found that the highest risk of lack of water supply is related to the failure of the M3 main pipe, which transports water to the eastern and north-eastern parts of the city. It is recommended to modernize the M3 main pipe, which will reduce the number of failures resulting in a lack of water supply.</jats:p>"

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this research is to highlight the factors that can optimize the total cost of a centralized supply chain through coordination of order quantities amongst the players in a supply chain. Survey of earlier research reveals that players in a supply chain usually have conflicting interests, such as reducing inventories and increasing profitability. Thus, to make coordination feasible, it is essential to provide proper incentives to individual players. Munson and Rosenblatt (2001) were the first to discuss coordination in a three level supply chain with a single player at each level. On the other hand, Viswanathan and Piplani (2001) are believed to be the first to consider cooordination in a two level supply chain with a single vendor and multiple retailers. This research extends upon these works by investigating coordination in a three level supply chain with multiple retailers. This is done by incorporating the model of Viswanathan and Piplani (2001) into that of Munson and Rosenblatt (2001). A new mathematical model is developed, with numerical examples presented and results discussed. When players in a supply chain agree to coordinate, it is possible to have some of the players benefiting more than others in the chain, if not losing. The mathematical model developed in this research work guarantees that the local costs for the players either remain the same as before coordination, or decrease as a result of coordination. Furthermore, this research work assumes that savings generated from coordination should be distributed among the players of the chain. This led to developing a scheme to fairly distribute savings amongst the players of the supply chain. Results indicate that even though players may have conflicting interests in the supply chain, coordination is recommended and should be pursued.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this research is to highlight the factors that can optimize the total cost of a centralized supply chain through coordination of order quantities amongst the players in a supply chain. Survey of earlier research reveals that players in a supply chain usually have conflicting interests, such as reducing inventories and increasing profitability. Thus, to make coordination feasible, it is essential to provide proper incentives to individual players. Munson and Rosenblatt (2001) were the first to discuss coordination in a three level supply chain with a single player at each level. On the other hand, Viswanathan and Piplani (2001) are believed to be the first to consider cooordination in a two level supply chain with a single vendor and multiple retailers. This research extends upon these works by investigating coordination in a three level supply chain with multiple retailers. This is done by incorporating the model of Viswanathan and Piplani (2001) into that of Munson and Rosenblatt (2001). A new mathematical model is developed, with numerical examples presented and results discussed. When players in a supply chain agree to coordinate, it is possible to have some of the players benefiting more than others in the chain, if not losing. The mathematical model developed in this research work guarantees that the local costs for the players either remain the same as before coordination, or decrease as a result of coordination. Furthermore, this research work assumes that savings generated from coordination should be distributed among the players of the chain. This led to developing a scheme to fairly distribute savings amongst the players of the supply chain. Results indicate that even though players may have conflicting interests in the supply chain, coordination is recommended and should be pursued.</jats:p>"

The blood supply chain system expiration rate under different strategy combinations was obtained through computer simulation optimization. Through the analysis of the results, it is found that the supply fluctuation has a greater impact on the performance of the supply chain. The performance adjustment effect of the distribution mode itself is small. Expiration due to short-term demand fluctuations is greater than the expiration rate caused by long-term demand fluctuations.

One promising strategy is the use of a cross‐functional team with representatives from functional departments. Such a team may facilitate sharing relevant information, enabling the firm to respond effectively to SC disruption warnings. However, despite their potential, cross‐functional teams also differ in their ability to respond to SC disruption warnings and to ensure firm robustness. Extending insights from information‐processing theory and team research to the field of SC management, we propose that a cross‐functional team’s ability to handle high numbers of SC disruption warnings depends on the extent to which the team adopts centralized decision‐making, with one or two members orchestrating the decision‐making process. We also introduce internal integration problems as a mediating mechanism explaining why a cross‐functional team lacking centralized decision‐making may be unable to handle high numbers of SC disruption warnings. In two independent studies, we use multi‐source data on cross‐functional teams’ performance in dealing with SC disruption warnings during a realistic SC management simulation; the results support our predictions.</jats:p>",

The approach that a company takes towards the preservation of the natural world and the part it plays in the introduction of environmentally responsible policies is what is meant by the term \"environmental orientation.\" Green supply chain management, on the other hand, entails the incorporation of environmentally friendly practises throughout the entirety of the supply chain, beginning with the procurement of raw materials and continuing all the way through the delivery of finished goods. The objective of green supply chain management is to lessen the negative impact that a company's operations have on the surrounding environment while simultaneously maintaining or improving the company's level of performance. In this study, we investigate the connection between environmentally conscious business practises, environmentally conscious management of supply chains, and successful business operations. In addition to this, we investigate the role that green supply chain management plays as a mediator in this connection. According to our findings, an environmental orientation appears to have a positive influence on green supply chain management, which in turn appears to have a positive influence on corporate performance. In addition, we discovered that environmentally responsible management of supply chains acts as a moderating variable, thereby reinforcing the connection between environmental orientation and business performance. Our findings shed light on the significance of environmental orientation as well as environmentally responsible management of supply chains in the process of improving corporate performance. When it comes to supply chain management, businesses that have a strong environmental orientation are more likely to adopt environmentally friendly practises, which can lead to improved performance.\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet-based technologies have changed the way firms do business and manage their supply chains. They have influenced customers’ purchase patterns, thereby motivating manufacturers to introduce online channels alongside traditional ones. Such structures are known as dual-channels. Nowadays, an increasing number of manufacturers offer a return policy to attract more customers and to stay competitive. Furthermore, learning-based continuous improvements help firms cope with market changes and be competitive, flexible and efficient. This thesis presents three main models:\n\nThe first model investigates the effect of adopting a dual-channel (comprised of a retail channel and an online channel) on the performance of a two-level (vendor-retailer) supply chain. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the system by finding the optimal markup margin and inventory decisions before and after adopting the dual-channel. The results show that adding an online channel would increase the profit of the system. However, it creates a conflict due to competition between the retail and online channels.\n\nThe second model studies a supply chain system, which is comprised of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. A return policy in which customers can return the purchased item for a refund is also considered. The purpose is to examine the effect of different return policies on the behavior of the system before and after adopting the dual-channel strategy. In both strategies, the model analyzes the change in the profit, the pricing and inventory decisions. The findings demonstrate that the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demand, the selling prices and the overall profit.\n\nThe third model investigates the effects of learning and forgetting in the vendor’s production processes. It also considers single- and dual-channel strategies. Each channel structure can adopt any of six inventory policies. Learning and forgetting effects are considered in all policies except one. The objective is to maximize the profit of the system by finding the joint optimal pricing and inventory decisions. The results suggests that learning, despite being impeded by forgetting, reduces inventory-related costs thereby allowing the chain to reduce the prices of its product(s), which increases demand and subsequently sales.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Internet-based technologies have changed the way firms do business and manage their supply chains. They have influenced customers’ purchase patterns, thereby motivating manufacturers to introduce online channels alongside traditional ones. Such structures are known as dual-channels. Nowadays, an increasing number of manufacturers offer a return policy to attract more customers and to stay competitive. Furthermore, learning-based continuous improvements help firms cope with market changes and be competitive, flexible and efficient. This thesis presents three main models:\n\nThe first model investigates the effect of adopting a dual-channel (comprised of a retail channel and an online channel) on the performance of a two-level (vendor-retailer) supply chain. The objective is to maximize the total profit of the system by finding the optimal markup margin and inventory decisions before and after adopting the dual-channel. The results show that adding an online channel would increase the profit of the system. However, it creates a conflict due to competition between the retail and online channels.\n\nThe second model studies a supply chain system, which is comprised of production, refurbishing, collection, and waste disposal processes. A return policy in which customers can return the purchased item for a refund is also considered. The purpose is to examine the effect of different return policies on the behavior of the system before and after adopting the dual-channel strategy. In both strategies, the model analyzes the change in the profit, the pricing and inventory decisions. The findings demonstrate that the more generous the return policy is, the higher the demand, the selling prices and the overall profit.\n\nThe third model investigates the effects of learning and forgetting in the vendor’s production processes. It also considers single- and dual-channel strategies. Each channel structure can adopt any of six inventory policies. Learning and forgetting effects are considered in all policies except one. The objective is to maximize the profit of the system by finding the joint optimal pricing and inventory decisions. The results suggests that learning, despite being impeded by forgetting, reduces inventory-related costs thereby allowing the chain to reduce the prices of its product(s), which increases demand and subsequently sales.</jats:p>"

Similarly, user service is not always satisfied in the time required to fill the storage, nor with sufficient pressure. Hence the importance of this study. Measuring the variability of pressure in the distribution network and determining the factors that influence the definition of a sufficient minimum hours of service, is a first step to change to a continuous service 24/7, in order to minimize the volumes of lost water and meet demand. In total, 347 pressure sensors were placed in a network to detect changes in pressure and obtain data for 3 years. This study presents a new approach to determine the operating policy of the operating agency that provides the service intermittently. Two objectives are pursued: pressure variability – to minimize leaks – and define the minimum hours of service. The analysis was performed using multivariate statistical techniques, including principal component analysis, correlation matrix and ANOVAs, to explore the association between objectives. The results obtained show that the pressure distribution has a Gaussian behavior and that the hours of service have a Poisson distribution.</jats:p>",

Results showed that considering space in EOQ brought savings to the chain. It has brought down the order quantity closer to, and many times equal to JIT ordering quantities.

The proposed PIPS is essentially a special high frequency soft switched DC/DC converter, integrating six parallel isolated power supplies in one module where each power supply generates a regulated dc supply for the GCT gate driver. In commercial GCT power supplies, a high-voltage isolation transformer is indispensable but highly inefficient in terms of cost and size, which can be significantly improved by the optimized transformer.

The transformer optimization procedure satisfying the voltage isolation requirement of GCT gate drivers is extensively discussed. The performance of PIPS, including the front end DC/DC converter, zero voltage switching phase-shift full bridge (ZVS-PS-FB) converter, and the optimization of the transformer, is verified by simulations and experiments where a 360W laboratory prototype is built for the experimental use.</jats:p>"

In this thesis, environmental concerns with a mathematical model are investigated to design and configure a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon green meat supply chain network. A multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation is developed to optimize three objectives simultaneously: minimization of the total cost, minimization of the total CO2 emissions released from transportation, and maximization of the total capacity utilization. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, a green meat supply chain network for Southern Ontario, Canada is designed. A solution approach based on augmented εε-constraint method is developed for solving the proposed model. As a result, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained. Finally, the impacts of uncertainty on the proposed model are investigated using several decision trees. Optimization of a food supply chain, particularly a meat supply chain, based on multiple objectives under uncertainty using decision trees is a new approach in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This thesis is devoted to the development of a novel parallel isolated power supply (PIPS) for the gate driver of integrated Gate Commutated Thyristors (GCT). The proposed PIPS is essentially a special high frequency soft switched DC/DC converter, integrating six parallel isolated power supplies in one module where each power supply generates a regulated dc supply for the GCT gate driver. In commercial GCT power supplies, a high-voltage isolation transformer is indispensable but highly inefficient in terms of cost and size, which can be significantly improved by the optimized transformer. In all, this design strives to achieve a general power supply for powering up the gate drivers of all types of GCT devices in all MV applications with minimal changes in configuration.\n\nIn this thesis, the configuration of PIPS is presented and its operating principle is elaborated. The transformer optimization procedure satisfying the voltage isolation requirement of GCT gate drivers is extensively discussed. The performance of PIPS, including the front end DC/DC converter, zero voltage switching phase-shift full bridge (ZVS-PS-FB) converter, and the optimization of the transformer, is verified by simulations and experiments where a 360W laboratory prototype is built for the experimental use.</jats:p>"

Uncertainty in price of diesel is also developed using mean reverting process. To date, the impacts diesel price uncertainty and transportation cost in the supply chain policy is not very well known. This report provides an analysis by altering the multiple variables impacting transportation costs such as the truck type, feature, environmental condition, route, weight and driving style.

However, the protection of the environment is one of the main factors that should be considered based on environmental protection regulations of countries. In this thesis, environmental concerns with a mathematical model are investigated to design and configure a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon green meat supply chain network. A multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation is developed to optimize three objectives simultaneously: minimization of the total cost, minimization of the total CO2 emissions released from transportation, and maximization of the total capacity utilization. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model, a green meat supply chain network for Southern Ontario, Canada is designed. A solution approach based on augmented εε-constraint method is developed for solving the proposed model. As a result, a set of Pareto-optimal solutions is obtained. Finally, the impacts of uncertainty on the proposed model are investigated using several decision trees. Optimization of a food supply chain, particularly a meat supply chain, based on multiple objectives under uncertainty using decision trees is a new approach in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Results showed that considering space in EOQ brought savings to the chain. It has brought down the order quantity closer to, and many times equal to JIT ordering quantities.

Two of the well-known trade credits that are widely used by\nbusinesses are the permissible delay in payments and price discounts. This\nthesis presents models for coordinating supply chains with both trade credits.\nThe first model investigates the effect of utilizing delay in payments in a two-level\n(manufacturer-retailer) supply chain. It modifies and analyzes three known\nmodels of different production and shipping policies to account for delays in\npayments; it then compares them and highlights the production policy that\nperformed the best with the total system cost being the performance measure.\nThe second model analyzes the coordination of a three-level (supplier-manufacturer-\nretailer) supply chain with the delay in payments. It analyzes \nnine different scenarios of permissible delay among the three players. A simulation\nstudy was performed and a thorough analysis of the results was used to identify\nthe limitations of all scenarios and to draw some managerial insights and\nfindings.\nThe third model investigates the effect of coupling permissible delay in payments\nand price discounts for coordinating a three-level. The analysis considers nine\ndifferent cases of delay-in-payments along with eight cases of price discounts\namong the three players in the supply chain, totaling seventy-two cases. The\nnumerical examples and the sensitivity analyses show that the coupling of delay-in-\npayments and price discounts maximizes the supply chain profit more than\nwhen using a single mechanism at a time.\nThe fourth model investigates a two-level supply chain by studying the effects of\nvarious scenarios for delay-in-payments when including some environmental\ncosts such as fuel and emissions from manufacturing and transportation.

However, because of its location in heavily built-up and densely-settled environments, the urban forest is vulnerable. The purpose of this dissertation is to conceptualize, assess, and analyze urban forest ecosystems and their vulnerability at multiple spatial and temporal scales. An urban forest ecosystem classification framework that integrates biophysical, built, and human components is developed. Subsequent classification of ecosystems at the neighbourhood scale reveals the spatial arrangement of several\nsocial-ecological interactions. Such information is valuable to ecosystem-based decision support while also informing future vulnerability research. The investigation of ecosystem vulnerability began with the development of a theory-based conceptual framework. Urban forest vulnerability is defined as the likelihood of decline in ecosystem service supply and its associated benefits for human populations, urban infrastructure, and biodiversity. It is comprised of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, which describe the built environment and associated stressors, urban forest structure, and the human population, respectively. This framework is applied using empirical field research in Toronto, Canada to explore the processes of vulnerability and their influence on ecological change. Results indicate that there are several significant predictors of urban forest decline and mortality, and emphasize the importance of applying diverse metrics to describe the built environment and urban forest structure at fine spatial scales. Vulnerability assessment and analysis at much broader spatial and temporal scales, using a spatially-explicit assessment approach and ecological modelling of alternative management and disturbance scenarios, is further investigated. This latter research emphasizes the importance of aligning scales of management with ecosystem function and the long-term influence of management intervention on ecological conditions. The multiple scales of investigation and methodological approaches developed in this study provide complementary opportunities to synthesize and apply existing theory in novel settings while also generating new theories pertaining to the processes of urban ecosystem change and decline. The intention of this study is to contribute to the \nunderstanding of urban forest ecosystems and their vulnerability,  while also providing practical knowledge and tools for the sustainable management of this resource.</jats:p>"

This report proposes a multi-period procurement problem with a flexible quantity risk-sharing supply contract that may provide a prevention against exchange rate (FX) fluctuations for international traders. The buyer assumed to be encountered with a random price modelled by a regime-switching geometric Brownian motion and also random demand. The proposed risk sharing supply contract model helps to compensate supplier for the depreciating market price and also helps buyer when purchase price increases. According to the author’s knowledge, none of the studies in the literature considers a\nrisk-sharing supply contract with random demand and random price while modelling the exchange rates by regime switching approach. Multi-period lattice model is developed for valuation of risk-sharing supply contract. The problem is solved with using dynamic programming approach.

The model also finds the optimum order size and optimum number of shipments. The buyer screens the products received from the vendor to find the defective items. The holding costs of the defective items at the buyer's end is paid by the vendor. After the screening process, the defective items are shipped back to the vendor and the vendor has to carry the shipping costs of the defective items. Two scenarios may arise: where both the vendor and buyer are domestic or international, where vendor and buyer are located in two different countries. In the case of an international supply chain, exchange rate between two countries has also been considered. In current world since the business growing fast, the inventory management of any business enterprise improving their performance financially by minimizing the holding cost. The analysis shows how the percentage of defective item affects the total expected cost.

Two of the well-known trade credits that are widely used by\nbusinesses are the permissible delay in payments and price discounts. This\nthesis presents models for coordinating supply chains with both trade credits.\nThe first model investigates the effect of utilizing delay in payments in a two-level\n(manufacturer-retailer) supply chain. It modifies and analyzes three known\nmodels of different production and shipping policies to account for delays in\npayments; it then compares them and highlights the production policy that\nperformed the best with the total system cost being the performance measure.\nThe second model analyzes the coordination of a three-level (supplier-manufacturer-\nretailer) supply chain with the delay in payments. It analyzes \nnine different scenarios of permissible delay among the three players. A simulation\nstudy was performed and a thorough analysis of the results was used to identify\nthe limitations of all scenarios and to draw some managerial insights and\nfindings.\nThe third model investigates the effect of coupling permissible delay in payments\nand price discounts for coordinating a three-level. The analysis considers nine\ndifferent cases of delay-in-payments along with eight cases of price discounts\namong the three players in the supply chain, totaling seventy-two cases. The\nnumerical examples and the sensitivity analyses show that the coupling of delay-in-\npayments and price discounts maximizes the supply chain profit more than\nwhen using a single mechanism at a time.\nThe fourth model investigates a two-level supply chain by studying the effects of\nvarious scenarios for delay-in-payments when including some environmental\ncosts such as fuel and emissions from manufacturing and transportation. The\nobjective of the model is to optimize the environmental and the economic\nperformance of the supply chain.

It creates new possibilities for legal connections between states and individuals, including overlapping memberships and belonging from a distance. In this chapter, I argue that the legitimisation of dual citizenship leads to the adoption of strategic policies on the part of states (the “supply” side) as well as on the part of eligible individuals (the “demand” side). Numerous states use dual citizenship policies to select new citizens that do not live on their territory and do not intend to relocate or give up their original citizenship. These include the descendants of emigrants (e.g. Italian descendants in South America who are now offered Italian citizenship), cross-border co-ethnics (such as ethnic Hungarians in the countries surrounding Hungary), as well as millionaires from developing countries who can now – for a hefty sum – acquire citizenship from a country where they have never set foot. From the perspective of eligible individuals, such schemes offer opportunities to strategically expand their scope of rights and opportunities by acquiring a second citizenship that is ranked higher in the global hierarchy of citizenship value. The expected benefits may include global travel freedom, an insurance policy and broader economic opportunities. These developments, which impact both states and individuals, weaken the traditional association between citizenship and national identity.</jats:p>",

The purpose of our work was to assess, examine and supervise the current technical status, network role and future sustainability of railway substations in order to choose a set of substations to be reconstructed in the given cost framework. We completed traction energy simulations to explore the weak points of the traction energy supply system and to provide basic data for the planning process. In our feasibility study we chose 20 of 38 substations to be reconstructed in a multi-step decision process. On Level 1 we assessed professional and operational aspects with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) regarding capacity shortages, energy efficiency, existence of remote control, characteristics of environmental protection and climate resilience, age-related failures, unit performance and network assessment. Based on the multi-criteria analysis we formed feasible technological options. To quantify and compare their long-term financial effects, on Level 2 we have chosen cost-effectiveness analysis methodology considering investment cost and the operational costs incurred during the estimated evaluation period. After option analysis we conducted cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Savings at social level are considered benefits in economic terms. As the type of the intervention did not fit the relevant CBA guide, we had to elaborate a special methodology for the assessment of economic benefits of the project. After all we have set up three project packages (6 or 9 or 20 substations) depending on available funding sources – and all three project packages can be regarded as economically viable and eligible for financing and implementation.</jats:p>",

Recent work suggests reproductive tissues are highly\nvulnerable to water stress in perennial plants where reproductive\nsacrifice could preserve plant survival. However, most crop species are\nannuals where such a strategy would theoretically reduce fitness. We\nexamined the reproductive strategy in tomato (Solanum lycopersium) to\ndetermine whether water supply to fruits was prioritized above\nvegetative tissues during drought. Using optical methods, we map xylem\ncavitation and tissue shrinkage in vegetative and reproductive organs\nduring dehydration to determine the priority of water flow under acute\nimposed water stress. Stems and peduncles of tomato showed significantly\ngreater resistance to xylem cavitation than vegetative tissues. This\nprioritization of reproductive water supply enabled tomato fruit to\ncontinue expanding during acute water stress, utilising xylem water made\navailable by capacitance and cavitation of vegetative tissues. Here,\ntomato plants prioritize water supply to reproductive tissues,\nmaintaining fruit development in drought conditions. These results\nemphasize the critical role of water transport in shaping tomato life\nhistory and suggest a broad relevance of hydraulic prioritization in\nplant ecology.</jats:p>"

An integrated solution framework has been developed: where (1) a product life cycle model is formed to characterize stochastic demands in the market, (2) an exchange rate lattice is presented to account for exchange rate uncertainty, (3) a supply chain model is created to utilize stochastic demands and exchange rates to maximize the firm's after tax profit, and (4) are cursive dynamic programming algorithm is developed to calculate the expected after tax profit. The model allows for capacity flexibility and factors in adjustment costs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">There are basicly two views answering the question of how money is created: according to  the exogenous money hypothesis of economic theory central banks have full control over the money stock in the markets and other policy instruments; whereas endogenous money theory postulates money is created by credit demand of economic actors . Demand for credits in turn arises from the production process, triggered by changes in production costs, basicly from a rise in nominal wages. This paper aims to analyze whether money supply creation is endogenous in the Turkish money markets during the period 2011-2018 by use of monthly data, for which cointegration between money supply (money base, M1, M2)  and credits is tested by Johansen method and VECM is estimated for  specifying direction of causality between the variables. Further, Toda Yamamoto test is applied to check robustness of the results obtained from VECM long and short run causality. Results point at relation from credits to money supply;  i.e. money is endogenous and demand determined, also that credits extended by banks form basis of the money supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nİktisadi teoride paranın nasıl yaratıldığı sorusuna iki farklı cevap bulunmaktadır: dışsal para hipotezine göre merkez bankalarının para stoku ve diğer para politikası araçları üzerinde tam kontrolü bulunmaktayken; içsel para teorisine göre para ekonomik aktörlerin kredi talebi üzerine yaratılmaktadır. İçsel para teorisine göre para talebi firma üretim süreçlerinden ortaya çıkmakta, üretim maliyetlerindeki artış ve daha çok da nominal ücretlerdeki artıştan kaynaklanmaktadır. Bu çalışmada aylık veri kullanılarak 2011-2018 arasındaki dönemde para arzının içselliği araştırılmakta; para arzı M1, M2 ile krediler arasında Johansen  koentegrasyon ilişkisi olup olmadığı sınanarak, VECM analizi ile değişkenler arasındaki nedensellik sorgulanmaktadır. Buna ilave olarak VECM kısa ve uzun dönem nedensellik testi sonuçlarının güçlü olup olmadığı Toda Yamamoto testiyle sınanmaktadır. Elde edilen sonuçlara gore nedensellik kredilerden para arzına doğrudur; para arzı içsel olup talep tarafından belirlenmekte, banka kredileri para arzının temelini oluşturmaktadır.</jats:p>"

Considering consumer preferences for green product functional attributes and environmental attributes, we construct a two-stage supply chain. The optimal behaviour pricing of green products is solved, and the effects of green sensitivity and the cost coefficient on the optimal price are analysed. We find that when consumers are less sensitive to the greenness, with the increase in the market share of green products, green product retailers will increase the loyalty price. An increase in greenness sensitivity and a decrease in the greenness cost coefficient will increase the wholesale prices and retail prices of green products. Consumer attention to the greenness and a decrease in the initial market share of green products will be conducive to promoting the greenness and improving the environment. Consumers' emphasis on the greenness of their products will lead to higher profits for the manufacturers and retailers of green products.</jats:p>"

We show that, for the extensive margin elasticity, two biases conspire to systematically produce large positive estimates when the elasticity is in fact zero. Among 723 estimates in 36 studies, the mean reported elasticity is 0.5. One half of that number is due to publication bias: larger estimates are reported preferentially. The other half is due to identification bias: studies with less exogenous time variation in wages report larger elasticities. Net of the biases, the literature implies a zero mean elasticity and, with 95% confidence, is inconsistent with calibrations above 0.25. To derive these results we collect 23 variables that reflect the context in which the elasticity was obtained, use nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, and employ Bayesian and frequentist model averaging to address model uncertainty.</p>"

The supply chain of any firm is generally dependent on six driving factors out of which three are functional (information, inventory, and facilities) and 3 are logistic (sourcing, pricing, and transportation). The risk causing factors in supply chains consists of various levels of sub-factors under them. Say for instance, under supply risk, the sub-factors can be poor logistics at supplier end, poor material quality etc., under demand risk, the sub-factors can be inaccurate demand forecasting, fluctuating demand, bullwhip effect, and under logistics risk, the sub-factors can be poor transportation network, shorter lead time, stock outs. Through this study, we observe to find the effect of these factors in the supply chain. We use Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) technique to prioritize the various types of risk into zones namely high, medium and low risk factors. Also, we use the Best Worst Method (BWM), a multi-criteria decision-making technique to find out the overall weightings of different risk factors. The combination of these methods can help an organization to prioritize various risk factors and proposing a proper risk mitigation strategy leading to increase in overall supply chain efficiency and responsiveness.</jats:p>"

In this paper, based on a questionnaire conducted among government departments, enterprises and residents and on stakeholder theory, under the theory model of Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) around the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) including society, economy and environment, the ecological compensation, sewage treatment and reservoir operation management in Xichuan County were investigated and studied. A total of 289 answers were recovered. Through the survey, it is found that: stakeholders include 15 township governments in Xichuan County, water conservancy project supporting facilities construction companies, ecological industry companies, water supply companies and other enterprises, as well as agricultural growers, rural farmers and non-agricultural residents in Xichuan County. Government stakeholders pursue the development of the overall operation of the project, while enterprises and residents pursue the development of individual economy. Finally, this paper lists the relevant indexes, which provide the opportunity for behavior evolution analysis and sustainable research of the project.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a review of an emerging field in the food processing sector, referring to efficient and safe food supply chains, ’from farm to fork’, as enabled by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The field is of great significance from economic, food safety and public health points of views. The paper focuses on effective food production, food maintenance energy management and food retail packaging labeling control, using recent advances in machine learning. Appropriate deep neural architectures are adopted and used for this purpose, including Fully Convolutional Networks, Long Short-Term Memories and Recurrent Neural Networks, Auto-Encoders and Attention mechanisms, Latent Variable extraction and clustering, as well as Domain Adaptation. Three experimental studies are presented, illustrating the ability of these AI methodologies to produce state-of-the-art performance in the whole food supply chain. In particular, these concern: (i) predicting plant growth and tomato yield in greenhouses, thus matching food production to market needs and reducing food waste or food unavailability; (ii) optimizing energy consumption across large networks of food retail refrigeration systems, through optimal selection of systems that can be shut-down and through prediction of the respective food de-freezing times, during peaks of power demand load; (iii) optical recognition and verification of food consumption expiry date in automatic inspection of retail packaged food, thus ensuring safety of food and people’s health.</jats:p>"

It measures the elasticities of shipping costs for bulk carriers and container ships. Using regression, it derives the functions of the daily and unit costs of shipping with respect to the size of dry bulk carriers and container ships. The estimated daily and unit cost elasticities and cost models reveal significant but diversified impacts of vessel size on dry bulk and container shipping cost and its components, other operating capital, and fuel costs. Findings: Dry bulk carriers and containership size mean elasticities of daily operating costs estimates respectively: total operating costs 0.291 and 0.552, other operating cost (labor cost included) 0.238 and 0.328, capital costs 0.329 and 0.765, fuel costs 0.289 and 0.462; dry bulker and container ship unit shipping mean elasticity respectively: full operating costs (−0.751) and (−0.553), other operating cost (−0.804) and (−0.782), capital costs (−0.713) and (−0.399), fuel costs (–0.757) and (−0.702). This research provides an insight into the impact of technology and the way the services are provided (irregular versus regular) on shipping cost and energy savings. The cost models can be used for estimating the savings in shipping costs resulting from handling larger vessels in seaports.</jats:p>"

This paper considers an interconnected three-stage forward and reverse supply chain, which provides green products to a green conscious market. The procurement of raw materials is responsible for the first stage of the supply chain; The second manufacturing/remanufacturing process; And the third stage of marketing the products to the consumer. There is one supplier, one manufacturer, and one retailer in the forward supply chain. New raw materials are used in this supply chain, and new products are manufactured and sold. There is also a market for remanufactured products and in this market, the same retailer also sells. There is one collector, one remanufacturer, and one retailer in the reverse supply chain. From consumers the collector collects used products; processes and sells the remanufacturable ones to the remanufacturer. If the raw materials supplied by the collector are not adequate to satisfy the demand, the remanufacturer purchases the remainder from the seller. Both the manufacturer and the remanufacturer use green manufacturing processes. Two models namely centralized model and decentralized model are formulated. A numerical example is taken to illustrate the two model and perform sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

This study aims to identify the effects of supply chain management (SCM) on the operational performance of SMEs in Korea, specifically considering organizational competencies. To achieve this, an empirical survey was conducted on 300 Korean manufacturing SMEs that had introduced SCM strategies. The relationships between the variables were analyzed through structural equation modeling. These show that specific SCM strategies and organizational competencies had a significant effect on overall business performance. Furthermore, the SCM strategies had a significant effect on SME organizational competencies. Additionally, we analyzed the mediating effect of organizational competencies on the effect of SCM strategy on overall business performance. We found that organizational competence mediated the effect of SCM strategy on operational performance, but not on financial performance. The study shows that introducing SCM strategies directly improves business performance and is closely related to competencies such as research and development, technology commercialization, production capability, and marketing capabilities. Consequently, a combination of SCM strategies and organizational competencies can generate sustainable overall business performance among SMEs.</jats:p>"

Countries’ economic planning has to evolve using current knowledge of international business and global supply chains—areas that dominate commerce in the world today. Linking the foreign trade approach and the supply chain approach for the model development allows structured planning of the insertion of a country’s companies into global supply chains and the reorientation of export sectors towards more sustainable benefits. The research demonstrates the possibility of applying and adapting knowledge from supply chain models to develop a model of global supply chain management supported by computerized tools designed from the perspective of suppliers. The modeling and planning of the coffee export chain in Peru illustrates this potential. The paper proposes the integration of two knowledge areas, international trade and supply chain management, to form a new field of interest. Knowledge in both areas is solid, but its integration across the two fields is not. Although there are several studies on this topic, very little has been achieved in terms of the creation of a reference model and even less in terms of the development of computerized support for adequate strategic and tactical planning.</jats:p>"

It is the main characteristic in the process of their analysis, design and calculation. The work is devoted to solving the scientific-applied problem of increasing the efficiency of the signalized intersection at one level by choosing a rational method of determining saturation flows for these characteristics of traffic flows, geometric parameters of the intersection and infrastructure in its area. The subject of the study is the influence of the main characteristics of the traffic flow, parameters and infrastructure of the intersection on the saturation flow value. Goal. The aim of the work is the analysis of the influence of the main characteristics of the traffic flow, parameters and infrastructure of the intersection on the saturation flow value. Methodology. The calculation of the control regime at the intersection is based on determining the relation between the traffic intensity of vehicles at the intersection and the saturation flow value, which changes under the influence of a number of factors. Analytical calculation of the saturation flow value is based on using of correction factors that take into account the influence of these factors. Results. The methods of determination of saturation flows are analyzed out in the work; performed a comparative analysis of the definition of ideal saturation flows by different methods; a comparative analysis of the determination of the saturation flow correction coefficients for the parameters that have an effect on it were performed; the estimation of discrepancy at calculations of coefficients of correction of saturation flows by various methods is done; the list of coefficients which need to be considered at definition of their influence on a saturation flow is refined. Originality. In oppose to classical and other approaches to determining the saturation flow, the method recommended by the American \"Highway Capacity Manual\" takes into account more parameters of influence. It is proposed to use this method for the saturation flow calculation, but with an updated list of coefficients that must be taken into account in the calculations. Practical value. The results of the work can be used in the practice of improving the efficiency of signalized intersections in sections of the urban road network, as well as in further research on this topic.</jats:p>"

This paper characterizes solutions, which are applied in supply systems, and describes a PSS in a TTD from a main source and a standby one. This enables determining the dependencies denoting the probabilities of the system staying in full ability state, safety threat state, and safety unreliability state. A quality analysis of the PSS in TTD was conducted, and the indicator value of the supply continuity quality was evaluated. This indicator allows the demonstration of continuity quality of power supply (CQoPS) dependency on many quality dimensions, not just reliability. An example demonstrates the calculation of CQoPS factor for both the main and the standby power supply, employing three observations, each influencing the quality. The presented considerations in the field of quality and reliability-exploitation modeling of a PSS can be applied as well in other public utility facilities (including those classified as critical infrastructure). The character of functions performed by critical infrastructure facilities demands an operating continuity of these systems at an appropriate level. The co-first authors of the article once again address the issue of determining CQoPS factor, this time on the basis of modeling using mathematical evidence. TTD is an example in this article, because the presented methods can be used in any kind of system, especially in the power source of critical systems.</jats:p>"

To study the impact of supply chain members’ altruistic behavior and consumers’ reference low-carbon effect on their joint emission reduction decisions and profits, we build optimization models under four decision scenarios, in which we solve the manufacturer’s and the retailer’s optimal emission reduction strategies and other equilibrium solutions by differential game theory. We obtain some findings. First, consumers' reference low-carbon effect will harm the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer, discourage the manufacturer's enthusiasm to reduce emissions and retailer's enthusiasm for low-carbon publicity. Second, the altruistic behavior of the manufacturer and the retailer can not only weaken the negative impact of the reference low-carbon effect, but also promote both parties to actively reduce emissions, help achieve Pareto improvement of their own profits and utilities, and obtain additional social welfare. Third, the cost-sharing contract can encourage the manufacturer to increase emission reduction investment without affecting the retailer’s low-carbon publicity investment, and can achieve a Pareto improvement of both parties’ profits and utilities. In addition, the cost-sharing ratio is only proportional to the marginal profits and altruistic intensity of both parties, and is not affected by the reference low-carbon effect. Meanwhile, the cost-sharing ratio will decrease as the manufacturer’s marginal profit and altruistic intensity increase, and will increase as the retailer’s marginal profit and altruistic intensity increase. In particular, when the retailer is completely altruistic, the cost-sharing contract can achieve perfect coordination of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As climate change progresses, the Arctic Ocean creates opportunities for new resource development and navigation routes. Such economic opportunities are attractive, but carry with them an increased risk of accidents and oil spills. Existing methods of emergency response face enormous challenges in the Arctic because of its lack of transportation infrastructure and support services. Cargo airships offer a practical solution. Many airship designs are proposed that can carry over 30 tons, travel long distances at 150 km per hour, and land close to the emergency site. However, it is difficult to justify the economics of having enough capacity waiting and available to be marshaled in response to infrequent events. One solution is to develop a synergy with a new civilian cargo airship industry that can serve the regular transport needs of remote communities and mining operations. Through contingency contracts with these civilian operations, the Government of Canada could stretch its budgets and have access to the latest airship models and trained crews at locations across the Arctic. This paper gives valuable insight into the development of cargo airships. Advances in technology that make cargo airships a practical option in the 21st century are reviewed, and five competing airship designs are discussed. A case study of an existing rare earth mine proposal is used to illustrate the cost comparison of roads versus airships that could provide contingency services.</jats:p>"

Based on this increased awareness, an integrated green closed-loop supply chain has been developed, which integrates the forward supply chain and reverse supply chain. The reverse supply chain follows the same path as the forward supply chain in the reverse direction to recycle used products. Due to the uncertain quality of used products, not all products can be selected for recycling and reproduction, as the reduced yield might decrease the overall net income in the supply chain. The study develops an evaluation model to consider government subsidy, used product recycling rate, and quality of the used products to explore their impacts on the entire system. The results show that when the reproducibility rate of used raw materials decreases, the net income would also decrease accordingly. Furthermore, when government subsidy increases, the net income of the supply chain also increases accordingly. Similarly, when the recycling rate of used products increases, the net income also increases. As government subsidy affects the net income more than the recycling rate of used products, this research concludes that government subsidy is a key factor in the green closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>"

The flow pattern of different TSW cases was analyzed, and the discharge coefficient curves were provided. Furthermore, to accurately study the hydrodynamics of the tested weirs, 3D numerical simulations were performed using the FLOW-3D software. The results showed that inserting a vertical wall at the upstream of the outlet keys (C-TSW type) has a negligible effect on the hydraulic performance of the PKW. A maximum increase of 16% occurred in the discharge coefficient of the B-TSW in comparison to the PKW, and up to a head to height ratio (Ht/p) of 0.45, the effect of the vertical wall on increasing the performance of the B-TSW was maintained.

The goal of this research is to design and optimize a multi-period, multi-product, multi-echelon, and multi-customer Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network for a mobile phone network considering different types of product returns. Commercial, end of life, and end-of-use returns are well-known in practice. In this research, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming formulation with stochastic demand and return is proposed to maximize the total profit in the mobile phone CLSC network, alongside maximizing the weights of eligible suppliers which are estimated based on a fuzzy method for efficient supplier selection and order allocation. Chance-constraint programming is applied in order to deal with the stochastic demand and return. Moreover, distance method and εε-constraint technique are employed to solve the proposed multi-objective problem. The application of the proposed mathematical model is illustrated in Toronto, Canada using real maps.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to determine the bacteriological quality of groundwater that serves bottled water production. A total of 73 groundwater boreholes were sampled and analyzed for the required bacteriological parameters. The analysis was performed in accordance to ISO standards methods. There should be no bacteria growth for each bacteriological parameter to qualify the groundwater of good bacteriological quality. The bacteriological analysis highlighted that 37 of the 73 groundwater samples (51%) were of poor bacteriological quality while 36 of them (49%) were of good bacteriological quality. Total coliforms and E. coli were the major sources of contamination with respectively 35 and 24 contaminated samples, followed in order by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci and sulfite reducing anaerobic bacteria spores with respectively 8, 7 and 2 contaminated samples. Bacteriological quality was strongly and negatively correlated with urbanization and/or agricultural activity parameter (r=−0.454). The performed logistic regression model showed that the presence of urbanization or agricultural activity multiplies significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.001) the risk by 7 of being a poor bacteriological quality groundwater. These findings are useful to avoid drill costs and to take the best strategy to protect groundwaters.</jats:p>",

Oleh karena itu, diperlukan penelitian yang mengkaji mengenai kehalalan daging ayam curah dalam serangkain proses suplly chain-nya dari hulu ke hilir. Penelitian ini mengambil objek yaitu daging ayam yang dijual di Pasar Baru Karawang. Adapun kesimpulan yang dapat ditarik dari penelitian ini adalah ketiga pemasok daging ayam ke pasar baru karawang secara umum berdasarkan observasi secara langsung di lapangan sudah memenuhi syarat syar’i mengenai kehalalan daging ayam dan sampai kepada konsumen akhir tidak terkontaminasi dengan barang haram/najis. Akan tetapi tetap masih diperlukan penyempurnaan sebagai yaitu perlu dipastikan kembali kehalalan bahan dari makanan, minuman, vaksin, dan vitamin yang digunakan, perlu adanya pemastian menghadap kiblat, perlu adanya pemastian bahwa ayam yang disembelih sudah betul-betul mati sebelum proses selanjutnya atau minimal menunggu 3 menit.&#x0D;\nRisiko yang dapat terjadi dikelompokkan menjadi resiko rendah, resiko sedang dan resiko tinggi. Risiko rendah yaitu daging ayam tercampur dengan bahan najis/haram dan timbangan tidak sesuai. Resiko sedang yaitu penyembelihan tidak menghadap kiblat. Sedangkan resiko tinggi yaitu ayam belum benar-benar mati karena berhubungan langsung dengan kehalalan daging ayam. Hal ini pula yang jarang disadari oleh para pemasok daging ayam mereka kebanyakan tidak memastikan benar-benar mati atau tidak menunggu setidaknya 3 menit. Oleh karena itu, dibutuhkan edukasi, standarisasi, serta kalibrasi timbangan.&#x0D;\nKata kunci  :   supply chain,  kehalalan, haram, Pasar Baru Karawang&#x0D;\nOne of the products that are close to the community and always in demand for consumption is chicken. Therefore, it is necessary to study the halal chicken meat in the supply chain process from upstream to downstream. This research took the object, namely chicken meat sold in Pasar Baru Karawang. The conclusions that can be drawn from this study are that the three suppliers of chicken meat to the Karawang new market in general, based on direct observations in the field, have met the syar'i requirements regarding the halalness of chicken meat and until the end consumers are not contaminated with haram / najis goods. However, improvements are still needed as it is necessary to re-confirm the halalness of the ingredients of the food, drinks, vaccines, and vitamins used, it is necessary to ensure facing the Qibla, it is necessary to ensure that the slaughtered chickens have really died before the next process or at least wait 3 minute.&#x0D;\nThe risks that can occur are grouped into low risk, medium risk and high risk. Low risk, namely the chicken meat is mixed with unclean / haram ingredients and the scale is not suitable. The risk is moderate, namely the slaughter does not face the Qibla. Meanwhile, the high risk is that the chicken has not really died because it is directly related to the halal meat of the chicken. It is also something that is rarely realized by most of their chicken meat suppliers who do not ensure that they are really dead or do not wait at least 3 minutes. Therefore, it takes education, standardization, and scale calibration.&#x0D;\n Keyword : supply chain,  halal, haram, Pasar Baru Karawang (traditional market)</jats:p>"

However, the impact usually varies significantly across household types. Whilst there is a substantial amount of literature on the labour supply effects of tax reforms and in-work benefits, the impact of changes in social assistance benefits has received less attention. This paper analyses labour supply responses to changes in social assistance. We show that labour supply elasticities vary substantially across gender and household type. Women exhibit higher labour supply elasticities, both on the intensive and the extensive margins. Additionally, labour supply elasticities are typically higher for singles and for households with children. Using these results, we analyse the impact of the Austrian reform proposal “Neue Sozialhilfe” (New Social Assistance), which was introduced in 2019 and substantially cut social assistance benefits for migrants and families with children. The overall effects of the reform are especially strong for men and migrants. Migrants and couples with children, that is, the groups hardest hit by the reform’s social assistance reductions, show the strongest labour supply reactions to the New Social Assistance. Furthermore, we show that overall, the reform is expected to have a positive, but small, effect on the intensive margin of labour supply.</jats:p>",

This study proposes an analytical model to investigate the dual-channel green supply chain decisions of a retailer and a competitive supplier; the latter suffers from unreliable production yield. The retailer’s environmental responsibility is considered as a two-echelon supply chain in which the retailer promotes the green product in their marketplace through green marketing. This problem is analyzed and modeled under three available channel strategies, considered in the order in which channel selections are made: a single online channel strategy, a single retail channel strategy, and a dual-channel strategy. The results show that the wholesale price of the manufacturer and the green-marketing effect of the retailer increase with the improvement in the level of the green production technology. Interestingly, the result reveals that a retailer’s expected profit is unimodal in the production technology level under the dual-channel strategy, which suggests that the retailer may not be incentivized to encourage the manufacturer to improve its production technology once a threshold has been reached. Further, we develop the channel selection: the retailer is strictly better off in the single retail channel scenario than that in the dual-channel scenario; however, while the unreliable supplier is better off in the single online channel scenario than that in the single retail channel scenario, its best option is still the dual-channel strategy. Additionally, numerical results illustrate that the expected profits of supply chain parties decrease with the improvement in customer acceptance of the online channel.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the diversity of raw material sources is a serious concern. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the risks of solid wood product supplies. The dispersion and concentration of supply sources are the measures. The SWI and HHI models are used to calculate the six major imported solid wood products. The results show that from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2018, wood chips and pellets with the highest average annual import quantity had the lowest average performance in SWI and with the highest average HHI value, which indicates that wood chips and pellets are the riskiest items among the 6 solid wood products. While the sawn wood has the highest average SWI value and the lowest HHI value, it offers the smallest supply risk.</jats:p>"

Composing data from previous descriptions, archaeological excavations and random discoveries during construction work created a database. This database currently has 144 tanks of 1 to 4 levels, from 6 m3 to 2,500 m3. In particular, they have identified 27 tanks on 1 level, 50 tanks on 2 levels, 49 tanks on 3 levels, 9 tanks on 4 levels and 9 tanks whose exact morphology is unknown to us. The examples of reservoir technologies and management practices given in this work may be of some importance to the sustainability of water resources for the present and the future. Reservoirs have been used to store both rainwater and spring and river water to meet the needs of seasonal variations. The tanks range from simple to large underground structures. Then, a comparison is made with the water management systems in the wider Mediterranean region and especially in Istanbul, where there is such infrastructure.</jats:p>",

Due to the distribution of the production system as well as to the presence of a large number of remote suppliers of materials, raw materials and components supply plans are threatened. Supply disruptions in their turn may affect the plans of the main production resulting in possible fines, economic losses, and disruptions in supply of manufactured articles to the markets of high-tech and science-intensive products. To study threats and vulnerabilities in supply logistics the risk-oriented approach that considers potential threats using past statistics and expert assessments has been proposed. The objective of the paper is to develop a risk-oriented method to study the existing threats and assess their impact on the vulnerabilities of the logistics chains of the distributed production system. Due to the complexity of the problematic logistics task, the study is conducted in three different stages: development of the method to simulate the risks in long supply chains; identification of possible bottlenecks in the transport system of supply logistics; threat simulation and vulnerability analysis in supply logistics. To model the risks, an agent model is used, in which the accumulation of risks is carried out by passing orders in the transport system. To simulate bottlenecks, a simulation event model is used, in which large queues that occur in the transport system are analyzed. A stochastic simulation model is used to model threats and vulnerabilities. The new scientific results are risk-oriented method of long logistics supply chains simulation; simulation of supply logistics threats and vulnerabilities. Mathematical methods used: risk theory; simulation event modeling; agent modeling; queuing theory. The proposed approach as a set of developed simulation models should be used to plan the supply of developing production.</jats:p>"

The implementation of sustainable supply chain resilience has recently played a vital role, owing to its substantial factors which influence the business continuity. The influence of sustainable supply chain resilience is greatly varying, to embrace companies’ efficiency during a crisis such as COVID-19. In the present study, systematic model-based integration of sustainable supply chain resilience is developed, which can benefit the companies’ profile of work normalcy during the pandemic situation by managing the associated risks. Different variable factors are considered, to assess their impact on the sustainable supply chain. These factors are environmental regulatory system, customer response monitoring system, environmental uncertainty, interoperability and operational integration. Data were collected by questionnaire and analyzed with statistical tools of interpretation. This research is concluded with the assessment that there is a significant correlation between technological integration and the resilient supply chain’s sustainability. The business organizations need to understand the current COVID-19 situation, the supply chain issues, and their impact on the other factors. Business organizations need to implement international quality standards through the use of technology. This study highlights the critical components of technological advancement, which can uplift the existing standards.

The wellbeing of the human population and their environs is directly linked to the level of water service delivery. The service level of three main categories of water supply systems was assessed across 6 locations in Ogun State, Southwest Nigeria. The water supply systems categories included: self-supply systems (hand-dug wells and boreholes), communal water supply systems (boreholes only), and public water systems. Five service level indicators (access, quality, management, cost, and reliability) were assessed using structured questionnaires. Questionnaire administration targeted water supply system users and owners in two categories: owners/resident users and non-resident users. Results show that owners/resident users restricted the access of non-resident users to water assets, which expectedly dipped access to adequate service level for non-resident users. When post-abstraction treatment was practiced by water users, the use of sodium hypochlorite solutions (Water Guard®) was the most prominent option of treatment. Management and costs (cleaning, maintenance and repair) of water supply systems are borne by owners/resident users; costs borne by non-resident users is only from purchase of water. Reliability of water supply systems is hampered by geology and climatic seasonal variations as some water supply systems dried up during the off-rain season. Coverage area and number of public water supply systems needs to be improved to reduce reliance of water users on questionable alternative sources that can expose water users to water-related diseases and prevent restricted access to water supply sources.</jats:p>"

The strategic nature of SCM and the importance of considering this discipline in such a way is emphasized, arguing that is a narrow view thinking of scm as directly related to logistics as its main focus, since this logistic vision creates a bias that limits the real scope of SCM.

But despite all these scientific methods, some of the businesses are still coordinating traditionally. Media supply chain, and above all its components, the cinema industry has been coordinated traditionally for years. One of the boldest problems in the media supply chain is wage determination in the cinema industry, which in it the actor’s efficiency or deficiency is not considered. It means the success or failure of the movie is nothing to do with the actor’s revenue. To address this problem, this article proposes a novel revenue-sharing coordination contract that benefits from text mining and the best-worst method. We aim to determine a fair share of profit or loss of a movie for each of its actors based on their performance and efficiency on the success or failure of the project. One of the latest movies is considered as a case study, and its lead actor’s wage for this movie is determined under this contract. The sentiment analysis technique investigated the viewers’ opinions about the movie and the actor’s performance. Since the reviewers mainly are the people who have no expertise in cinematography, they cannot discern the influence of other participants on the actor’s performance. So the proposed method used experts’ opinions through the fuzzy DEMATEL method to consider the overlapping effect besides enhancing the validity of the reviewers’ opinions.</jats:p>"

The problem can be solved by the Manning equation but the parameters present uncertainties as to their true-real values. Especially, the Manning n roughness coefficient, which is an empirically derived coefficient, presents quite a high variation for different substrates. With the help of fuzzy logic and utilizing a fuzzy transformation method, it is possible to include the uncertainties of the problem in the calculation process. In this case, it is feasible to estimate the discharge, putting more emphasis on different uncertainty rates of the Manning roughness coefficient, while the rest of the parameters remain with constant or zero uncertainty level. By taking different α-cut levels, it is shown that the methodology gives realistic and reliable results, presenting with great accuracy the variations of the water discharge for trapezoidal open channels. In this way, a possible underestimation or overestimation of the actual physical condition is avoided, by helping engineers and researchers to obtain a more comprehensive view of the real physical conditions, and thus make better management plans.</jats:p>",

However, the traditional control system cannot adapt to the change of raw water’s quality, the set value of streaming current can only be adjusted manually. In order to solve this problem, an intelligent control system for flocculation of water supply is designed based on the neural network and fuzzy control to adjust the set value of streaming current and tune the control parameters automatically in this study. The experimental results show that the proposed intelligent control system can control the flocculant dosage accurately. It is of great significance to improve the quality of water supply and reduce the cost of water treatment.</jats:p>",

With the Modelica Buildings library expanding its capabilities to district scale, this study is one of the first to demonstrate how the open-source models can be used for detailed energy and control analysis of a DC plant.  For a real-world case study, we developed and calibrated high-fidelity models for a DC system central plant at a college campus in Colorado, USA, and we optimized the condenser water supply temperature (CWST) setpoint for a DC plant across multiple time horizons using the Optimization library in Dymola. Results indicate that annual CWST optimization saves 4.7% annual plant energy, with less than 1% of additional energy savings gained through daily optimization. This confirms previous studies' findings that high frequency CWST optimizations are not necessary for the studied system.</p>"

The approach is intended to be used in the conceptual design phase of an Arctic OSV. It includes (a) a parametric design model of an Arctic OSV, (b) performance assessment models for independently operating and icebreaker-assisted Arctic OSVs, and (c) a novel adaptation of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm for multi-objective optimization of Arctic OSVs. To demonstrate the feasibility and viability of the proposed optimization approach, a series of case studies covering a wide range of operating scenarios are carried out. The results of the case studies indicate that the consideration of icebreaker assistance significantly extends the feasible design space of Arctic OSVs, enabling solutions with improved energy- and cost-efficiency. The results further indicate that the optimal amount of icebreaking assistance and optimal vessel speed differs for different vessels, highlighting the motivation for holistic design optimization. The applied adaptation of the ABC algorithm proved to be well suited and efficient for the multi-objective optimization problem considered.</jats:p>"

This investigation propagates through the use of nanoscale absorbers (montmorillonite) for sturdy desalination because of their excellent photo thermal conversion of nanoparticles. The solar absorber was dispersed in sea water in liquid type rather than fixed or floating type. Nanoparticles of chemical composition were employed by the researchers from starting to the present day, which includes carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide, etc., Inspired by nature and keeping in mind an eco-friendly technique, here we considered montmorillonite clay nanoparticles of natural origin. The experiment was conducted for an operational period of 14 days with a yield of 5.33–6.45 kg/m2/day with an evaporation rate of 0.70, 1.42 and 4.47 kg/m2.hr under 1-, 2- and 4-sun irradiance. The clean water output parameters was validated with WHO standards to satisfy potable water characteristics. The water characteristics before desalination for turbidity, pH, and Cl–, Na+ and TDS were found to be 48.50, 8.7, and 18,400, 12,120, 20,400 mg/L respectively; after desalination they were found to be 0.30, 6.65, 12, 4.5 and 52 mg/L respectively.

Green credit policy (GCP) is one of the significant preferential policies for government to encourage enterprises to vigorously develop green projects. We are interested in the impact of the central bank’s GCP on the profits and optimal strategies of manufacturers and suppliers related to POF (purchase order financing). Specifically, we build a game-theoretical model consisting of a manufacturer, a bank and a green supplier and a non-green supplier. Furthermore, the optimal strategies of the manufacturer and suppliers when the bank or the government sets a carbon emission cap on suppliers are discussed. We come to some important conclusions about a GCP that promotes the development of green projects since it brings higher profits to both the manufacturer and suppliers than the lack of a GCP. Furthermore, the higher the production cost, the better the effect of a GCP. Under the carbon emission restrictions required by the government, the effect of GCP is weakened and the profits of the manufacturer and the suppliers are reduced to zero due to the gradually increasing delivery risks as production costs increase.</jats:p>"

The technological scheme of the reactor-cementator is given. The influence of various factors on the process of copper cementation – pH, concentration and ratio of iron and copper in the reaction mixture, contact time were studied. The time at which the greatest rate of change of residual copper concentration is observed is determined. The influence of the pH value of the cementation process was also determined. As a result of the obtained data, it is concluded that the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution affects the course of the contact exchange reaction. The higher the acidity of the solution, the higher the recovery rate of copper. Promising directions for the creation of closed water circulation systems in the process of copper wastewater treatment are outlined.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The industry generally consists of a supply chain system. The main constituents of any supply chain system are suppliers, manufacturers, distribution centers, and retailers. The system configuration can be straight chain, branched, cyclic, or a combination of all. An analytical model is needed to study system behavior as a result of the dynamics of its constituents. Modeling a multi-channel section becomes quite a challenging job in this regard. A method of modeling the multi-channel section will be discussed in this paper by adopting multi-server queues. As is well known, in a multi-server queue, there is a branching point at which the flow of entities begins to spread across several parallel servers. In the modeling perspective of this paper, the branching point is in the buffer (finished good warehouse in the factory, i.e., the focal echelon). That is the end of the waiting line from which the entity specifically moves to one of the servers, or in this context; it is called a channel. In this paper, the number of channels can be any, generalizable, can be more than two. Hence, the subsystem studied includes a factory, finished product warehouse, and several distribution centers. The factory produces by the mechanism of, where and r are stopping point and production restarting point, respectively. Production stops when the quantity of finished product in the warehouse reaches units and will restart the production when the quantity drops to the same or lower than units. The model is developed under Markovian assumptions by considering the quantities of production rates, the number of distribution centers (channels), travel time from factories to each distribution center, delivery lot size, and the time between the arrival of orders from distribution centers. The system under study is seen as a case of two echelons, namely factories and distribution channels. The numerical model obtained is applied to one case example with certain conditions. Comparisons with discrete simulation results give relatively small and acceptable differences. So, in the future, this model can complement the overall modeling of the supply chain system, a multi-echelon system with multi-channel distribution.</jats:p>"

The inference of how the manufacturer improves reduction of carbon emission, how the new retailer improves service and how the traditional retailer improves promotion through effective coordination mechanism is analyzed. The research results show that the cost sharing will make supply chain have a Pareto improvement to a considerable degree. The greater the marginal profit of the supplier is, the worse the coordination effect of the cooperative emission reduction mode will be. The comparative advantage of the cooperative service coordination and cooperative promotion coordination depends on the influence of service and promotion on channel demand. The greater the impact of reduction of carbon emission on channel demand is, the higher its rate should be shared by the channel retailer. The profit of supply chain is positively related to a new retailing channel preference; this indicates that opening up the ‘new retailing’ is beneficial for improving supply chain profits.</jats:p>",

However, a major barrier to achieving sustainable supply chains is the uncertainty associated with supply chain activities. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the different resilience capabilities that SFSCs possess and the potential role of digital technologies as enablers of SFSCs’ resilience. Using a case study research approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted in two SFSCs in Mexico. Collected data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings suggest that SFSCs possess the supply chain resilience (SC resilience) capabilities investigated here, namely flexibility, redundancy, collaboration, visibility and agility. A key finding is the importance of low-cost digital technologies (including freeware and social media) that can support flexibility, collaboration, visibility and agility. These findings raise important implications for SFSCs actors exploring opportunities to improve their collective resilience. This study expands the current literature by proposing a conceptual framework that summarizes a wide variety of strategies that support SC resilience capabilities in the context of SFSCs.</jats:p>"

To deal with these changes, it is necessary to develop a resilience capacity that allows for the establishment of different patterns of relationships through a new management model. The application of circularity principles implies a radical change in stakeholder relations, breaking with the “end-of-life” concept existing in linear economies. Furthermore, circular economy can ensure resilience in supply chains, and it can be considered as a tool in uncertain environments. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse the association between the customer–supplier relationships with circular supply chains based on the intellectual capital-based view theory. External capital is a crucial factor for organisations, and it helps with building remarkable capabilities for the whole supply chain due to collaboration and cooperation. This research contributes with a systematic revision of the literature regarding circular supply chains and customer–supplier external capital, providing an exploratory model. Establishing a closer and effective relationship with customers and suppliers supposes a differentiating value and competitive advantages. Actors involved in the supply chain are essential in the implementation of circularity in organisations for reducing waste production and returning resources to the production cycle. Therefore, circular networks related to customers’ behaviour, sustainable supplier election and IT tools play a key factor in improving resilience in supply chains.</jats:p>"

Solar distillation (thermal process) represents a sustainable solution to water shortages and energy crisis in the world especially in the Middle East and North Africa region. The technique is based on a evaporation–condensation process via heat delivery through a cylindrical parabolic collector to a thermal energy storage, in the form of sand integrated into the solar still, to maximize water production efficiencies. It is a technically feasible and operational method. Results suggest that the additional solar collector flux has a direct impact on the increase in average sand and seawater temperature particularly over the period between 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. Seawater temperature increases by &amp;gt;26.6%. The energy stored quantity delivered for the distiller basin grows proportionality with the sand temperature, which is depending directly for the solar collector absorber temperature. The difference between the both temperatures defines a decreasing rate of −19%. The daily water production by the hybrid solar distiller is 6.5 l/day, it represents an increase of +91% compared to the traditional concrete solar still production (3.4 l/day), for the same geometry and meteorological conditions.</jats:p>",

Twenty critical challenges to SHSCM are identified using a comprehensive literature review, and three strategies were developed. The challenges and strategies were verified using expert input. The challenges were evaluated using the neutrosophic analytic hierarchical process (AHP) method. The neutrosophic TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive multicriteria decision making) method was then used to select the best strategy. The findings reveal that facility location problems, short lead times for emergency supplies, spread of rumors, rapid emergence of new clusters, and doubt concerning the available remedy are five critical challenges in SHSCM during COVID-19. Public–private partnerships are identified as the best strategy in SHSCM. Finally, this paper discusses the implications to sustainable development goals in the post-COVID-19 pandemic era.</jats:p>"

Well-known theoretical and empirical hydraulic dependences, relevant reference data, in particular, discharge and velocity characteristics, local resistance coefficients were used in this article. Necessary information on selection of water disposal wells is given. The proposed method of calculation the parameters of water disposal channels can be used in different fluid flow modes: both pressureless and pressure, steady and unsteady. It is recommended for use in the water disposal networks designing, regardless of the pipelines material.</jats:p>"

This study evaluated and analyzed the sustainable performance of China’s inter-provincial power supply chain systems (PSCSs), and developed policy recommendations for further developing China’s power industry based on the research results. For PSCSs with internal subsystems, this study first developed a non-radial two-stage model, and proposed steps to solve the model; then, this study applied the proposed model to empirically analyze China’s inter-provincial PSCSs. The empirical analysis yielded the following key research findings. Firstly, for the study period, China’s power industry had a low overall performance, and PSCS performance varied significantly across different regions. Secondly, the average meta-frontier efficiency (ME) of PSCSs in high-income regions was the highest; the average ME of PSCSs in middle-income regions was the lowest. This is consistent with the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Thirdly, this study found that the PSCSs had effective management and technical systems in Qinghai and Guangdong. The PSCSs in other regions need improvements to mitigate either inadequate management, inadequate technology, or both.</jats:p>"

Changes in the feed gas composition due to the preferred incorporation of certain components into the hydrate phase and an inadequate gas supply is often assumed to be the cause of coexisting hydrate phases. This could also be the case for the gas hydrate system in Qilian Mountain permafrost (QMP), which is mainly controlled by pores and fractures with complex gas compositions. This study is dedicated to the experimental investigations on the formation process of mixed gas hydrates based on the reservoir conditions in QMP. Hydrates were synthesized from water and a gas mixture under different gas supply conditions to study the effects on the hydrate formation process. In situ Raman spectroscopic measurements and microscopic observations were applied to record changes in both gas and hydrate phase over the whole formation process. The results demonstrated the effects of gas flow on the composition of the resulting hydrate phase, indicating a competitive enclathration of guest molecules into the hydrate lattice depending on their properties. Another observation was that despite significant changes in the gas composition, no coexisting hydrate phases were formed.</jats:p>"

This paper provides a reliability model to enhance the WDN for a water pumping station in Saudi Arabia. The paper utilizes the fault tree analysis (FTA) reliability tool to mitigate water supply stoppages. In the case under study, the pump station utilizes two groundwater aquifers in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia to meet the raw water demand through a water distribution network (28 km-long pipelines). Data has been gathered from the maintenance history to estimate the system reliability based on the loss of water by which each component of the system is assessed on its contribution to the overall system reliability and water supply. The findings revealed that system availability can be improved by adding a new pump in the booster station which further enhances the availability of the system to 99.99% and saves the WDN more than 740,974.60 gallons of water loss per year. It is hoped that the paper's recommendations will enhance reliability practices in similar water network stations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For foreseen natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes or floods), the uncertainties faced in relief logistics primarily stem from evacuation activities. We present a strategic planning problem to supply relief items by considering uncertainties in disaster location, intensity, duration, and evacuee compliance. To ensure time- and cost-effectiveness in relief distribution, we develop a robust optimization model to determine centralized supply locations, and supply quantities for different transportation modes in a five-tier network. In doing so, we consider the interaction between evacuation and supply-side activities and capture the inherent uncertainties using a combination of event and box uncertainty representations. Our model provides a decision maker with the flexibility of including or excluding the time dependency of evacuation-related uncertainties. Accordingly, it suggests a threshold time window for relief distribution, beyond which either the system cost increases or the benefits of early distribution diminish. Although the model primarily aids a policymaker in strategic preparedness, its tactical variant can aid the efficient distribution. We devise an enhanced Benders decomposition-based efficient solution method to solve realistic-size problems. In a case study using geographic information system data, we highlight the complex dynamics among various system components and discuss the resulting time-cost trade-offs that also influence the network structure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is one of the most widely consumed vegetable crops and the second-largest cultivated vegetable crop in the world after potato. Tomato is one of the most important protective foods because of its special nutritive value. Tomatoes grown in the country are consumed fresh in raw or cooked form or processed into tomato paste, juice, sauce, ketchup, soup and, pickles. Less than one percent of India’s tomato production is processed. On the other hand, the demand in India for processed tomato products has been growing at an annual rate of about 30 per cent over the last few years. India is the World's largest producer of many fruits and vegetables but there still exists a huge gap between per capita demand and supply due to enormous wastage during post-harvest storage, handling, and the absence of an optimum supply chain. The price fluctuations in tomatoes are very high and often farmers are forced to sell at prices that will not cover even the labor cost of picking the tomatoes. A well-developed tomato processing industry will reduce wastages as well as secure better prices for tomatoes. The present study entitled “Supply chain analysis of raw and value-added products of tomatoes in Telangana” was intended to assess supply chain analysis for raw and processed tomato products along with the constraints faced by each stake holder in the supply chain. Vikarabad district was purposively selected for the study, two mandals four villages each were selected from each village, data was collected from 10 farmers. Hence the total data was collected from 80 farmers. The data was also collected from commission agents, wholesalers/ traders, and retailers. From the tomato processing firms operating in around Hyderabad, three firms were selected to collect data regarding their products and marketing supply chain. The collected data was analyzed.&#x0D;\nThe results of the study identified three channels of raw tomato marketing, namely: channel-I Farmer- Commission Agent-Trader-Retailer-consumer, Channel-II Famer – Commission agent - Retailer-consumer and Channel-III Farmer- Retailer-consumer. Two channels of processed tomato products were identified, namely: Channel-I, Manufacturing unit- wholesalers-consumers and Channel-II, Manufacturing unit- consumers.&#x0D;\nThe producer share in the consumer rupee was highest in the Channel -III because of lesser number intermediaries. The marketing efficiency is highest for the channel – III fallowed by channel – II and channel -I. In case of processed industries are mostly preferring channel -II. The major constraints to the farmers identified were high price fluctuations, high cost of fertilizers and pesticides. The major constraints to the intermediaries identified were high price fluctuations and transportation costs and problems. The major problems identified were lack of quality raw materials suitable for processing, and price fluctuations of raw materials for the processing units, while the major problems faced by wholesalers identified were timely availability and quality related issues.</jats:p>"

The accuracy of leakage detection using transient-based methods depends on several factors. This study investigated the sensitivity of location and size of leaks in simple polyethylene transmission pipelines to dynamic parameters, flow regime, sample size, spatial-step increment, and leak size and location. For this purpose, a hydraulic transient solver was first developed to take into account the dynamic effects of unsteady friction, viscoelasticity of the pipe wall, and the leak. The leakage was assumed to function with a quasi-normal distribution around its real location to reduce problem dimensionality and unnecessary computations. This approach was evaluated based on experimental transient data in which leaks were simulated in different sizes and locations. Results revealed that the hydraulic transient model that includes only viscoelasticity effects could pinpoint leakage characteristics. The sample size evaluation indicated that half and a single period of the pressure signal are sufficient to determine the leakage location and size in simple viscoelastic transmission pipelines, respectively. The optimal ratio of the spatial step to pipe length (Δx/L) was 0.025.</jats:p>",

In this study, based on Lower Upper Bound Estimation (LUBE), hybrid artificial intelligence methods were used for point and interval prediction of monthly RSF. Two states based on stations' own data and upstream stations' data were considered for RSF modeling of the Housatonic River during the period of 1941–2018. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) methods were used for enhancing the streamflow point forecasting accuracy. Interval Prediction (PI) was applied for tolerating increased uncertainty. Results showed that in state 1, the error criterion value for the superior model decreased from 0.155 to 0.082 and 0.09 for the EEMD- and VMD-based models, respectively. Generally, hybrid models increased the modeling accuracy between 20% and 40%. Via the integrated approaches, the upstream stations' data was successfully used for streamflow prediction of stations without data. In this state, the PI coverage probability values for the VMD-based model were approximately 12% higher than the single model. Generally, the VMD-based model led to more desirable results due to having higher PI coverage probability and lower mean PI width values.</jats:p>",

Water utilities and regional suppliers are responsible for their own water supply plans and adaptation strategies, which are developed largely by a relatively small group of technical specialists (internal and contracted). Water supply planning is prescribed by the state water governance system and local community planning processes. The degree of engagement of large coastal communities and water utilities and regional water suppliers in Florida with climate change research is generally high. Climate change-induced impacts to water supplies and demands over the common 20-year planning horizon are likely to be small relative to increases in demand caused by projected on-going population growth and normal climatic variation. Water utilities in Florida have been incidentally moving toward more climate-resilient supplies (e.g., brackish groundwater desalination) due to the unavailability of additional permittable, inexpensive fresh groundwater rather than climate change concerns. Climate change will narrow the alternatives for future water-supply development.</jats:p>",

This study aims to assess the current water supply service levels and water supply inequalities of WUSAs in terms of water consumption, supply hours, and customer satisfaction. Among the three types of water service providers, WUSAs offered the best performance in terms of their low non-revenue water (NRW) rates and production costs, high bill collection rates, and long supply hours. During the COVID-19 lockdown, water consumption increased, but bill payment notably decreased, possibly due to restricted movement and hesitation by customers to make payments. The multiple-year water consumption variations illustrated the uneven water consumption behavior of customers. Despite the variation in water supply hours, Lorenz curves, Gini coefficients (G), and water consumption analysis depicted low inequalities (G ≈ 0.20–0.28) and adequate water consumption among WUSAs even in 2019–2020. In the three WUSAs, more than 90%, 74%, and 38% of customers consumed water above the basic, medium, and high levels, respectively. Thus, maintaining high service levels of WUSAs is instrumental in achieving Goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nepal.</jats:p>"

Based on land cover data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1990, 2005, and 2015, this paper estimated the supply capacity of ecosystem services using the value equivalent method, calculated the demand for ecosystem services using population density and economic density, established an ecosystem risk index based on the idea of an ecosystem service matrix to reveal the spatio-temporal pattern of the supply and demand of ecosystem services in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and identified the potential ecological risk areas arising from the imbalance between supply and demand. The results showed that: (1) In terms of the spatio-temporal pattern of land use change, the desert area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau decreased the most with 26,238.9 km2, and other types of land use increased, of which construction land increased by 131.7%; (2) In terms of the supply and demand of ecosystem services, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was mainly dominated by low-level surplus areas, accounting for 64.0%, and the deficit in some areas has worsened significantly; and (3) In terms of division pattern of ecological risk areas, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau presented characteristics of high risk in the east and low risk in the west. The high-risk area accounted for 1.1%, mainly distributed in the Huangshui Valley and the “One River and Two Tributaries” (Yarlung Zangbo River, Lhasa River, Nianchu River). The research results can provide reference for ecosystem management and policy formulation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and have important significance for realizing the coupling and coordinated development of human–land relationship in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.</jats:p>"

It based on the consistent use of physico-chemical treatment methods and allows to remove organic matter, suspended solids from wastewater to the requirements of regulations and divert treated wastewater into the municipal sewerage system. Wastewater generated during the processing of soapstocks, in terms of pollutants exceeds the standards set for wastewater when discharged into urban drainage systems. Therefore, before removal to municipal treatment facilities, they must be treated locally using physico-chemical and biological methods. In the phase-dispersed state, such wastewater is a stable emulsion. The presence of phospholipids, which are stabilizers of emulsions, complicates the phase separation of wastewater components. In addition, wastewater contains suspended particles, colloidal and dissolved substances of organic and inorganic nature. It was found that the highest values ​​of the effect of removal of organic matter by COD - 78% at the initial COD - 40000 mg / dm3, the effect of reducing the concentration of suspended solids - 72.5% at the initial 6300 mg / dm3 were obtained in the process of coagulation using Al2 (SO4)3 and subsequent flotation with air supply through porous materials. The technological scheme of local treatment of industrial wastewater is proposed. It includes the following main processes: averaging, aeration, alkalinization, coagulation, flotation, oxidation, filtration, adsorption. Experimental studies have shown the effectiveness of treatment of soapstocks in oil production using the proposed technology with bringing the quality of treated wastewater to current sanitary requirements, which allowed to recommend the technology of treatment of soapstocks for successful use in industrial enterprises of the oil industry.</jats:p>"

A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model in Ansys Fluent® was established to simulate the flow over stepped spillways, using a volume of fluid model (VOF) and Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence model (SST k-ω). The model was first validated by comparisons of velocity profiles at step niches and water depth at step edges with existing measurements acquired by the bubble image velocimetry (BIV) technique and an ultrasonic sensor, in a 0.5-m wide stepped spillway physical model. The SST k-ω model gave good results for velocity and water depth, and the numerical predictions of the vorticity in the skimming and recirculating flows were qualitatively adequate. The model was used to analyse the flow regime for six different stepped spillway widths. The careful examination of flow patterns at the different stepped spillway widths showed that the alternating skimming flow appears for the stepped spillways wider than 0.35 m due to the asymmetrical distribution of vorticity patches that are generated in the step cavity. These vorticity patches are of uniform size and shape when the spillway width is less than 0.35 m, which does not produce an alternating skimming flow. However, for wider stepped spillways, the vorticity increases, and an alternating skimming flow appears closer to the crest.</jats:p>",

This research has been conducted to determine how native farmers support different policy options to reduce agricultural water consumption. Structural equations modeling was used to construct structures derived from the ‘theory of planned behavior’. For each policy option, a separate model is proposed and the modeling data supports the view that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have a positive and significant effect on the intention. Attitudes, and perceived behavioral control, have the strongest effect on intention. Significantly, intention also have a positive impact on farmers' behavior. According to the results of the present research, the variance explained is over 85% for intentions and the variance explained for the farmers' behavior on water policy options is above 45% which is a result that indicates the high ability of the ‘theory of planned behavior’ in predicting policies achievement on saving agricultural water resources. It is argued that the field of psychology, and in particular environmental psychology, can play an important role in understanding more of the drivers to reduce agricultural water consumption and contribute to the social research program for water policy.</jats:p>",

These are important realistic characteristics that are rarely considered. The simulation is embedded into a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)-based optimization scheme to identify the Pareto solutions for which the ESC total profit is maximized and the disequilibrium among its agent’s profits is minimized, while uncertainty is accounted for by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. An oil and gas ESC model with five layers is considered to show the proposed framework and its capability of enabling efficient management of the ESC sustained production while considering the agent’s uncertain interactions and the dynamically changing structure.</jats:p>"

A method of controlling the supply of cryogenic fuel to a gas turbine engine is to pump its liquid phase, followed by its separation into two parts and controlling the flow rate of each part. Heated the first part of the cryogenic fuel to a gaseous state in the heat exchanger, mixing it with the second part and feeding the resulting mixture of cryogenic fuel into the combustion chamber. The first part of the cryogenic fuel flow rate is passed through the heat exchanger Gta = Gsm  [Ср_sm  (Тfp + T)  il] / [ig  il], where Gsm is the consumption of cryogenic fuel at the outlet of the mixer, Ср_sm is the isobaric heat capacity of cryogenic fuel at the outlet from the mixer, Тfp is the temperature of the phase transition of cryogenic fuel from liquid to gas at a pressure in the mixer, T is the temperature of the gas mixture of cryogenic fuel at the outlet of the mixer above the temperature of the phase transition, il is the enthalpy of the first part of the liquid phase of cryogenic fuel at the input ode to the heat exchanger and the second part of the liquid phase of the cryogenic fuel, which is fed to the second entrance to the mixer, ig is the enthalpy of the gaseous phase of the cryogenic fuel at the outlet of the heat exchanger, at which it is fed to the first entrance to the mixer. Moreover, ig  Ср_sm  (Тfp + T)  il and Gsm = Gta + Gl, where Gl is the flow rate of the second part of the liquid phase of the cryogenic fuel, which is fed to the second input to the mixer. When the pressure of the cryogenic fuel in the mixer is below the critical value Pkr, the temperature Тfp of the phase transition from liquid to gas of the cryogenic fuel is taken equal to the temperature Тnas on the saturation line of the cryogenic fuel at the corresponding pressure in the mixer. The excess of the temperature of the cryogenic fuel mixture over the phase transition temperature after mixing the gas and liquid phases at the mixer outlet sets T = 60  ... 170  for cryogenic methane and T = 150  ... 260  for cryogenic hydrogen. Due to the gasification of a part of the cryogenic fuel consumption in the heat exchanger and subsequent mixing of this part with the second liquid part of the cryogenic fuel in the mixer, the freezing of the outer surface of the heat exchanger in all operating modes of the power plant is reduced. Due to the reduction of external freezing of the channels of the heat exchanger, the heat transfer efficiency is increased in it. By reducing the dimensions of the heat exchanger, the hydraulic losses in the gas-dynamic path of the power plant are reduced, which, in turn, increases its efficiency. By lowering the temperature of the gas phase of the cryogenic fuel at the inlet to the combustion chamber, the temperature of the exhaust gases at its outlet is reduced, which, in turn, increased the reliability of the gas turbine of the power plant. The method of operation of the cryogenic fuel supply system is intended for ground-based power plants and vehicles. The work is intended for scientists and designers in the field of cryogenic fuels for internal combustion engines.</jats:p>"

Water leaks are the main problem in the management of drinking water networks, so a drinking water network must be reliable and sustainable to meet the needs of subscribers. The modeling of a network allows, among other things, to determine distribution strategies in order to guarantee continuous quality of service. The EPANET modeling software, developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, enables the hydraulic and quality behavior of a water distribution network to be simulated on the basis of its parameters. Our work consists of simulating an existing network in the new city of Guelma in order to check all the necessary elements of the network, namely pressure, speed, flow and water quality. The results obtained verified that the pressure at all junctions and the flow rates with their velocities at all mains is sufficiently feasible to supply adequate water to the network in the study area. These results will help to better understand the pipeline network in the Study Area and allow the Study Area to be studied in the future.</jats:p>"

A confessional system of governance has hindered development of the sector. Laws and regulations have been developed erratically with many superseding others without the superseded laws being erased from the registry. This created a chaotic regulatory and legal environment with overlapping jurisdictions and no clear accountability mechanisms. The period before the onset of the civil war in 1975 witnessed significant progress of both infrastructure and laws and regulations related to the management of the water sector. The civil war destroyed the water sector infrastructure and emptied all regulatory control of the resources. The period of reconstruction between 1990 and 1999 witnessed the promulgation of ambitious reconstruction plans for the water sector with funding reliant on borrowing from local and external debtors. Post 1999, government reforms started creeping into the system but were often donor driven and still suffered from the same mistakes of laws overlain on top of existing laws without erasing the older material. Critically, the management of the sector is not inclusive and the beneficiaries of water services are often not heard and ignored.</jats:p>",

When reducing the vapor phase of propane-butane in the pressure regulators of the above-ground closet gas control points, water falls out in free form and at subzero temperatures of ice and crystalline hydrates formation. In order to prevent this, methods are employed in the form of applying thermal insulation and heating the inner space of the cabinet, which significantly increases the cost of the structure and the reduction process. As an alternative, the authors set forth an underground reduction chamber. The article provides a scientific rationale for the use of this underground chamber in the practice of gas supply to consumers. Results. The configuration of the reduction chamber has been substantiated, mathematical modeling of the heat exchange processes of the chamber with the surrounding soil massif has been performed, the thickness of the thermal insulation of the ascending section of the vapor phase and the reduction chamber has been selected, and the process of reduction of the vapor phase in pressure regulators has been simulated. Conclusions. According to the results of the studies, the cylindrical shape is optimal for the reduction chamber, which provides the minimum total surface of the enclosing structures. The implementation of the economic and mathematical model made it possible to recommend the optimal thicknesses of the thermal insulation of the chamber and the ascending section of the vapor phase, enabling the process of throttling of the liquefied petroleum gas vapor phase in pressure regulators without the release of free water and the formation of ice and hydrate plugs.</jats:p>",

Inclusion of counterfeiting products and opaqueness of the system urge renovation in this sector. Technological advancement can now reshape the infrastructure of the supply chain for the future. Here, a conceptual framework utilizing blockchain and smart contract to monitor the overall oil supply chain is suggested. Blockchain is a used to monitor and support the security building of a decentralized type supply chain. The Internet of Things (IoT) sensors open a broader window to track the process and attributes in real time. A methodology to support reverse traceability for each participant of the supply chain is constructed. Implementation of smart contracts is also shown with detailed analysis.

Pharmacy staff with more positive beliefs about their professional competency to supply and monitor antibiotic use were more likely to supply antibiotics without a prescription for common cold (Adj.OR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01–1.15; p = 0.032), wound infections (Adj. OR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.00–1.13; p = 0.059), and UTI (Adj.OR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.99–1.15; p = 0.097). Pharmacy staff who believed in the effectiveness of antibiotics against common infections were more likely to supply antibiotics for common infections. Supply of antibiotics without a prescription was associated with staff’s beliefs about antibiotics’ effectiveness and their professional competency. Our findings could be used to strengthen regulatory strategies to improve practice.</jats:p>"

The uncertainty of supply chain demand and bullwhip effect is a challenge in the supply chain. Data fusion can effectively reduce the uncertainty of demand and the amplification effect. In this study, a new conceptual model was established on the traditional supply chain based on data fusion.

Comparing standards of the EU and Ukraine concerning total phosphorous in wastewater, effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), drinking water, and consumer detergents, the paper shows how the difference of legislation makes legal the eutrophication of water bodies in Ukraine. As demonstrated, the current Ukrainian regulations do not oblige strictly municipal WWTPs to remove phosphorus compounds from wastewater, although the EU has rigid requirements therein. Instead, Ukraine forbids discharging wastewater with more than 5 mg/l of total phosphorous into the municipal sewage system, though many local regulations in EU-countries allow higher values, e.g. such cities of Germany as Berlin, Hannover, and Düsseldorf permit up to 50 mg/l of total phosphorous in their municipal sewage systems. This is mostly because only natural human metabolism causes up to 10 mg/l of total phosphorous in wastewater, so, to reduce total phosphorous to 5 mg/l, every domestic house would oblige to have its own WWTP. All this leads to the situation where water companies in Ukraine, instead of modernization their 30-40 years old WWTPs, fine their clients due to the steep requirements. For instance, the municipal water company Khmelnitskvodokanal won the case No 20/4901 against the company “Khmelnitsk plant of experimental production” that discharged into the municipal sewage system in the town of Khmelnitsk its wastewater with 17.42 mg/l phosphates (or 5.68 mg/l as total phosphorous), usual concentration for the EU. Moreover, phosphonates in detergents also contribute to the eutrophication. Another problem is that, due to the lack of trained qualified staff, the amount of total phosphorous determined in different laboratories in the same sample of water may differ by several times.</jats:p>"

After a job is released, it can be first manufactured on one machine in a factory. It is noted that there is a given constraint of unavailability on the machine. There may be some job interrupted by the determinate unavailability interval during its process of manufacturing, and the interrupted job must be reprocessed after the machine becomes available again. In order to take full advantage of the unlimited capacity of a vehicle, the completed jobs can be delivered in batches to the customer. Our goal is to minimize the maximum arrival time of the vehicle when the vehicle returns to the factory after it has delivered the last completed job to the customer. The lower bound is proved when we construct a series of intractable instances. And an on-line algorithm for the problem is then developed and the competitive analysis is performed.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on the top-level management of different manufacturing companies located in Pakistan. A total of 34 manufacturing industries were selected using a cluster sampling technique. The data collected from 125 top-level managers were analyzed using a partial least square method, while the moderation analysis was conducted by using variance analysis. First, supply chain ambidexterity positively influences green supply chain management. However, networking capabilities do not moderate the relationship between supply chain ambidexterity and green supply chain management. This research was restricted to manufacturing industries in Pakistan because the research intended to gain an understanding of the several supply chain ambidexterity practices in Pakistani businesses and wanted to determine how these practices are associated with various parts of GSCM. Further studies can be extended to examine the impact in other industrial settings and countries. The findings of this research study will allow the managers to identify the right mix of exploitation and exploration techniques required to manage the supply chain in a green and sustainable manner.</jats:p>"

In this regard, based on the flow and sediment particles properties various models were developed and tested using some available experimental data sets. The obtained results showed that the applied methods had high efficiency in the Manning coefficient modeling. It was found that both flow and sediment properties were effective in modeling process. Sensitivity analysis proved that the Reynolds number plays a key role in the modeling of channel resistance with dune bedform and Froude number and the ratio of the hydraulic radius to the median grain diameter play key roles in the modeling of channel resistance with ripple bedform. Furthermore, for assessing the best-applied model dependability, uncertainty analysis was performed and obtained results showed an allowable degree of uncertainty for the MLP-FFA model in roughness coefficient modeling.</jats:p>",

According to N:P, water nutrient types can be divided into N limited, P limited and N + P limited classes. Phytoplankton biomass is represented by chlorophyll a, which is one of the sensitive indicators of water eutrophication. Comprehensively tracing non-point pollution from terrestrial exogenous pollutants (fertilizer, soil release, anthropogenic discharge) to water nutrients that happen in reservoir bays is of great significance. This paper identified the dominant environmental variables and nutrients' limited types of reservoir bays at storage and discharge periods, and constructed a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to explore the impacts of terrestrial exogenous pollutants. Results showed that in the storage period, water contamination mainly came from residential discharge and soil endogenous release, and the total contribution rate reached 61%. In the discharge period, with the increase of rainfall–runoff erosion, the explanatory ability of land use, topography and landscape pattern to water quality increased, up to 58%. The dominant nutrient limited types of reservoir bays were P limited (35%–47%) and N + P limited (35%–59%) at both stages, N limited situations were less than 20% and generally appeared in the storage period. Whatever the nutrient limited type was, phosphorus always had a higher effect on phytoplankton biomass. In the N limited situation, nitrogen came mainly from soil release (total effect = 0.6) and phosphorus from fertilizer (total effect = 0.22) and soil release (total effect = 0.17). In the P limited situation, all three sources had almost high effects on nitrogen, phosphorus, and phytoplankton biomass. In the N + P limited situation, anthropogenic discharge was the main source of nutrients and the primary threat factor for phytoplankton biomass. The approaches employed in this study could be generalized to other basins and the results were significant for early warning and controlling water eutrophication.</jats:p>",

The theoretical is based on an economic hedonic price regression model; and using variables measuring host and accommodation attributes, location, booking policy, number of reviews and amenities, identifies among those what determines supply, demand and pricing.&#x0D;\nFindings: The p2p market in Latin America has a wide margin to continue growing and to configure itself as a professional market far the renta! of entire homes in the short term. There is high concentration of demand in a few accommodations. Relations between variables hint that hosts are not exploiting the full capacity to efficiently manage their accommodation prices. Ali this suggests that, in emerging markets, unlike in mature tourist destinations, the incorporation of specific elements, such as those related to equity and the distribution of added value, is pertinent in a global framework far the valuation of the social welfare generated by trade made through Airbnb.&#x0D;\nResearch limitationslimplications: The fact that the number of reviews has been used as a proxy is a limitation and adds a provisional character to our results and encourages the replication of our analysis with data on the effective occupation of the accommodation, to which we did not have access to in our case. Similarly, if possible, other smaller Latin American cities could be studied.&#x0D;\nPractica/ implications: The differences detected in price farmation in faur Latin American cities with respect to previously analyzed consolidated destinations could suggest that, in certain regions, hosts are not taking full advantage of the potential of the market, which might be an opportunity far the propasa! of programs improving the management capacity of individual owners.&#x0D;\nSocial implications: Given the inequality detected across hosts, if a policy priority is a more equalitarian distribution of income that is brought by tourist rentals to locals, a system that allocates permits according to the criteria reflected by social preferences could be tested.&#x0D;\nOriginalitylvalue: This research represents the first analysis of the peer-to-peer market far tourist accommodation that takes as a reference severa!

The analysis of the Russian normative and methodological documents, as well as research articles, has identified gaps in the development and practical implementation of hydraulic electronic models of existing water supply systems. The user guide of the software products, used to design these models, merely demonstrates the capabilities of software modules and misses the outcome of their application in certain cases. Decree No. 782 issued by the RF Government on September 5, 2013, being the document that regulates the development of electronic models of water supply systems, lists the requirements applied to software. The document, titled Construction regulations SP 31.13330.2012, has the requirements applicable to the hydraulic analysis of water supply system designs. This suggests that the Russian regulatory environment has no document that contains the basic requirements governing the development and detailing of hydraulic electronic models of water supply systems. This is an essential problem of urban utility networks, since the hydraulic electronic model is the basis for any further actions in strict accordance with which a development plan of a centralized urban water supply system is designed.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods.

We focus on a fresh produce supply chain consisting of a supplier who sells online directly and a physical store retailer. The purpose of this paper is to explore the optimal channel selection strategy considering the fresh-keeping efforts of supply chain members. Specifically, we examine the conditions under which the supply chain members should cooperate to adopt the deliver-from-store (DFS) model and further investigate the impact of consumers’ freshness sensitivity and offline hassle cost on supply chain members’ sales model options. Several important conclusions are shown as follows. First, the retailer’s profit increases with the increasing freshness sensitivity in the dual-channel model, while it decreases if consumers are sufficiently sensitive to freshness in the DFS model. Second, if adopting the DFS model, online demand and total market demand expand, and the performance of the supplier and the retailer heavily depends on the size of the commission rate. Third, there always exists a win–win situation with an appropriate range of commission rate when the consumer’s hassle cost is large. This paper contributes to the omnichannel strategy research of fresh produce supply chain management and the results provide management insights for the sustainable development of the fresh produce industry in the omnichannel retailing environment.</jats:p>"

Secondly, an improved ant colony algorithm, a hybrid algorithm combining simulated annealing algorithm with ant colony algorithm, is proposed to improve the ability of searching and jumping out of local optimum. Finally, through the simulation optimization and comparative analysis of a random numerical example, it is verified that it can effectively reduce carbon emissions in the process of distribution using collaborative optimization model of supply chain production and distribution with minimizing optimization of carbon emissions and total travel time under the time-varying network, and the effectiveness of the algorithm is also verified.</jats:p>",

Then, the optimal pricing strategies of decentralized and integrated three-echelon dual-channel supply chain are developed by applying two-stage stackelberg game theory and overall revenue maximization principle.

The resulting pandemic caused many undesirable economic and societal effects including: sudden supply shortages, economic recession, unemployment, lower consumer incomes, reduced business revenues and increased business losses. A knock-on effect of these effects is increased opportunity for illicit trade to take place and food fraud. Paradoxically the coronavirus outbreak threatened legal global distribution routes and facilitated some fraudulent trade, highlighting that fraud is opportunistic by nature. This is not unexpected as case history and published literature highlights increased fraud in the aftermath of hurricanes and other natural disasters. History teaches us that fraudulent activities in the aftermath or amid a crisis result from “at-risk” individuals e.g., those in poverty, criminals or opportunists, taking advantage from weaknesses in systems e.g., food chain, financial services etc. and as crime increases offenders are motivated to find new flaws to exploit. So far, there are no international data available to compare incidence of food fraud and adulteration during pandemic to any previous pre-pandemic period. The scope of this paper is not therefore to assert that there was a pandemic related increase in food fraud, but to indicate market and supply chain weaknesses and disturbances that may have exposed the market to a higher risk of food fraud vulnerability during the pandemic. Indication of these system weaknesses, highlights areas that might deserve special monitoring and development to reduce vulnerability in any future global crisis.</jats:p>",

I exploit a shift toward performance pay in Wisconsin induced by the enactment of Act 10, which gave school districts autonomy to redesign their compensation schemes. Following the law, half of Wisconsin school districts eliminated salary schedules and started negotiating pay with individual teachers based on performance. Comparing the quantity of teaching degrees in Wisconsin institutions before and after Act 10, and relative to those in similar states, I find that Act 10 led to a 20 percent increase in teaching degrees. This effect was entirely driven by selective universities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Background and aims\n Cotton (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L.) is an important cash fiber crop species, but its root traits related to phosphorus (P) acquisition have been poorly understood.\nMethods\n Eight cotton varieties that were released between 1950 and 2013 were grown in pots with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) at three P supply levels. Eleven root traits were measured and calculated after seven weeks of growth.\nResults\n At the lower two P levels mycorrhizal plants acquired more P and produced more biomass than non-mycorrhizal plants. At the highest P level mycorrhizal plants took up more P than non-mycorrhizal plants, but there was no difference in biomass. At the intermediate P level, root diameter was significantly positively correlated with biomass, P concentration and P content of mycorrhizal plants. More recent accessions had smaller root diameters, acquired less P and obtained less biomass, indicating (inadvertent) varietal selection for thinner roots that provided less cortical space for AMF, which increased the need for high P fertilizer.\nConclusion\n Our study provides support for the importance of the outsourcing model of nutrient acquisition in the root economics space framework. Inadvertent varietal selection in the last decades, resulting in thinner roots and a lower benefit from mycorrhizal colonization, has caused a lower productivity of cotton varieties at moderate P supply, indicating the need to rethink cotton breeding efforts in order to achieve agricultural sustainability.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction industry has dynamic supply chains with multiple suppliers usually engaged in short-term relationships. Government legislation, novel types of payment agreements, conventional information technology solutions, and supply chain management best practices have endeavoured to solve payment-related financial issues in the construction industry, which are mainly caused by the complexities of the construction supply chain. Nevertheless, payment-related issues persist as one of the key challenges in the industry. Applications of blockchain technology–a trusted, distributed data storing mechanism–along with smart contracts are gaining focus as solutions for complex interorganisational processes. A smart contract is a self-executing script that codifies a set of rules or agreements between multiple parties and runs across the blockchain network. This paper identifies the suitability of blockchain and smart contract technologies in solving payment issues in the construction industry. An expert forum of construction industry stakeholders served as the primary data collection method through a structured questionnaire. The key finding of the paper is that blockchain and smart contract powered solutions can significantly mitigate the payment and related financial issues in the construction industry, including partial payments, nonpayments, cost of finance, long payment cycle, retention, and security of payments.</jats:p>"

Subsequently, we turn to the technological level and present the digital supply chain twin as a contemporary instrument for stress testing supply chain resilience. We provide some implementation guidelines and emphasize that although resilience assessment of individual supply chains is important and critical for firms, viability analysis of intertwined supply networks and ecosystems represents a novel and impactful research perspective.

However, under a loss of power to their gate, normally‐ON junction‐field‐effect transistors are subject to a shoot‐through situation, which might be severe for their survivability. This paper presents a universal concept for an automatic and self‐powered gate driver power supply circuit for normally‐ON silicon carbide junction‐field‐effect transistors employed in high input‐impedance circuits. The power to the gate is supplied during start‐up and steady‐state operations through a mutually coupled inductor with the high input impedance inductor and by employing a typical low‐voltage, power supply circuit. The performance of the proposed automatic and self‐powered gate driver was evaluated on a DC/DC boost converter rated at 6 kW, as well as in a low‐voltage solid‐state DC circuit breaker. From experiments it is shown that using the proposed circuit, the start‐up process requires approximately 350 s, while the steady‐state switching process of the junction‐field‐effect transistor during steady‐state is also shown. Using the proposed circuit in a low‐voltage solid‐state DC breaker, a fault current of 68 A is cleared within 155 s.</jats:p>",

That said, we show that if the spread of COVID-19 is not contained, or if the ongoing pandemic were to follow a mortality pattern similar to the 1918–1920 Great Influenza pandemic, then the effects on the productive capacity would be economically significant and persist for decades.</jats:p>",

Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for restoring the previously offshored competencies. As a strategic decision, reshoring requires a balance of short- and long-term financial and non-financial considerations. This study extends the reshoring literature by exploring the underpinnings of the decision. For this purpose, the extended fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is used to study the interrelationship among the decision criteria and explore the sequential effect of the prominent criteria on reshoring decisions. Data from the UK apparel industry is used as a baseline to provide insights for other industry situations. Findings are supportive of the supply process complexity as the prominent considerations with the highest potential impact on the financial criterion. Along with supply process complexity, environmental sustainability appears to have had the highest influence on cost-efficiency as the major driver of past offshoring decisions. Overall, the research findings provide insights for deeper analysis of the manufacturing location decisions for a globalized setting.</jats:p>"

The effectiveness of the proposed DSMPC is proved through simulation results executed by the MATLAB/SIMULINK software. These\n results demonstrate its performance is superior to DSMC.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper describes how supply chain management practices are applied to the process of organ transplantation in the USA. While these practices are meant to increase the volume of organs available for transplantation, I argue that they may in fact exacerbate existing inequities of access to treatment. This is an especially pressing issue given that the number of people currently on the organ transplant waiting list far exceeds the number of organs available for transplantation, a situation referred to as the <jats:italic>organ shortage crisis</jats:italic>. A contributing factor to this disparity is the spatiotemporal distribution of transplant centres, donors, and recipients, considering that the transplant process is so time‐sensitive and time‐intensive. In response, the healthcare industry is developing systems that smooth and accelerate the procurement and delivery of organs, creating a logistical network that is standardised, data‐driven, and able to be deployed at a moment’s notice. However, these new systems draw design inspiration from those originally developed for profit‐based corporate supply chains, and thus risk employing the spatial logics of corporate supply chain management practices. Drawing from interviews with transplant and other medical professionals, I argue that applying these practices to the organ transplant network may end up privileging already‐advantaged patients, when instead, a truly equitable network must attend to the uneven landscape of transplantation in the USA. Furthermore, I argue that these technologies should not necessarily be resisted outright, but rather adopted in the interest of universal access as opposed to the maintenance of profitability.</jats:p>",

Their Online and offline channels form dual-channel supply chains. However, consumers have to wait before receiving the products they buy. The time elapsed is called delivery lead time which is an important index in consumer’s channel choice. There are few studies in this new field with studies in dual-channel supply chain being more common. In this paper, a dual-channel supply chain in which there are one manufacturer and one retailer is studied, and the retailer has an Online and an offline channel at the same time. The supply chain is considered as a retailer-dominant Stackelberg game. The delivery lead time is introduced into the operation of the supply chain. The impact of the delivery lead time on the operation of the supply chain is analyzed in this paper. The two-part tariff contract is used to coordinate the supply chain when making the decentralized decision. Finally, the optimal decisions of the supply chain members when the delivery lead time is different are shown using numerical examples.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>New energy vehicles have a significant advantage in energy saving and environmental pollution reduction in the transportation industry; however, they are still at a disadvantage in the market competition. The Chinese government has introduced lots of policy measures to promote the mass adoption of new energy vehicles (NEVs), specifically the dual credit policy. Moreover, consumer’s preferences are vital factors in their purchase decision making. This study focuses on the production decisions of automobile manufacturers under the decentralized and centralized supply chain, considering the factors of both consumer preferences and dual credit policy. First, under the centralized decision mode, higher demand drives the manufacturer to expand production; however, retailers’ profits are harmed. With the increase in consumers’ environmental preference and cognition of endurance ability, market pricing and demand increase under the decentralized decision mode. The cross effects of preferences bring more profits for manufacturers and retailers. Second, the difference in prices and profits widens, under the two decision modes, as increases in consumer preferences’ value. When consumers have higher environmental preferences, manufacturers and retailers should increase the new energy vehicle pricing. Otherwise, they should decrease pricing to increase the market penetration ratio. In addition, the impacts of one preference on the profit difference are related to the other preference.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous research has identified that climate change mitigation policies could increase demand for resources perceived as critical, because these are used in many renewable energy technologies. This study assesses how reducing the extraction and use of fossil fuels could affect the supply of (i) elements jointly produced with fossil fuels and (ii) elements jointly produced with a host that is currently mainly used in fossil fuel supply chains. Several critical resources are identified for which supply potential from current sources is likely to decline. Some of these, e.g. germanium and vanadium, have uses in low-carbon energy systems. Renewable energy transitions can thus simultaneously increase demand and reduce supply of critical elements. The problem is greatest for technology groups in which by-products are more difficult to recycle than the host. Photovoltaic cell technology stands out as one such group. Phasing out fossil fuels has the potential to reduce both the supply potential (i.e. primary flow) and recoverable resources (i.e. stock) of materials involved in such technology groups. Further studies could examine possibilities to increase recovery rates, extract jointly produced resources independently of hosts and how the geographical distribution of by-product supply sources might change if fossil fuel extraction is scaled back.</jats:p>",

The power supply-demand relationship analysis swaps. In particular, the quantitative spatial analysis of sub-regions is of great significance for optimizing the spatial layout of power swapping stations, better operation of taxis, and more efficient power swapping stations. Therefore, this paper analyzes the correlation between the ten states of taxis and the corresponding power exchange. The present analysis targets the limitations in the existing methods to analyze the power exchange supply and demand and utilizing the big data pertaining to real-time taxi operation, order-taking mode, and station-swapping operation. As per the correlations, a calculation method is established to determine the power exchange demand based on the location where the orders are received and the matching method of the power exchange supply and demand. Besides verifying the scientific nature and feasibility of the method empirically, this study also ensured its great flexibility, which allows it to adapt to more complicated social scenarios.

Although most studies on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) consider stakeholder management necessary, little is known about related stakeholder management practices in SSCM. Thus, this paper seeks to enrich the theoretical debate on stakeholder management practices in SSCM through a case study approach to bioenergy SCs in Chile. Based on 28 interviews with SC actors and representatives from the surrounding stakeholder environment, the deductive–inductive analysis reveals that stakeholder management combines different practices to discuss stakeholder concerns, address them, and evaluate the process at the SC's external and internal levels. We propose structuring these practices based on two dimensions: “practices to address stakeholder requirements” and “practices whereby stakeholders are integrated.” The analysis' results indicate that although two‐way communication with stakeholders can be seen as the core of stakeholder management, a certain willingness to learn and transform SC design is a prerequisite for true orientation toward stakeholder management in SSCM. Additionally, linkage development and local anchoring are practices used to obtain further legitimacy at the external level. Building on these findings, this study can guide practitioners in engaging with stakeholders and managing their issues across the SC.</jats:p>",

DHL transportation planners perform routing and cost-deduction tasks for many business projects. We refer to the associated planning problem as the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Regulations and Common Carriers (VRPTRCC). Unlike ordinary vehicle routing problems, which use only a single type of transportation mode, our VRPTRCC applications include make–buy decisions because some of the package deliveries are ultimately subcontracted to organizations other than DHL. Time regulation means that the problem considers not only delivery-time windows, but also layover and driving-time restrictions. Our developed Network Mode Optimization Tool (NMOT) is an ant-colony optimization (ACO)-based program that aids DHL Supply Chain transportation analysts in identifying cost savings in the ground logistic network. By using the NMOT, DHL and its customers have saved millions of dollars annually. Also, the NMOT is helping DHL to win new customers against bidding competitors and reducing estimation times from multiple weeks to hours. The results show an actual increase in profits compared with the previous process by more than 15% through a combination of new projects enabled and reduced current operational costs. The NMOT is implemented and evaluated by using data from ongoing projects. </jats:p>",

It has reference value for the inventory control of consumer goods in other countries and regions.

Firstly, through the empirical data-driven study, we show that the directed betweenness metric is more suitable than the other topological metrics in evaluating the robustness of supply chain networks. Then, we propose a rewiring algorithm based on directed betweenness to improve network robustness under the impact of disruptions.

This paper is based on the hypothesis that multi-stage coagulation results in better phosphate removal. Therefore, comparison of phosphate removal with one-step and three-step dose coagulation from the aspects of both the theoretical calculation and experimental results is investigated in this paper. The result of theoretical calculation based on the Freundlich equation shows that the final phosphate concentration from a three-step dose, i.e. 0.43 μgP/L, is ten times lower than that from a one-step dose, i.e. 4.47 μgP/L. The experimental result shows that for the three-step dose, final phosphate concentration is 1.0 μgP/L, which is lower than for the one-step dose (i.e. 4.0 μgP/L), but not as low as the theoretical calculated value (0.43 μgP/L). This discrepancy between theoretical calculation and experimental result may be the impact of equilibrium phosphate concentration, different initial Fe:P molar ratio and NOM competition between one-step dose and three-step dose coagulation. Although this discrepancy exists, the experimental results still showed that multi-stage coagulation presented better phosphate removal in seawater to concentration levels that are lower than with conventional coagulation. In other words, the problem of the high coagulant dosage in the pretreatment process while removing phosphate from seawater may be solved by application of multi-stage coagulation instead of conventional coagulation.</jats:p>",

At the same time, it provides the opportunity to obtain economic benefits. In addition, the use of combined heat and power (CHP) in the case of coalbed methane combustion enables much more efficient use of this fuel. The article analyses the possibility of electricity production using gas engines fueled with methane captured from the Budryk coal mine in Poland. The basic issue concerning the energy production from coalbed methane is the continuity of supply, which is to ensure the required amount and concentration of the gas mixture for combustion. Hence, the reliability of supply for electricity production is of key importance. The analysis included the basic characterization of both the daily and annual methane capture by the mine’s methane drainage system, as well as the development of predictive models to determine electricity production based on hourly capture and time parameters. To forecast electricity production, predictive models that are based on five parameters have been adopted. Models were prepared based on three time variables, i.e., month, day, hour, and two values from the gas drainage system-capture and concentration of the methane. For this purpose, artificial neural networks with different properties were tested. The developed models have a high value of correlation coefficient. but showed deviations concerning the very low values persisting for a short time. The study shows that electricity production forecasting is possible, but it requires data on many variables that directly affect the production capacity of the system.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we introduce an evaluation index system that consists of four dimensions, based on the characteristics of cruise ship supply and the connotation and type of cruise ship supply LSPs. The four dimensions are business level, collaborative capacity, service price, and information level, including ten subcriteria. We first establish an evaluation decision model for the interdependence and feedback relationship between the criteria by using analytic network process (ANP) for weight definition of each index; then, we use Super Decisions software to simulate the results, combine RBF neural network training and validation, and extract implicit knowledge and laws. We propose an incremental algorithm that can effectively avoid the influence of subjective factors and increase the dynamic nature of evaluation.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Old‐growth forests are optimal habitats for many woodpeckers, which are often themselves excellent indicators of deadwood‐associated biodiversity. Old‐growth forests are, however, heterogeneous ecosystems in terms of structure, composition, and deadwood characteristics, thus implying a varied use of these forests by woodpeckers. In boreal landscapes, old‐growth stands are threatened by forest harvesting; however, there is little information in regard to the consequences for biodiversity with the loss of specific types of old‐growth forests. This study aimed to assess how the black‐backed woodpecker (<jats:italic>Picoides arcticus</jats:italic>), a biodiversity indicator species associated with old‐growth forest attributes, uses different types of old‐growth forests for its foraging needs. We identified woodpecker foraging marks in 24 boreal old‐growth forest stands in eastern Canada that were dominated by black spruce (<jats:italic>Picea mariana</jats:italic>), located within the home range of eight black‐backed woodpeckers. We identified the various old‐growth forest types using a typology based on the structural attributes of old‐growth stands. We classified the sampled stands into four old‐growth forest types, corresponding to different successional stages (recent or old, relative to the onset of the old‐growth stage), composition (pure black spruce or mixed black spruce–balsam fir [<jats:italic>Abies balsamea</jats:italic>]), and productivity (ongoing paludification or not). The black‐backed woodpecker foraged in all types of old‐growth forests, but favored dense old‐growth forests that were not paludified and that showed a high temporal continuity (i.e., old‐growth dynamics probably started more than a century ago). The temporal continuity of the old‐growth state allows for the continuous supply of large, slightly decayed snags, the preferred foraging substrates of the black‐backed woodpecker. The old‐growth forest type most favored by this woodpecker is, however, also the forest type most often targeted first by logging operations. Protecting the biodiversity associated with recent deadwood in managed areas thus requires maintaining a sufficient area and density of dense, old‐growth black spruce‐dominated forests in managed areas.</jats:p>",

The minimization of the amount and cost of fuel results in increased competition and profitability of the companies as well as the reduction of environmental damage. Nowadays, these aspects are particularly important. This research aims to develop a new optimization method for road freight transport costs in order to reduce the fuel costs and determine optimal fueling stations and to calculate the optimal quantity of fuel to refill. The mathematical method developed in this research has two phases. In the first phase the optimal, most cost-effective fuel station is determined based on the potential fuel stations. The specific fuel prices differ per fuel station, and the stations are located at different distances from the main transport way. The method developed in this study supports drivers’ decision-making regarding whether to refuel at a farther but cheaper fuel station or at a nearer but more expensive fuel station based on the more economical choice. Thereafter, it is necessary to determine the optimal fuel volume, i.e., the exact volume required including a safe amount to cover stochastic incidents (e.g., road closures). This aspect of the optimization method supports drivers’ optimal decision-making regarding optimal fuel stations and how much fuel to obtain in order to reduce the fuel cost. Therefore, the application of this new method instead of the recently applied ad-hoc individual decision-making of the drivers results in significant fuel cost savings. A case study confirmed the efficiency of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

There are different coordination strategies with varying impacts on supply chain players’ profit or cost. Therefore, analyzing and comparing them could provide insights on how to decide about the choice of coordination strategy. In doing so, this study considers the coordination strategies of quantity discounts and cost-sharing.

In this work, the pump is applied for heat supply system. For this application, between the rotor and stator for cooling the canned motor there is a circulating flow, which will flow back in the pump passage with higher temperature, and bring the mixing of the liquid having different temperature between the main stream and the circulating flow. The steady state internal flow has been investigated for the pump, and the pump hydraulic performance has been compared with the experimental data. With the consideration of both mechanical energy and internal energy as the effective energy increment of the working fluid, an efficiency assessment is proposed for a canned motor pump. The proposed efficiency shows the same tendency as hydraulic efficiency, and is more understandable compared with that of the conventional method. The present results indicate that the proposed method of evaluating the efficiency of the canned motor pump can reasonably depict the energy balance inside the whole canned motor pump. Further, the introduction of circulating flow is helpful to predict the internal flow and heat transfer for the canned motor pump in numerical simulation with better accuracy. The present study is helpful for both development and application of high performance canned motor pump for various industries.</jats:p>",

This research explores relationships between GVRN and DVMT effects in developing countries (DCs), proposing that transport, supply chain and logistics management (TSCLM) incorporating agility, can enable GVRN more supportive and responsive.  In so doing, efforts for DVMT and PVTY eradication can improve, alleviating problems for individuals and systems left unprepared, bereft and vulnerable.

To heighten research and practical consciousness of interactions between GVRN, TSCLM and DVMT, especially PVTY effects, this paper engages literature review and associated conceptual model with propositions.  The conceptual model focuses on relationships and interactions, combining institutional theory and organisational learning theory incorporating networking or collaboration, presenting four propositions to sustain further exploration, management and practice.   In concluding, this researcher presents implications, and suggests future research avenues with respect to interrelationships of GVRN, TSCLM and DVMT.  The incorporation of elements to better enable GVRN relationship with DVMT beneficial to PVTY eradication in business context with COVID-19 hindrances, can assist individuals and firms to be more agile and effective in planning, implementation and output systems and to sustain advantageous outcomes.

This study address one-year eddy covariance measurements from a Robinia pseudoacacia site in Northern Greece and remote sensing products: we (a) provide a medium-term description of daily ET fluxes for a R. pseudoacacia plantation in a degraded land, (b) assess the contribution of environmental drivers (e.g. net radiation, temperature etc.) on ET and (c) evaluate a simple satellite and meteorological driven model for larger-scale applications, based on the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and the FAO approach. R. pseudoacacia was found to have quite high water consumption, especially during leaf expansion. Net radiation and soil water content had the greatest effect on ecosystem evapotranspiration. LSWI was found to be correlated with both soil water content and evapotranspiration. Its use as an index for water limitation in models leads to high accuracy when compared to ET measurements. Our results (a) provide a significant contribution to the assessment of R. pseudoacacia ecophysiology and (b) highlight the potential of accurate ecosystem ET estimation with simple modeling approaches.</jats:p>",

The calculations have been made to determine the amount of the main components of heat balance of a residential building on an example of one of standard projects being currently used in the climatic conditions of Moscow, subject to the structural characteristics of the building and its occupancy level. It is established that the actual heat output of the heating system when using the system of chilled water downstream the hot water supply heat exchangers as a heat source enables to main-tain an indoor temperature required for safe living conditions with the average daily outdoor air temperature above +2°C, the heat gain from solar radiation being moderate. It is proven that, tak-ing into account the thermal stability of the enclosing structures, the daily flow rate fluctuations do not significantly affect the stability of the temperature conditions of residential buildings or the comfort of their indoor microclimate at high outdoor air temperatures. It is noted that, in terms of reliability of heat supply of the main group of residential buildings and ensuring the life safety, the proposed arrangement is not inferior to the standard two-stage arrangement of connection of DHW heat exchangers with restriction of the total consumption of delivery water and with the associated regulation of heat supply for DHW, heating and ventilation. It is shown that the use of this arrangement involves virtually no extra costs, provides hydraulic resistance of the heating system and ensures a system-wide effect in the form of higher electricity generation at thermal consumption when using cogeneration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Impacts on nature and landscape are to be offset in accordance with different nature conservation acts in various European countries. In Germany in particular, biodiversity offsets can also be made in advance, for instance, by booking them into eco-accounts, and then allocating them to an intervention. In Baden-Württemberg, these offset measures are assessed in eco credits in accordance with the Eco Account Regulation (ÖKVO). As a means of income diversification, farmers can voluntarily implement offset measures on their land, and then generate and sell corresponding eco credits. Using a geodata-based model, the potential for implementing biodiversity offsets on arable land – areas with major eco credit potential – is analysed from an economic perspective. The Stuttgart Region is a steadily growing conurbation in south-west Germany. It serves as a study region since the loss of farmland due to large-scale construction measures and the related offsetting are a major issue here. In the analysis, the gross margins of the crops grown, their yield capacity, the associated standard land values and the costs of possible offset measures are used to determine the net present value of the arable land at parcel level. From a theoretical point of view and depending on the market price for eco credits, there is a significant potential for offset measures on arable land. Production-integrated compensation (PIC) – an extensification of arable land use – is less economically viable than the conversion of arable land into grassland or its utilisation for nature conservation. There are major spatial disparities between the city of Stuttgart and the surrounding districts. The implementation of biodiversity offsets is not economically viable at a price of less than € 1.00 per eco credit in the city of Stuttgart. By contrast, in surrounding districts, offset measures may be economically viable and implemented on a large scale for less than € 0.30. This is particularly relevant as the districts concerned are located in the same natural area as the city of Stuttgart and the eco credits can, therefore, be attributed in the event of interventions. Based on derived supply curves, decision-makers can see the scale of additional costs of biodiversity offset measures if they are implemented in a spatially restricted region. The analyses presented here can help decision-makers to more easily weigh up the desired natural characteristics and economic effects in the context of agricultural land.</jats:p>"

The present study proposes a new method to locate a leakage in WDNs using feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). For this purpose, two ANNs training cases are considered. For case 1, the ANNs are trained by average daily water demand, including small to large hypothetical leakages. In case 2, the ANNs are trained by hourly water demand and variable hourly nodal leakages over 24 hours. The training parameters are determined by EPANET2.0 hydraulic simulation software using MATLAB programming language. In both cases, first, ANNs are trained using flow rates of total pipes number. Then, sensitivity analysis is performed by hybrid ANNs for the flow rates of pipes number less than the number of the total pipes. The results of proposed hybrid ANNs indicate that if at least the flow rates of 10% of the total pipes are known (using flowmeters), then the leakage locations in both cases can be determined. Despite the complexity of case 2, because of the variations of demand and leakage over the 24-hour period, the proposed method could detect the leakage location with high accuracy.</jats:p>",

We not only evaluate differences in the level of BWE, but also differences in associated system performance. We find that systems with hard capacity constraints are effective at limiting BWE, but also produce very poor customer service levels. However, systems with low levels of volume flexibility generate similar performance as fully flexible systems but do so while also generating a lower BWE. In a multi‐echelon setting, we show that having partial volume flexibility at the upstream echelon helps in reducing order variance, with no significant drop in service level in the supply chain. This is particularly useful in those manufacturing environments which prefer stable orders for production planning without affecting the downstream customer service level. Counterintuitively, both experiments uncovered instances of irrational behavior where participants invoked flexibility in ways that did not always enhance system performance. In addition, these experiments also established enhancements in BWE and system performance through introduction of incremental volume flexibility into upstream echelon of a supply chain.</jats:p>",

The diversity of technological solutions being developed determines the efficiency of such systems, as well as the possibility of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide and exhaust components into the atmosphere. An innovative double direct injection system was used as a method for forming a mixture in the combustion chamber. The tests were carried out with the use of gasoline, ethanol, n-heptane, and n-butanol during combustion in a model test engine—the rapid compression machine (RCM). The analyzed combustion process indicators included the cylinder pressure, pressure increase rate, heat release rate, and heat release value. Optical tests of the combustion process made it possible to analyze the flame development in the observed area of the combustion chamber. The conducted research and analyses resulted in the observation that it is possible to control the excess air ratio in the direct vicinity of the spark plug just before ignition. Such possibilities occur as a result of the properties of the injected fuels, which include different amounts of air required for their stoichiometric combustion. The studies of the combustion process have shown that the combustible mixtures consisting of gasoline with another fuel are characterized by greater combustion efficiency than the mixtures composed of only a single fuel type, and that the influence of the type of fuel used is significant for the combustion process and its indicator values.</jats:p>"

In addition, sustainable SCF (SSCF) has received increasing attention, and credit risk management is important to achieve SSCF. Therefore, it is significant to identify the key factors influencing the credit risk of SMEs and construct a prediction model to promote SSCF. This study uses the lasso-logistic model to identify factors influencing the credit risk of SMEs and to predict the credit risk of SMEs. The empirical results show that (i) the key factors influencing SMEs’ credit risk include six variables—the matching degree of order data, ratio of contract enforcement, number of contract defaults, degree of business concentration, and number of administrative penalties; and (ii) the lasso-logistic model can identify the key factors influencing credit risk and have a better prediction performance.

The presence of low concentration Ca2+ (1–5 mM) inhibited the disinfection effect of EGCG but higher concentrations (6–10 mM) enhanced its effects. As Ca2+ concentration increased, the proportion of damaged bacteria also increased (15–43%). The presence of Ca2+ lessened the damaging effects of EGCG on the surface structures of E. coli but may have facilitated the entry of EGCG into the bacteria, enhancing its antibacterial efficacy. Tea polyphenols may be useful additives for the disinfection of groundwater and other raw waters containing calcium ions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Manufacturing activities of China and the U.S. account for a substantial portion of the global manufacturing output and environmental sustainability impacts. The two countries’ economies account for one third of the global economic output. Their supply chains are critically linked with and serve most of the production and service industries across the globe. Recent global trends in manufacturing necessitate a study that comparatively analyzes the two countries’ manufacturing industries from an economic and environmental perspective. In this paper, U.S. and China manufacturing industries were investigated to analyze the economic and mid and endpoint environmental impacts over a 20-year study period. The literature is abundant with single period and single country focused works, and this study contributes to the state-of-art by extending the temporal dimension to 20 years and spatial focus to the global economy (40 countries and rest of the world). In terms of the methodology, Multi-region input-output (MRIO) models were built using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) as the primary database, global input-output tables, environmental impact and economic output multipliers, and manufacturing industries’ final demand. Twenty MRIO models, each comprised of 40 major economies and the rest of the world (ROW), were built to cover the global trade linkages, which yielded the global supply chain linked cradle-to-gate life cycle inventory (LCI) of economic outputs and environmental impacts. The environmental LCI was extended to midpoint (Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP)) and endpoint (human health and ecosystem) impact dimensions by ReCipe framework. Lastly, the relative impact of a unit change in Leontief inverse, final demand and Green House Gas (GHG) emission multipliers on the total economic output and environmental impacts were explored with structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Results indicated that both countries’ manufacturing industries experienced positive economic output growth, in which China was more dominant in recent years. Both countries’ manufacturing industries’ midpoint and endpoint impacts were found to be steeply rising despite the negative growth observed in emissions intensities. The amount of GHG emissions and related midpoint (global warming and ozone depletion) and endpoint (damage to ecosystems and human life) impacts seemed to be quickly worsening in China compared to the USA.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With its quantities of groundwater, the Zagreb aquifer is an irreplaceable water-supply resource that forms the basis of the water-supply of Zagreb, the capital and largest city of the Republic of Croatia. The depth of the Zagreb aquifer system is about 100 m at the deepest part, and the two main aquifers of the aquifer system can be separated vertically by low-permeable clay deposits. In the area of the Zagreb aquifer, there are several active and reserve public water-supply sites, the largest of which are Mala Mlaka and Petruševec. The groundwater level of the Zagreb aquifer is directly related to the water levels of the Sava River, so any erosive change in the Sava riverbed decreases the groundwater levels in the aquifer. In the last 50 years, the groundwater levels in the Zagreb aquifer have decreased significantly, being most pronounced in the area of the Mala Mlaka water-supply site. This has affected the normal functioning of the public water-supply because the suction baskets of the pumps in the dug wells at the Mala Mlaka water-supply site occasionally remain partially or completely in the unsaturated aquifer zone during low groundwater levels, which reduces capacity or prevents pumping from these water-supply facilities. Immediately next to the Mala Mlaka water-supply site is the Sava-Odra Canal, which was built to protect Zagreb from flooding and into which the Sava River flows when its flow rate exceeds 2350 m3/s. This reduces the flow rate of the Sava River near Zagreb and the possibility of flooding urban areas. To prevent problems with groundwater levels at the Mala Mlaka water-supply facilities and to enable normal water-supply, even in extremely dry periods, several variants of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) are proposed here. In order to determine the optimal solution for MAR and to enable the normal functioning of one of the main sites of water-supply in the Zagreb water-supply system. Groundwater flow for the period of 2006 to 2010 was simulated for six different variants of MAR. One assumes a constant potential in the Sava-Odra Canal, three are related to recharge from the Sava-Odra Canal with different backwater levels in the infiltration facility (elevations of 114, 114.5, and 115 m a.s.l.), and two with three absorption wells upstream of the Mala Mlaka water pumping station (injection of 300 L/s each and 500 L/s each). The most favorable method to recharge artificially the Zagreb aquifer near the Mala Mlaka pumping station is achieved with an infiltration facility using an elevation of 115 m a.s.l. The use of such a facility will enable the smooth operation of the water pumping station and the possibility of increasing the pumping quantities at the Mala Mlaka water pumping station for the future development of the area.</jats:p>"

Complementary to this standard, ISO 31010 presents 31 risk tools to guide companies in this task. However, a question of practical application arises as to which tools should be used for each stage of the SCRM process. In view of the raised question, the main objective of this research is to select ISO 31010 tools that can be used in each of the stages (identify, analyze, and evaluate) of the risk management of the import and export process of an automotive industry located in Brazil. For this, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP method) was used in a case study to prioritize the tools to compose the SCRM.

Nitrate levels have increased significantly in groundwater and surface water because of the high usage of nitrogenous fertilizers, which have lethal effects on human health. Therefore, the removal of this toxic material from surface water is absolutely essential. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of three aquatic plant species, called Cyperus alternifolius, Typha latifolia, and Juncus inflexus, in the removal of nitrate from surface water. This experiment has been carried out in the laboratory scale using a hydroponics method. To do this, the water samples containing nitrate were collected and evaluated before and after the treatment to see the effects of these three plants on both the nitrate removal and the pH variation of water. The results show that all the plants can remove excessive levels of nitrate from the surface water. The comparison of the results has revealed that T. latifolia plant has higher ability to remove nitrate from water than C. alternifolius and J. inflexus. It was observed that the nitrate removal efficiency of T. latifolia was 95%, J. inflexus was 85%, and C. alternifolius was 70% after 10 days. Moreover, it was observed that the pH values of the treated water have been affected by these plants. The results of this study can be employed for further improvement of surface water quality, thereby lowering water purification time and costs as well as decreasing the nitrate-related diseases significantly.</jats:p>"

Therefore, if consumers regard the cover prices as reference points, then they may be more likely to purchase books if retail prices are lower than the cover prices. (2) Methods: We develop a Stackelberg game model for a book supply chain to investigates how reference price effects affect retailers and publisher’s pricing strategies. (3) Results: The results show that retailers will sell printed books at a discount only when the publisher’s wholesale discount rate is not high. Further, as the intensity of the reference price effects increases, (a) the lower boundary of the wholesale discount rate rises, (b) publishers’ profits increase and (c) retailers’ profits increase relative to the level of consumers’ e-books acceptance.

First, we consider a newsvendor model in which an unbiased retailer sells mass customized products. The retailer needs to make order quantity decisions before the selling season. Meanwhile, the supplier is a mass customization manufacturer and implements modular production. The supply process is uncertain, as the real quantity the retailer received is the order quantity multiplied by a random yield rate. Second, two overconfident models are considered and theorems are proposed. In the first model, the behavioral bias of overconfidence only affects the retailer’s judgment of variance of market demand. In the second model, the behavior bias of overconfidence affects not only the retailer’s cognition of the variance of market demand, but also his cognition of the expectation of market demand. In addition, the relationship between the optimal decisions and the modularity level is obtained. Finally, we provide managerial insights for the decision makers of the retailers and the manufacturers on order quantity and modularity level, respectively.</jats:p>",

To ensure the effective operation of the supply chain and to solve problems such as asymmetric information, difficult data quality assurance, and uncontrollable transportation in shipping logistics services, blockchain technology are proposed to reduce information interaction problems. In view of the factors of information sharing and customers’ sensitivity to information quality, a tripartite evolutionary game model with the shipping company, the port and the freight forwarder as the research objects was established, and the cooperative decision making of node companies was discussed before and after the application of blockchain technology. Theoretical derivation and data analysis show that ports and freight forwarder in the supply chain of shipping logistics services dominated by shipping companies are less affected by information sharing and customers’ sensitivity to information quality. With the increase in the application of blockchain technology, when customers have lower expectations for information quality, shipping companies are more willing to cooperate actively. The willingness to cooperate actively between ports and shipping companies is increasing faster than when blockchain technology is not used. Therefore, shipping companies should encourage the active use of blockchain technology to reduce the degree of information sharing between ports and freight forwarder and the influences of customer expectations on shipping companies. </jats:p>",

In part, thescientific debate has focused on the various agri-food production commercial outlets, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of both the dominant models like mass market retail, as well as emerging models like solidarity purchasing groups The present study can be classified as concerning the sustainability of agri-food supply chains. It compares five different extra virgin olive oil (evoo) supply chains in terms of the distance between the agricultural producer and end consumer, from both an economic perspective (the number of intermediaries) and a geographical one (production and consumption places). The examined aspects are 1) all the supply chain segments in which value is added to what will be the final food product purchased by the consumer, with a focus on trade and the transport cost estimated in relation to food miles; 2) the environmental impact of transport along the entire supply chain up to the distribution of evoo to the final consumer; and 3) the trade-offs between the environmental impact and economic results.The results obtained confirm some existing general evidence in the literature, such as the greater enhancement of agricultural products through short supply chains, and they emphasize as combining the value chain results with the environmental impact based on FMs, no real trade-offs, but rather trends, emerge.</jats:p>",

The conditions for the occurrence of an asynchronous mode are considered and analyzed, the main signs of the transition of an electrical network to an asynchronous mode are highlighted. On the basis of the RUSTab software package, an experiment was modeled that simulates the asynchronous mode and synchronous oscillations in the network section included in the IES of the East. The critical values of the parameters of the elements of the experimental network are estimated. The composition and parameters of the control action have been determined, which makes it possible to exclude the asynchronous mode without changing the network topology. The results obtained show the efficiency of using asynchronous mode methods based on the constructed model.</jats:p>",

However, the pandemic has exposed most Indian firms to severe supply chain disruptions (SCDs) due to undiscovered supply chain vulnerabilities. Against this background, we reviewed the existing relevant literature on SCDs and transportation disruption in general context and pandemic specific context and identified that there exists very little research on this issue especially in the context of Indian firms, and offered policy options by developing a new model of robust transport and advanced logistics system (ALS) for speedier supply chains recovery (SCR). We have utilized and analyzed the rich available literature on SCDs, transport intelligence (TI), and ALS using gray literature. The study revealed that many Indian firms have experienced major disruptions in transportation and logistics services, including impact on transportation and logistics data, time delays, and cargo cancellations due to cramped freight capacity, restricted circulation, closure of ports, and slow customs clearances. This has also impacted adversely the production and transport consignments including logistics services and led to delays and rerouting to final consumers. With the gradual removal of restrictions, firms are making concerted efforts to recover from SCDs; however, with weak applications of robust TI and ALS, the SCR is relatively very slow. This called for a review of current transport and ALS used by priority firms. Therefore, we offered a new model for addressing the SCDs using robust intelligence transportation systems and ALS.</jats:p>"

Flexibility is considered one of the key ingredients of coping strategies. However, the concept of flexibility in the context of spate irrigation systems is poorly defined. A framework to assess and operationalize flexibility in spate irrigation is lacking. In this paper we develop a conceptual framework by answering four principal questions and exploring eight flexibility characteristic features and five subfeatures. We explore the flexibility of traditional, improved and modernized spate irrigation systems to cope with high, low and untimely flood events. Flexible spate irrigation systems are highly dependent on system capabilities to deal with uncertainty and enable adjustments to change. The framework can be used as a guideline for water managers, farmers and decision makers for assessing and providing flexibility in spate irrigation systems.</jats:p>",

For validation and calibration, the results of MOC were compared with the results of EPANET software as well as experimental data. To extract experimental data, the water network of Babol Noshirvani University of Technology (NIT) with a constant head of 7 m three loops, and four inclined branches were employed. While evaluating the capabilities of the developed computer code, the results show that for all pipes, as the number of pressure fluctuations in a specific period increases, the intensity of the pressure fluctuations decreases, and the damping speed increases as well. Moreover, in inclined pipes, unlike noninclined pipes, the intensity of pressure fluctuations will increase as the elevation increases and the cross-sectional distance from the transient event increases as well. The evaluation of the effect of space steps on the accuracy of the solution to the MOC shows that in the study network, considering 20 segments for each pipe, the fastest response time with an error of less than 1% is obtained.</jats:p>"

The apparel industry has to deal with an intricate supply chain globally. While many apparel-exporting countries adopt sustainable supply chains, Bangladesh is still under the traditional supply chain umbrella. Sustainable supply chain in the apparel sector of Bangladesh is in the nascent stage yet. This study explores the challenges to the sustainable supply chain and their interrelation in the apparel sector of Bangladesh. This study incorporates thirty barriers in five categories (environmental, economic, societal, knowledge &amp; technology, and Management &amp; Stakeholders). This study is quantitative in nature, and data collection was completed two-fold. Two questionnaires were designed to garner a response. The first questionnaire was used to collect responses from experts (academic, buying-house, and industry people)to determine the most prominent barriers and shortened number of obstacles from thirty to eighteen. The second questionnaire was designed to collect responses from hundred respondents as input in the comparison matrix of DEMATEL. Finally, DEMATEL based method was applied to investigate the interrelation among the barriers. From the result of the study, according to prominence value, lack of stakeholder involvement, high costs of sustainability adoption, insignificant financial gains, lack of supply chain integration are the prime barriers to SSCM. Moreover, this study unravels the cause-effect relationship among the barriers, ten barriers fall in the cause group, and eight barriers fall in the effect group, and finally, proposed corrective action to address the cause barriers.</jats:p>"

Results. The relation “cause-effect” has been established between the paired ratio of calcium and magnesium in drinking water and incidence of urolithiasis in adults, adolescents, and children. Increased concentrations of silicon, manganese, and iron in drinking water do not affect the studied incidence level. The maximum risk of urolithiasis in the population is mainly located in the North and East of the Primorsky Territory. Conclusions. An imbalance of calcium and magnesium against a background of magnesium deficiency in tap and well water is the priority risk factor of aquatic origin for urolithiasis in the Primorsky Territory; the features of the geographical distribution of the immediate risk of urolithiasis among the population make it possible to form a scientifically based plan for the sequence of implementation of primary prevention measures for this disease in the region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Designing the supply chain network is one of the significant areas in e-commerce business management. This concept plays a crucial role in e-commerce systems. For example, location-inventory-pricing-routing of an e-commerce supply chain is considered a crucial issue in this field. This field established many severe challenges in the modern world, like maintaining the supply chain for returned items, preserving customers’ trust and satisfaction, and developing an applicable supply chain with cost considerations. The research proposes a multi-objective mixed integer nonlinear programming model to design a closed-loop supply chain network based on the e-commerce context. The proposed model incorporates two objectives that optimize the business’s total profits and the customers’ satisfaction. Then, numerous numerical examples are generated and solved using the epsilon constraint method in GAMS optimization software. The validation of the given model has been tested for the large problems via a hybrid two-level non-dominated sort genetic algorithm. Finally, some sensitivity analysis has been performed to provide some managerial insights.</jats:p>",

In a pot experiment, the relationship between wormwood (A. scoparia L.) and radish grown individually or intercropped, without and with Pb(NO3)2 supply, was investigated. The intercropping had significant effects in both species, as a consequence of metal allelopathy. Radish showed decrease of root biomass (1.75- fold), Fe, Mn and Zn content (2-fold), Cu level (5.4-fold), and a 1.59-fold Pb increase in the leaves. In wormwood, a 1.75-fold increase of root biomass, as well as a 7.2- and 2.8-fold increase of root and leaf Fe content, respectively, were recorded. A. scoparia, the most Pb tolerant out of the 11 Artemisia species investigated, accumulated 6.6 and 9.9 times more Pb in leaves and roots respectively, compared to radish, under Pb supply which encouraged the growth of both plants. The intercropping under Pb supply induced a three-fold decrease of radish root biomass and 7.8-fold decrease of Pb content. Changes in plant antioxidant activity were recorded only under Pb supply and were not related to radish-wormwood interaction: the leaf phenolics content and antioxidant activity displayed 1.4- and 2- fold increases, respectively, in radish, and 1.4- and 1.6-fold decreases in wormwood. Synchronous changes in elemental composition of wormwood and radish in intercropping conditions, without or under Pb supply, suggest the significance of this phenomenon in plants interaction and arise high prospects of A. scoparia utilization to tackle weeds and soil Pb pollution</jats:p>"

Mycobacteria-infected dendritic cells (DCs) migrate to the lymph node to initiate adaptive immune priming, which is vital to antimycobacterial immunity. This response is intimately tied to nutrient availability – especially the amino acid L-arginine (L-ARG), metabolism of which is altered in TB patients. We have characterized a pathway utilized by immune cells to synthesize L-ARG. Loss of L-ARG synthesis in CD11c+ cells, which includes DCs, results in increased mycobacterial burden following infection in mice. To characterize the role of this pathway in DCs, we developed a co-culture system with mycobacterial-specific CD4+ T cells and bone marrow derived DCs. Using CD4+ T cells and DCs with differing capabilities of L-ARG synthesis, we found 1) DC L-ARG synthesis supports CD4+ T cell proliferation and 2) activated T cells contain DC-derived L-ARG. We hypothesize DCs “share” synthesized L-ARG to support CD4+ T cell activation when L-ARG is limiting. Our data suggest nutrient availability as a 4th signal – following antigen presentation, co-stimulation, and cytokine receptor ligation – required for T cell activation. This work expands the current model of DC-T cell interactions and provides insight into the effects of nutrient availability in immune cells.</jats:p>",

Based on the MEDALUS Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI) approach, the sensitivity in desertification is estimated by employing 15 quantitative parameters divided in to four main quality indices: climate, vegetation, soil, and management quality. The methodology applied for a baseline scenario (current conditions), two future climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and a soil quality improvement scenario. According to the results, more than 13% of the island's area is characterized as critically sensitive to desertification in the current conditions. This percentage will increase in the future under both the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 climate scenarios, where the critical areas will rise above to 15%. By applying the soil quality improvement scenario simultaneously with the climate change scenarios, a slight mitigation of desertification risk in the future could be achieved. The methodology developed in this study may be used to assess desertification process under various climate, soil, and land use management scenarios in regions of the Mediterranean Sea.</jats:p>",

In this context, we propose a novel low-cost, compact inkjet-printed UHF RFID tag antenna design for liquid bottles, with 2.5 m read range improvement over existing designs along with robust performance on different liquid bottle products. The tag antenna is based on a nested slot-based configuration that achieves good impedance matching around high permittivity surfaces. The tag was designed and optimized using the characteristic mode analysis. Moreover, the proposed RFID tag was commercially tested for tagging and billing of liquid bottle products in a conveyer belt and smart refrigerator for automatic billing applications. With the help of block-chain based product tracking and a mobile application, we demonstrate a real-time, secure and smart supply chain process in which items can be monitored using the proposed RFID technology. We believe the standalone system presented in this paper can be deployed to create smart contracts that benefit both the suppliers and consumers through the development of trust. Furthermore, the proposed system will paves the way towards authentic and contact-less delivery of food, drinks and medicine in recent Corona virus pandemic.</jats:p>"

This article uses a combination of normative analysis and empirical analysis to analyze the status quo of the supply chain of small and medium e-commerce companies. First, this article establishes an evaluation framework for the supply chain of e-commerce companies based on edge computing. Second, according to the distribution of the supply chain, this article adds the member’s predetermined quota, reputation, execution time, and other indicators as parameters to establish a fuzzy neural network model. On this basis, combined with the price regression model, the pricing plan is evaluated. The results show that the financing risk obtained by this model differs very little from the actual risk.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this model, a supply chain model has been developed where a manufacturer continuously transports perfect quality items at no cost to a distribution center to maintain the market demand. At the beginning of the process, the production process is in an “in-control” state, but after a random time, it goes to an “out-of-control” state. Thus the production process produces perfect as well as imperfect items in this state. The rate of imperfect production depends on production rate and production-run length in the “out-of-control” state. The unit production cost of the manufacturer depends on the production rate which indicates that the higher production rate is the cause of higher production cost if it exceeds the normal production rate set by the manufacturer. The manufacturer provides a credit period to the distributor to increase his sales growth. In the competitive business world, credit period affects the demand rate of a retailer/buyer due to its late payment facility. So, here, credit period dependent demand function is introduced for the distributor. During the festive season, demand factor of products is usually affected by stock level. Also, for some types of products (such as clothing), the demand factor depends on its stock level. Thus we have considered stock-dependent demand function for the customers. Now, in an infinite time horizon, the problem is how they adjust their demands to sustain the whole system’s financial flow. The novelty of this model is to analyze the compatibility of this two-type of demand in their businesses so that both can maintain their profits. Also, there is another credit length which is offered by the distributor. The proposed model has been discussed in type-2 fuzzy environment due to the uncertainty of the credit period. The purpose of this model is to optimize the integrated profit of the system by optimizing production rate and production-run time. Finally, numerical examples have been provided to illustrate the feasibility of both crisp and fuzzy model and some conclusions are derived conducting a sensitivity analysis of different parameters.</jats:p>",

Kendall’s coefficient of concordance analysis and content analysis were the analytical techniques employed. It found that households’ level of participationin urban water management was 14%. Results of the Kendall’s analysis showed a coefficient of 0.59, which indicates that there is a high agreement level among households that the low level of participation is attributed to GWCL’s lack of trust in end-users’ capacity to make meaningful inputs. It identifies formation of urban zonal water management committees, communication and information sharing, operational transparency and assigning specific roles to end-users as some of the strategies for improving participation in urban water management. These findings have implications for the realisation of the Ghana National Water Policy objective of participatory decision-making in urban water management.

To mitigate the problem, the need for optimal route planning algorithms emerged. In this paper, we propose a mathematical formulation of the EV-specific routing problem in a graph-theoretical context, which incorporates the ability of EVs to recuperate energy. Furthermore, we consider a possibility to recharge on the way using intermediary charging stations. As a possible solution method, we present an off-policy model-free reinforcement learning approach that aims to generate energy feasible paths for EV from source to target. The algorithm was implemented and tested on a case study of a road network in Switzerland. The training procedure requires low computing and memory demands and is suitable for online applications. The results achieved demonstrate the algorithm’s capability to take recharging decisions and produce desired energy feasible paths.</jats:p>"

The molecular aspects of protein synthesis are centered around the mTORC1 complex. However, the intricacies of mTORC1 regulation, both up and downstream, have expanded overtime. Moreover, the plastic nature of skeletal muscle makes it a unique tissue, having to coordinate between temporal changes in myofiber metabolism and hypertrophy/atrophy stimuli within a tissue with considerable protein content. Skeletal muscle manages the push and pull between anabolic and catabolic pathways through key regulatory proteins to promote energy production in times of nutrient deprivation or activate anabolic pathways in times of nutrient availability and anabolic stimuli. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can be used for both energy production and signaling to induce protein synthesis. The metabolism of BCAAs occur in tandem with energetic and anabolic processes, converging at several points along their respective pathways. The fate of intramuscular BCAAs adds another layer of regulation, which has consequences to promote or inhibit muscle fiber protein anabolism. This review will outline the general mechanisms of muscle protein synthesis and describe how metabolic pathways can regulate this process. Lastly, we will discuss how BCAA availability and demand coordinate with synthesis mechanisms and identify key factors involved in intramuscular BCAA trafficking.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main topics discussed in a supply chain is the production-distribution problem. Producing and distributing the products plays a key role in reducing the costs of the chain. To design a supply chain, a network of efficient management and production-distribution decisions is essential. Accordingly, providing an appropriate mathematical model for such problems can be helpful in designing and managing supply chain networks. Mathematical formulations must be drawn close to the real world due to the importance of supply chain networks. This makes those formulations more complicated. In this study, a novel multi-objective formulation is devised for the production-distribution problem of a supply chain that consists of several suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and different customers. Also, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) mathematical model is proposed for designing a multi-objective and multi-period supply chain network. In addition, grey flexible linear programming (GFLP) is done for a multi-objective production-distribution problem in a supply chain network. The network is designed for the first time to cope with the uncertain nature of costs, demands, and capacity parameters. In this regard, due to the NP-hardness and complexity of problems and the necessity of using meta-heuristic algorithms, NSGA-II and Fast PGA algorithm are applied and compared in terms of several criteria that emphasize the quality and diversity of the solutions.</jats:p>",

Decarbonising the energy demand of buildings will require two types of strategies: first, an overall reduction in energy demand, which could, to some extent, be achieved at negative costs; and second through a reduction of the carbon content of energy via fuel switching and supply-side decarbonisation. This study assesses the contributions of each of these strategies for the decarbonisation of the buildings sector in line with a 1.5°C global warming. We show that in a 1.5°C scenario combining mitigation policies and a reduction of market failures in efficiency markets, 81% of the reductions in buildings emissions are achieved through the reduction of the carbon content of energy, while the remaining 19% are due to efficiency improvements which reduce energy demand by 31%. Without supply-side decarbonisation, efficiency improvements almost entirely suppress the doubling of emissions that would otherwise be expected, but fail to induce an absolute decline in emissions. Our modelling and scenarios show the impact of both climate change mitigation policies and of the alleviation of market failures pervading through energy efficiency markets. The results show that the reduction of the carbon content of energy through fuel switching and supply-side decarbonisation is of paramount importance for the decarbonisation of buildings.</jats:p>",

In order to study the impact of strategic consumers on the sales of 5G mobile phones, we establish a two-period pricing model. The supply chain contains two manufacturers, a communications operator and a mobile phone retailer. Cases where two manufacturers have the same or different pricing rights are researched by using the Stackelberg game and the Nash game model. Our research results are as follows: (1) We obtain the optimal 5G communication fees in two periods and find out how they change with the proportion of consumers changing. (2) We figure out the profits of the supply chain in two periods and analyze them. We find that the communication operator earns more than the others most of the time. (3) We investigate how the proportion of strategic consumer impact on supply chain profits and conclude that the optimal price and demand in a period will decrease as the proportion of consumers who only purchase products in the other period increases</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Frequent problems of counterfeiting have spawned consumer demands to monitor the entire supply chain. The application of blockchain technology with anti-counterfeiting and traceability can improve the reliability and authenticity of product information and eliminate consumer doubts about product quality. Furthermore, based on the transparency of blockchain technology, brand suppliers can independently obtain the market demand information through information sharing. This paper introduces a consumer suspicion coefficient to illustrate the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain. Considering product authenticity verification and information sharing, we study the optimal pricing and product quality decisions in a two-level supply chain under the following three scenarios: (1) no blockchain technology, a traditional supply chain, and no information sharing (case TN); (2) no blockchain technology but a traditional supply chain with information sharing (case TS); and (3) a supply chain based on blockchain technology (case BT). We find that when the consumer suspicion coefficient increases, consumers will have limited faith in the authenticity of the product, which will affect the retailer’s optimal decision and profit. By comparing the equilibrium results of several cases, we also find that demand information sharing by the retailer may not achieve a win-win outcome in a decentralized channel in the absence of blockchain technology. Under demand information sharing based on blockchain technology, however, if the consumer suspicion coefficient exceeds a certain threshold, the brand supplier and retailer can achieve a win–win outcome. In addition, the extended models reveal that in a centralized supply chain, regardless of the state of market demand, blockchain technology can always improve product quality and retail price and optimize supply chain profit.</jats:p>",

We find that, chain members will set the largest wholesale price, retail prices of direct and indirect channels when the retailer only shares information with the manufacturer and the highest return rate can be obtained in the case of the retailer only revealing information to the collector. We can also find that, information sharing is profitable to the manufacturer and the collector, while is detrimental to the retailer.

Second, the incentive model is solved and analyzed based on the optimal emission reduction cost and the optimal carbon emission incentive. Finally, optimal control theory is used to analyze the dynamic optimization of the model. The result shows that with the improvement of anastomosis in Online and offline operations, the emission reduction cost is reduced. Supply chain members need to reduce carbon emissions only when their business scale is more than a certain amount. The cost of emission reduction for supply chain members is a concave function of the cost for its operation equipment or the correct emission price.</jats:p>",

However, rational water allocation will become more difficult in the future owing to the effects of climate change, causing water shortages and disputes. In this study, an advanced hydro-economic water allocation and management model (WAMM) was introduced by improving the optimization scheme employed in conventional models and incorporating the economic value of water. By relying upon economic valuation, the WAMM can support water allocation efforts that focus not only on the stability but also on the economic benefits of water supply. The water supply risk was evaluated following the different objective functions and optimization methods provided by the WAMM using a case study of the Namhan River basin in South Korea under a climate change scenario over the next 30 years. The water shortages and associated economic damage were compared, and the superior ability of WAMM to mitigate future water shortages using economic valuation and full-step linear programming (FSLP) optimization was demonstrated. It is expected that the WAMM can be applied to help resolve water shortages and disputes among river basin units under severe drought conditions.</jats:p>"

The application of cooperative game in the distribution of power distribution costs gives an economic signal reflecting the difference in power supply to users in the park. In the concept of multiple solutions in cooperative game theory, the Shapley value determines the power flow contribution of each user to the power grid with its uniqueness, determines the user’s power distribution cost based on the power flow, and its economic background also clarifies the user’s responsibilities, and the user chooses differently. The power distribution costs borne by the power supply are also different, thereby promoting power supply optimization. The 5-node calculation example verifies the effectiveness of the distribution cost allocation based on the Shapley value for the economic incentive of power supply optimization.</jats:p>",

High transportation costs increase almost three times the price of one ton of the solid fuel. Coal fields in the Arctic have social rather than commercial value. The key target of local coal mining is enhancement of energy preparedness of population rather than money making. The review of modern methodological approaches to assessing the efficiency of using local coal resources in hard-to-reach areas reveals a wide range of such approaches, their ambiguity and neglect of the Arctic activities peculiarities. The paper presents a new approach for evaluation of small coal opencasts operating in remote Polar regions in Yakutia. The approach is based on the economic and mathematical model of substitution of local coal for imported coal. The technical and economic indicators of a small coal mine is calculated in terms of Krasnorechensky deposit of thermal coalm, and the effect of replacing imported coal by local coal in the Abyi district is evaluated. The results of the study show feasibility of in-house coal supply in the isolated and hard-to-reach areas of the Arctic by means of creation of small coal opencasts, which enhances the energy security and reduces the socio-economic tension.</jats:p>",

The experimental layout was a split-plot design with three replications. Three deficit irrigation (DI) levels (DI0: 100%, DI30: 70% and DI60: 40% of the field capacity) and two basil cultivars (Green and Purple) were applied to main and subplots, respectively. The results showed that there was a decrease in yield and an increase in CWP for fresh leaves and fresh and dry herb by decreasing the irrigation water. However, a significant difference between fresh leaves and fresh and dry herb yield of DI0 and DI30 treatment was not observed. The Green basil had higher leaves and herb yield and CWP than the other cultivar. A polynomial relationship was established between fresh leaves yield and crop evapotranspiration; however, the yield response factor (Ky) indicated a linear relationship between the relative reduction in crop evapotranspiration vs. the relative reduction in yield. The Ky values were obtained as 0.70 and 0.76 for Green and Purple basil, respectively. The results revealed that the irrigation regime of 30% water saving could ensure acceptable yield of basil plant and increase in CWP, especially for the Green basil cultivar.</jats:p>",

The conceptual model developed is based on a simplified model of psychological ownership. The results highlight a convergent perspective regarding sustainability challenges, namely, natural resources and biodiversity, safety, and supply chain. However, hotels and restaurants do not reflect the same perception regarding sustainability initiatives, e-tourism, or free internet access.

In view of this, it is important to improve the ferritization treatment of wastewater from zinc and chromium ions. A laboratory installation for the ferritization process with electromagnetic pulse activation (EMI) has been developed. This method of activation provides not only a reduction in energy costs, but also the appropriate degree of extraction of heavy metal ions, which allows you to get an aqueous solution that can be used in a circulating water supply system, and sludge disposed of as additives for alkaline cements. The influence of the strength of the electromagnetic field on the degree of extraction of zinc and chromium ions from wastewater by ferritization has been studied.

It is believed that the energy is injected from the energy-containing range into the inertial range and then transferred to dissipate into heat eventually. However, the energy injection process in the heliosphere remains unclear. Here we analyze this process. We utilize Helios 2 and Ulysses measurements of the fast solar wind at different radial distances from 0.29 to 4.8 au. We obtain the perpendicular heating rate based on the gradient of the magnetic moment. We estimate for the first time the energy supply rate due to the sweeping of low-frequency break based on the identification of low-frequency break and the corresponding power spectra density profile. We find that the energy supply rate is comparable to the perpendicular heating rate of protons, which support the idea that low-frequency range becomes part of the inertial range as the solar wind turbulence ages. These results help us understand the energy supply process from the energy-containing range and the heating process of solar wind protons.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A common notion is that negative feedbacks stabilize the marine nitrogen inventory. Recent modeling studies have shown, however, some potential for localized positive feedbacks leading to substantial nitrogen losses, in regions where nitrogen fixation and denitrification occur in proximity to each other. Here we include dissolved nitrogen from river discharge in a global 3-D ocean biogeochemistry model and study the effects on near-coastal and remote open ocean biogeochemistry. We find that at steady state the biogeochemical feedbacks in the marine nitrogen cycle, nitrogen input from biological N2 fixation, and nitrogen loss via denitrification, mostly compensate for the yearly addition of 22.8 to 45.6 Tg of riverine nitrogen and limit the impact on global marine productivity to &lt; 2 %. Global experiments that regionally isolate river nutrient input show that sign and strength of the feedbacks depend on the location of the river discharge and the oxygen status of the receiving marine environment. Marine productivity generally increases in proximity to the nitrogen input, but we also find a decline in productivity in the Bay of Bengal and near the mouth of the Amazon River. While most of the changes are located in shelf and near coastal oceans, nitrogen supply from the rivers can impact the open ocean, due to feedbacks or knock-on effects.\n                        </jats:p>"

Their karst origin and xeric setting impart a characteristic ecohydrology, which is a function of their connectivity to a regional water-supply aquifer. This study describes their general hydrologic character and provides physical and chemical evidence of this connectivity. These findings advance fundamental understanding of sandhill wetland/water ecohydrology and endeavor to ensure their proper management and protection amidst increasing groundwater demands, ever-expanding development, and a changing climate.Water level elevations and/or geochemistry were compared for 12 wetlands, five ponds, two lakes, and 12 monitor wells (10 constructed in limestone, two in surficial sand) in west-central Florida. Hydrograph and regression analyses indicate widely ranging water levels for most features and wells that are similar in elevation and very highly correlated with each other (0.84<jats:underline>&lt;</jats:underline><jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup><jats:underline>&lt;</jats:underline>0.99). Water geochemistry varies from rainwater to water in contact with limestone as a function of feature depth relative to the depth of the rainwater-limestone water mixing zone. Results suggest sandhill wetland/water features are surface water expressions of the underlying regional aquifer hydrology, distinguishing them from isolated features elsewhere and establishing them as a groundwater endmember along the hydrologic continuum.</jats:p>"

Secondly, the battery behaviours are analysed and applied in LabVIEW. The algorithms which are low pass filter, PID and others are implemented in LabVIEW to reduce standard deviations and errors. The current study found that the constant load at 0.5C and 1C, which controlled by the electronic load via LabVIEW, can emulate the battery voltage and the error relative is below 5 %. Further work is required to establish the optimization of the parameters in the battery management system (BMS) since a battery simulator uses power sources before the use of the battery management system (BMS) with a real battery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The public housing demand in Seoul has been continuously increasing, but the available land for housing is insufficient. To meet the demand, the Seoul government is planning to develop small-scale housing in urban areas through various methods. Construction activities for increasing housing capacity cause negative environmental impacts, and this inevitably leads to an increase in the number of civil complaints. The complaints can be mitigated by using offsite construction (OSC) for fabricating components. However, OSC remains underdeveloped in Korea owing to concerns over high project costs. To promote OSC, the government must develop a long-term plan to secure demand for OSC. For such a plan, the number and feasibility of applicable sites in Seoul must be estimated. This study suggests a two-stage research framework: (1) estimate the number of applicable sites in Seoul using GIS and (2) conduct feasibility analyses of these sites through architectural planning. The estimated number of sites was equal to the expected supply of small-scale housing units in Seoul for 8 years, and the selected case sites were identified to be feasible. Therefore, the use of OSC for developing small-scale housing units in Seoul is reasonable. This research differs from previous studies in that the previous use of qualitative studies to promote modular construction was replaced with a quantitative analysis that included the entire Seoul area. Using the research framework, the Seoul government can develop a specific long-term plan based on the quantitative research analysis. Furthermore, manufacturers can develop plans based on the government plan and deliver returns on the higher initial costs. The contractors can reduce the higher project cost and doing so is expected to mitigate the negative perception and to promote modular construction in Korea.</jats:p>"

To hybridize ELM, imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), firefly algorithm (FA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) metaheuristic algorithms were implemented. In addition, six different models were established to determine effective dimensionless (relative) input variables. A new data set was constructed by adding the data obtained from the experimental study in the present research to the data obtained from the literature. The performance of each model was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation. Results showed that ICA hybridization slightly outperformed FA and PSO methods. Considering relative input parameters, Froude number (Fr), expansion ratio (B) and relative sill height (S), effective input combinations were Fr–B–S and Fr–B for the prediction of the sequent depth ratio (Y) and relative hydraulic jump length (Lj/h1), respectively.</jats:p>",

BT is in its early period and it is hard to find supply chains that have successfully implemented this technology to track their sustainable actions. Therefore, it is worth studying about the role of customers, members, domestic, national, and international challenges that could resist implementing Blockchain and may affect SC sustainability. Accordingly, four categories of barriers to the use of BT are introduced which are inter-organizational, intra-organizational, technical, and external barriers. Then with Bayesian Best Worst Method, we ranked the BT barriers and the sub-barriers. The study illustrates the interconnection of these barriers and the priority of each element. The lack of business models and the best practices in implementing Blockchain technology is a challenge and it is important that practitioners acknowledge these barriers in the first steps.</jats:p>",

During the advance selling process, consumers may be loss averse. This influences the pricing strategy of the members of the supply chain. Using prospect theory and game theory, and considering consumers’ loss aversion, this paper studies the pricing strategy of advance selling in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an e-retailer under a resale contract or an agency contract. The study finds that as consumers’ loss aversion increases, supply chain members set lower prices. Consumers’ loss aversion has a positive impact on the member who directly prices to consumers, but it has a negative impact on the indirect member. Advance selling under an agency contract makes it easier to achieve a Pareto improvement than that under the resale contract. When the unit order fulfilment cost is low, the e-retailer prefers the agency contract.</jats:p>",

Our study thus identifies inefficiencies in the supply chain network (SCN). The initial goal is to obtain the best allocation order for products from various sources with different destinations in an optimal manner. This study considers two types of decision-makers (DMs) operating at two separate groups of SCN, that is, a bi-level decision-making process. The first-level DM moves first and determines the amounts of the quantity transported to distributors, and the second-level DM then rationally chooses their amounts. First-level decision-makers (FLDMs) aimed at minimizing the total costs of transportation, while second-level decision-makers (SLDM) attempt to simultaneously minimize the total delivery time of the SCN and balance the allocation order between various sources and destinations. This investigation implements fuzzy goal programming (FGP) to solve the multi-objective of SCN in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The FGP concept was used to define the fuzzy goals, build linear and nonlinear membership functions, and achieve the compromise solution. A real-life case study was used to illustrate the proposed work. The obtained result shows the optimal quantities transported from the various sources to the various destinations that could enable managers to detect the optimum quantity of the product when hierarchical decision-making involving two levels. A case study then illustrates the application of the proposed work.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, an emerging scholarly interest in questions of logistics and supply chain capitalism has lacked a systematic theorisation of how increasing functional integration in the world economy shapes—and is also shaped by—rent relations. To bridge this gap, this article explores the complex, convoluted relation between property and the social circulation of capital in and beyond land markets. With this, we place into focus the extent to which the logistics revolution has elevated the importance of property relations—and thereby of the rentier class—in the dynamics of accumulation and political conflict under late‐stage capitalism.</jats:p>",

The effect of N fertilizer rates and timings on morphology, antioxidant enzymes, and grain yield of maize (Zea mays L.) in the Loess Plateau of China was evaluated. The four N levels, i.e., 0 (N0), 100 (N1), 200 (N2), and 300 (N3) kg ha−1, were applied at two timings (T1, one-third N at sowing and two-thirds at the six-leaf stage of maize; T2, one-third applied at sowing, six-leaf stage, and eleven-leaf stage of maize). The results show that N2 and N3 significantly increased the plant height, stem and leaf dry weight, and leaf area index of maize compared with a non-N-fertilized control (N0). The net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and leaf chlorophyll contents were lower, while the intercellular carbon dioxide concentration was higher for non-fertilized plants compared to fertilized plants. The activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased with N rate, but the difference between 200 and 300 kg ha−1 was not significant; further, the isozyme bands of POD and SOD also changed with their activities. Compared with a non-N-fertilized control, N2 and N3 significantly increased grain yield by 2.76- and 3.11-fold in 2018, 2.74- and 2.80-fold in 2019, and 2.71- and 2.89-fold in 2020, and there was no significant difference between N2 and N3. N application timing only affected yield in 2018. In conclusion, 200 kg N ha−1 application increased yield through optimizing the antioxidant enzyme system, increasing photosynthetic capacity, and promoting dry matter accumulation. Further research is necessary to evaluate the response of more cultivars under more seasons to validate the results obtained.</jats:p>"

Tactical and operational decisions are considered in the proposed multi-product and multi-period planning problem. Using a rolling horizon, the approach aims at defining optimal quantities to produce, to store and to deliver. The integration consists in coordinating informational flows between producer and retailer. Information sharing will allow the producer to estimate more accurately the future replenishment orders that may happen at the operational level and adjust production capacity requirements accordingly. For this purpose, a two-stage planning approach is devised; the first stage deals with the tactical level while the second stage deals with the operational level. The monthly decisions taken at the tactical planning level are accounted for in the operational planning considering a variable rolling horizon. Moreover, accurate forecasts of future replenishment orders are established based on information sharing and introduced in the operational planning to determine the weekly decisions. Linear programming models are used to build production and distribution plans at the tactical and operational levels. Using real-life data from a textile and apparel Tunisian firm, we show that producer-retailer coordination based on the sharing of current sales information, yields significant cost savings reaching up to 20% of the supply chain cost. These findings can only motivate the partnership between producer and retailer through reliable information sharing in joint tactical-operational and production–distribution planning.</jats:p>",

They are often regressive, potentially limiting access to quality healthcare, particularly for the most vulnerable, and can have catastrophic consequences for households. Yet there is little empirical research that uses theory-driven hypotheses to explore what influences informal payments and, especially, from health workers’ perspectives. Consequently, we have explored the characteristics of health workers and facilities influencing informal payments in Tanzania, examining two hypotheses: health workers with power and position in the system are more likely to receive informal payments, and transparency and accountability measures can be bypassed by those who can game the system. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 432 health workers from 42 public health facilities (hospitals and health centres) in 12 district councils from Pwani and Dar es Salam regions in Tanzania. Our dependent variable was whether the health worker has ever asked for or been given informal payments or bribes, while explanatory variables were measured at the individual and facility level. Given the hierarchical structure of the data, we used a multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression to explore the determinants. Twenty-seven percent of 432 health workers ever engaged in informal payment. This was more common amongst younger (&amp;lt;35 years) health workers and those higher in the hierarchy (specialists and heads of departments). Those receiving entitlements and benefits in a timely manner and who were subject to continued supervision were significantly less likely to receive informal payments. The likelihood of engaging in informal payments varied among health workers, consistent with our first hypothesis, but evidence on the second hypothesis remains mixed. Thus, policy responses should address both individual and system-level factors, including ensuring adequate and progressive health sector financing, better and timely remuneration of frontline public health providers, and enhanced governance and supervision.</jats:p>",

The leaf NDF concentration, an indicator of N uptake, increased concomitantly only when pre-harvest N was applied. Pre-harvest treated trees allocated more than half of the NDF into fruit and leaves and stored the same amount of NDF into perennial organs as the post-harvest treatment. Subsequent spring remobilization of NDF was not affected by the timing of N fertigation from the previous season. A seasonal effect of remobilization was observed with a decrease in root N status and a reciprocal increase in branch N status at fruit harvest of season two. These findings represent a shift in the understanding of dynamics of N use in mature deciduous trees and indicate that current fertilizer strategies need to be adjusted from post-harvest to primarily pre-harvest N application to optimize N use efficiency. This approach can provide adequate storage N to support early spring growth the following season with no detriment to fruit quality.</jats:p>"

At this stage, urban rail transit as an important tool of urban public transport, with fast, energy-saving and other advantages, so it has become an important part of urban infrastructure. Stable power system is the basis to ensure the stable operation of urban rail transit. However, traction power supply and electric power technology are needed to provide technical support in the operation of urban rail transit. This paper analyzes the content of this aspect and has a certain understanding of the relevant technology through the analysis of the article. Urge the relevant staff to conduct in-depth research, in order to obtain more advanced technology. With the gradual improvement of the reliability and advanced nature of the power grid, the self-healing ability has become the core function of the advanced power grid system in the future. This paper analyzes and compares the research status and technical characteristics of self-healing technology of distribution network system and rail transit power supply system, and points out the deficiency of self-healing of rail transit power supply system at present; by combing the fault scenarios and self-healing requirements of rail transit power supply system, this paper preliminarily analyzes the realization method of self-healing system, and puts forward an overall architecture of self-healing system. This paper first explains the causes of urban rail transit power system faults, then explains the fault types of urban rail transit power system, and finally explains the ways to deal with the faults of urban rail transit power system. With the continuous acceleration of urban modernization in China, urban rail transit has become the main force of urban transportation, providing people with more convenient travel, but also has a very high travel efficiency. It is precisely because of the characteristics of urban rail transit itself that it has become the darling of urban development, and many cities have plans to build rail transit.</jats:p>",

This study was carried out to evaluate the climate smartness of short organic food supply chains in a direct farmers’ market in Kurunegala, Sri Lanka.Research Method: Data were collected from all farmer venders (50) of the direct organic farmers’ market using a structured interview schedule and from two venders through in-depth interviews and observations. The economic, social and environmental sustainability aspects were assessed as the components of CSA.Findings: Results revealed that the income of farmer venders increased after joining the organic direct market and that was stable throughout the year achieving the economic sustainability. Involvement of small-scale farmers, adopting climate resilient production practices, access to information and markets, institutional support and collective actions were identified along the value chains as the elements of social sustainability. The average GHG emission along the two selected value chains of the direct market had reduced after joining the farmers market depicting the environmental sustainability. Therefore, the studied organic direct farmers’ market was climate smart.Research Limitations: Only two value chains of the market was studied due to its’ complexity and time and resource limitation. The calculations of GHG emission were based on default values as there were no country specific values. Therefore, the calculated GHG emission values are approximate.Originality/Value: The findings of the study are novel as most of the concepts studied are relatively new. Therefore, findings are important for understanding and future interventions.</jats:p>"

The data were obtained from 296 questionnaires from seniors over 50 years old (or completed by relatives on their behalf, according to their actual situation). Twenty-two observed variables were selected for the five latent variables, and their interactions were explored using structural equation modeling. The results showed that LA was the most significant factor influencing SSCSC, and it was followed by BLNs and LE. PTs did not show a direct effect on LA, but they could have an indirect effect on SSCSC through influencing BLNs and LE. Based on the current state of community aging satisfaction, we propose to establish a community elderly care service system based on the basic needs of the elderly population, providing differentiated and refined elderly care services and improving the level of aging-friendly communities. This study provides references for the government to formulate relevant policies and other supply entities to make strategic decisions and has important implications for further enhancing community elderly services to become an important part of the social security system for the elderly.</jats:p>"

However, the nutrient effects on co‐occurrence network topology, particularly in freshwaters, are understudied. Here, we investigate 1) whether nutrient supply and ratio constrain topological properties of algal co‐occurrence networks in streams and 2) to what extent climate and space (a surrogate for dispersal) affect co‐occurrence network topology versus metacommunity composition across nutrient supply and ratio contexts. We used a subcontinental dataset of benthic algae from 840 stream localities in the conterminous US. We constructed co‐occurrence networks representing nutrient supply contexts (oligotrophic versus eutrophic) and nutrient ratio contexts (N‐limited versus P‐limited) and statistically assessed topological variability within each pair via randomization. We then used a null model framework and direct gradient analysis to ascertain the importance of climate and space in driving, respectively, network topology and metacommunity composition. Nutrient supply was only positively related to network size (species node counts), which was driven by motile species, while other topological differences were non‐significant. Climatic and spatial variables had pronounced and for the most part comparable effects on network topology that further depended on nutrient context. A comparative assessment of topological versus compositional responses to climate and space across nutrient contexts identified both similarities and differences. While climate and space contributed to both network topology and metacommunity composition, space was a stronger predictor of compositional variability than climate, regardless of nutrient context. Our findings highlight the need for developing integrative multi‐level approaches (from metacommunities to co‐occurrence networks) to fully understand biological responses to complex and interactive abiotic forces.</jats:p>",

The modes of operation of synchronous generators and their overload capacity are analyzed. The overloading capacity of diesel generator sets (DGS) can be significantly increased when used as an electromechanical energy converter of asynchronous generators (AG). The initial algorithm for their selection involves calculating the optimal value of the rotor speed and choosing the range of rotation frequency. The value of the optimal value of the rotational speed is determined depending on the method of maintaining the constancy of the current frequency when calculating the parameters of an autonomous asynchronous semiconductor cascade, which is understood as an AG together with its excitation and control system. The dependences of individual terms of electrical power losses on the operating mode of an autonomous asynchronous semiconductor stage are considered. After determining the optimal speed, the possible AG power is selected. Then, from a number of powers, its nominal power is selected. After determining the rated power, the minimum and maximum values of the rotational speed, it is possible to determine the optimal operating modes of the diesel generator set with the AG. As a criterion of optimality, the specific effective fuel consumption of the diesel generator set is taken. This approach to the choice of the type of diesel generator set when designing autonomous power supply systems requires a detailed consideration of the technical and economic characteristics of the units. The proposed design principles can ensure the most complete use of the positive properties of a diesel engine and an electromechanical energy conversion system, as a result of which to improve the technical and economic characteristics of autonomous power supply systems.</jats:p>",

The nine different Planetary Boundaries i.e. climatic change, biodiversity loss, biogeochemical, ocean acidification, land use, freshwater availability, stratosphere ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosols and chemical pollution are examined in relation to ASC sustainability and resilience. Kenya’s tea upstream supply chain sustainability and resilience from the ecological point of view is questioned. This study adopts a multi-case study analysis approach of nine producer organisations from Kenya’s tea supply chain. The data from the in-depth semi-structured interviews and a focus group discussion are analysed using thematic analysis. The Kenyan tea supply chain producers are not aware of all the nine planetary boundaries, although these impact on their resilience practices. They are engaged in pursuing both sustainability and resilience practices. They implement mainly environmental practices in relation to sustainability, while only a few of them are implementing resilience practices. The sustainability and resilience concepts were found to be interrelated, but resilience does not improve at the same pace as sustainability. It is suggested that the relationship between sustainability and resilience is non-linear. Limitations and future research avenues are also provided.</jats:p>",

Thus, success in today’s high rival markets depends on the presentation of new products with new options, which must be compatible with customers’ desires. This research aims to analyze the psychological effect of the noise of a new product on the total profit of the chain and the optimal pricing and marketing decisions of the chain’s members. Additionally, a cooperative (co-op) advertising strategy as a coordination mechanism is considered among the partners such that it helps them to obtain their target markets. Commonly, under co-op advertising, the manufacturer pays a percentage of the retailer’s advertising costs. In this chain, the manufacturer and the retailer agree to share the retailer’s advertising costs. Afterwards, four different relations between the manufacturer and retailer are studied and analyzed including three non-cooperative games with symmetrical distribution of market power and one asymmetrical distribution of it. So, four game models and their closed-form solutions are illustrated with a numerical example. It was found that the noise effect affects the total profit of the manufacturer and the retailer, as well as the supply chain by influencing the partners’ advertising policies. In other word, increasing the noise effect of the product indicates to the manufacturer and the retailer to globally and locally advertise more, respectively. In turn, their profits increase, although also increasing the advertising costs. Finally, a complete sensitivity analysis is conducted and reported.</jats:p>"

The results using logit regression analysis revealed that new partners and revocation partners each have a signaling effect perceived as positive and negative information in the short term, and the excess returns by country showed a positive signaling effect in the order of the US, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. The findings also suggest that the change in the new partners’ stock price after the preannouncement of new products was useful investment information. Moreover, information asymmetry was found between individual investors, institutions, and foreigners.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Akses terhadap sumber air merupakan satu keperluan bagi setiap manusia. Bekalan air bersih terawat menjadi agenda penting negara seperti yang dinyatakan dalam Dasar Sumber Air Negara (2012). Pulau Sebatik yang dimiliki oleh Malaysia telah memiliki sistem bekalan air paip tersendiri yang diperoleh daripada Loji Rawatan Air (LRA) Wallace Bay yang terletak di bahagian barat. Walaupun jaringan paip telah meliputi sehingga Rancangan Bergosong yang terletak di bahagian tengah pulau, tetapi masyarakat masih tidak mendapat bekalan air yang mampan. Oleh itu, kajian ini cuba melihat tahap sekuriti air dalam konteks capaian bekalan air terawat di Pulau Sebatik. Bagi mencapai objektif kajian, soal selidik dan temu bual telah dijalankan. Data-data soal selidik dianalisis menggunakan analisis jadual silang dalam Microsoft Excel. Di samping itu, sumber temu bual digunakan untuk menyokong dapatan soal selidik melalui analisis kata demi kata berpandukan kolektif memori responden. Umumnya, kemampuan masyarakat untuk menikmati bekalan air paip yang efisien di pulau ini masih berada pada tahap yang rendah. Penduduk sering menghadapi catuan bekalan air, terutama di kawasan jauh daripada LRA seperti Kampung Sungai Tongkang (76.5 peratus) dan Kampung Bergosong (78.0 peratus), berbanding Kampung Wallace Bay (28.4 peratus) yang terletak dekat dengan LRA. Lebih 50 peratus penduduk yang menghadapi catuan sering menghadapi masalah bekalan air antara tiga hingga lima hari dalam seminggu. Selain catuan, penduduk Sebatik tidak selesa dengan tahap kualiti air, iaitu lebih 50 peratus berpendapat air paip terasa klorin (54.7 peratus), payau (3.1 peratus) dan kadang-kadang keruh (21.1 peratus). Lantaran itu, para penduduk terpaksa bergantung dengan air hujan dan telaga sebagai alternatif untuk kegunaan harian utama. Dapatan ini diharapkan menjadi panduan kepada masyarakat di kawasan lain agar mampu memberikan reaksi dengan masalah bekalan air agar berupaya beradaptasi dengan masalah yang dihadapi.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccess to water resources is a necessity for every human being. No matter where the location is, clean water supply is an important to our agenda as stated in the National Water Resources Policy (2012). Sebatik Island owned by Malaysia has its own piped water supply system obtained from the Wallace Bay Water Treatment Plant (LRA) which is located in the western part. Although the pipeline has covered up to Rancangan Bergosong in the central area, but the island community still do not have sustainable of water supply. Therefore, this study attempts to look at the problems faced by the community in Sebatik Island in the context of access to tap water supply. Therefore, this study has analysed the water security accessibility of treated water supply in Sebatik Island. To achieve the objectives, questionnaires and interviews were conducted. Questionnaire data were analysed using crosstabulation analysis using Microsoft Excel. In addition, the interviews are used to support the findings of the questionnaire through the analysis of verbatim guided by the collective memory of respondents. In general, the ability of the community to enjoy an efficient supply of tap water on the island is still at a low level. Residents often face water supply rationing, especially in areas far from the LRA such as Kampung Sungai Tongkang (76.5 per cent) and Kampung Bergosong (78.0 per cent) compared to Kampung Wallace Bay (28.4 per cent) closer to the LRA. More than 50 per cent of the population who suffer from water rationing, often face water supply problems between three to five days a week. In addition to water rationing problems, Sebatik residents feel uncomfortable with the water quality level where more than 50 per cent said tap water contains excess chlorine (54.7 pe cent) and brackish taste (3.1 per cent) and sometimes turbid (21.1 per cent). As a result, residents have to rely on rainwater and wells as an alternative as the main daily water use. This finding is expected to be a guide to community in other areas in order to strive the water supply problem.</jats:p>"

Some descriptive statistics, accounting and financial techniques, and a regression model are used to analyze the data. The study finds that the average ROA of SMEs is 35.87% and the ROE of SMEs is 62.81%. It indicates that the SMEs are earning more than the cost of the fund collected from the institutional sources. It is also observed that there is a significant effect of institutional credit on ROE of SMEs but not on ROA. On the other hand, the growth rate of SME NPL is higher than the total NPL during the study years that is of course alarming regarding SME loan recovery. The institutional SME credit should be increased by applying proper strategies for increasing loan recovery performance. </jats:p>",

This paper leverages data on 89,970 tests of aquatic products extracted from a self-constructed data set of 2.6 million food safety tests conducted by the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) organizations. The integrated and structured data set is used to conduct innovative analysis that identifies the sources of adulteration risks in China’s food SCs and contrasts them with the current test resource allocations of the CFDA. The analysis highlights multiple strategic insights. Particularly, it suggests potential gaps in the current CFDA testing allocation by SC location, which is heavily focused on retail and supermarkets. Instead, the analysis indicates that high-risk parts of the SC, such as wholesale and wet markets, are undersampled. Additionally, the paper highlights the impact that SC analytics could have on policy-level operational decision making to regulate food SCs and manage food safety. The hope is that the paper will stimulate the interest of academics with expertise in these areas to conduct more work in this important application domain. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management. </jats:p>",

To this end, non-linear optimisation methods were used. The control equations and the solution of the simultaneous linear equations were performed using the Crout method. The results of the calculation of the electrical power steady-state mode were considered as a reference. The lower the difference between the evaluation and steady-state calculation results, the higher the accuracy of the overall state assessment procedure. The problem of correcting the weight factors is set and solved as a nonlinear optimisation problem, where the optimisation parameters are taken as the dispersion of the measurements. The objective function was formulated as follows: to minimise the measurement evaluation dispersions that are part of a single control equation by maximising the active power measurements dispersion in the swing bus of the power supply system. In this study, limitations in the form of equation and inequality are monitored. The problem of optimising the dispersions is solved after the first iteration of the state assessment; starting with the second iteration, the state assessment is performed with new measurement weight factors. The calculations were performed on a 6-node test circuit. The control equations are drawn from the current measurements. The measurements data on the selected control equation of the test circuit are used to calculate the target function. The accuracy of the dispersions redistribution and their extreme values are controlled by the limitations. The results showed that, when adjusting the dispersion of measurements, the power assessments at all nodes are closer to the steady-state mode calculation results.</jats:p>"

To achieve the purposes, the optimal quota allocation is determined with respect to disruption of suppliers in a five-echelon supply chain network and consideration of the distributor centers as a hub location-allocation mode. The objective of the optimization model is involved in simultaneous minimization of transactions costs dealing with suppliers, expected purchasing costs from suppliers, expected percentages of delayed and returned products in each distributor, as well as transportation cost in each echelon and fixed cost for distributor centers, and finally maximization of the expected scores for suppliers and high priority of product customers. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. The proposed optimization model is utilized to investigate a numerical case study for asthma-specific medicines. The analyzing procedure is conducted based on the collected real data from Cobel Darou pharmaceutical company in 2019.

This study analyzes the advisory and extension services that support the provision of agricultural inputs in two Divisions of the Western Region of Cameroon (Mifi and Menoua).&#x0D;\nStudy Design and Methodology: These areas are home to about 60% of the private agricultural input distributors involved in the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services within the region Data collected by questionnaire and interview guide were carried out with 62 agricultural inputs sellers with input shops on the one hand, and 7 managers of a number of organizations involved in the provision of agricultural services on the other hand.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nResults: private agricultural input providers use several agricultural advisory and extension approaches: 42% among them use agricultural extension approach, while 32% use advice to the family farm approach, 21% use organizational capacity building advice and 5%, demand driven approaches. The terms for providing these agricultural extension and advisory services depend on the rationalities of each of these providers. Some agricultural extension and advisory services providers (NGOs, CIGs) promote agroecology through the diffusion of organic inputs, while others promote conventional agriculture through the popularization of synthetic chemical inputs. Access to services by beneficiaries are either paid-offerings or free-offerings. Findings also reveal that in some cases, the actions of some of these providers in the field are intertwined and lead to a collaborative relationship, while in other cases providers work completely compartmentalized leading to negative effects and low performance of the local agricultural extension and advisory system.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The advent of private providers has increased the number of actors with various profiles leading to potential advantages (e.g., includes access to agricultural information). Yet these potentials have not yet been fully valorized in the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services to farmers. And the needs of farmers have only been partially met. It would be equally crucial to factor climate risks as integral part of extension and advisory services.</jats:p>"

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have lagged behind larger corporations due to a number of factors. Chief among these factors is the lack of resources and capabilities. In this study, we investigate whether entrepreneurial orientation as a distinctive firm‐level resource contributes to the successful implementation of GSCM practices within SMEs. We use primary data obtained from 316 manufacturing SMEs and analyze the data by using a fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Our findings show four equifinal configurations of GSCM practices and the components of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) that lead to high environmental performance. Two practices, “eco‐design” and “internal environmental management”, are present in all configurations, with the latter being the single core condition. The components of EO are present in all the configurations. Three distinct configurations lead to the simultaneous achievement of high environmental performance and high economic performance. Some noticeable differences appear in these configurations: “internal environmental management” is no longer a core condition, instead external practices (“green purchasing,” “cooperation with customers including environmental requirements,” and “investment recovery”) and “risk‐taking” become core conditions. We exptrapolate our findings into a set of propositions that expand theory on the link between entrepreneurial orientation and sustainable performance. Our study provides insights for managers who seek to infuse entrepreneurial thoughts and actions into their green supply chain initiatives.</jats:p>",

The objective of this research is to optimize the nozzle cooling system method in the machining performance of Aluminum alloy 319 to achieve good surface roughness, low-temperature reading, and less insert wear by selecting machining parameters appropriate to cutting speed, cutting depth, and feed rate. The variety of orifice nozzle measurements used from nozzles 1.0 mm to 5.0 mm with the use of different machining parameters (cutting and spindle speed and with fixed cutting depth) using on CNC lathe condition. This method is done by the basic reaction surface (RSM), which is one of the alternative methods to minimize the cutting process that can be done at high cutting speed in which the temperature can minimize the formation of wear on the insert. Built-in edges and thermal construction can reduce the roughness of the work surface. The results of this research the smallest orifice nozzle used able to minimize the thermal impact and reduce the temperature that causes the arrangement of lower build edges (BUE). Therefore, better surface roughness, minimum insert use as well as low temperatures can be achieved. This is because the direction of the coolant can be directed at a point that can remove heat from the chips. The use of cutting fluid from the smallest nozzle size and technical conditions in the machining process can also be offered to obtain productivity, high-quality products, lower costs as well as minimize environmental impact (refrigerant waste is generated). This research is very useful to minimize the cost of the machining process budget and also increase productivity in the machining industry and can also decrease the dependency of machine operators on the skills and knowledge available.</jats:p>",

It is a mitigation tool to mitigate power interruption. The UPS circuit consists of a bidirectional buck-boost DC-DC converter, a rechargeable battery and a DC-AC/AC-DC converter. The bidirectional DC-DC converter has a function of charging (buck) or discharging (boost) the battery for maintaining DC-link voltage connected to the DC-AC/AC-DC converter. During the normal mode operation, the DC-AC/AC-DC converter supplies voltage to the bidirectional converter by performing AC to DC conversion. Instead, during the backup mode, the converter supplies voltage to the load by performing DC to AC conversion. In this work, a single-loop voltage control algorithm regulates the bidirectional converter. For the DC-AC/AC-DC converter, a multi-loop control algorithm regulates the output current using the inner loop and the output voltage using the outer loop. MATLAB/Simulink simulates the UPS to determine its performance during normal and backup mode operation. From the simulation results, both independent control algorithms can regulate the operation of both converters during both modes of operation. As a result, the UPS system is capable of supplying sinusoidal waveforms with low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of output current and output voltage. Both THD values are below 4%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Improving water security is critical to delivering the best outcomes for development. In Ethiopia, the upper Awash sub-basin supports expanding urban and industrial areas, with increasing water demands. Studies have preferentially focused either on surface water hydrology or on groundwater characterization. However, novel tools are required to support the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for competing users under potential climate change impacts. In this paper, we present research based on a WEAP-MODFLOW link configured for four catchments in the upper Awash sub-basin (Akaki, Melka Kunture, Mojo, and Koka). The Akaki catchment supplies water for Addis Ababa city. Unlike most surface water hydrological models, both supply (surface water and groundwater) and demand (domestic, industrial, and livestock) are modeled. The tool was used to evaluate the impacts of population growth, leakage, expansion of surface and groundwater supply schemes, and climate change scenarios up to the year 2030. Considering the high population growth rate scenario for Addis Ababa city, the unmet domestic water demand may increase to 760 MCM in 2030. Water leakage through poor water supply distribution networks contributed about 23% of the unmet water demand. Though not significant compared with population and water loss stresses, climate change also affect the supply demand condition in the basin. Planning for more groundwater abstraction without considering additional surface water reservoir schemes will noticeably impact the groundwater resource, with groundwater levels projected to decline by more than 20 m. Even more groundwater level decline is observed In the Akaki catchment, where Addis Ababa city is located. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater not only boosts the supply demand situation in the basin but will lift off some of the stresses from the groundwater resources. Even under the likely increase in temperature and low precipitation climate scenarios, the conjunctive use resulted in a significant increase in domestic water demand coverage from 26% for the reference condition to 90% in 2030, with minimum effect on the groundwater resources. To improve water security conditions through sustainable utilization of both surface and groundwater resources, policy responses need to consider surface and groundwater conjunctive use. Minimizing water leakage should also be given the highest priority.</jats:p>"

However, due to spatio‐temporal dependencies pertaining to demand and supply‐demand gap in a ride‐hailing system, making accurate forecasts for both demand and supply‐demand gap is a difficult task. Furthermore, due to confidentiality and privacy issues, ride‐hailing data are sometimes released to the researchers by removing spatial adjacency information of the zones, which hinders the detection of spatio‐temporal dependencies. To that end, a novel spatio‐temporal deep learning architecture is proposed in this paper for forecasting demand and supply‐demand gap in a ride‐hailing system with anonymised spatial adjacency information, which integrates feature importance layer with a spatio‐temporal deep learning architecture containing 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and zone‐distributed independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN). The developed architecture is tested with real‐world datasets of Didi Chuxing, which shows that the models based on the proposed architecture can outperform conventional time‐series models (e.g. ARIMA) and machine learning models (e.g. gradient boosting machine, distributed random forest, generalized linear model, artificial neural network). Additionally, the feature importance layer provides an interpretation of the model by revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction.</jats:p>",

We used greenhouse, field and laboratory experiments to evaluate the role of organic acids in the occurrence of Fusarium wilt of faba bean to confirm the mechanism of rational application of nitrogen (N) and intercropping to alleviate Fusarium wilt. We investigated the response of organic acids exuded from the roots of faba bean to different N levels and cropping patterns (monocropping and intercropping with wheat). The results showed that the application of N and intercropping with wheat could control the Fusarium wilt of faba bean, which was closely related to the components and quantity of organic acids exuded from its roots. Among them, tartaric acid and malic acid are the most abundant and important, because they have a significant inhibitory effect on the growth and reproduction of FOF and substantially aid in the control of Fusarium wilt. The application of 90 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of N combined with wheat intercropping significantly controlled the Fusarium wilt and increased the grain yield of faba bean.

Building on the literature on organizational responses to external demands and behavioral ethics, this study addresses this issue to better understand how external pressures and managerial decision-making are associated with the scope of trade-control compliance programs. Based on a sample of 289 SMEs, the findings show that the organizational responses of SMEs reflect proportionate adjustments to regulatory pressures but only if decision-makers are well informed and aware of the prevailing rules and regulations. Conversely, uninformed decision-making leads to a disproportionate response resulting in an inadequately reduced scope of the compliance program. In addition, the results indicate that SMEs that are highly integrated into supply chains are susceptible to passing-the-buck behavior.</jats:p>",

Fostering subsistence agriculture through the production and home-grown consumption (HGC) of fruits and vegetables are seen as potential strategies for improving overall FVC, in particular, for developing countries like India. In addition, educational strategies targeting FVC health literacy are also used. Little evidence has documented a connection between these two strategies. We examine the single and combined influence of HGC and health literacy with regard to benefits from fruits and vegetable consumption. Data were collected from 427 rural households in the state of Odisha, India. Three outcomes were examined: FVC, as well as fruit and vegetables separately. Linear and Poisson regression were used to examine the association among home-grown consumption (HGC), FVC health literacy, and the FVC outcomes. Findings show that HGC, but not FVC health literacy, was directly associated with FVC (β = 0.65, SE = 0.10, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.008) and vegetable consumption (β = 0.57, SE = 0.11, p = 0.02).

In addition, HGC effect is concentrated among participants who reported low FVC health literacy, especially on overall FVC and vegetables alone. Results are discussed in relation to the beneficial role played by HGC in those particularly vulnerable households who perceived little FVC health literacy. Our results provide insights on novel improved FVC consumption across all population segments. Future research should explore the complex interplay between agricultural policies and educational programs in the design of interventions promoting fruit and vegetable production and consumption.</jats:p>"

The impact of precipitation variability is more pronounced in ecosystems where sensitive vegetation is apparent. Therefore, understanding the relationship between precipitation and vegetation is vital to guide appropriate measures towards fragile biomes. We investigated the trends and correlations between precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for 1982–2015 over the Kunhar River basin, Pakistan, using satellite-derived NDVI and globally available interpolated precipitation datasets. Subsequently, we attempt to identify vegetation types that are influenced by precipitation changes. Results show a general decreasing trend in vegetation activity as we go from southern to northern portions of the basin. This decrease is also accompanied by the similarly decreasing precipitation trend in the same direction. The similarity of spatial patterns between the two variables can indicate that, in general, precipitation is playing a guiding role in determining vegetation distribution in the basin. Our lagged correlation analysis revealed that strong precipitation–vegetation correlations (r &amp;gt; 0.75) are rare in the basin. Agricultural and forested areas show moderate correlations (0.5 &amp;lt; r &amp;lt; 0.75) when NDVI is correlated with the previous month's precipitation values (lag1). In simultaneous month correlation (lag0) and the rest of the lagged correlations (lag2 and lag3), a weak association between precipitation and NDVI is observed. The moderate and weak correlations over the basin might indicate that precipitation is not the only factor influencing vegetation growth in the Kunhar River basin. Other climatic and biogeographic factors such as temperature, solar radiation, topography and soil characteristics also play additional roles in vegetation activities. The results can provide a technical basis and valuable reference to ecological management strategies in the Kunhar River basin for concerned decision-makers and stakeholders.</jats:p>",

Manufacturing industries in developing countries such as Pakistan are under severe economic pressure and striving to boost sustainable supply chain practices for achieving business excellence. In this context, the objectives of the present research are to examine the critical supply chain risks associated with sustainable development goals, namely social, economic, and environmental factors. The failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) technique is employed for categorizing the risk factors and Pareto analysis for highlighting the more crucial and risky factors. For this purpose, a large-scale survey was carried out in the textile industries of Pakistan to develop a risk mitigation model for sustainability-related risks and vulnerability in a textile supply chain (TSC). It captures the input expressions of experts for risk factors, namely severity (s), occurrence (o), and detection (d) for calculating the risk priority numbers (RPNs) of identified alternatives. The results depict that endogenous environmental risks categorize as the most significant for the textile manufacturing industries, and the interfaces between the various risks associated with sustainability-related are also found very high. This study would be a toolkit for the industrial managers and policy-makers for creating sustainable manufacturing culture on organizational premises.</jats:p>",

A multichannel supply chain model is constructed in this work under the flat carbon tax policy and progressive carbon tax policy. The complexity of the supply chain under the channel heterogeneity expectations is studied. The impacts of consumers’ dual preferences and the free-riding of each channel on the system complexity, profits, carbon emissions and social welfare are explored. This study indicates that the supply chain order quantity system under the two types of carbon tax policies will enter into an unstable state with changes in consumers’ preferences and free-riding parameters. In order to positively impact on the profits of all parties, government revenue, consumer surplus, and the environment, the system should be kept in stable region. Consumers’ preferences and free-riding have more obvious influence on the social welfare under the progressive emission carbon tax policy than the flat carbon tax policy. In contrast to the flat carbon tax policy, the progressive carbon tax policy can delay or even prevent the order quantity system from entering into the bifurcation and chaos area, and the chaos control effect under the progressive carbon tax policy is better. The present work expands the practical application scenarios of complex system theory and thereby has an important theoretical and practical value.</jats:p>",

The matter of this investigation was to evaluate how pandemic fear and guidelines for limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus could have impacted the regular supply of radiotherapy (RT) and the outcome of the treatments. Materials and Methods. From March 9, 2020, to May 29, 2020, a register has been established to record patients that cancelled or postponed the RT appointment. The reasons were as follows: (1) patients whose appointments were postponed by the staff according to national guidelines; (2) patients who asked themselves to postpone the appointment; (3) patients who interrupted the treatment for causes directly or indirectly related to the pandemic; (4) patients who cancelled their care path. Results. A total number of 277 patients started regular RT, and 384 respected their computed tomography (CT) simulation appointment, but 60 of them had alteration of their therapeutic pathway.

So the study tried to investigate labour supply and employment opportunity in rural areas due to COVID-19-led reverse migration and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on employment status, income profile and livelihood of returned migrants in Odisha. The study also discusses the possible measures to create alternative livelihood by rebuilding the rural economy after COVID-19. Both secondary and primary data are used in the study. Descriptive statistics and regression model are used in the study to examine the vulnerability of migrants during the period of COVID-19. The study found a sudden rise in labour supply with a huge scale is catch sight of the rural economy of Odisha. Job loss is the biggest problem faced by migrants followed by income loss. The study found that income of migrants, household income excluding migrants and nature of work have significant impact on the vulnerability of migrants. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification Codes: J21, J22, J46 </jats:p>",

While much research focuses on understanding the role of personality-level traits for those who share the news, such as partisanship and analytic thinking, characteristics of the articles themselves have not been studied. Across two pre-registered studies, we examined whether character-deprecation headlines – headlines designed to deprecate someone’s character, but which have no impact on policy or legislation – increased the likelihood of self-reported sharing on social media. In Study 1 we harvested fake news items from online sources and compared sharing intentions between Republicans and Democrats. Results showed that, compared to Democrats, Republicans had greater intention to share character-deprecation headlines compared to news with policy implications. We then applied these findings experimentally. In Study 2 we developed a set of fake news items that was matched for content across pro-Democratic and pro-Republican headlines and across news focusing on a specific person (e.g., Trump) versus a generic person (e.g., a Republican). We found that, contrary to Study 1, Republicans were no more inclined toward character deprecation than Democrats. However, these findings suggest that while character assassination may be a feature of pro-Republican news, it is not more attractive to Republicans versus Democrats. News with policy implications, whether fake or real, seems consistently more attractive to members of both parties regardless of whether it attempts to deprecate an opponent’s character. Thus, character deprecation in fake news may in be in supply, but not in demand. </jats:p>",

This study presents a surface-groundwater framework for water resources modelling of ill-posed problems in hydrogeologically data-scarce areas. The proposed framework is based on the application of a conceptual water balance model and composed of surface hydrological (UTHBAL) and groundwater flow simulation with the integration of a Newton formulation of the MODFLOW-2005 code (MODFLOW-NWT) and PEST suite modules. The groundwater simulation includes a preprocessor tool for automated calibration and a post-processor tool for automated validation. The methodology was applied to a rural region of Central Greece, Lake Karla Basin, which is degraded due to groundwater resources overexploitation to cover irrigation water demands. The aquifer is modelled focusing on a precise simulation–validation procedure of the conceptual model. The groundwater model was calibrated with the calibration preprocessor tool for spatially distributed hydraulic conductivity with the pilot points method. The calibration process achieved satisfactory results as validated by the post-process analysis of observed and simulated water levels. The findings for the groundwater budget indicate that the groundwater system is still under intense pressure even though farming activity in recent years has turned to less water-intensive crops.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHT</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>My research deals with the pilot points method on groundwater modelling in an area with scarce hydrogeologic data.</jats:p>",

With the rapid development of high-speed railway in recent years, this problem is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, it is urgent to analyse the negative sequence of the urban power grid caused by TPSS (Traction Power Supply System). Usually, the mathematical and simulation model of TPSS is established to analyse the power quality of TPSS. However, the modelling process is usually simplified, and the load of TPSS has randomness and volatility, which makes the simulation results deviate from the actual results. Therefore, based on the measured data of TPSS loads and the method of dynamic power flow calculation, considering the factors of station number, common phase of traction transformer and train marshal, the negative sequence influence of TPSS on the whole urban power grid under different conditions is analysed in this paper. Finally, the feasibility of alternation commutation phase to weaken negative sequence voltage is verified.</jats:p>",

However, DW RL supply chains (RLSCs) were found to be suffering from uncertainties, information deficiencies, and uncoordinated material flows. Improving supply chain integration (SCI), specifically external integration, across DW RLSCs was identified as a possible solution to overcome such problems. Despite this, studies that focus on external integration in DW RLSCs are limited. Using a systematic literature review (SLR), this study explores external integration in DW RLSCs. Sixty-six articles from three databases published between 2006 and 2020 were subjected to descriptive and content analysis. Arrangement of material, information, and financial flows across DW RLSCs, inhibitors of external integration, and potential measures for improving external integration were analyzed. Accordingly, material, information, and financial flows across DW RLSCs were mapped, and inhibitors of external integration, along with potential measures for improving external integration were identified. As the key outcome of this SLR, these findings were developed into a conceptual framework, which shows the main factors that inhibit and improve external integration in DW RLSCs. The framework will be useful in guiding further empirical research and informing industry practice. Several future research directions are also proposed to expand knowledge around the research domain. </jats:p>",

The renewable energy-based power plants is developed in order to stop dependence of electricity supply from outside Bali and to increase the share of renewable energy in the power supply mix to achieve Bali green and independent electricity and for climate change mitigation. . In this study, AIM-Enduse model was used to estimate the potential of renewable energy-based power plants and GHG emissions reduction from the deployment of renewables in Bali’s power supply mix. There were three scenarios for representing renewable energy-based power plants development in Bali, i.e. baseline (business as usual) and two scenarios (CM1 and CM2) of the deployment of renewables in the power supply mix. The CM1 described conservative scenario of the deployment of renewable in the energy supply mix of Bali’s power plants while CM2 represented optimistic scenario. Since the renewable is considered as carbon neutral, therefore these scenarios can also relate to the mitigation actions to reduce GHG emissions. Under the CM1, GHG emissions reduction potential from the deployment of renewable energy technology in Bali’s power plants and the conversion of coal to natural gas power plants is accounted to about 22% (1.5 MtCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e) in 2030 and can be targeted up to 32% (4.0 MtCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e) in 2050. The deployment of renewable energy under the CM1 is 0.96 GW in 2030 and 1.92 GW in 2050. Under the CM2, the GHG emissions reduction potential from the deployment of renewable energy technology in Bali’s power plants and the conversion of coal to natural gas power plants is accounted to about 23% (2.16 MtCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e) in 2030 and targeted to achieve 27% (4.75 MtCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>e) in 2050.

Grid-connected parking lot spaces are the most common charging option due to their technological readiness and convenience of adoption. Since the batteries aggregated by parking lots can be regarded as virtual energy storage, grid-connected parking lots are expected to provide many benefits to the urban distribution grid. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodological framework to evaluate the potential benefits and costs of utilizing grid-connected parking lot infrastructures to promote energy supply sustainability in future power distribution grids. Capacity-value-based and cost-effectiveness indexes are developed, which quantify the potential contribution of parking lots to power supply reliability and the associated economic implications. To realistically describe the available generation capacity of parking lot resources, a comprehensive model is presented, which explicitly considers the impact of external stimuli (incentive rates) on the behavioral patterns of lot users. Vehicle user responsiveness to incentive grades is derived from social field surveys. To conduct the evaluation, a hybrid algorithm based on Monte Carlo simulations is employed. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a real distribution grid in Beijing. The results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach and support practical policy suggestions.</jats:p>"

These risks, such as drastic changes in demand, machine failures, or systems not properly configured, can lead to planning or execution issues in the supply chain. It is too expensive to have planners continually track all situations at a granular level to ensure that no deviations or configuration problems occur. We present a machine learning system that predicts service-level failures a few weeks in advance and alerts the planners. The system includes a user interface that explains the alerts and helps to identify failure fixes. We conducted this research in cooperation with Michelin. Through experiments carried out over the course of four phases, we confirmed that machine learning can help predict service-level failures. In our last experiment, planners were able to use these predictions to make adjustments on tires for which failures were predicted, resulting in an improvement in the service level of 10 percentage points. Additionally, the system enabled planners to identify recurrent issues in their supply chain, such as safety-stock computation problems, impacting the overall supply chain efficiency. The proposed system showcases the importance of reducing the silos in supply chain management. </jats:p>",

As large-scale simulations require substantial computational power and have long run times, most often a sample of the full population and downscaled road capacities are used as simulation inputs, and then the simulation outcomes are scaled up. Using a massively parallelized mobility model on a large-scale test case of the whole of Switzerland, which includes 3.5 million private vehicles and 1.7 million users of public transit, we have systematically quantified, from 6 105 simulations of a weekday, the impacts of scaled input data on simulation outputs. We show, from simulations with population samples ranging from 1% to 100% of the full population and corresponding scaling of the traffic network, that the simulated traffic dynamics are driven primarily by the flow capacity, rather than the spatial properties, of the traffic network. Using a new measure of traffic similarity, that is based on the chi-squared test statistic, it is shown that the dynamics of the vehicular traffic and the occupancy of the public transit are adversely impacted when population samples less than 30% of the full population are used. Moreover, we present evidence that the adverse impact of population sampling is determined mostly by the patterns of the agents’ behaviour rather than by the traffic model.</jats:p>",

Thereby, the objective of this work was to evaluate empirical modeling efficiency in predicting the turbidity removal dynamic using artificial neural networks applied to a DAF prototype. For the study of the neural network input variables, a two-level, full-factorial design was utilized to verify the statistical significance of the saturation pressure and the saturated water flow rate in relation to the turbidity removal. Using a time-delay recurrent neural network architecture, two empirical models were proposed to simulate the dynamic behavior of the turbidity removal promoted by the DAF prototype. The real-time model provided good predictions with R = 0.9717 and MSE = 1.0482, and the simulation model was also able to predict the process behavior presenting performance criteria equal to R = 0.9475 and MSE = 1.8640.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to determine the production capacity of the gas field. Gas well deliverability tests are conducted to determine the production capability of gas wells. The deliverability test performed on this layer uses the modified isochronal test method. AOFP analysis was carried out using conventional methods. This deliverability test is carried out in the “X” layer which is classified as a dry gas reservoir. Based on the deliverability test analysis, it can be seen that this layer has gas reserves of 2420425 MMSCF and has five wells still in production. The gas well has a value of n = 0.645810875 and a value of C = 0.014353581 MMSCFD / psi2. From the results of the discussion it can be concluded that the gas well in the field has a good productivity with an AOFP 38.34201321 MMSCFD. This shows that the potential for gas reserves in the area is still quite large.</jats:p>",

This paper presents messages learnt from country assessments that took place prior to the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These messages remain relevant post-COVID-19, with greater priority being given to the challenges for national NTD programmes in continuing to deliver mass drug administration (MDA) during the pandemic. Stakeholder coordination from the earliest stages of the pandemic has occurred at two levels: in the first mile with global partners of the NTD Supply Chain Forum and in the last mile with implementing partners in each country. This has been instrumental to manage delayed MDA, including the impact delays have on the shipment of NTD donated drugs and the distribution of stock held in country. The Ascend West and Central Africa programme is supporting countries with the resumption of MDA through a risk assessment and mitigation action (RAMA) process.</jats:p>",

This ambivalence is a result of an empirical focus on the effects of these programs on target communities, as opposed to an empirical focus on the people who are responsible for developing those programs. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork among people tasked with designing, promoting, and enforcing sustainability standards in global agricultural supply chains, I argue that the empowerment of multinational corporations and well-funded environmental NGOs that characterizes market-oriented sustainability programs is, in fact, intentional. This intention reflects the belief among sustainability professionals that the intersection of western scientific expertise with the dynamics of “the market” is the most effective way to promote sustainability in global supply chains, and to generate global sustainability in a more general sense. Concepts like “stakeholder engagement” and a commitment to flexibility and accommodation in the development and adoption of social and environmental standards are examples of what I call euphemistic sustainability, which shifts critical attention away from a balance of power that is increasingly tilted toward private interests, even as that imbalance remains an intended outcome of non-state market-driven governance systems like ostensibly voluntary sustainability standards. </jats:p>",

We investigated the course patterns of the venous plexus in the floor of the oral cavity and analyzed their relationships to those of the arteries using 23 human cadavers (41 halves) in the anatomy course at Niigata University during 2016–2018. The venous plexus in the floor of the oral cavity comprised the perforating submental vein, the vena comitans of the hypoglossal nerve, the vena comitans of the submandibular duct, the vena comitans of the lingual nerve, the sublingual vein, and the deep lingual vein. Individual variations of this plexus include duplications or absences of some veins. There is a high incidence of a submental branch running above the mylohyoid or perforating submental artery in the sublingual fossa among individuals with the perforating submental vein piercing the mylohyoid muscle, whereas the sublingual artery has a high incidence there when there is no perforating submental vein. The course patterns of arteries in the floor of the oral cavity can be predicted by estimating the course patterns of the submental veins. The course patterns of the submental veins or veins associated with the nerves and submandibular duct need to be carefully considered during surgery.</jats:p>",

In <jats:italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</jats:italic>, the production of OA had been previously achieved by rational engineering of the fatty acid synthase. For the supply of the precursor molecule acetyl‐CoA and of the redox cofactor NADPH, the native pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass had been harnessed, or the cells had been additionally provided with a pathway involving a heterologous ATP‐citrate lyase. Here, we redirected the flux of glucose towards the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and overexpressed a heterologous phosphoketolase/phosphotransacetylase shunt to improve the supply of NADPH and acetyl‐CoA in a strain background with abolished OA degradation. We show that these modifications lead to an increased yield of OA during the consumption of glucose by more than 60% compared to the parental strain. Furthermore, we investigated different genetic engineering targets to identify potential factors that limit the OA production in yeast. Toxicity assays performed with the engineered strains suggest that the inhibitory effects of OA on cell growth likely impose an upper limit to attainable OA yields.</jats:p>",

However, in some arid and water deficient areas, the shortage of water resources is a crucial factor affecting regional economic development and population growth. Therefore, it is essential to reliably predict the future water consumption data of a region. Aiming at the problems of poor prediction accuracy and overfitting of non-growth series in traditional grey prediction, this paper uses residual grey model combined with Markov chain correction to predict domestic water consumption. Based on the traditional grey theory prediction, the residual grey prediction model is established. Combined with the Markov state transition matrix, the grey prediction value is modified, and the model is applied to the prediction of domestic water consumption in Shaanxi Province from 2003 to 2019. The fitting results show that the accuracy grade of the improved residual grey prediction model is “good”. This shows that the dynamic unbiased grey Markov model can eliminate the inherent error of the traditional grey GM (1,1) model, improve the prediction accuracy, have better reliability, and can provide a new method for water consumption prediction.</jats:p>",

According to the World Bank, oil palm was the main contributor of GDP for Malaysia agriculture. Climate change affects oil palm growth and productivity in a number of ways, including reduction in sex-ration, disrupts the pollination process, abortion of newly produced inflorescence, drops in productivity, and increase in ranges and distribution of pests and diseases. Much of the economic researches devoted to employ production function and Ricardian approach. This study, therefore, focuses to model the effect of climate change on oil palm production by using supply response approach. An annual time series data used for the period of 37 years starting from 1980 until 2016, and Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) co-integration_-employed in achieving the objective of the study. Six econometric models consisting of linear and non-linear equations were constructed by incorporating temperature and rainfall as proxies for climate variable to estimate the yield response model. The results revealed that oil palm production was very negatively affected by changes in temperature compared to changes in rainfall. Meanwhile, the planted area and own price upsurge the supply of palm oil. The results also indicated that Model 3 and Model 6 were the best model to represent the linear and non-linear effect of climate_change on oil palm production, respectively. Quantifying the impact of climate change on palm oil production can help policy makers and relevant stakeholders to determine the best adaptation and mitigation measures.</jats:p>",

The proposed approach is an exploratory application of the geometric algebra power theory (GAPoT) to multiple-phase systems. A definition of geometric apparent power for three-phase systems, that complies with the energy conservation principle, is also introduced. Power calculations are performed in a multi-dimensional Euclidean space where cross effects between voltage and current harmonics are taken into consideration. By using the proposed framework, the current can be easily geometrically decomposed into active- and non-active components for current compensation purposes. The paper includes detailed examples in which electrical circuits are solved and the results are analysed. This work is a first step towards a more advanced polyphase proposal that can be applied to systems under real operation conditions, where unbalance and asymmetry is considered.</jats:p>"

The use of galactagogues during lactation is becoming increasingly common despite limited evidence regarding effectiveness and safety, and no definitive recommendations for use in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to explore factors influencing women’s decisions to use galactagogues during lactation. Twenty-two semi-structured interviews were conducted in October and November 2019 (over the telephone or in person) with participants located in most Australian states and territories, including metro and regional areas. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using NVivo. Analysis revealed that following a concern about breast milk supply, the decision to use galactagogues was influenced by three core and interrelated domains: access to and quality of breastfeeding support, maternal agency and determination to provide breast milk. Women revealed many problematic experiences with health care professionals that left them feeling dismissed and confused due to provision of inconsistent and insufficient information that was sometimes at odds with their desire to provide breast milk. In this instance, some women turned to galactagogues to regain agency. A range of broader dimensions influencing decision-making also emerged. These were separated into categories that emphasise distinctions relating to breast milk supply, which included: maternal emotional wellbeing, social norms and pressures, concerns about infant development, maternal physical health and lactation history, as well as those relating specifically to galactagogue use, including: desire for a guaranteed/urgent response, risk-risk trade-off, acceptance and trust, and accessibility and cost. In understanding the complexity of decision-making concerning these substances, we identify opportunities to improve breastfeeding counselling and support. We recommend that support be individually tailored to manage conflicting information, adopt communication styles that encourage trust and processes that enable shared decision-making to enhance or restore maternal agency. There is also considerable need to address evidence gaps regarding the effectiveness and safety of commonly used galactagogues, so that women can be appropriately counselled about potential benefits and harms.</jats:p>"

The main results of the study show that two levels of KPI can be defined: technology specific and overall DHC system.

The design of new technological pipelines and the modernization of existing pipeline systems for transporting fuel oil involves hydraulic calculations. Generally accepted in practice is the hydraulic calculation of pipeline lines based on the flow continuity equation and the Bernoulli equation for a real viscous liquid, which takes into account the pressure loss due to friction and to overcome local pipeline resistances. With this approach, hydraulic calculation is a multi-variant task, since there are an infinite number of combinations of parameters pipeline diameter - pressure drop, which are not equal from both economic and technical points of view. Research of literature sources has shown the feasibility of conducting hydraulic calculation of pipe-wire lines on technical and economic indicators. As a criterion for optimization of technological pipelines, the total annual costs for the creation and operation of the pipeline, which are a linear superposition of capital and operational costs, are proposed. The paper offers calculation relations for determining the optimal diameter of the pipeline from the condition of minimum total annual costs for its creation and operation, taking into account current prices and tariffs for the pipeline and electricity, pipeline tracing, conditions of its operation, as well as the properties of the transported medium. On the example of a hydraulic installation for pumping fuel oil, computational experiments were performed to assess the influence of the pipeline diameter on its technical and economic indicators and determine the optimal parameters of the fuel oil pipeline.</jats:p>",

Blockchain technology has recently gained popularity and it is increasingly being employed in a large number of applications and industries. The use cases for blockchain are growing rapidly in different fields and domains. Combining blockchain into IIoT and in our supply chain logistics could provide many solutions to the critical issues that current systems face today. Blockchain features such as immutability, decentralization, and data encryption are useful in solving the shortcomings of IIoT and the current supply chain systems security and integrity. This article presents a comprehensive review of blockchain applications in IIoT and supply chain systems.

The unpredictability of composition may result in an increased risk of overdose due to unexpected elevated concentrations of the high-potency drug. Using data from a community-based drug-checking project, we evaluated trends in fentanyl concentration of illicit opioids in the context of an overdose epidemic. Using a quantification model for fentanyl hydrochloride, historical Fourier-transform infrared spectra from opioid drug-checking samples were analyzed to determine fentanyl concentrations. Median monthly fentanyl concentrations were plotted, and polynomial and autoregressive time-series analyses were performed to examine trends over time. A total of 3,621 fentanyl-positive samples were included in the study, spanning November 2017 to December 2019. Monthly median fentanyl concentrations ranged from 4.5% to 10.4%. Time-series analyses indicated that a third-degree polynomial model fit the data well (R2 = 0.639), suggesting a cyclical pattern in median concentration over time. Notably, absolute variance in fentanyl concentration decreased by an average 0.1% per month (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Future research should explore the relationship between fentanyl concentration and overdose to identify potential targeted harm-reduction interventions that can respond to changes in observed fentanyl concentration.</jats:p>",

Consumers are fed gravitationally from the water tower, with variable demand over 24 hours. Simulations were carried out in EPANET 2.2 using two methods: Demand Driven Analysis (DDA) with outflow issuing from emitters, and Pressure Driven Analysis (PDA). To minimize numerical instabilities, a particular attention was paid to the groundwater well (modelled both with variable, and constant hydrodynamic level), as well as to the connection of the water tower to WDS (where the connection was made either using 2 pipes, or a single pipe). By applying the DDA and PDA methods to the resulting 2×2 configurations of the hydraulic system, a total of 8 sets of simulations (solutions) were obtained and compared. The most advantageous pair of method and configuration is recommended to be considered when modelling a complex (e.g. urban size) WDS with groundwater supply and storage tanks.</jats:p>",

Atrazine is an organic pollutant widely applied as a pesticide and it is a potential chemical hazard present in water sources, which cause water pollution and negative effects on aquatic life and human health, due to its high solubility and persistence in soil. However, for developing countries, monitoring and quantification of atrazine can be complex and costly; thus, to contribute to establishing strategies for risk assessment in water supply watersheds, it was evaluated the potential use of an easy, rapid and low-cost technique such as ultraviolet (UV) absorbance to identify the presence of atrazine. It was conformed distilled and surface water samples doped with Atrazine, and there were correlated with the UV typical spectrum indicator of organic material presence (wavelength λ: 200 - 300 nm). The optimal λ range was 203 - 223 nm to identify this substance at levels possible to be found in surface sources, being UV223 more adequate than UV254, which is more used to identify the presence of natural organic matter, which shows that UV223 is a complementary tool to chemical risk assessment for atrazine in drinking water supply systems.</jats:p>"

It evaluates the understanding of AMR (and drug-resistant infections) as a food system challenge and critically explores how responsibility for addressing it is framed and implemented. We place the spotlight on the AMR strategies applied in UK retailers’ domestic poultry and pork supply chains. This provides a timely analysis of corporate engagement with AMR in light of the 2016 O’Neill report on Tackling Drug Resistant Infections Globally, which positioned supermarket chains, processors, and regulators as holding key responsibilities. Research included interviews with retailers, industry bodies, policy makers, farmers, processors, consultants and campaigners. We evaluate how strategy for tackling AMR in the food system is focused on antimicrobial stewardship, particularly targets for reducing antibiotic use in domestic food production. The global value chain notion of multipolar governance, where influence derives from multiple nodes both inside and outside the supply chain, is blended with more-than-human assemblage perspectives to capture the implementation of targets. This conceptual fusion grasps how supply chain responsibility and influence works through both a distributed group of stakeholders and the ecological complexity of the AMR challenge. The paper demonstrates in turn: how the targets for reducing antibiotic use in domestic meat production represent a particular and narrowly defined strategic focus; how those targets have been met through distributed agency in the UK supply chain; and the geographical and biological limitations of the targets in tackling AMR as a wicked problem. </jats:p>",

Initially, meat and meat products' prices increased due to less production and increased demand because of panic buying. Whereas, later on, both meat production and demand were significantly decreased due to lockdown restrictions and lower purchasing power of the consumers that results in a decrease in meat prices. In early April 2020, meat packing facilities started to shut down due to the rapid spread of the COVID-19 virus among workers. Furthermore, meat producers and processors faced difficulty in harvesting and shipment of the products due to lockdown situations, decrease in labor force, restrictions in movement of animals within and across the country and change in legislation of local and international export market. These conditions adversely impacted the meat industry due to decrease in meat production, processing and distribution facilities. It is suggested that the integration among all the meat industry stakeholders is quite essential for the sustainability of the industry's supply chain to cope with such devastating conditions the future may hold. This review aimed to discuss different aspects of the meat industry and supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed some future directions.</jats:p>"

An optimal design of the system is realized thanks to a double-objective optimization based on a proposed operational strategy of the system and on Firefly Algorithm (FA). The system is designed for household energy supply in three different towns of the northern part of Cameroon. For different LPSP (Loss of Power Supply Probability), the double objective simulation determines the optimal configurations of the system with their related cost. The optimal and reliable PV/Battery subsystem configuration corresponding to LPSP of 0% obtained for one household is composed for the towns of Maroua and Garoua by 8 PV modules and a battery capacity of 11.304 kWh with 1-day autonomy. For the town of Ngaoundéré, it is composed by 10 PV modules and battery capacity of 11.304 kWh with 1-day autonomy. The related investment costs corresponding to these optimal configurations are USD 6225.6 for Maroua and Garoua and USD 7136.6 for Ngaoundéré. The great proportion of the monthly energy demand consumed by the load is provided by the PV/Battery system. The monthly PV/Battery energy represents 60.385% to 72.546% of the load consumed in Maroua, 58.371% to 71.855% of the load consumed in Garoua, and 61.233% to 74.160% of the load consumed in Ngaoundéré. The annual main grid energy consumed for one household is 1299.524 kWh in Maroua, 1352.818 kWh in Garoua, and 1260.876 kWh in Ngaoundéré. Moreover, the annual PV/Battery energy consumed for one household is 1580.730 kWh in Maroua, 1527.815 kWh in Garoua, and 1619.530 kWh in Ngaoundéré. Thus, the PV/Battery system, by reducing the grid energy consumption, acts as the principal source of energy of the whole system. The time the PV/Battery/Grid-connected system needs to be economically more advantageous than the electric grid without blackouts is 17 years for Maroua and 18 years for both Garoua and Ngaoundéré. It is demonstrated in this paper that the hybrid PV/Battery/Grid-connected system is an effective solution for electrical load shedding in sub-Saharan zones. This system is very useful for grid energy consumption reduction. For a long-term investment, the PV/Battery/Grid-connected system is more economically advantageous than the main grid alone.</jats:p>"

The use of various masks is the most important social tool against this virus. Given the importance of rapid and quality supply of masks in the current situation, it is necessary to study supply chain in particular. In this research, the design of a closed chain supply chain network for different types of masks is assessed. The studied supply chain includes suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers in the forward flow and collection centers, separate centers, recycling centers, and disposal centers in the backward flow. In this regard, a multi-objective mathematical model with the objectives of increasing the total profit and reducing the total environmental impact, and maximizing social responsibility is presented. The optimization of this mathematical model has been done using a fuzzy optimization approach in GAMS software. The results of this study show that maximizing the total profit and minimizing the environmental effects and maximizing social responsibility are in contrast to each other. In addition, the sensitivity analysis indicated that the customers’ demand can affect all aspects of the sustainable supply chain simultaneously.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The world's large rivers are facing reduced sediment loads due to anthropogenic activities such as hydropower development and sediment extraction. Globally estimates of sand extraction from large river systems is lacking, in part due to the pervasive and distributed nature of extraction processes. In the Mekong River, current basin wide estimates of sand extraction are 50 Mt, and based on estimates from 2013. Here, we demonstrate the ability of high-resolution satellite imagery to map, monitor and estimate volumes of sand extraction on the Lower Mekong River in Cambodia. We use monthly composite images from PlanetScope imagery (5 m resolution) to estimate sand extraction volumes over the period 2016–2020 and show that rates of extraction have increased year on year from 24 Mt (17 Mt to 32) in 2016, to 59 Mt (41 Mt to 75 Mt) in 2020 at a rate of ~8 Mt yr−1 (6 Mt yr−1 to 10 Mt yr−1); where values in parenthesis relate to lower and upper error bounds, respectively. Our revised estimates for 2020 (59 Mt) are nearly two times greater than previous best estimates for sand extraction for Cambodia (32 Mt) and greater than current best estimates for the entire Mekong Basin (50 Mt). We show that over the five year period, only two months have seen positive (supply exceeds extraction) sand budgets under mean and upper bound scenarios (five months under the lower bound estimates). We demonstrate that this net negative sand budget to the river is driving major bed incision with a median rate of −0.26 m a−1 over the period 2013 to 2019. The use of satellite imagery to monitor sand mining activities provide a low-cost means to generate up-to-date, robust estimates of sand extraction in the worlds large rivers that are needed to underpin sustainable management plans of the global sand commons.\n                        </jats:p>"

Based on the perspective of cereals trade networks (CTN), the pandemic risk is combined with the trade intensity between countries, and an assessment model of cereals external supply risk is constructed that includes external dependence index (EDI), import concentration, and risk of COVID-19 from import countries index (RICI). The results show that: (1) the global main CTN have typical scale-free characteristics, and seven communities are detected under the influence of the core countries; (2) about 60%, 50%, and 70% of countries face risks of medium and above (high and very high) external dependence, concentration of imports, and COVID-19 in the country of origin, respectively. Under the influence of the pandemic, the risk of global external cereal supply index (RECSI) has increased by 65%, and the USA-CAN communities show the highest risk index; (3) the countries with a very high risk are mainly the Pacific island countries and the Latin American and African countries. In addition, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and 80% of the net food-importing developing countries are at high or very high RECSI levels. Approximately 50% of countries belong to the compound risk type, and many export countries belong to the RICI risk type; (4) global external food supply is subjected to multiple potential threats such as trade interruption, “price crisis”, and “payment dilemma”. The geographical proximity of community members and the geographical proximity of the pandemic risk is superimposed, increasing the regional risk of external food supply; and (5) this study confirms that the food-exporting countries should avoid the adoption of food export restriction measures and can prevent potential external supply risks from the dimensions of maintaining global food liquidity and promoting diversification of import sources. We believe that our assessment model of cereals external supply risk comprises a useful method for investigations regarding the international CTN or global food crisis under the background of the pandemic.</jats:p>"

In order to further explore the operation strategy of supply chain member enterprises, this article also explores the selection of financing objects of B2B platforms, the optimization of financing cost rate formulated by the loan amount of financing enterprises, and the optimization of product order quantity.

Based on the main assumptions of a linear product demand function and CSR measured by consumer surplus, this paper solves the equilibrium solutions of the manufacturer and the retailer through game theory. The results show that: First, the difference in the degree of CSR undertaken by manufacturers and retailers leads to a difference in the ranking of optimal strategies of both parties under the three power structures. Second, under the same power structure, compared with undertaking CSR by oneself, when the other party undertakes CSR, the level of the product’s green degree, the level of green promotion, the party’s own profit, and the profit of the other party are all higher. Third, regardless of the power structure, manufacturers and retailers undertaking CSR is conducive to improving the level of product greenness, increasing green promotion, lowering the retail price, increasing consumers’ willingness to buy green products, and ultimately helping to increase the profits of manufacturers and retailers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of kola nut, including natural or alternative medicinal sources, has inevitably created an increased global market demand in excess of its production and provides great prospects for the growth of the kola nut industry in producing countries like Ghana. Nonetheless, there is a great dearth of information on Ghana’s kola nut supply-side practices and constraints that can provide a basis for the development of the industry. This study fills the research gap by describing the practices and constraints of farmers, processors, and marketers of kola nut in Ghana. Using a survey methodology, results showed that nearly all (99.5%) farmers interviewed had not received any extension training on agronomic practices. Low market price of nuts (61.5%) and pests and diseases (60.4%) were the most reported constraints to kola nut production. Chiefs among motivating factors for cultivating kola nut were alternative livelihood support (58%). Some processors (28.6%) who rinsed nuts after depulping used a solution of Akate Master (bifenthrin) and others (51.0%) used fumigation tablets (aluminium phosphide) (91.0%) for storing the nuts. However, these chemicals may be dangerous to the health of consumers in the long run. The low selling price of kola nuts was perceived to be the most (74.8%) constraint to kola nut processing and marketing. Respondents noted that the red nuts were preferred for their durability during transportation and longer shelf life, while the white nuts were preferred for their taste. The results suggest the need for further agronomic, postharvest handling, preservation, and storage, as well as breeding research to provide recommendations to farmers and processors. To overcome some marketing challenges, there is a need for policy support to standardize pricing and grading systems for the mutual benefit of all the stakeholders.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We investigate a dynamic contracting problem in a supply chain with a manufacturer selling a seasonal product through a retailer over two periods. In period 1, which is before the selling season, neither firm knows the demand information. The manufacturer runs on the regular production mode with low production cost but long lead time. In period 2, which refers to the selling season, only the retailer can update the demand information, so information asymmetry exists in the supply chain. The manufacturer may further produce and supplement the retailer via a second contract. However, only a mode of quick response with a shorter lead time but higher cost is viable, if the manufacturer decides not to carry inventory from period 1 to period 2. We formulate this dynamic contracting problem into four models based on whether the manufacturer adopts quick response or carries inventory. We show that the adoption of quick response may not always benefit the manufacturer due to the information rent she has to sacrifice, and the manufacturer may be better off under a higher cost of quick response. Interestingly, the capability of inventory carryover always hurts the manufacturer regardless of the implementation of QR. Essentially, we find that one of the hurdles of implementing these capabilities comes from the incentive issues in a decentralized supply chain. The retailer may ask for information rent whenever the manufacturer adopts a capability for supplying him in period 2, especially if this capability is inflexible that requires advance production before demand realization. </jats:p>",

However, MANTRA's utilization rate is still not optimized, hovering around 63% up to October 2019. This presents the biggest challenge that needs to be addressed. The research goal is to help find root causes and suggest actions to make this tool more beneficial to users. This research uses a qualitative methodology, with data and information collected through direct observation and interviews with nine respondents from three different clusters. Interview results were analyzed through mind-mapping and narrowed down to two factors: core technical capabilities and non-technical factors. Several actions for improving the utilization rate include introducing a change agent, distributing performance reports, and transforming MANTRA from a \"by-choice\" to a \"must-use\" tool.

However, given the fact that the complex trade-offs/synergy relationships of ESs are a challenging area, studies on matching mechanisms for ES supply and demand are still rare. In this study, using the InVEST model, ArcGIS, and other professional tools, we first mapped and quantitatively evaluated the supply and demand of five ES types (water yield, soil conservation, carbon retention, food supply, and leisure and entertainment) in Hangzhou, China, based on land use, meteorology, soil, and socio-economic data. Then, we analyzed the matching characteristics between the supply and demand of these ESs and analyzed the complex trade-offs and synergy between the supply and demand of ESs and factors affecting ESs. The results of this analysis indicate that although the ES supply and demand of carbon retention tended to be out of balance (supply was less than demand), the supply and demand of the other four ES types (i.e., water yield, soil conservation, food supply, and leisure and entertainment) were in balance (supply exceeded demand). Finally, the spatial heterogeneity of the supply and demand of ESs in Hangzhou was significant, especially in urban areas in the northeast and mountainous areas in the southwest. The supply of ESs was based on trade-offs, whereas the demand of ESs was based on synergy. Our results further show that the supply and demand of ESs in the urban area in Hangzhou were out of balance, whereas the supply and demand of ESs in the western region were coordinated. Therefore, the linkage of ES flows between this urban area and the western region should be strengthened. This innovative study could provide useful information for regional land use planning and environmental protection.</jats:p>"

Depletion occurs when oxygen is consumed during decomposition of organic matter, and oxygen replenishment is limited by water column stratification. Arctic–alpine lakes are often well mixed and oxygenated, but rapid climate change in these regions is an important driver of shifts in catchment vegetation that could affect the mixing and oxygen dynamics of lakes. Here, we analyze high‐resolution time series of dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature profiles in 40 Swedish arctic–alpine lakes across the tree line ecotone. The lakes stratified for 1−125 days, and during stratification, near‐bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations changed by −0.20 to +0.15 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, resulting in final concentrations of 1.1−15.5 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at the end of the longest stratification period. Structural equation modeling revealed that lakes with taller shoreline vegetation relative to lake area had higher dissolved organic carbon concentrations and oxygen consumption rates, but also lower wind speeds and longer stratification periods, and ultimately, lower near‐bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations. We use an index of shoreline canopy height and lake area to predict variations among our study lakes in near‐bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations at the end of the longest stratification period (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.41). Upscaling this relationship to 8392 Swedish arctic–alpine lakes revealed that near‐bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations drop below 3, 5, and 7 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in 15%, 32%, and 53% of the lakes and that this proportion is sensitive (5%−22%, 13%−45%, and 29%−69%) to hypothetical tree line shifts observed in the past century or reconstructed for the Holocene (±200 m elevation; ±0.5° latitude). Assuming space‐for‐time substitution, we predict that tree line advance will decrease near‐bottom dissolved oxygen concentrations in many arctic–alpine lakes.</jats:p>",

By establishing the government incentive regulation model, the government can disclose the true recovery cost of the recycler and guide the recycler to make an reasonable effort. In this study, our model obtains the best recovery rate threshold for the recycler from the perspective of maximizing social welfare. Then, we conduct some sensitivity analyses and explore the impacts of related factors on the strategies-making of government and supply chain players. The results of the study indicates that the recovery rate threshold set not only depends on the operation efficiency of the recycler, it also affected by the consumers behavior and the production efficiency of manufacturer. The government should not pursue a high recovery rate blindly, more attention should be paid to control the cost of effort made by the recycler. With the increasing of the negative utility for the recycler to make effort, the government will improve the recovery threshold, otherwise, the threshold will decrease. The results facilitate scientific incentive mechanism development, and provide a reference for promoting CLSC operations.</jats:p>",

A pulsed power supply used in nano EDM is expected to limit a single pulse energy to nJ order of magnitude for improving the removal resolution of single pulsed discharge even to nanoscale. One developing direction is to decrease pulsewidth of the pulsed power supply. Conventional pulsed power supplies hardly output a single pulse and continuous pulses with nanosecond (ns) pulsewidth, resulting in too large single pulsed energy of <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>J order of magnitude usually. In this research, a novel pulsed power supply is designed for realizing the ns-pulsewidth with controllable pulsewidth and peak voltage. The key novelty lies in a cascaded circuit with two triodes working in the state of ultra-fast avalanche conduction, where pF capacitors are applied to adjust the pulsewidth and pulsed energy precisely. Performance tests verified that a single pulse of 5 ns pulsewidth or continuous pulses up to 9 MHz can be outputted. Furthermore, nano EDM experiments of single pulsed discharge are carried out under the conditions of nanometer (nm) discharge gap and nm-tip tool electrode based on an atomic force microscope (AFM) system. The special results are achieved: a single pulsed energy can reach down to 1.75 nJ by outputting a pulsewidth of 10 ns, and a nano-EDM crater is only about 182 nm in diameter with regular shape and little recasting. Those results verify the possibility of AFM-tip-based nano EDM for machining nanostructures.</jats:p>",

Several physiological stress factors can influence phytonutrients in chili peppers, resulting in their differential synthesis. Maintaining the right and exact amount of water through a drip system can promote an effective fruit set and crop quality. Four pepper cultivars (‘Hetényi Parázs’; HET, ‘Unikal’; UNIK, ‘Unijol’; UNIJ and ‘Habanero’; HAB) were investigated under different water supply treatments: RF or rain-fed, DI or deficit irrigation, and OWS or optimum water supply. The two-year experiment was carried out in May 2018 and 2019 under open field conditions. Physiological parameters (relative chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, and canopy temperature) were measured during the growth stage and phytonutrients (vitamin C, capsaicinoids and carotenoids) analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at harvest in September. The study revealed that, due to higher precipitation and rainfall interruption, increased water supply affected physiological response and phytonutrients in the cultivars. HAB under OWS had a lower response during the growth period when compared to HET, UNIK, and UNIJ. As water supply increased, measured individual carotenoid concentration increased in some cultivars. On the other hand, as water supply decreased, vitamin C and capsaicinoids concentration increased. Even though cultivars responded to the water supply treatments differently, HET exhibited a more uniform and stable composition in all treatments.</jats:p>"

The key work to reveal the changes of river water and sediment conditions is to quantitatively study the changes of precipitation, water and soil conservation in river basins, and the effect of reservoirs on sediment containment. Taking the Yongding River as a case study, we analyze the changing trend of the water and sediment into the Yongding River and find that their amount has greatly decreased. In particular, the sediment yield has decreased by more than 90% and its trend has changed, and the turning point occurred in the 1980s. Based on the statistical data analysis model, the influences of human activities on the sediment inflow of the Guanting Reservoir were quantitatively evaluated. The results show that sand retention of the upper cascade reservoirs is the main reason for the sharp reduction in sediment loads, but the sand retention effect of reservoirs has a certain time limit. Water and soil conservation played a vital role in the sediment loads reduction during the present stage. The present studies may provide insights into understanding the integrated reclamation of the river basin.</jats:p>",

Under the assumptions of B2B platform risk, neutrality, and risk aversion, a principal-agent model for cooperation was established between banks and B2B platforms. Its purpose was to expand and compare the models by adding supervision variables. It also helps to analyze the effects of risk aversion coefficients on effort level, fixed payment, incentive coefficients, and the impact of bank income. This paper has analyzed the banking system’s incentives and supervision mechanisms by performing numerical analysis on big data. We have used MATLAB for numerical analysis. The results show that banks’ expected benefits when cooperating with risk-neutral B2B platforms are always greater than the expected benefits obtained when cooperating with risk-averse B2B platforms. But when banks act, the increase in profits exceeds the cost of regulatory measures. Besides, when the bank takes supervisory measures, the profit will be greater than the profit without supervisory measures. Hence, the B2B platform’s ability to recover losses is positively correlated with the bank’s expected utility. The cost coefficient of the B2B platform is negatively correlated with the bank’s expected utility. The risk aversion degree does not affect the optimal effort level of the B2B platform, but it affects the optimal fixed payment and the optimal incentive coefficient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facilitating the proper handling of water is one of the main challenges to overcome when trying to improve fuel cell performance. Specifically, enhanced removal of liquid water from the porous gas diffusion layers (GDLs) holds a lot of potential, but has proven to be non-trivial. A main contributor to this removal process is the gaseous transport of water following evaporation inside the GDL or catalyst layer domain. Vapor transport is desired over liquid removal, as the liquid water takes up pore space otherwise available for reactant gas supply to the catalytically active sites and opens up the possibility to remove the waste heat of the cell by evaporative cooling concepts. To better understand evaporative water removal from fuel cells and facilitate the evaporative cooling concept developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute, the effect of gas speed (0.5–10 m/s), temperature (30–60 °C), and evaporation domain (0.8–10 mm) on the evaporation rate of water from a GDL (TGP-H-120, 10 wt% PTFE) has been investigated using an ex situ approach, combined with X-ray tomographic microscopy. An along-the-channel model showed good agreement with the measured values and was used to extrapolate the differential approach to larger domains and to investigate parameter variations that were not covered experimentally.</jats:p>"

Our results show that the total emissions of marine economy increased by 2.3 times from 2002 to 2017, and the share of that in national total emissions increased by 43.3%. The economic output of marine economy may lead to up to 1.8 times of the total economic output in the upstream industries, while the indirect emissions of major marine economy embodied in the upstream supply chains is on average 3.5 times of direct emissions from marine industries.

To compare disparities in the accessibility of community care resources and the optimization of allocation, methods for community care resource capacity were examined. This study also investigates units based on basic statistical area (BSA) to improve the limitation of larger reference locations (administrative districts) that cannot reflect the exact locations of people. The results show the capacity redistribution of each service point within the same total capacity, and the proposed method brings the population distribution of each demand to the best accessibility. Finally, the grading system of assessing accessibility scarcity allows the government to effectively categorize the prior improvement areas to achieve maximum equity under the same amount of care resources. There are 2046 (47.26%) and 396 (9.15%) BSAs that should be improved before and after optimization, respectively. Therefore, integrating socioeconomic status and spatial factors to assess accessibility of community-based care resources could provide comprehensive consideration for equal allocation.</jats:p>"

Calculations instantaneous and average catenary wires power losses while passing through the intersubstation zone one train and two successive trains are presented in this article. Losses are determined for two cases: when installed compensating device and in its absence. The values of the differences of these losses are founded. The computer simulation in MATLAB-Simulink software was implemented. According to the results of calculations graphs were built, illustrating the change of catenary wires power losses while moving trains on the intersubstation zone when installed compensating device and without it, as well as the differences between the said losses. Average values of catenary wires power losses were determined by integrating these functions and their comparison is carried out. Calculations have shown that by selecting compensating device power by the average reactive power consumed by a train, its intersubstation zone passage with constant current causes the same average catenary wires power losses as in the absence of the compensating device. Increasing the number of trains, simultaneously located on the intersubstation zone at the same compensating device power, entails a reduction of catenary wires power losses with respect to a similar situation without the compensating device, but at the same time reactive power is compensated only partially.</jats:p>",

Severe hemolytic episodes result in the release of red blood cell (RBC)-derived proinflammatory and oxidatively reactive mediators (e.g., extracellular hemoglobin, heme, and iron) into plasma. Here, we studied the role of these hemolytic mediators in coagulation activation by measuring factor Xa (FXa) and thrombin generation in the presence of RBC lysates. Our results show that hemolytic microvesicles (HMVs) formed during hemolysis stimulate thrombin generation through a mechanism involving FVIII and FIX, the so-called intrinsic tenase complex. Iron scavenging during hemolysis using deferoxamine decreased the ability of the HMVs to enhance thrombin generation. Furthermore, the addition of ferric chloride (FeCl3) to plasma propagated thrombin generation in a FVIII- and FIX-dependent manner suggesting that iron positively affects blood coagulation. Phosphatidylserine (PS) blockade using lactadherin and iron chelation using deferoxamine reduced intrinsic tenase activity in a purified system containing HMVs as source of phospholipids confirming that both PS and iron ions contribute to the procoagulant effect of the HMVs. Finally, the effects of FeCl3 and HMVs decreased in the presence of ascorbate and glutathione indicating that oxidative stress plays a role in hypercoagulability. Overall, our results provide evidence for the contribution of iron ions derived from hemolytic RBCs to thrombin generation. These findings add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of thrombosis in hemolytic diseases.</jats:p>",

Previous research has shown that pH and the supply of electron donors and acceptors affect that ratio, but it is unclear how their influences compare and affect one another. This study examines impacts of pH and the supply of acetate, sulfate, and goethite on the ratio of iron to sulfate reduction in semi‐continuous sediment bioreactors. We examined which parameter had the greatest impact on that ratio and whether the parameter influences depended on the state of each other. Results show that pH had a greater influence than acetate supply on the ratio of iron to sulfate reduction, and that the impact of acetate supply on the ratio depended on pH. In acidic reactors (pH 6.0 media), the ratio of iron to sulfate reduction decreased from 3:1 to 2:1 as acetate supply increased (0–1 mM). In alkaline reactors (pH 7.5 media), iron and sulfate were reduced in equal proportions, regardless of acetate supply. Secondly, a comparison of experiments with and without sulfate shows that the extent of iron reduction was greater if sulfate reduction was occurring and that the effect was larger in alkaline reactors than acidic reactors. Thus, the influence of sulfate supply on iron reduction extent also depended on pH and suggests that iron reduction grows more dependent on sulfate reduction as pH increases. Our results compare well to trends in groundwater geochemistry and provide further evidence that pH is a major control on iron and sulfate reduction in systems with crystalline (oxyhydr)oxides. pH not only affects the ratio between the reactions but also the influences of other parameters on that ratio.</jats:p>",

On the supply side, Bangladesh’s supply of grain products has increased substantially, with an average annual growth rate of 1.99 million tons in 1998–2018. Domestic grain production, especially rice production, accounted for the largest proportion in its structure. However, under the constraints of resources and environment, imports and international aid were needed to ensure a stable and sustainable grain supply. On the demand side, Bangladesh’s demand for grain products continued to grow at an average annual rate of 2.09 million tons and its structure was constantly diversified. In recent years, domestic grain production has fully met the grain demand for food use, but the overall grain supply dependence on foreign gradually increased. From the analysis of the influencing factors, the grain supply, especially the domestic production of rice and maize, had the greatest impact on the balance of grain supply-demand in Bangladesh. Moreover, multiple cropping index, chemical fertilizer application per hectare and irrigation rate were the three main factors affecting grain production. As a typical agricultural country, Bangladesh’s grain security was faced with challenges, such as high population density, insufficient cultivated land resources, international grain trade and frequent natural disasters. It is suggested that its government should strengthen scientific and technological research, adjust agricultural structure, improve the efficient utilization of agricultural resources and grain circulation systems, and balance the grain demand between food use and indirect use, so as to achieve complete grain self-sufficiency and overall grain security.</jats:p>"

To assess the level of fecal contamination, drinking water from the source and at the point of consumption was tested for Escherichia coli using on-site membrane filtration. On-site testing of water generated significant interest from community members to receive water test results and understand how to keep their drinking water safe from contamination. The inclusion of the module in the ALCS facilitated access of the enumerators to both communities and households. Only 21.0% of households used safely managed drinking water services. A majority of households (58.2%) used water sources contaminated with E. coli, while E. coli contamination at the point of consumption was found in 77.0% of households.

This versatility allows utilization of different biomass feedstock using a verity of conversion techniques. Often, a biomass‐to‐bioenergy conversion method is selected depending on the application, end‐use product, and the type of feedstock. In many applications such as residential energy supply, it is possible to select amongst various technologies. Although, there exist several challenges such as cost‐effectiveness and sustainability that constrains bioenergy development. To this end, this research elaborates on the impacts of different conversion methods on techno‐economic performance of bioenergy systems for residential energy supply. In this context, Organic Rankine Cycle based on direct combustion, and Dual Fluidized‐Bed technology based on gasification were selected for that purpose. A techno‐economic comparative analysis illustrates that the primary product of the system and fuel cost are the two most important factors in feasibility assessment. The negative impact of feedstock price was more severe on the Organic Rankine Cycle. For wood chips prices below 55$/t, Organic Rankine Cycle could be the better option due to lower capital and maintenance costs. In contrast, Dual Fluidized‐Bed could better tolerate the variation of feedstock price; offering 8% lower cost of energy at 65$/t wood chips.</jats:p>",

It is also implicated as a signaling/regulatory molecule and must be mobilized in response to cellular demands. This presents a complex logistical problem: heme cannot simply diffuse around cells because it is both insoluble and cytotoxic. We show that the cell exhibits exquisite control over release of heme by limiting its availability to one molecule or less within cellular compartments. We suggest an exchange mechanism between protein partners to control supply and demand. Such a mechanism would provide an in-built buffering capacity for heme, enable cells to hoard supplies of heme, and protect the cell against the undesirable effects of heme.</jats:p>",

This feature is crucial in the development of a new generation of intelligent OLED controllers, which in relation to known solutions, are characterized by reduced power consumption and increased speed of periodic or continuous measurement of the I – V characteristics of OLED structures. On the basis of such measurement the drift of characteristics of OLED structures in the course of their operation is carried out, and therefore, the possibility of operative correction of their power modes is provided. The measurement of I – V characteristics of OLED structures is performed on the transients of voltage generation in the boost circuits of the drivers. To meet the requirements for such measurements, the parameters of the transient pulses must meet certain criteria. The pulse amplitude should be sufficient to scan the I – V characteristics of OLED structures in the whole range of their possible operation, and the shape and rise time should be optimal from the point of view of further detection of these I – V patterns, in particular, regarding their drift in temperature modulation or OLED structure degradation. In a number of tasks scanning and measurement of I – V characteristics should be fast enough to prevent heating, but acceptable for high-precision analog-to-digital conversion. The parameters of the pulses provide the ability to measure the thermal parameters of thermal resistance and its dependence on the duration of heating. The controller is implemented on the basis of programmable systems on the chip, namely on the PSoC 5LP.</jats:p>",

Methods and materials. The authors use the historical-descriptive (idiographic), historical-genetic, historical-comparative methods, as well as quantitative methods in the study of statistical sources. In the course of the research, documentary materials of the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, the State Archives of Volgograd Region, and the Center for Documentation of the Contemporary History of Volgograd Region were used to illustrate the main methods and directions for resolving the food problem in the city of Stalingrad in the late 1920s – first half of the 1930s.  Analysis and results. The first five-year plan brought to citizens a sharp deterioration in food supply. Having refused to take economic measures the city authorities were forced to introduce a standardized distribution on the ration books of workers’ cooperatives. In 1931, Stalingrad as an important industrial center was included by the government in the list of the cities, which were supplied with basic products in a centralized manner. However, problems with food remained until the abolition of the card system in 1935. Interruptions in the supply of even standardized products, giant queues for them were the result not only of insufficient allocation of resources, but also of the unwillingness of the cooperative and state trade system to work effectively in the new conditions. The city’s population also grew too rapidly due to the peasants fleeing from the countryside, which contributed to the food shortage. The creation of subsidiary farms at large enterprises, the organization of collective farm fairs also did not lead to a noticeable result. The goal stated in the resolution of 1931 to bring the food supply of Stalingrad workers closer to the level of Moscow and Leningrad turned out to be unattainable. Some improvements in the food situation occurred only in autumn 1934, when a good harvest allowed the government to fulfill the state supplies, but the problem was never completely solved.</jats:p>",

This reduces the carrying capacity in gravity pipes and increases the energy consumption in rising mains. As partial blockages do not give rise to any external evidence, they are considered the most insidious fault occurring in pipe systems. Thus, the refinement of reliable techniques for detecting partial blockages at an early stage is of great interest to water utilities. This paper presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based analysis of the steady-state flow through a sharp-edged orifice which corresponds to the most straightforward partial blockage feature in a pipe. The main motivation is the fact that the interaction between pressure waves and a partial blockage – on which Transient Test-Based Techniques for fault detection are based – is strongly influenced by the pre-transient conditions at the partial blockage. The refined CFD model has been validated by considering experimental data selected from the literature. The comparison of obtained results demonstrates good performance of the numerical model. This authorised exploring in detail the features of the flow through the orifice as a necessary premise to its use within the successive transient analysis.</jats:p>",

Dynamic monitoring data of groundwater level are typical spatio-temporal sequence data, which have the characteristics of non-linearity and strong spatio-temporal correlation. The trend of dynamic change of groundwater level is the key factor for the optimal allocation of groundwater resources. However, most of the existing groundwater level prediction models are insufficient in considering temporal and spatial factors and their spatio-temporal correlation. Therefore, construction of a space–time prediction model of groundwater level considering space–time factors and improving the prediction accuracy of groundwater level dynamic changes is of considerable theoretical and practical importance for the sustainable development of groundwater resources utilization. Based on the analysis of spatial–temporal characteristics of groundwater level of the pore confined aquifer II of Changwu area in the Yangtze River Delta region of China, the wavelet transform method was used to remove the noise in the original data, and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method was used to calculate the water level. The spatial–temporal dataset and the long short-term memory (LSTM) were reconstructed by screening the spatial correlation of the monitoring wells in the study area. A spatio-temporal KNN-LSTM prediction model for groundwater level considering spatio-temporal factors was also constructed. The reliability and accuracy of KNN-LSTM, LSTM, support vector regression (SVR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model were evaluated by a cross-validation algorithm. Results showed that the prediction accuracy of KNN-LSTM is 20.68%, 46.54%, and 55.34% higher than that of the other single prediction models (LSTM, SVR, and ARIMA, respectively).</jats:p>",

Next, interactions between electric vehicles and the local energy system in Stuttgart were examined, comparing different development scenarios in the mobility sector. Further, a travel demand model was used to generate charging profiles of electric vehicles under consideration of mobility patterns. The charging demand was combined with standard household load profiles and a load flow analysis of the peak hour was carried out for a quarter comprising 349 households. The simulation shows that a higher charging capacity can lead to a lower transformer utilization, as charging and household peak load may fall temporally apart. Finally, it was examined whether the existing infrastructure is suitable to meet future demand focusing on the transformer reserve capacity. Overall, the need for action is limited; only 10% of the approximately 560 sub-grids were identified as potential weak points.</jats:p>"

We investigated the dynamics of the inorganic carbon system and organic matter (OM) in two Indian estuaries near mangroves; riverine freshwater supply to the Matla Estuary was reduced and that to the Dhamra Estuary was uninterrupted. Seasonal sampling was conducted over an annual cycle. We used elemental and stable isotope signatures to delineate the sources of OM and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). We found that compared to the Dhamra, the reduced riverine freshwater supply to the Matla increased the marine influence in the estuary on the OM degradation pathways and decreased CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions to the atmosphere. In the Dhamra, higher seasonal variability in biogeochemical pathways, facilitated high internal carbonate buffering capacity; in contrast in the Matla, the greater marine influence increased the carbonate buffering capacity, resulting in retention of higher DIC concentrations and low CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon concentrations were higher in the Dhamra than the Matla, indicating higher riverine supply of these.

A heavy train cannot be slowed down often, much less stopped, since this leads to a significant loss of energy. In the article, the authors considered the issue of strengthening the traction power supply system on the rated section of the railway line of the Eastern polygon in connection with an increase in the amount of cargo turnover by 2025. Based on the results of the traction calculation, the predicted values of the indicators were obtained. They are the total travel time of the train along the section of the railway line, the free running time of the train, the consumption of active and total electricity, the specific consumption of active and total electricity for each inter-substation zone of the railway line section. The operation parameters of the traction power supply system with a long-term train schedule on the rated section of the railway line are determined.

In general, the effectiveness of implementing the train traffic interval regulation with a use of a “virtual coupling” technology is presented in the works of many authors; however, the issues of the use of the existing infrastructure of the traction power supply system are not considered in the works. Comparing the “virtual coupling” technology with connected trains driving consists of the capacity reserve and train schedules evaluation. The use of modern software tools for mathematical modeling will allow you to solve not only the tasks set, but also to evaluate the compatibility of the currently used traction power supply system. According to the results of authors meant below, it can be seen that the temperature in the contact system and the suction line, the load limiting factor and the energy losses of the traction network trains movement in the “virtual coupling” are lower than those during the movement of the united train. When using trains with a virtual coupling, the voltage in the contact network is significantly higher than when using connected trains. Based on the above, it can be concluded that the virtual coupling trains use on the section under consideration is more appropriate than the use of the connected trains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain disruptions have significant negative effects on logistics operations, in which recovery actions could in turn affect the environment if certain green precautions are not undertaken. The objective of this research is to assess the effect of disruption on carbon emissions from logistics activities in the supply chain. A case study was carried out in this study to identify the factors of supply chain disruptions that affect logistics operations, and investigate the impact of the disruptions on the environment. Data collection using the Fuel Monitor application and real disruption data from a selected company were used to quantify the carbon emissions during disruption and non-disruption scenarios. Analysis of the study found that carbon emissions during disruption events increased to approximately 18 – 20 % as compared to normal operations. This is due to the increase in travelling distance in order to fulfill customer backorders during the disruption occurrence. The carbon emission amount was slightly higher when using fuel consumption as reference data in comparison to distance travelled, as fuel consumption takes into account the driving behaviour and efficiency of the truck engines. This study is useful for analyzing the impact of supply chain disruptions on the environment, particularly from the post-disruption recovery decisions.</jats:p>"

Investigating the lateral deflection of the perforated plate is of great significance because the buckling limit of structural members can be predicted not only by strength but also by displacement (or deflection). For this purpose, we conducted buckling experiments by considering various variables of the perforated plate, such as opening size, thickness, and aspect ratio. In addition, a series of elastoplastic large deflection analyses were performed using the commercial finite element analysis program, and the calculated results were compared along with the experimental results. Finally, practical curves, which can predict lateral deflection with an increase in axial displacement, and the occurrence point of ultimate strength are reported in this study. The results showed that there was a distinct difference in the behavior of lateral deflection between perforated plates with different opening ratios. The local buckling occurred mainly around the opening and was more dominant with an increase in the opening ratio. In addition, the ultimate strength of the perforated plate was determined at the end of the local buckling phase.</jats:p>"

The ZKR and PDR are two reservoirs constructed on the upper Lhasa River that originate from the Nyainqentanglha glaciers in the remote headwater in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and lacks historical in situ hydrological observations in the long term. Therefore, the Joint Research Center (JRC) Global Surface Water dataset (GSW), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data were used for estimating the total amount of water storage of the two reservoirs, and the SRTM and TanDEM-X DEMs were used for estimating the glacier mass balance. The result shows that the total amount of water impounded by reservoirs is 0.76 Gt, roughly 54% of their design capacities. The mass balance of the glaciers is estimated by comparing the elevation changes between the SRTM and TanDEM-X DEMs. The glaciers in this region melt at an average rate of 0.09 ± 0.02 Gt·year−1 from 2000 to circa 2013, and the impounded water of these reservoirs is comparable to the amount of glacier-fed meltwater in eight years.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most common conditions resulting from micronutrient deficiency is iodine deficiency. Purpose — to evaluate the current state of iodine supply in schoolchildren living in the North-Eastern region of Ukraine, including children with digestive diseases and inflammatory joint diseases. Materials and methods. Target group: 86 people (11.8±2.71 years), which included patients with digestive diseases (DD) (26.7%) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (60.5%). Methods: dietary iodine intake evaluation by urinary iodine concentration (Sandell–Kolthoff reaction), followed by calculation of the median. Results. Median urinary iodine excretion was at the lower normal range and amounted to 104.98 μg/l [QR: 59.8; 180.1] in the examined children. Only 51.2% of children had adequate iodine provision; mild iodine deficiency (ID) was diagnosed in 29.1% (Ме=81,91μg/l [QR: 64.26; 90.58]); moderate — 17.4% (Ме=36,19 μg/l [QR: 33.54; 42.24]); severe — in 2.3% of the surveyed (Ме 14,02 μg/l [QR: 12.34; 15.70]). The median urinary iodine excretion in children with somatic diseases was significantly lower than in children of the control group and amounted to 97.26 μg/l [QR 53.7; 148.3] versus 183.71 μg/l [QR 104.4; 287.4], (p=0.003). Conclusions. School-age children have a high incidence of iodine deficiency (51.2%). Often encountered in childhood diseases (DD and JIA) are accompanied by insufficiency of iodine supply. The research was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki declaration. The study protocol was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of all participating institution. The informed consent of the patient was obtained for conducting the studies. No conflict of interest was declared by the author. Key words: iodine deficiency, school-age children, the level of iodine excretion.</jats:p>",

Previous studies focused on the effect of P on root traits, but little information is available on changes to aboveground traits. In this paper, we show how P addition affects shoot traits and reduces the adverse effects of water stress on the yield. Two soybean genotypes, with contrasting aboveground architectures, were grown in pots to compare the canopy architecture, leaf traits, aboveground dry matter accumulation and yield under two water and three P levels. The addition of P to two soybean genotypes, one with a larger number of branches and greater leaf area on the branches than the other, showed that the increased leaf area distribution on the main stem and branches was associated with increased shoot and root dry weights, which were positively correlated with the number of filled pods, seed number and seed yield and negatively correlated with seed size at maturity under well-watered and cyclic water stress treatments. The leaf P concentration at 65 DAS (flowering stage) and leaf photosynthesis measured shortly after re-watering increased with P addition, while the leaf mass area on the main stem at 65 DAS and maturity and on the branches at maturity increased modestly with P supply and water stress. Evidence is presented that P addition can ameliorate the adverse effects of water stress on yield through increased leaf area, leaf function and aboveground shoot production. We conclude that the increased yields of soybean resulting from increased P and water supplies that were previously shown to be associated with increased root growth and function are mediated through increased shoot growth and function, particularly the greater number of sites for pod production.</jats:p>"

Recently, we invented a dissolution–precipitation (DP) method to grow 2D materials. Here, we further extend this method by developing a double-faced precursor supply DP growth strategy to substitutionally dope metal atoms into monolayer MoS2 lattices. In this double-faced precursor supply DP method, the Mo source and dopant source are supplied from the bottom and top surface of the glass substrate, respectively, to separate their diffusion paths. As a result, monolayer MoS2 incorporated with different concentrations of V atoms were grown by tuning the amount of V precursor, which exhibited different types of electrical transport properties. This new doping method is universal in growing several transition metal atom doped MoS2, including Re, Fe, and Cr, which will extend the applications of 2D materials.</jats:p>",

In order to increase consumer demand for fresh agricultural products, the supplier will make appropriate efforts to preserve the freshness of agricultural products. The optimal fresh-keeping effort level of the supplier and the optimal pricing decision of the retailer under the centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making modes were studied, respectively; through the design of traditional cost-sharing contracts, traditional cost and revenue-sharing contracts, and cost-sharing and compensation strategies, the supplier was encouraged to improve their fresh-keeping effort. The research shows that the traditional cost-sharing contract and the traditional cost-benefit sharing contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. Under the strategy of cost sharing and compensation, when the amount of compensation meets certain conditions, the coordination of supply chain can be realized. Finally, the important parameters of the model are analyzed by numerical simulation.</jats:p>",

For the study of Chl-a value measurement in rivers or lakes, there are many classical methods, such as curve fitting, back propagation (BP) neural network and radial basis function (RBF) neural network, and all of them have some corresponding applications. With the rise of computer power and deep learning, this study intended to analyze the measurement of water quality and Chl-a in deep learning (DL) and to compare it with several classical methods, so as to explore and develop better methods. Taking Taihu Lake of China as the case, this study adopted the measured data of Chl-a in Taihu Lake in 2017 and the data corresponding to the same time from Landsat8. In this study, the four methods were used to invert the distribution of the Chl-a value in Taihu Lake. From the results of inversion, the power curve fitting model with ∑Residual2 of fitting of 90.469 and inverse curve fitting model with the ∑Residual2 of fitting of 602,156.608 had better results than the other curve fitting models; however, they were not as accurate as the machine learning method from segmentation results images. The machine learning method had better accuracy than the curve fitting methods from segmentation results images. The mean squared error of testing of the three methods of machine learning (BP, RBF, DL) were respectively 1.436, 4.479, 4.356. Thus, the BP method and DL method had better results in this study.</jats:p>",

Methods: Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. The study was employed at 200 pharmacies in 2020. This study proposes a conceptual framework of pharmacies’ satisfaction. The scale’s reliability is assessed using Cronbach’s Alpha and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) model. Therefore, pharmacies’ satisfaction is evaluated by the multiple linear regression model. Main findings: The scale is built with 6 factors, including Product (5 items), Employee service capacity (6 items), Price and Payment (4 items), Response (9 items), Confidence (4 items) and Satisfaction (2 items). When calculating the Crobach’s Alpha with 30 items, Cronbach’s Alpha was from 0.769 to 0.904 for reliability. After applying EFA, all factors are required, of which Eigenvalue of independent element was 1,034 &gt; 1 and Eigenvalue of dependent element was 1,825 &gt; 1. After the linear regression analysis variability, there are 4 crucial factors affecting pharmacies’ satisfaction to the medicine supply service of Pymepharco, In particular, Response is the most powerful factor (standardized Beta coefficient equal to 0.363), the second is Pharmaceutical products (standardized Beta coefficient equal to 0.230), the third is Price and Payment (standardized Beta coefficient equal to 0.149) and finally, Employee Serviceability (standardized Beta coefficient equal to 0.145). Conclusion: The study has proposed a conceptual framework of pharmacies’ satisfaction to the medicine supply service of Pymepharco joint stock company and determined that the response factor is the most influential factor on pharmacy satisfaction. Key words: pharmacies’ satisfaction, medical supply service, Pymepharco Joint Stock Company.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Motivated by the practices that many small and middle-sized enterprises (SME) retailers have financial constraints due to their limited budget and financing access, this paper studies the manufacturer’s financial strategy (i.e., trade credit versus vertical merger with a capital-constrained retailer) in a supply chain with two financial asymmetric retailers. We first compare the equilibrium profits under different financing modes and find that if manufacturer’s capital cost under trade credit or administrative cost under vertical merger is below a certain threshold, the manufacturer should finance instead of deselect the capital-constrained retailer even though the competition is intensified. Furthermore, manufacturer can choose a financing strategy based on the tradeoff between financing value and cost from trade credit or vertical merger. Under trade credit, the increased horizontal competition intensity is against the capital-constrained retailer while with vertical merger the competition intensity is harmful to the capital-abundant retailer. In addition, through investigating the impact of different financial modes on the equilibrium profits of the supply chain players, we find that whether trade credit can outperform vertical merger for both the manufacturer and the capital-constrained retailer depends on horizontal competition intensity, profit-sharing proportion and administrative cost of vertical merger. Moreover, the capital-abundant retailer will get the lowest profit when other participators act like an alliance. Our study provides a roadmap for the manufacturer to make a financing policy for capital-constrained retailer who competes with a funded retailer.</jats:p>",

Designing newly‐built or refurbished ICUs and operating theatre suites is an opportunity to incorporate mandatory fire safety features and improve the management and outcomes of such emergencies: These include well‐marked manual fire call points and oxygen shut off valves (area valve service units); the ability to isolate individual zones; multiple clear exit routes; small bays or side rooms; preference for ground floor ICU location and interconnecting routes with operating theatres; separate clinical and non‐clinical areas. ICUs and operating theatre suites should have a bespoke emergency evacuation plan and route map that is readily available. Staff should receive practical fire and evacuation training in their clinical area of work on induction and annually as part of mandatory training, including ‘walk‐through practice’ or simulation training and location of manual fire call points and fire extinguishers, evacuation routes and location and operation of area valve service units. The staff member in charge of each shift should be able to select and operate fire extinguishers and lead an evacuation. Following an emergency evacuation, a network‐wide response should be activated, including retrieval and transport of patients to other ICUs if needed. A full investigation should take place and ongoing support and follow‐up of staff provided.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>2020 is the year of wildfire records. California experienced its three largest fires early in its fire season. The Pantanal, the largest wetland on the planet, burned over 20% of its surface. More than 18 million hectares of forest and bushland burned during the 2019–2020 fire season in Australia, killing 33 people, destroying nearly 2500 homes, and endangering many endemic species. The direct cost of damages is being counted in dozens of billion dollars, but the indirect costs on water‐related ecosystem services and benefits could be equally expensive, with impacts lasting for decades. In Australia, the extreme precipitation (“200 mm day −1 in several location”) that interrupted the catastrophic wildfire season triggered a series of watershed effects from headwaters to areas downstream. The increased runoff and erosion from burned areas disrupted water supplies in several locations. These post‐fire watershed hazards via source water contamination, flash floods, and mudslides can represent substantial, systemic long‐term risks to drinking water production, aquatic life, and socio‐economic activity. Scenarios similar to the recent event in Australia are now predicted to unfold in the Western USA. This is a new reality that societies will have to live with as uncharted fire activity, water crises, and widespread human footprint collide all‐around of the world. Therefore, we advocate for a more proactive approach to wildfire‐watershed risk governance in an effort to advance and protect water security. We also argue that there is no easy solution to reducing this risk and that investments in both green (i.e., natural) and grey (i.e., built) infrastructure will be necessary. Further, we propose strategies to combine modern data analytics with existing tools for use by water and land managers worldwide to leverage several decades worth of data and knowledge on post‐fire hydrology.</jats:p>",

As the main area where hydrochemistry occurs, studying the law of hydrochemical evolution within 1 m below the riverbed is of great significance for understanding the migration and removal of river pollutants. In this study, a combination of onsite monitoring and indoor experiments was used to analyze the variation characteristics of the hydrochemical composition of pore water during riverbank infiltration, as well as the main hydrochemical effects and influencing factors. The results show that in the process of river water infiltration, a series of redox reactions occur in the riverbed sedimentation zone, and there are differences in different infiltration depths. From 0 to 20 cm below the riverbed, strong respiration and denitrification mainly occurred. Reductive dissolution of manganese minerals mainly occurred from 20 to 60 cm, and reductive dissolution of iron minerals mainly occurred from 60 to 90 cm. River water level, dissolved organic carbon content and microbial activity had varying degrees of influence on these redox effects. The recharge of river water infiltration ensures the exploitation amount of the pumping wells, but it also leads to the increase of some components in groundwater, and the extracted water cannot be directly drunk.</jats:p>"
