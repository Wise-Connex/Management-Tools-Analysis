      "abstract": "<jats:p>Immunization helps save lives, protects serious illness and is recognized as one of the most effective public health intercessions and available today. However, the success of the programs depends heavily upon the immunization supply chain management including storage, transportation, and handling of vaccines in a proper manner. It was, therefore, important to assess the immunization supply chain and logistics practice. The study was conducted at the EPSA Jimma branch. Purposive sampling methods were used because the hub has completed the Woreda level vaccine transition and have a better experience in vaccine management. Moreover, all staffs (7) who directly engage in vaccine management were a respondent in this study. The primary data was collected using structured questionnaires and Standard checklist observation. In addition, secondary data was collected from documents and recordings from the manual and electronic recording tools. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed according to their type. For the analysis of the quantitative data descriptive statistics supported by SPSS software version 20 was applied, and for qualitative data, document analysis was done. SPSS mean and the standard deviation was used to calculate and show the expert's experience on immunization supply chain practices, and frequency and percentage were considered to present the respective practices. The result showed that there are rooms for improvement to ensure recommended good storage. The branch has sufficient positive (+20C to +80C) storage capacity, but the available negative storage volume only covers 65% of the negative storage capacity needed. Respondents were agreed on bundling practice during the distribution of vaccines, Disagree on Refrigerated vehicle pre cold before loading of vaccines, whereas strongly disagree on the temperature of vaccine is always monitored during transportation and availability of an adequate number of the vehicle for transportation of vaccines for which respondents remained neutral. The study strongly indicates the need to improve vaccine logistics supply chain management practices, especially in vaccine storage and handling and temperature monitoring. EPSA and development partners working on vaccine logistic and supply chain management should have intensified their technical and material support to improve the vaccine management practices.</jats:p>"

This has reduced the efficiency of supply chains and customer service quality and increased operating costs, creating new requirements for supply chain flexibility and sustainability. When investigating 21 companies based on 200 questionnaires and a structural equation model analysis, the results showed that the elasticity of the supply chain for supply chain sustainability, economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environment sustainability has an obvious positive effect: supply chain sustainability has an obvious positive effect on supply chain performance. Supply chain resilience has no direct positive effect on supply chain performance, but it has a strong indirect effect on supply chain performance under the mediating effect of supply chain sustainability. In view of this, in order to create sustainable supply chain development and improve the performances of supply chains, it is necessary to establish the awareness of risk prevention, root the risk culture in supply chain network organization, and improve supply chain resilience in multiple dimensions. Enterprises in the supply chain should continue to build their resilience and establish effective strategies to integrate supply chains. The intermediary role of sustainability in supply chains and of supply chain flexibility in supply chain performance shows the influence of economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable angles, such as the implementation of supply chain management, the maximization of the interests of the whole supply chain, improving the ability of supply chain enterprises to innovate and develop, establishing customer awareness, and enhancing humanistic ideas. Dynamic selection of supply chain partners while focusing on their green performance promotes the green development of supply chain enterprises.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Agro processing sector is a widely diverse subsector and is vital to the production of food, beverages and non-food products. The sector contributes in earning foreign exchange, growth of gross domestic product and offer employment opportunities. The sector is inefficient in terms of value addition to the agricultural produce as Kenya exports raw agricultural produce instead of high-quality value-added products. This study therefore, sought to determine the effect of transactional supply chain governance on performance of agro processing firms in Kenya.&#x0D;\nMethodology: This study adopted a survey research design. The study focused on 344 agro processing firms in Kenya. This study used a census survey and data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. The data collected was analysed using SSPS version 25. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics by use of moderated multiple regression analysis.   &#x0D;\nFindings: The findings of this study revealed that transactional supply chain governance had a significant and positive effect on performance of agro processing firms in Kenya. The model found out that the coefficient of determination was 0.597 implying that 59.7% performance of agro processing firms in Kenya is explained by transactional supply chain governance. The study concluded that transactional supply chain governance was critical in enhancing the performance of agro processing firms in Kenya.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: The study recommended that agro processing firms should implement the systems of transactional supply chain governance to enhance their profitability, sales growth and market share</jats:p>"

As a proxy for the demand of information, we extract Google Trends (GT) for keywords such as \"inflation\", \"inflation rate\", or \"price increase\". The rationale is that when agents are more interested about inflation, they should search for information about it, and Google is by now a natural source. As a proxy for the supply of information about inflation, we instead use an indicator based on a (standardized) count of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) articles containing the word \"inflat\" in their title. We find that measures of demand (GT) and supply (WSJ) of inflation information have a relevant role to understand and predict actual inflation developments, with the more granular information improving expectation formation, especially so during periods when inflation is very high or low. In particular, the full information rational expectation hypothesis is rejected, suggesting that some informational rigidities exist and are waiting to be exploited. Contrary to the existing evidence, we conclude that the media communication and agents attention do play an important role for aggregate inflation expectations, and this remains valid also when controlling for FED communications.</jats:p>"

During the system filling, the air that entered into the pipes when the supply was closed is expelled through any fissures including service pipes. When a meter is installed, the airflow can cause inaccuracies, over-reading, and reliability issues. This paper investigates experimentally the impact of the airflow on water meter performance during filling by means of a laboratory set-up, using pipes with diameters comparable to those of a real water system. The impact of the airflow on the accuracy and reliability of the water meters is discussed and the potential for over-reading is estimated.</jats:p>",

Vegetables and fruits, in all stages of the food supply chain, are contaminated with a variety of bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites. The prevalence of many diseases has been recorded in the past as a result of eating fruits and vegetables. The results of extensive research conducted in this field around the world were used in this chapter, and melon is discussed in detail as an example. Research findings show that pathogens that lodge in the skin of melon can enter the melon flesh when cut and infect it. Similarly, in hot climates, the bacteria Salmonella, Listeria, and E. coli multiply easily in melon flesh at low pH and soon reach pathogenic doses. Therefore, appropriate hygiene measures should be considered along the food chain. These hygiene measures are considered very important from the perspective that very small contamination by campylobacter, Escherichia coli, and norovirus, for example, can cause a major health problem. Highly vulnerable people include pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and the sick.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Society depends on a secure electricity supply which is increasingly important as various sectors are being electrified to substitute fossil fuels. The sustainability targets for the future cannot be met unless the necessary transformation of the power system is addressed. The future power system should be renewable, flexible, intelligent, secure, and resilient. This transformation should be made at acceptable costs, without jeopardising the security of electricity supply. The electricity grid is a crucial enabler for the energy transition. Intensified electrification and digitalisation imposes new challenges and requirements for the grid.  At the same time, the power system will be more exposed to natural disasters in the future due to climate change and increased weather-related stress. It is important to understand the new risk picture and find the right strategies for dealing with the security of electricity supply in the future power system.  &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

From the perspective of the natural resource-based view and dynamic capability theory, based on the theoretical logic of “resource-capability-performance”, this study aims to explore the relationship between GSCI and firms’ green innovation performance and its intrinsic mechanism. In order to test the research model, this study collected survey data from 405 Chinese manufacturing firms and tested them by using hierarchical regression and bootstrap analysis. The results show that all three dimensions of GSCI, namely, green internal integration, green supplier integration, and green customer integration, have positive effects on supply chain agility. In addition, supply chain agility has a significant positive impact on green product and process innovation. This study also finds that supply chain agility plays a partially mediating role between all three dimensions of GSCI and green product and process innovation; that is, GSCI can further promote firms’ green innovation performance by improving supply chain agility. The results of this study not only enrich the theoretical research on the driving factors of firms’ green innovation but also provide policy implications for manufacturing firms and government policy-makers regarding the implementation and promotion of green innovation practices.</jats:p>"

Therefore, consumers who are mostly women like cosmetics. However, many companies are gradually selling cosmetics, ignoring the halalness of their products. In addition, due to the high price range for quality cosmetics, some women choose to buy beauty products at relatively low prices, but not necessarily certified as halal and not necessarily registered with the BPOM (food and drug supervisory agency).

The temperature-compensated current is generated by combining two currents with opposite temperature coefficients (TCs) which are derived from two NMOS transistors biased with different complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) gate voltages. Self-biased self-cascode MOSFET (SBSCM) stages operating in the subthreshold region are utilized as the slope-adjustable linear CTAT voltage generators to achieve both low-power and low-voltage operation. Designed in a 130 nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.0021 mm<sup>2</sup>, the proposed current reference achieves an average untrimmed TC of 308 ppm/°C over − 40°C to 120°C while generating an output reference current of 6.6 nA. Post simulation results show that the power consumption is only 3.68 nW at the minimum supply voltage at room temperature.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Identifying the socio-economic factors associated with the supply and the demand of health facilities (HF), can contribute to the decision-making of the creation of the HF. This study aims to contribute to this issue, in the competitive context of the tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment centres (DTC), and to describe the spatial distribution of the residence of TB patients and DTC, to understand the DTC attendance’ rate in the city of Douala, Cameroon. Methods: The Spatial analysis was performed to access the spatial-economic model hiding behind the distribution of the “observed” number of patients attending the DTCs compared to the “expected” number. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression and the analysis of variance were used to identify the factors associated to the demand and supply of DTCs respectively. Results: The decentralization policy advocated by the national program against tuberculosis (NTP) is not always followed by the patients: The “expected” and the “observed” number of patients in DTCs are not correlated. The attendance of DTCs in Douala is in accordance with the spatial-economic theory models of Salop and Hoteling, which is an artefact. Patients seeking treatment in DTCs closer to their residence are mainly women and patients from relatively poor households, while attendance of DTC was associated with the quality of service and the level of the HF. Conclusion: Attendance HF is dictated by the spatial-economic theory models. The policy of creating HF for TB is not followed by patients in competitive context. Attendance of HF by TB patients is associated with socioeconomic factors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tanzania’s supply chain system is a complicated web of integrated and vertical systems, covering essential and vertical programs health commodities, laboratory and diagnostics, equipment, and supplies. Despite significant improvement in the supply chain over the decades, the availability of medicines has remained uneven. Therefore, identifying the cost of operating the supply chain is vital to facilitate allocation of adequate finances to run the supply chain. We adopted a three-step approach to costing, which included i) identification, ii) measurement, and (iii) valuation of the resource use. Two levels of the Tanzanian supply chain system were examined to determine the cost of running the supply chain by function. These included first the Medical Stores Department (MSD) central and zonal level, secondly the health service delivery level that include National, Zonal and regional hospitals and the Primary Health Care (District Hospital, health center and Dispensary). The review adopted the health system perspective, whereby all resources consumed in delivering health commodities were considered, resource use was then classified as financial and economic costs. The costing period was an average of two financial years, 2015/16 and 2016/17. The cost data were exchanged from Tanzania Shillings to 2017 US$ and then adjusted for inflation to 2020 US$. The study used the total sales reported in audited financial accounts for throughput value. The average annual costs of running the supply chain at the central MSD was estimated at USD$ 15.5 million and US$ 4.1 million at the four sampled MSD Zonal branches. There is a wide variation in annual running costs among MSD zonal branches; the supply chain’s unit cost was highest in the Dodoma zone and lowest in the Mwanza zone at 26% and 8%, respectively. When examined on a cost-per-unit basis, supply chain systems operate at sub-optimal levels at health facilities at a unit cost of 37% per unit of commodity throughput value. There are inefficiencies in supply chain financing in Tanzania. Storage costs are higher than distribution costs, this may imply some efficiency gains. MSD should employ a \"just in time\" inventory model, reducing the inventory holding costs, including the high-expired commodities holding charge, this could be improved by increasing the order fill rate.</jats:p>"

Within this ecosystem, freight transportation is considered a fundamental component of all supply chain systems. As a matter of its demanding multimodal and intermodal character, freight transportation is a highly competitive market where actors involved, demand reliable and high-quality services at competitive prices. However, even though its systems keep evolving, being spurred by developments at multiple levels, the maritime actors’ fundamental operational processes keep an unprecedented low pace of evolution and transformation, and the maritime supply chain market is considered to be as hyper-fragmented as ever. This paper investigates how the effective, efficient, and sustainable matching of the demand and supply needs of the actors involved in the maritime supply chain domain can be strategically achieved and supported through specialised information systems. The paper, also presents a holistic framework for designing these systems. The analysis was based on the outcomes received from a number of interviews conducted with strategically positioned experts, pointing out their emerging needs and the challenges they face. The outcomes showed that digital transformation is still in its infancy but that the embracement of a decision-matchmaking system could be a real game changer.</jats:p>"

The Granger causality test examines the causality between remittance and economic growth of Nepal. The result of the Granger causality test shows that both the Nepalese people's entry and exit from the country are significant for the economic growth of Nepal. The remittance received from migrated people is significant for the economic growth of Nepal. The contribution of remittance to GDP has increased, and the poverty level has decreased over the years. The education sector has improved, and the development level is gradually increasing. Therefore, there is an urgent need for policies with a high priority on national interests for managing international migration (both emigration and immigration) and remittance. This implies that the policy maker should implement an appropriate policy to invest in capital formation. It may be conducive to the economic growth of Nepal.</jats:p>"

But COVID-19 is adversely affecting the country. To be specific Agriculture sector is most vulnerable to losses everywhere. Indian agriculture has not been very progressive as compared to other industries. Farmers don’t get a reasonable price for their produce. Farmers here are illiterate and trick by money lenders, middle-man, traders, etc. Most of the margin of farmers taken by middle-men results in loss of farmers and customers getting the product at a high price. Also, there are fewer storage facilities, so they have to sell their produce immediately after harvesting. Considering the research region, i.e., Nasik District, where most of the farm produce like grapes, cereals and vegetables have harvesting season in this period. Due to lockdown in the country, as COVID hit here, there have been more significant losses to grapes and other farms produce like cereals and vegetables. Nasik, which is the region of my research, has around 6 lakh farmers, wherein I have taken a sample survey of 100 farmers, which comprise small, marginal, medium, and large farmers. There is a need for change in agricultural practices wherein farmers should adopt concepts like proper supply chain management, cold storage, processing in a farm of whichever produce is possible, Direct marketing, Private wholesale market, organized retailing. Cold storage and cooperative storage facilities can play a significant role in such a critical situation. The need for change in agricultural marketing and coping with such issues as COVID is of utmost importance. New innovative ideas can help to sustain farmers in such severe problems.</jats:p>",

The analysis showed the positive effects of digitization, which stabilize the situation in the domestic labor market. In particular, in the extreme conditions of the pandemic and war, these are the emergence of new digital professions, the possibility of remote work, the individualization of forms of employment and conditions of cooperation for the personal needs of labor market entities. The concept of digital professions has been introduced as a creative labor activity, since it is associated with the promotion, security of functioning and the expanded practice of digital technologies in manufacturing processes in any sphere of economic activity. The trend of increasing the number of digital practitioners in the wake of the worldwide trend of inducing a global information society has been grounded. The consequences of digitalization are shown that hinder the effective functioning of the labor market and manifest themselves in the increase in unemployment due to the emergence of unnecessary workers whose skills are impractical in digitized reality, the outflow of personnel to foreign labor markets, and the increase in inequality of the population in labor opportunities. The necessity of interaction between educational institutions, business and the state in achieving a balance of supply and demand in the labor market of Ukraine in the context of digitalization is emphasized.</jats:p>",

This causes interactions that result in unexpected scenarios associated with a variety of dangers such as variations in demand, risks associated with supplier relationships, and so on…. As a result, risk management appears to be a major issue for decision-makers. Today supply chain management needs to be dynamic and responsive to create added value, and mitigates these risks by using flexibility strategies to respond to change while remaining competitive. The goal of this research is to look into the supply and demand strategies used by pharmaceutical companies to respond to disruptions and avoid medicine interruptions for consumers. In this thesis the supply chain risk management strategies are basically connected to an empirical study done in 32 Moroccan pharmaceutical enterprises. Following that, the participants’ responses were based on a questionnaire structured through the literature seeks to bring more detailed information about these strategies. Accordingly, the results showed that Moroccan pharmaceutical firms focus on some crucial activities such as supplier selection, flexible control, supplier control, vendor verification, and inventory management to account for supply and demand risk.&#x0D;\nEmpirical studies in the field of pharmaceutical risk management are rare. Thus, the goal of this work is address the scarcity of empirical studies in this field by outlining several key risk management strategies used by pharmaceutical supply chain laboratories in the context of Morocco which are putting more resources into these vital strategies. Most of the supply and demand techniques of these firms are found to be proactive .</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Land transportation is generally considered one of the most expensive, polluting and least efficient parts of the logistics chain. Due to these issues, using unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones for package delivery in last-mile logistics becomes increasingly attractive. However, there are several significant obstacles in terms of technical aspects and performance capabilities of drones like limited flight coverage. In addition, supply chains are exposed to a broad range of uncertainties some of which may cause disruptions in the whole supply chain system. To hedge against these issues, a well-designed reliable network is a top priority. This research aims to construct a feasible delivery network consisting of warehouses and recharging stations through the development of a stochastic mixed-integer model, resulting in improving the coverage and reliability of the supply chain network. Due to the computational complexity of the scenario-based mixed-integer model, this research improves the performance of the genetic algorithm by considering each scenario independently in one of the steps of the algorithm to significantly improve the computational time need to find the solutions. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficiently capable of solving large-scale problems. It is also demonstrated that substantial improvements in the reliability of the system can often be possible with minimal increases in facility cost.</jats:p>"

This growing interest is exemplified by the number of studies published in this field. The resulting models for these cases are complex multi-objective optimization network models of a combinatorial nature. Exact algorithms can at best provide an Pareto optimal solution for medium size problems. In such situations, metaheuristic algorithms become a viable option for solving these kinds of problems. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop three meta-heuristic algorithms to solve large size multi-objective supply chain network design problems. The algorithms are based on tabu search, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing to find near optimal global solutions. The three algorithms are designed, coded, tested, and their parameters are fine tuned. The exact ε-constraint algorithm embedded in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is used to validate the results of the three algorithms. A well-designed study is used to compare the performance of the three algorithms based on several performance measures using sound statistical tests. A typical multi-objective supply chain model is used to compare the algorithms’ performance. The results show that the tabu search algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms in terms of the percent of domination and computation time. On the other hand, the simulated annealing solutions are the best in terms of their diversity.</p>"

The GSCM practices examined comprised green design, green purchasing, green production, green marketing, environmental management, and recycling. All these practices are applicable for the shipbuilding industry that creates tangible economic value but also causes substantial environmental and social issues. Already, sustainability implementation, environmentally related regulations, and corporate standards have initiated new design and construction practices in the shipbuilding and shipyards. A research model was created here to test the relationship between six GSCM practices and the three sustainability performance dimensions. The authors utilized an updated, altered survey from recent academic research in the Turkish chemical, electronic, automotive, or food packaging industries. The research revealed that the GSCM practices green design, green purchasing, green production, green marketing, environmental management, and recycling were indicators those selected by the experts in the shipbuilding sector. Furthermore, these selected indicators were tested by SEM-PLS for its significance and relationship within each other. The result was found positively significant for the economic and social performance. Nevertheless, there was no direct improvement in the environmental performance dimension, despite the implementation ISO 14001 certification in 95% of the shipyards. Certificate is the first step for GSCM practices but not means company achieved environmental performance positively. The certification is not enough to justify that the companies are environmentally protected, as well as approval using GSCM. Environmental uncertainty did neither have a moderating effect between GSCM practices and sustainability performances.</jats:p>"

We argue informational disclosure-based governance presents a potential strategy to mitigate this zero-sum logic as citizens discount policy costs while expecting substantive benefits. We focus on political efforts to increase sustainability throughout global supply chains, drawing on two original survey experiments with representative samples in the 12 largest high-income importing economies (N=24,000). Indeed, at higher levelsof policy stringency, citizens expect greater benefits than costs. Further, we find that expected benefits are more strongly associated with support than costs. Lastly, we note how policy stringency promotes convergence of expected benefits across the political ideological spectrum.

To address these objectives, manufacturing, field service engineering and customer support should be aligned and should strive towards the same end-goal. While several studies have revolved around this context, the product-service system (PSS) approach has emerged as a promising way of meeting manufacturer, customer and environmental requirements alike. Nevertheless, most of these studies revolve around the design and development of a PSS, whilst a minimal amount of research has targeted its impact from the supply chain perspective, leaving aside inventory management. Consequently, the following study utilizes functional hierarchy modeling (FHM) and the PSS concept matrix to propose solutions that make it possible to meet customer requirements and improve the environmental performance and associated costs at the same time. An application at a medical equipment manufacturer brings forward the positive effects suggested by the research and reduces the aforementioned gaps. In detail, the results show a smaller variability in the supply of spare parts combined with optimized maintenance planning, which translates into lesser costs to the manufacturer, a prolonged product life cycle and a reduced environmental impact.</jats:p>"

This study uses an enhanced multi-regional input-output database (REX, Resolved EXIOBASE) and supply chain impact mapping (SCIM) method to assess global biodiversity loss associated with mining-related land use. We identify hotspots in the supply chain of mining products, compare the impact of fossil and renewable electricity, and estimate the share of mining in total global impacts. We found that half of the global mining-related biodiversity loss occurs in Indonesia, Australia and New Caledonia. Major international trade flows of embodied biodiversity loss involve Indonesia’s coal exports to China and India, New Caledonia’s nickel exports to Japan and Australia, and Australia’s iron and bauxite exports to China. Key end-consumers include China’s growing infrastructure and the EU’s and USA’s households-consumption. Electricity generation accounted for 10% of global mining-related biodiversity loss in 2014. The impact of coal-fired electricity was ten times higher than renewables per unit of electricity generated. Globally, mining contributes to less than 1% of total land-use related biodiversity loss, which is dominated by agriculture. Our results provide transparency in sourcing more sustainable mining products and underline synergies in fostering renewables to meet local biodiversity and global climate targets.</jats:p>"

The industry has been affected by the pandemic, leading to a need for faster transformation and upgrading. Additionally, there is an increased demand for green and environmental protection in the chemical sector due to global climate change and the concept of sustainable development. During the time after the pandemic, there will be a continued trend of industrial clustering and scale development in the chemical sector. It is essential to prioritize optimization via green supply chain management in order to facilitate industrial upgrading. In order to achieve this objective, this study administered a questionnaire survey to gather reliable data. The collected data was then analyzed using software tools like SPSS and AMOS. The analysis aimed to investigate the influence of various factors, including regulatory compliance, green procurement, green manufacturing, green logistics, green sales, competitors, internal environmental protection, and cost control, on the awareness and implementation of green supply chain management in chemical enterprises. Additionally, a structural equation model was constructed to further examine these relationships. The findings suggest that green procurement, manufacturing, logistics, sales, and internal environmental protection and cost control have a notable and beneficial influence on the implementation of green supply chain management. Additionally, the awareness and implementation of green supply chain management also contribute positively to both economic and environmental advantages. This paper offers a theoretical framework for enhancing the efficiency of the green supply chain management system in chemical industrial clusters, hence promoting the environmentally friendly and sustainable growth of the chemical sector.</jats:p>"

The results show that permissioned blockchain governance mechanisms with consensus and incentives to motivate stakeholders are lacking in private and consortium blockchains. This study closes a research gap as understanding how the stakeholder management approach can compensate for the lack of consensus mechanisms can provide managerial guidance toward the development of an effective stakeholder management strategy, which eventually can be provided for a competitive advantage.

There are plenty of useful models built to address this issue. However, there are still many challenging problems, including that the accuracies of the models are not high enough, the complexity of the models makes them hard for wide use in reality and the capabilities of models to catch peaks still have much room for improvement. In order to solve these problems, we proposed an ensemble deep learning model named STL-Ada-LSTM for daily water demand forecast by combining STL method with AdaBoost-LSTM model. After data preprocessing, the smoothed series is decomposed by STL to gain three input series. Then, several LSTM models are integrated by the AdaBoost algorithm to construct the ensemble deep learning model for water demand forecast. At last, the superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated by comparing with other state-of-art models. The proposed method is applied for water demand forecast using daily datasets from two representative water plants in Yiwu, East China. All models are assessed by mean absolute scaled error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and Akaike information criterion (AIC). The results show that the proposed model not only enhances the accuracy of the forecast, but also improves the stability and conciseness, which make it a practical daily water demand forecast model.</jats:p>"

The need to shift to demand-side solutions and sustainable supply alternatives has been long advocated; yet this study is the first to “quantify” its impact on the water management system of Qatar – considered a study case of GCC countries. In this research, a scenario-based approach was utilized to predict the impact of water demand control and wastewater reuse (and the resulting synergies) on desalinated water consumption, groundwater resources and wastewater infrastructure. To this effect, country-specific models for Qatar were developed to forecast yearly household water demand, wastewater generation and residential construction growth, up to year 2050. The outcomes showed that tariff reforms and regulated greywater reuse would reduce the household demand for desalinated water by up to 27% and 7%, respectively. Also, intensive reuse of Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) would reduce 40–80% of total groundwater abstraction for irrigation. Finally, adopting an integrated water strategy, with combined demand and supply management targets, creates synergies that would: (1) limit the exploitation of groundwater resources to a range close to their safe yield; and (2) delay the need for expansion of the water and wastewater infrastructure by more than a decade. Data-driven recommendations were provided accordingly.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Background\n The relationship between health and labour has received considerable attention. There have been several studies exploring the link between health shocks and labour supply. However, there are only few systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this area. The current work aims to fill the gap by undertaking a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of health shocks and labour supply.\nPurpose\n The purpose of this work is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to produce pooled estimates of the effects of health shocks on labour supply. This provides two main contributions to the literature. First, it offers a comprehensive systematic review on the relationship between health and labour supply, an area of research where systematic reviews are uncommon. Second, it goes beyond a standard qualitative synthesis by performing a meta-analysis to quantify the combined effects of health shocks on labour supply. This might offer policy makers more accurate and credible evidence as pooled effects have the advantage of being based on larger sample sizes.\nMethods\n We conduct a thorough search using the databases EconLit and Medline together with grey literature to identify relevant papers for the analysis. We check results of these papers and extract the necessary information following an extraction tool. We calculate partial correlations to determine effect sizes and estimate the overall effect sizes by using the random effects model captioned in forest plots. Sub-group analyses are conducted based on geography, publication year and model type to assess the sources of heterogeneity. We also employ multivariate and univariate meta regressions to further examine the sources of heterogeneity. Moreover, we test for publication bias by using a funnel plot, the Egger’s test, the Begg’s test and the trim and fill methodology.\nResults\n We find a negative and statistically significant pooled estimate of the effect of health shocks on labour supply. The studies exhibited substantial heterogeneity with the I<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> test showing 96.6 percent. Sub-group analysis and univariate meta regressions showed that sample size, geography, model type and publication year were significant sources of heterogeneity. The funnel plot and the Egger’s test showed some level of publication bias, but this was contrasted by both the Begg’s test and the trim and fill methodology.\nConclusion\n We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of health shocks on labour supply. We searched the Econ Lit and Medline databases together with grey literature. Using partial correlations, we estimated the overall effect size by employing a random effects model and found a negative pooled effect of health shocks on labour supply. Sub-group analyses along with meta regressions were undertaken to deal with the observed high heterogeneity among studies and we established that geography, sample size, model type and publication year are significant sources of heterogeneity. Our results are novel in that this is the first meta-analysis on the topic directly filling the gap regarding understanding of pooled effects of health shocks on labour supply. The study is relevant for the understanding of policies regarding social protection, disability allowance and other relevant policies emanating from the health -labour relationship.</jats:p>"

Strategic collaborative alliances among small and medium enterprises help these companies to overcome difficulties confronted in supply chain processes, such as procurement and transportation. This study describes a horizontal collaboration among small and medium enterprises (<jats:italic>i.e</jats:italic>., customers) where the demands are satisfied by a supply and distribution cooperative in Turkey. The cooperative is responsible for making bulk purchases with a discounted price that is not attainable for individual customers and making product deliveries to the customers. The benefits of establishing a supply and distribution cooperative that involves horizontally collaborating customers are assessed through a proposed decision support model.</jats:p>\n    </jats:sec>\n    <jats:sec>\n          <jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>      \n        <jats:p>The model comprises a dynamic programming-based heuristic to determine a distribution plan and simulation to calculate total cooperative profit and customer profit shares.

In order to achieve the objective, this study has analysed the financial ratios applying the DuPont analysis, which has been demonstrated with tables to show the company's performance trend for five years (2018-2022). DuPont analysis is based on the analysis of Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA). The ROE disaggregates performance into three components: • Net Profit Margin, • Total Asset Turnover, and • The Equity Multiplier The return on investment consists of Assets Turnover (Operating Income × Total Assets) and Net Profit Margin (EBIT × Operating Income). From the study, it is found that: • The company under study is more efficient in managing assets to generate profits than the use of equity to generate profits. • The company is, on average, a low-risk firm for investors and shareholders. • ROE and ROA are the most comprehensive measure of the profitability of a firm as well as a compass for making operating, investing, financing, and leverage-related decisions. Based on these findings, it is recommended that: Management of the company needs to do an operational overhaul to sustain the significant areas of strength and overcome the weakness evident in the financial statements.</jats:p>"

Based on the studies, unlike the Stephenson's hypothesis (the outflow depth is equal to the critical depth), the outflow depth from the rockfill media is a coefficient (Γ) of the critical depth. In the present study, using several (large scale and almost real) experimental data in the radial non-Darcy flow condition, dimensional analysis and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, an equation was presented to calculate the mentioned coefficient based on upstream water depth (h) and distance between the well center and the upstream (R). Then, using the calculated outflow depth and the 1D flow analysis equations, the water surface profile in the radial non-Darcy condition was calculated for the first time. The results showed that considering an outflow depth equal to the critical depth and using the proposed solution in the present study, the mean relative error (MRE) values of 83.43% and 3.53% were obtained, respectively. In addition, using the proposed solution for different experimental conditions, an average MRE of 2.58% was calculated for the water surface profile.</jats:p>",

The present study investigates discharge measurement by top-hinged plates located along channels under free flow condition. The proposed simple device is a portable one. Two discharge models are proposed based on Buckingham's theorem of dimensional analysis. The first model (Model I) considers deflection angle as an independent variable while the second model (Model II) considers it as a dependent variable. A series of laboratory experiments (687 runs) were performed to calibrate the proposed models. The results showed that when the slope of the channel increases, the accuracy of the proposed model slightly decreases. The first model has an average error of 2.32%, while the second model has an average error of 3.19%, thus flow discharge through the rectangular channels with longitudinal slopes in range of [0, 0.005] can be accurately estimated using the proposed discharge models. Based on this experimental study, the plate length enhances the performance of the second model when the mass plate is unknown. The proposed device offers a simple and reliable discharge measurement approach for both horizontal and sloping rectangular channels.</jats:p>",

More precisely, based on a case study design involving Swedish SMEs operating in the same supply chain, this paper provides insight into the DSC process of these Swedish SMEs adopting the DIF. The results of the study enable the proposal of an updated framework consisting of five main components in the digitalization process, namely: digital strategy, digital organization and culture, digital operations, digital products and services, and digital customer experience. Furthermore, each component consists of several steps, called sub-components, which could be considered by SMEs when developing DSC to increase the success of this challenging activity.</jats:p>"

Natural disasters such as earthquakes have caused different types of damage to water distribution networks (WDN), particularly for those with aged infrastructure. This paper investigates the resilience of an existing water distribution network under seismic hazard. An earthquake generation model coupled with a probabilistic flow-based pressure driven demand hydraulic model is investigated and applied to an existing WDN. A total of 27 earthquake scenarios and 2 repair strategies were simulated. The analysis examined hydraulic resilience metrics such as pressure, leak demand, water serviceability, and population impacted. The results show that nodal pressure drops below nominal pressure and reaches zero in some earthquake scenarios. Leak demand could reach to more than 10 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s within hours following an earthquake. Water serviceability drops to a low of 40% and population impacted reaches up to 90% for a 6.5 M earthquake, for example. This study highlights and quantifies vulnerabilities within the simulated WDN. The tools outlined here illustrate an approach that can: (1) ultimately help to better inform utility water safety plans, and (2) prepare proactive strategies to mitigate/repair before a hazard of this nature occurs.</jats:p>"

While most of the existing studies on water supply concentrate on continuous water supply (CWS), the research focused on the IWS is now becoming mainstream. Hydraulic modelling is an effective tool for the process of planning, design, rehabilitation, and operation of water distribution systems. It helps significantly in engineers’ decision-making processes. The necessity of modelling IWS systems arises from the complexity and variety of problems caused by intermittency. This paper offers a review of the state-of-the-art IWS modelling and identifies the key strengths and limitations of the available approaches, and points at potential research directions. Currently, neither computer software nor a practically used approach is available for modelling IWS. For a rigorous simulation of IWS, system characteristics first need to be understood, i.e., the user behaviour under pressure-deficient conditions, water losses, and filling and emptying processes. Each of them requires further attention and improvement. Additionally, the necessity of real data from IWSs is stressed. Accurate modelling will lead to the development of improved measures for the problems caused by intermittency.</jats:p>",

The sampling technique used is purposive sampling, with 50 MSMEs – determination of the samples based on considering MSMEs that have implemented SCM practices. The analytical tool used is a path analysis model. The variables used in this study are aspects of SCM practices: customer relationship management, supplier relationship management, goal congruence, and information sharing. The results show that the dimensions of SCM practices partially positively influence firm performance and supply chain performance. Unfortunately, supply chain performance cannot mediate SCM practices on MSMEs performance. The supplier relationship management variable is considered to have the lowest value among other variables. Suggestions of this research that MSMEs can make are expected to work together with suppliers to improve product quality, such as evaluating product raw materials from suppliers, as well as routinely making continuous product improvements to maintain product quality owned by MSMEs.</jats:p>"

For better or worse, the effects of automating personal vehicles will not be felt for some time. In contrast, the effects of automated work vehicles, like semi-trucks, will be felt much sooner—within the next decade. The costs and benefits of automation will not be distributed evenly; while most of us will be positively affected by the lower prices overall, those losing their livelihoods to the automated semi-trucks and other similar work vehicles will be much worse off. This sets up a classic distributive justice problem: how do we balance the harms and benefits of automation? In this paper, the authors recommend work alternatives: policies that the government would enact in order to ensure that each person could live a decent life even if one could not work, especially for reasons like having one’s job automated. After arguing for this position, we propose some policy guidelines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Magnesium (Mg) plays an imperative role in determining crop growth and development, but Mg-deficiency becomes more common, more severe and more widespread in farmland. The major source of nitrogen for rice is ammonium (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>). However, excessive application of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> could inhibit Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> uptake by rice. It has been accepted that partial nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup>) nutrition may not only improve nitrogen (N) assimilation and rice growth, but also promote Mg<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup> absorption. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying Mg and N interaction are not well documented. To explore the relationship between them in rice plant, a hydroponic experiment was conducted with different Mg (0.01, 1.00, and 5.00 mM) concentrations and various NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup>/NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ratios (0/100, 25/75 and 50/50, %) under greenhouse conditions. Results showed that Mg-deficiency (0.01 mM) can cause yellow leaves, dwarf plants and fewer tillers during rice growth. Furthermore, Mg-deficiency treatment induced a major decrease in dry weight, root morphology and activity, photosynthetic properties, and Mg and N accumulation, while increase in antioxidant enzyme (MDA, SOD, POD and CAT) activities in rice, when compared with the high Mg (5.00 mM) or normal Mg (1.00 mM) treatment. The treatments with different NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup>/NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ratios had no significant effect on these antioxidant enzyme activities in most cases under high or normal Mg conditions. However, under Mg-deficiency stress, the supply of partial NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup> lead to a significant drop in antioxidant enzyme activities. Moreover, partial NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup> supply significantly improved Pn, Tr, Gs and Ci under Mg-deficiency conditions. In particular, under Mg-deficiency stress, the supply of partial NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup> dramatically promoted the growth of the root system, boosted the occurrence of lateral roots, enhanced root vitality. Additionally, the supply of partial NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup> lead to significant increases of dry weight and N and Mg accumulation under the stress of Mg-deficiency. The results of this study suggested that the symptoms of Mg-deficiency stress in rice can be alleviated by partial NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>-</jats:sup> supply.</jats:p>"

In this article, we focus on the problem of food waste, which is defined as loss of edible foods at the retail and consumption stages. Although not the main source of food waste in relative terms, retailers have a major role to play in food waste mitigation, by incentivizing upstream suppliers to reduce waste of resources and minimizing negative environmental impacts\nand by encouraging consumers to shift toward sustainable purchase and consumption behaviors. Given the close connection of marketing to retail operations and consumer behaviors, marketing scholars have the opportunity to make significant contributions in addressing the global food waste challenge. Our discussion focuses on how to mitigate food waste in retail outlets and by consumers through leveraging digital technologies and marketing knowledge. We first outline the economic, social, and environmental\nimpacts of food waste, and then synthesize current mitigating practices by retailers. We discuss several technologies that are particularly important for mitigating food waste. Finally, we propose five areas that offer opportunities for future research and actions on food waste mitigation.</jats:p>",

The Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion increased health insurance access among low-income individuals but there are concerns that public insurance may disincentivize labor supply. In this study, we examine whether Medicaid expansion affected the labor supply of low-educated DCWs at both extensive and intensive margin overall, and by different healthcare settings. Using annual American Community Survey data from 2010 to 2019 retrieved via Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, we identify 100,676 adult DCWs (age: 19-64) with a high school or less degree from 50 states and DC. We examine the potentially causal effect of Medicaid expansion on labor supply of DCWs using difference-in-differences and event-study regressions We find that Medicaid expansion is associated with a 2.9 percentage-point (p&amp;lt; 0.01) increase in full-time employment (&amp;gt;=35 hours) and a 1.9 percentage point (p&amp;lt; 0.05) decrease in part-time employment (20-34 hours). We also find that unemployment decreased by 0.8 percentage points (p&amp;lt; 0.1) among DCWs mainly driven by those working in the long-term care industry. Our study suggests that Medicaid expansion does not have a negative impact on labor supply among low-educated DCWs. States that have not expanded Medicaid can consider policies to increase insurance coverage for DCWs as a strategy to strengthen this workforce.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the period 1970–2019 was divided into three periods with the change point detection methods (Pettitt, Buishand rank and standard normal homogeneity test). Trends were examined by applying modified Mann–Kendall and Spearman's rho tests to precipitation and extreme indices for all periods and sub-periods. Then, temporal and spatial analyses of extreme indices were performed. According to the results obtained, there is no precipitation homogeneity throughout the basin.

This review paper focuses on the applicability of a framework for Supply Chain Agility as a methodological framework in stable (pre-COVID-19) versus turbulent (COVID-19) business environments. We argue and propose that Supply Chain Agility Framework is a holistic framework which is efficacious in both stable and unstable supply chain environments. This is amply supported by the central plank of our proposition that the Supply Chain Agility Framework offers an adaptable tool that can serve as a panacea to fresh produce supply chain challenges not only in a stable (pre-COVID-19) business environment but also effective and applicable in a turbulent business environment, such as experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In recent years, the EU has published vast documentation and directives on energy supply with particular emphasis on two main aspects: the identification and addressing of the malfunctioning of the EU Energy Market; and the impact of energy production and transportation on the environment. The second of these has centred on the promotion of renewable sources of energy. Having described briefly these developments to date, the paper proceeds to describe the latest attempts early in 2007 to set out an energy policy for Europe. This is designed to remove the persistent market malfunctions, improve energy efficiency and further support the development of renewable sources of energy. The paper also goes on to describe the obstacles to implementation of the energy policy at least in the short and medium terms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>One of the challenges of supply chain management is to properly react to supply interruptions due to disruption risks or poor performance. In this context, supply risk assessment and mitigation based on judgments of severity and occurrence is a common approach to establish risk factor mitigation priorities. This is a decision process that entails imprecise judgments by a group of decision makers, which may be better dealt with by applying computing with words combined with soft consensus techniques. Therefore, taking into account limitations of previous studies, this paper proposes a group decision making model to classify supply risk factors using the possibility distribution-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set as inputs to a fuzzy rule base classification system using a non-compensatory rule base. Also, the study includes computational modeling and a pilot application of the proposed decision model in a manufacturing company. The results of the pilot application were coherent with the experts´ evaluations. Using hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets enabled the experts to express their uncertainty about judgments in a better way. Also, the fuzzy rule base classification system is better to classify risk factors than the Mamdani FIS, which is more adequate to simply order risk factors.</jats:p>"

They have been widely used as a water regulator and to increase discharge in channels and spillway dams. Labyrinth weirs are an economical and effective method to pass large floods. In addition, they are used to reduce the requirements of the structural footprint. These features make them an interesting and appropriate choice to increase the capacity of discharge. Several factors affect the discharge capacity and the hydraulic performance of labyrinth weirs, including water level to crest height ratio, angle of sidewalls, apex width, conveyance channel conditions, and vertical aspect ratio. The present paper aims to summarise the most relevant knowledge of the hydraulic characteristics of the labyrinth weirs reported in previous articles. The importance of the present study is to provide a better understanding of how these weirs operate, in addition to which future studies deserve further investigation. The results demonstrated that some parameters still need further investigation. Also, energy dissipation over the labyrinth weir needs further investigation with different weir geometry. Furthermore, the results showed that common design equations did not take into account all parameters affecting labyrinth weir performance, including geometries, flow conditions, site conditions, and scale effect. In addition, machine learning techniques need further study.</jats:p>",

The results of structural equation modeling based on a sample of 162 Chinese companies show that environmental turbulence profoundly affects supply chain dynamic capabilities through direct and indirect effects. The dimensions of supply chain synergy have an important mediating effect on the dynamic capability of supply chains. Supply chain flexibility and agility, as the external manifestation of supply chain dynamic capability, are not only influenced by environmental turbulence and supply chain synergy, but also, the supply chain flexibility affects the supply chain agility. Based on these results, the formation mechanism of supply chain dynamic capability was further proposed.</jats:p>"

It is generally believed that the use of electricity to supply heat to multi-family buildings is considered to have a higher carbon footprint than gas-fired heating. If we consider the entire life cycle of heat supply systems, as well as the production of smoke exhaust systems, air supply, gas supply, operating expenses, the comparison between the carbon footprints of the above technologies is ambiguous. The use of electric boilers as sources of heat supply to apartments is limited due to the amount of energy, thus produced, which is equal to 15 kW.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. The author analyzed the operation of a wall-mounted electric boiler with a hierarchical load control system. Its mode of operation was focused on meeting the top-priority physiological and social needs of apartment residents.&#x0D;\nResults. The operation of electric heat generators, having triac and relay control systems, was compared for the case of a limited amount of electricity supplied. The authors determined the boundaries of comfortable use of electric heat generators for apartment heat supply.&#x0D;\nConclusions. Electric boilers with a triac control system and a small load change step can demonstrate linear modulation in the entire range of changes in heat load values of independent heat supply systems. The structure of electrical energy consumption by electric boilers is hierarchical. An electric boiler control system must have an independent line equipped with priority and time relays. 15 kW is enough to ensure the comfortable use of any standard electrical appliances for premises up to 80 m2 located in the central areas of the Russian Federation.</jats:p>",

To analyze this, we develop a game-theoretic model considering a manufacturer who faces a per-unit carbon emissions cap and sources from a supplier. The manufacturer operates in a carbon sensitive market. We analyze the responses of the manufacturer and supplier and show that since the burden of carbon emissions cap is borne by the manufacturer, the first-best outcomes are not reached. Therefore, the supplier may offer different contracts to incentivize the manufacturer. We study two mechanisms: the two-part tariff and the revenue-and-investment sharing contracts. We show how such contracts achieve coordination and deliver efficient supply chain outcomes. Interestingly, we find that the contract preferences of the manufacturer and the supplier may not be the same and vary under different market conditions.

High-rise buildings are often multi-functional, and this characteristic is implemen­ted in the process of designing indoor water supply systems: it is necessary to take into account various classes of functional fire hazards typical for different areas inside a building, and equip individual rooms with automatic water extinguishing units. Of special importance is the energy efficiency of a water supply system, since pumping equipment and its mode of operation have the greatest influence on the system. The design of an indoor water supply system for any high-rise structure is always a compromise between the interests of investors (developers) and the regulations. The purpose of the study is to identify current trends in the design of indoor cold water supply systems for high-rise buildings (or complexes).&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. The overview is based on current regulatory and engineering documentation governing high-rise construction, as well as the research papers focused on the design of engineering systems of high-rise buildings. The author analyzed several designs of indoor water supply systems for multi-functional high-rise buildings, in respect of which positive opinions had been issued by the expert organizations.&#x0D;\nResults. It is established that up-feed parallel water supply systems, broken down into zones, are most widely used in the present-day projects of indoor water supply systems designed for high-rise buildings. Each water supply zone can serve 11 to 18 floors, and an increase in the number of floors within one zone reduces the energy efficiency of the system. Automatic fire extinguishing systems are an integral element of water fire extinguishing systems in multi-functional high-rise buildings. Any damage, inflicted by the false triggering of sprinklers, should be minimized at the stage of design.&#x0D;\nConclusions. The author classified potential cold water supply systems for high-rise buildings, described their principle of operation, strengths, weaknesses, and applicability limits. The research project also encompasses the analysis of present-day designs of indoor cold water supply systems for multi-functional high-rise buildings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper examines the issue of strategic planning of fuel supplies in combined heat and power systems. This is a major challenge in energy modeling because heating-degree day calculation methods only address short-term horizons and are not suitable for the long-term planning of fuel supplies. In this work, a comprehensive method is proposed for strategic fuel supply planning of independent heat producers. The method considers changes in the market dynamics of residential and commercial properties, the annual rate of customer acquisition by the network operator, customer disconnections, as well as the thermal modernization of buildings for estimating the long-term thermal energy demand of an urban area. Moreover, the method develops a mathematical model to minimize production costs, taking into account the technical constraints of the system. The proposed strategic planning tool, in addition to information on the quantities of fuel consumed for heat and electricity production, also provides valuable management information on the operational costs of the CHP system and its environmental impact. The application of the method is illustrated with the analysis of a large-scale combined heat and power plant supplying heat and electricity to a city with over 500,000 inhabitants. The results indicate that depending on the changes in the primary and secondary heat markets, the demand for energy carriers may range from 107.37 TWh to 119.87 TWh.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. It has been found that selenium deficiency is one of the risk factors for the development of thyroid pathology, in particular autoimmune one. The evidence base for this statement includes the association of low selenium levels with enlarged thyroid gland, heterogeneity, and the presence of hypoechogenicity, which are ultrasonographic signs of thyroid lymphoid infiltration. Given that the inhabitants of rural areas consume mainly vegetables and fruits of local origin and water from local sources, the levels of selenium in them largely reflect the supply of this trace element in specific territories. Aim: to determine the degree of selenium availability of adolescent girls in rural areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions of Ukraine. Materials and methods. The level of selenium was studied in the hair of adolescent girls aged 13–15 years. Measurements were made using an atomic absorption spectrometer ICE 3500 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Selenium content of more than 0.8 μg/g was considered normal. Results. It was found that selenium level in the hair was lower than the reference values in 15 of 16 residents of Zaporizhzhia region (93.6 %), in 16 of 18 residents of the Balakliia district (88.9 %) and in all the examined girls from Chuhuiiv district of Kharkiv region (100.0 %). At the same time, the median and minimum levels of selenium supply in all groups of patients were lower than the lower threshold of reference norms. In 12 of 16 examinees in group I (75.0 %), 9 of 12 in group II (75.0 %) and 14 of 18 in group III (77.77 %), thyroid sizes exceeded the age norm. Conclusions. The results of the research show that adolescent girls living in rural areas of Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions have a high frequency of selenium deficiency against the background of which the majority of the examined patients has increased thyroid volume. Such data require regular monitoring of the health of adolescents in the specified areas with the mandatory participation of endocrinologists. In addition, there is a need to develop special organizational measures that would ensure timely detection of children with selenium deficiency with a rational schedule for their further examination.</jats:p>"

While the results of 300 mobile banking users 93.3% rated effective at the level of need and convenience. Then 10% less effective and 3.3% less effective users agree and disagree because the UI (User Interface) of mobile banking is less attractive. Finally, the security level can be assessed as effective with a percentage of 80% and less effective 20% because the application login security does not yet have a fingerprint and face id which he thinks is more secure and practical.</jats:p>"

Background: Disruption factors are obstacles that impede a manufacturing company filling customer orders and are treated as the main causal factors in this study. The number of unfilled orders of an industry is any obligation to provide a good or service that has not been met and is used as the main response variable in this research. Methods: Principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis are both variable reduction techniques that were utilized together in order to isolate latent constructs behind disruption factors and identify significant disruption factors contributing to the unfilled orders for each industry. Results: Across a majority of manufacturing industries, insufficient supply of materials, equipment limitations, logistics/transportation constraints, and storage limitations were observed to be amplified significantly as disruption factors by the pandemic. Conclusions: This research reveals the disruption factors that were exacerbated by the pandemic in a set of certain industrial manufacturing and technology industries that were not extensively examined by previous research and strongly corroborate existing literature on the general challenges imposed by the pandemic on supply chain networks. This work also provides a future research objective of improving supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

Power (wattage) output from 27V/10A DC is inadequate to power up various onboard avionic sub-systems in guided stores involving seekers and other avionics. Hence, it is planned to convert available high power 3Ø-115V-400Hz-AC supply for applications requiring higher wattages (of the order of 500 watts or more). This power supply provides multiple output options of 30V regulated and isolated DC supply with multiple input supplies from Aircraft, viz. 3Ø-115V-400Hz-AC, 1Ø-115V-400Hz-AC and 27V DC. One of the outputs provided is with hold-up capacitors, to cater for any input power interruptions as per requirements of MIL-STD-704F and GOST-19705-89 standards. This power supply is a ready-to-connect device and essentially consists of housing, components of DC to DC conversions, EMI/EMC filters, solid state power controllers, control switches, and control circuitry for monitoring signals.</jats:p>"

This article delves into the intricate dynamics of food production, distribution, and consumption, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in meeting the nutritional needs of a growing population. Through a comprehensive analysis of trends, policies, and innovations in agriculture and food systems, this article explores pathways towards achieving food security and ending hunger worldwide. By emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach that addresses both supply-side constraints and demand-side factors, the article advocates for integrated strategies that promote sustainable agriculture, equitable access to food, and nutritional diversity. Drawing upon empirical evidence and case studies from diverse contexts, the article underscores the urgency of collective action and multisectoral collaboration in realizing the vision of Zero Hunger. Ultimately, it argues that by aligning production with nutritional needs, enhancing food distribution systems, and empowering communities to make healthy food choices, we can create a world where every person has access to adequate, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food, thereby ensuring food security and promoting human well-being.</jats:p>",

In terms of its contribution, after reviewing some of the existing literature, this article presents a theoretical framework to understand “irregular” supply behaviour, while it empirically identifies an “inverse” supply curve for the EU dairy sector. In doing so, milk prices have been decomposed by following the procedure proposed by James P. Houck. This exercise confirms the non-reversibility, and therefore an asymmetric response, in the behaviour of milk supply for most EU Member States. Moreover, this article also presents the results of a “stress” test of the dairy sector in order to analyse the responses of dairy production in a context of the asymmetrical behaviour of dairy farmers and assess the competitiveness of the dairy sector at Member State level. The outcomes emphasise the high competitiveness of the Irish dairy sector and suggest a deterioration of the competitiveness in the case of the United Kingdom and France. From the policy-making perspective, the identification of this type of farmer’s reactions is key for an appropriate design of policy interventions and crisis management strategies.</jats:p>"

Recently, organizations have started embarking on “Industry 4.0 technologies”, a name used to denote transformative modern-day technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, automation and robotics, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain, and so on to make faster decisions, optimize current practices, provide end-to-end transparency, increased collaboration, and superior warehouse management, which can collectively make it an “Intelligent supply chain”. However, a comprehensive understanding of the subject is required to understand the benefits and challenges of adopting them. Methods: Hence, the article aims to systematically review the literature to identify various challenges associated with supply chain management and provide an overview of the role of Industry 4.0 technologies in addressing them. In addition to traditional complexities, the uncertainties arising from contemporary challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, war, natural calamities, and difficulties businesses face in developing and adopting sustainable business practices. Results and Conclusions: The study shows that although it is hard to predict the level of disruptions during any global events, it is possible to be prepared through Industry 4.0 technologies that can give agility, transparency, and resilience to the supply chain.</jats:p>"

In the absence of this gas supply, the continent is likely to experience shortages and associated inflation. Immediate solutions include diversification of Europe's natural gas supply and the use of alternative fossil fuels, such as coal, but the latter would come with significant climate costs. Over a longer period, there is more scope for reshaping Europe's energy policy and diversifying its energy supply, but these would come at a cost. Expanding renewable energy capacity within Europe is critical. Fine‐tuning policy to balance climate objectives against the security of the energy supply will be difficult. To ensure energy security and emerge from this conflict greener, the answer may be renewable energy produced in Europe. Investment in renewables in developing countries, particularly in the continent's trading partners, also holds promise, as it would allow more natural gas imports into Europe while contributing to Europe's climate commitments.</jats:p>",

Food security has become a highly emotive issue, as chronic hunger, local food shortages, and sudden increases in food prices are strongly influencing public sentiment and reaction. This raises concern for the assessment of supply chain management and sustainable food security in Nigeria, using honesty among supply chain participants, effective storage facilities, and quality of seed as a determinant for sustainable food security. A survey research design was adopted for this study, using a structured questionnaire. Convenient and Purposive sampling techniques were used to select 80 farmers from the North-Western state of Nigeria. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data collected, which was presented using charts. The findings of this study show that honesty among supply chain participants, effective storage facilities for farm produce, and the quality of seeds to plant will enhance nutritional foods in society, promotes both affordability and high profits for all participants in the supply chain based on the response of the selected farmers. It was further revealed from the study that Government intervention in terms of subsidy and credit facilities to the farmers are not well harnessed by the real farmers that are actually in the business of farming. Therefore, it was recommended, among others, that there should be an effective feedback mechanism from the government to ensure the subsidy is actually addressing the purpose of its establishment.</jats:p>"

Two possible breaches are considered – a breach in quality of the delivery and a breach in the process. In the absence of any penalty, a process breach reduces the supplier’s delivery risk and cost of delivery. Determining the parametric conditions for efficient contracts, numerically we show the effects of various variables on the zone of efficient contract.

Much of the attention on the matter is centered in industrialized countries, creating a knowledge gap within developing countries, among which is the Philippines. This lack of information impedes the country-level response in solving the issue, whose implications extend to food and nutrition security, productivity, and resource use. For this reason, our paper estimates the food loss and waste levels in the Philippine food supply chain of rice, corn, and banana commodities. We were first to identify the percentage accumulation of food loss and waste in each stage of the food supply chain and translated such portions into edible food volumes initially intended for human consumption. Our findings revealed that between one-seventh to one-fifth of edible rice, corn, and banana quantities are lost/wasted in their respective food supply chains. For each of the commodities analyzed, the principal activities responsible for the problem are drying, dehanding, and harvesting, respectively. Our results suggest the following for policy intervention and research: establish an agreed-upon food loss and waste definition; calibrate interventions at the level of the food supply chain; follow a supply chain system approach in reducing the problem; and determine an acceptable level of loss/waste.</jats:p>"

Bangladesh is a well-known Asian country for a variety of reasons. Though the tourist industry is not well-known among international visitors, it is very popular among locals.Objective: The objective of the study to analyze the tourism supply chain in Bangladesh. Methodology: The research included descriptive methods. Data were collected from secondary sources like published journal articles, research reports and internet sources. Results: Tourism industry has positive impact on GDP and the whole economy of the country. Conclusion: Tourism emphasizes pleasure and loyalty. This concept only works in a bad supply chain grid. Under NTO's supervision, tourism components will lessen tourist irritation. Contingency models assist supply chains to find solutions. In terrible weather or traffic, don't send visitors. Tour operators take travelers to nearby hotels and restaurants.</jats:p>",

The specific objectives were to determine the effects of information technology, material handling, staff competencies, and storage facilities on inventory management. The study was guided by Resource Based View Theory. The study adopted a descriptive survey design. The sample size for the study was 41 members of staff from Public Hospitals. The study established that increase in the staff competencies and storage facility results in an increase in effective inventory management. Further, increase in information technology and materials handling results in a decrease in effective inventory management. The study recommended that public hospitals should consider both academic qualification and experience in hiring its staff, automating material handling techniques to enhance the safety of materials, and must ensure maximum security and safety of stores and hospitals at large. Top management in public hospitals must embrace and attain the required standards of knowledge on matters of inventory control and management. The hospital management and leadership must and should embrace the use of technology to enhance most effective and efficient delivery of services to the public.</jats:p>"

Therefore, green supply chain management (GSCM) practices have caught the attention of researchers in many different countries. However, the adoption of GSCM practices and their influence on firm performance is still in its early stages. This study examines the influence of GSC determinants on firm performance in Pakistan’s manufacturing industry. Survey data was collected from 317 respondents working at various managerial levels in supply chains from manufacturing firms of Pakistan. Green supply chain management practices were assessed using five variables; ‘eco-design, green purchasing, green information systems, cooperation with customers and green manufacturing’. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that green supply chain (GSC) initiatives had a significant impact on firm performance. Excluding green purchasing, the remaining four elements of GSC were shown to be statistically significant in predicting firm performance. This study highlights the importance of employing green strategies and practices in supply chains in order to improve overall organizational performance. In addition to practical implications for supply chain related environmental concerns, some directions for future research have also been suggested. </jats:p>"

It is predicted that up to 15% of additional protein will be provided by insects in 2050, and their market will be estimated at $1.2 billion. The characteristics of the black lion fly (Hermetia illucens) and its larvae, peculiarities of cultivation and chemical composition are presented. Larvae mostly consist of protein and fat, and also contain 7.0% chitin, 5.0% calcium, 1.5% phosphorus and iron. The amino acid composition of the protein demonstrates the presence of a wide range of amino acids and a relatively high content of lysine, which makes it possible to use them in the development of new components of complete feed for farm animals and poultry. A method of introducing dry larvae of the black lion fly into the compound feed through granulated and extruded mixtures with a mass fraction of larvae from 10 to 50% has been developed. The structural scheme of the introduction of larvae in the production of compound feed is presented, which includes cleaning of grain raw materials, grinding, sieving, mixing the passing fraction of the sieve with dry larvae in a certain ratio, and subsequent granulation and extrusion of the mixture. The results of the study of the physical properties of the samples of the molded mixtures are given, and it is established that the sample with 15% dry larvae has the best physical properties. With an increase in the content of dry larvae in the mixture by more than 25%, the samples at the exit were characterized by significant fragility and fatness and required an additional drying operation, which would significantly increase the cost of the finished compound feed. Calculated recipes of complete ration compound feed for adult laying hens using larvae from 15 to 20%, which made it possible to exclude expensive feeds of animal origin (fish meal, meat and bone meal) and partially replace soybean meal (up to 12%), which significantly reduced the cost of finished compound feed.</jats:p>"

Recent events have resulted in a commitment to the Paris Agreement for the reduction of carbon emissions by a significant amount by the year 2030. Rapid urbanisation is taking place to provide room for an increasing number of people’s residences. Increasing the size of a city and the number of people living there creates a daily need for consumable resources. In the areas of transportation, supply chains, and the utilisation of renewable energy sources, deliver on pledges that promote the accomplishment of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations. As a result, the supply chain needs to be handled effectively to meet the requirements of growing cities. Management of the supply chain should be in harmony with the environment; nevertheless, the question of how to manage a sustainable supply chain without having an impact on the environment is still mostly understood. The purpose of this study is to present a conceptual model that may be used to maintain a sustainable supply chain with electric vehicles in such a way that caters to both environmental concerns and human requirements. As part of the continual process of achieving sustainability, interrelationships between the various aspects that are being investigated, comprehended, and applied are provided by the model that was developed. It is self-evident that governmental and international organisations that are concerned with supply-demand side information will benefit from such a model, and these organisations will locate viable solutions in accordance with the model’s recommendations. Beneficiaries consist of individuals who are active in the supply chain and are concerned with supply-demand side information.

However, the difficulty of recharge and the clogging problem in the recharge process are still a worldwide problem that restricts the sustainable development and utilization of sandstone geothermal reservoirs. The main factor affecting the recharge effect is physical clogging. In this paper, a series of simulation experiments were conducted to study the physical clogging in the recharge process of sandstone thermal storage in the Lubei area, which conclude that the degree of clogging is related to the particle size and concentration of suspended matter. At a certain particle size, the clogging is most serious when the experimental suspended matter concentration gradient is up to 140 mg/L. In addition, particle migration in clogging is related to the recharge flow rate, and the critical flow rate is 0.75–2 mL/min, which is experimentally derived, and it is recommended that the recharge rate should be controlled below 0.75 mL/min during the actual recharge. This paper provides a scientific basis for the efficient recharge of geothermal tailwater through the study of the clogging mechanism.</jats:p>",

Contractionary monetary policy, when pushed too far, drags the economy to recession while` extreme expansionary monetary policy sinks the economy to liquidity trap. Central banks are in charge and are expected to favorably run the monetary policy by adjusting interest rates, influencing local lending rates, buying foreign currency, printing money, and use of other tools to modulate currency exchange rates, manage inflation, etcetera, with a sole target of creating a healthy economy. This study looks into the effect of money supply rate, exchange rate and interest rate on inflation rate in Nigerian economy between 1991 and 2021. With secondary data, the variables are found to be of mixed order of integration and, therefore, the ARDL model is our parameter estimator. Our model is found to be stable and our empirical investigation reveals that both money supply rate and interest rate in Nigeria have no significant effect on Nigeria’s inflation rate while exchange `rate has a significant inverse effect on Nigeria’s inflation rate – the less favorable the exchange rate, the more biting the inflation. The study is wrapped up `with a recommendation that Nigerian government/authorities should rise up to occasion of fixing the insecurity challenges of the nation so as to create safe environment that can attract local investments as well as foreign direct investments which, among other benefits, will be favorable to Nigeria in exchange rate.</jats:p>"

To achieve these goals, hydrometeorological data of this basin were analyzed using the Pettitt and Mann Kendall tests. Likewise, flooding risk areas were produced from Frequency Ratio (FR) model. Average and extreme flows of Mefou river have increased since 1985–86, unlike the rainfall, which generally decreased for all seasons from the 1970s, apart from summer, where the reverse was observed. Changes in land use (increase impervious areas (+530%) and a decrease in forest (−52.9%) and water bodies (−80.4%)) seem to be the main cause of the increase in flows observed. Floods are often recurrent in basins with such hydrological behaviour. To enable policymakers to reduce the vulnerability of populations to this disaster, the proposed flood map shows that 2.67, 7.22, 22.5, 35.25 and 32.36% of the catchment area are respectively delineated into very low, low, medium, high and very high flood vulnerability classes. These results could be useful for the management of water resources and associated hydrological risks in the basin investigated.</jats:p>",

After thorough research from the existing literature, it was determined that the convergent angle (CA) of a standard Venturi meter has not been optimized yet. The range given for a standard ASME Venturi CA is 20–22°. More than 50 models were created and run in ANSYS FLUENT, which was used as a CFD tool. Three β-ratios are taken into consideration here, which are 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6. An optimum value of CA, corresponding to each β, is obtained by finding out the best coefficient of discharge (closest to 0.99) for each test value of CA. Another aspect explored in this research is the relationship between Reynolds number and coefficient of discharge. This is done with the integration of ANSYS FLUENT and laboratory results. The results of this study yield a definite value of CA for each β.</jats:p>",

This paper used the resource-advantage theory as the theoretical foundation and modeling binary logistic regression analysis, consisting of human, relational, and physical resources. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with growers, coordinators, integrators, and factory managers. The results revealed that human resources (e.g., education level, work experience), relational resources (e.g., membership, trading channel), and physical resources (e.g., sweet corn variety) have statistical significance with information sharing. This confirms the resource as a potential source of opportunities to share information.

Four primary factors and 21 subfactors were identified from the existing literature, and after validation by 12 experts, the causal relationships between the factors were analyzed using the Gray-DEMATEL method. The Gray-DEMATEL method was applied to analyze the causal relationships between the factors. The findings show that joint promotion by stakeholders is the most significant cause driver and market impact is the most prominent driver in the first-level indicator, both of which have a significant impact on low-carbon production. “Process optimization”, “Top-management support”, “Government regulations and support”, and “Information disclosure” are the most significant cause secondary drivers under the corresponding Tier 1 indicator factors, respectively, to provide realistic guidance for companies engaged in the plastics industry to continue to develop a low-carbon circular economy to achieve net-zero emissions under the challenges of COVID-19.

As part of their Clean Futures initiative, Unilever Home Care has published the Carbon Rainbow, a scheme which categorizes chemical sources into different “colors,” depending on their derivation. One of the sustainability goals of the Carbon Rainbow is to phase out non-renewable “black” carbon from supply chains by 2030. This complements the goals of the Clean Futures initiative, which looks toward a Net-Zero impact from all products from a cradle-to-shelf scope by 2039. Given the substantial contributions to atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from the production and use of conventional surfactants, this paper reviews methods to form Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS) through means which look to utilize Carbon Rainbow-categorized carbon sources outside of traditional fossil sources. The focus when reviewing each method is the overall defossilization of the LAS production process. The inventories of new defossilised methods collated within this research will ultimately provide the backbone for a future study on sustainability assessment screening. Through a literature search and technological overview, the construction of a tree diagram showing many new routes to LAS-appropriate olefins has been accomplished, illustrating the breadth of technologies available that share the common goal of defossilization. The expanse of technologies works well as to provide options to the necessary companies, though also resulting in a vast array of options to consider and assess before pursuing the optimum route. In total, 19 technologies were reviewed, forming a map containing 27 different supply chain routes from feedstock to LAS-appropriate olefins. This research therefore also shows the need for a short-form sustainability screening in order to green-light technologies which are suitable for a long-form sustainability assessment before any new process is adopted.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Uttarakhand, a state in the northern region of India which is traversed by the Himalayas, grows a variety of horticultural crops (e.g., fruits, vegetables, spices, and flowers) and is experienced with large-scale horticulture production at the national and/or international levels. Due to the wide variation in the climatic conditions and growing patterns, its pattern varies from harvest to harvest and from one province to another in terms of range, production, and yield. One of the most lucrative industries in Uttarakhand’s hilly areas is horticultural cultivation. It substitutes for the neighborhood economy and helps farmers make a living. According to the literature, no work on the supply chain management of fruits in the hilly areas of Uttarakhand has yet been documented to analyze the growth of horticulture cultivation. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to focus on the supply chain management of kiwi fruit, a type of major growing fruit in Uttarakhand’s Bageshwar area. Additionally, this paper will offer a business plan for small-scale farmers to boost employment, economic development, and benefits. This study contributes to the discussion of the problems with the Himalayan fruit supply chain that is specific to the kiwi fruit and how a sustainable business model like horti-tourism can enable greater revenue generation for farmers while also resolving the problems with the Himalayan produce supply chain.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a novel conceptual framework and empirical results to evaluate the potential for Structurally Insulated Panels (SIPs) to address this challenge. Firstly, we present a comprehensive analysis of the energy performance of a SIPs building in the UK to evaluate the potential for such technologies to satisfy the energy and carbon objectives. Using our unique data set we show that SIPs can exceed the necessary energy efficiency standards and reach Net Zero Carbon. Secondly, we introduce game theory as a novel conceptual framework to understand the incentives of the manufacturers of SIPs and UK/EU authorities. This enables us to identify potential sources of incentive conflict, which inhibit the diffusion of such technologies. We demonstrate that it benefits both parties to engage in medium investment, but the inferior under investment scenario can emerge if the UK/EU does not provide leadership and commitment to SIPs technologies. Regardless of the market design in terms of the timing of decisions, the maximum level of support by both the UK/EU and the SIPs manufacturers cannot be achieved.</jats:p>"

Plus exactement, il s’agit de présenter comment les hommes et les femmes travaillant en logistique et SCM évaluent les compétences nécessaires à leurs missions. Ce sujet pose la question de la représentation des femmes et de leurs compétences dans des métiers historiquement masculins. Une étude quantitative a été menée auprès de 156 personnes travaillant dans la logistique et le SCM en France. Contrairement aux études et enquêtes précédentes, nos résultats indiquent que les femmes sont présentes presque en même proportion que les hommes, y compris dans les niveaux hiérarchiques supérieurs (directeur et top-managers). Notre recherche souligne également que le genre a peu d’impact sur la perception des compétences nécessaires à la réalisation des missions en logistique et SCM. En effet, hommes et femmes valorisent tous les deux plus fortement les compétences humaines vis-à-vis des compétences techniques. Le classement des compétences entre hommes et femmes reste très proche. La différence notable apparaît dans le classement des trois premières compétences clés toutes catégories confondues. Notre étude contribue ainsi à éclairer la situation des femmes travaillant dans le domaine de logistique et SCM en France, mais également à prolonger les études existantes sur les compétences en intégrant une perspective peu étudiée. À cela, s’ajoute l’opportunité offerte aux entreprises, d’ouvrir le débat sur la diversité de genre et la nécessaire évolution des compétences face aux nouveaux défis de la Supply Chain (SC).</jats:p>",

Since the environmental supply chain management of firms has an important part in maneuvering their sustainable performance, the present study focuses on assessing the impact of green supply chain management practices on the sustainable performance of the textile, automobile, and tobacco industries. The data were collected from 384 organizations and analyzed through SPSS and AMOS. The results reveal that the impact of green manufacturing, green purchases, eco-design, and green information system are significant and positive on the sustainable performance of the organizations, whereas the impact of cooperation with customers is insignificant. Similarly, the moderation of institutional pressures between green manufacturing, green purchases, eco-design, and sustainability performance is insignificant, whereas it significantly moderates between cooperation with customers, green information systems, and sustainable performance. The study is significant and novel for considering five different factors of green supply chain management (GSCM): green manufacturing, green purchasing, cooperation with customers, eco-design, and green information systems. Furthermore, adding institutional pressures as a moderator between GSCM and sustainable performance adds to the novelty and uniqueness of the research.

The activity of tourist operators in war conditions was analyzed, the main directions of tourist trips chosen by tourists in the 2022 season were determined and characterized. The influence of the state of war on the activities of travel agencies was shown, most of which were forced to switch to online work or stop travel agency activities. In general, the tourist market of Ukraine has undergone organizational changes during the war, but it is actively working, reorganizing and creating new tourist products.\n\nThe sphere of tourism is one of the most important sectors of the economy. In terms of revenue, it ranks third in the country's economy. Taxes paid on income from tourist trips make up a significant part of the budget of the regions and the country. Trade enterprises, hotel and restaurant establishments, production of souvenir products, all types of transport are related to tourism.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to study the specifics of the activities of tourism and tourism business entities in the conditions of a full-scale Russian-Ukrainian war, to determine tourism priorities, the offer of tour operators and the demand of Ukrainians for tourist services.\n\nWith the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the activities of tourism market entities such as tour operators and travel agents practically ceased from February to May 2022, however, most tourism enterprises paid taxes to the state budget. According to the State Tourism Development Agency, the budget of Ukraine has under-received taxes from the tourism industry due to the war.\n\nAmong all subjects of the market of tourist services, military operations had the most negative impact on the work of tourist operators. Some of them have suspended their activity, others have stopped it altogether. The «pause» or temporary suspension of tourist activity was conditional in the first months of military aggression. At that time, the management and employees of tourist operators tried to find an opportunity to enter the European markets and transfer airlines with the possibility of departures from the nearest, neighboring countries to Ukraine.\n\nThe tourism business struggled to hold on. Closer to June, it became clear that focusing exclusively on the domestic market is unrealistic. In order to achieve full loading of tour operators, it is extremely important to enter new markets. This is a very necessary and very serious step of one of the largest tourist operators of Ukraine, «Join Up».\n\nWith the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia into Ukraine, one of the important and, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, successful sectors of the national economy - tourism and the service sector – was reorganized. Until this moment, tourism was at the stage of strategic development, and found itself at the stage of the possibility of preservation. The preservation of tourism and the tourist business is an extremely important task in the conditions of a full-scale war, in order to support the country's economy and the future recovery after our victory. The new conditions change both the demand and supply of travel operators and agents. However, new tourist products adapted to force majeure circumstances appear every season.</jats:p>",

The factors that adversely affect the performance are the extent of the population covered by groundwater-based schemes and irrigation water demand per unit area. Subsequently, the districts in Maharashtra where groundwater-based schemes are likely to succeed were identified.

Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are used in this study. First, quantitative methods were used to develop a conceptual model for the organization’s current needs using the PPT, the TOE, and an Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT). A simple random sampling method was used to gather the data, with a sample size of 14 villages. Using a five-point Likert scale, the researcher gathered data from 2,584 households and collected 627 valid responses. After that, descriptive statistics were used to describe the data (frequency distributions, percentages, averages, medians, and standard deviations), and PLS-SEM was used to investigate the interactions between variables and launch the conceptual model using partial least squares (PLS) path modeling. First and foremost, qualitative through Interactive Qualitative Analysis (IQA). There are two ways to create a congested SID and an uncluttered SID: the Affinity Relationship Table (ART), the mapping of the Inter-Relationship Diagram (IRD), and the system influence diagram.

It is difficult to obtain an exact analytical solution to the head discharge relationship due to the existence of 3D flow. Consequently, various forms of soft computing techniques are used as an appropriate alternative to achieve greater accuracy in developing a discharge prediction model. In the present study, support vector regression (SVR) has, therefore, been implemented to develop a discharge coefficient prediction model for a triangular labyrinth (TL) weir using a sizeable amount of laboratory data available in the literature. An attempt has also been made to obtain a simple discharge coefficient equation using the same data based on the non-linear regression (NLR) approach for field application. A comparative study has been carried out to assess the accuracy of the discharge coefficient models obtained in the present study and those reported in the literature. Sensitivity analysis has been made to study the influence of individual parameters on the discharge coefficient. The accuracy of different discharge coefficient prediction models was also tested for the data of prototype labyrinth weir and appropriate models were recommended for the field application.</jats:p>",

For this, the first graph neural network based approach to model uncertainty in supply chain knowledge graph reasoning is shown. We illustrate our approach on a novel dataset and manage to improve the state-of-the-art performance by 60% in uncertainty link prediction.

The objectives are to evaluate and categorise the literature that addresses the big data potential in SCM and the current practises of big data in SCM. The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to analyse several published papers between 2017 and 2022. It follows four steps: the literature collection, descriptive analysis, category selection, and material evaluation in a systematic review. The finding reveals that BDA has been applied in many supply chain functions. Furthermore, integrating BDA in SCM has several advantages, including improved data analytics capabilities, logistical operation efficiency, supply chain and logistics sustainability, and agility. Finally, the study emphasises the importance of using BDA to support the success of SCM in businesses. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As semiconductor usage is prevailing, sustainable growth is deemed highly dependent on the semiconductor supply chain. Accordingly, it is essential to establish robust supply chain capability for a semiconductor company. Especially for Japanese semiconductor manufacturers, it is critical to secure robust and flexible supply chain operation with the background of the experience of supply chain disruption caused by the East Japan Earthquake. So far, we identified that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers and Japanese automotive manufacturers have been in cooperation to secure the semiconductor supply chain. However, the global electronic industry environment has been significantly changed and it is not enough just to consider natural disasters. With this perspective, it is not yet fully studied how Japanese semiconductor manufacturers adapted to global operation through organizational learning. This paper examines how a Japanese semiconductor firm conducted organizational learning and adapted to environmental changes in cross-border M&amp;A transactions. Traditionally, Japanese firms have established organizational routines for the management control systems of their overseas subsidiaries by relying on the expatriates’ transactive memory systems (TMS), which is based on their personnel experiences over the countries and cultural background understanding. Japanese firms have used TMS of expats to manage their global organizations. Recently, however, not a small number of Japanese companies have accelerated their globalization through cross-border M&amp;A, which requires organizational capabilities different from those of conventional TMS formation. In this paper, we studied a case of cross-border M&amp;A of a Japanese semiconductor company by modeling the organizational learning structure throughout the extracted concepts summarizing semi-structure interview outcome. As a result, it has been found out that, by shifting from Japanese cultural norms to more global values in terms of management systems, benefits can be achieved. The company unlearned organizational routines that relied on TMS and created new organizational routines. This study provides direction from a practical perspective on how Japanese firms can transform their global organizations and adapt to changes in the environment for sustainable growth.</jats:p>"

Based on a literature review, this study proposes the adoption of a holistic approach that involves private actor partnerships and involvement to improve scale and speed of vaccination during pandemic times. The study has also revealed that social actors like religious and community leaders need to be involved in order to support communication that is necessary for reducing misinformation and development of trust for citizens to go ahead and vaccinate.

The objective is to explore the effects of carbon trading pricing and overconfidence on supply chain members’ decisions and profits. The study shows that carbon trading prices can be a good guide for low-cost manufacturers to reduce emissions when manufacturers are rational under carbon trading policies. However, the ability of carbon trading prices to act as a guide starts to fail as the cost of emission reduction increases. When manufacturers are overconfident, this causes manufacturers to increase the emission reduction rate of their products under carbon trading policies. In addition, this effect increases in line with increases in carbon trading prices. When manufacturers face different emission reduction costs, higher carbon trading prices do not necessarily always generate benefits for rational manufacturers. For overconfident manufacturers, however, overconfidence is always detrimental, especially when the price of carbon trading increases. Retailers tend to choose to work with manufacturers who are less overconfident, when the higher price of carbon trading results in higher gains for the retailer.</jats:p>"

An electronic questionnaire was used to collect primary data that was then analyzed using descriptive statistics such as percentage, means, and standard deviation to draw insightful findings. To test the relationship and magnitude of relation between the variables, inferential statistics including correlation was used. The study realized that stakeholder capacity building is important at p=0.000 determined at 0.01 significance level. Of note was that capacity building correlated with project performance at 0.711. The study, therefore, recommended that NASCOP management should prioritize strengthening the capacity of the pharmacy stakeholders in the ART facilities countrywide. In particular, they should provide regular training on DHIS2, strengthen ARV records/ documentation and inventory management, and can conduct periodic supervision initiatives to track and assess the progress of ARV management in the pharmacies and stores across Kenya.</jats:p>"

In response to the current dilemma of the supply-side output of physical education in Chinese universities, it calls for a balance between the demand and supply for higher physical education. In terms of exploring factors that contribute to a high-quality education system from the perspective of supply-side structural reform, the supplier, the content, the mode, and the conditions of the supply side is supposed to be optimized by improving the teaching abilities of the leading suppliers, optimizing the output of the supply content, facilitating a collaborative supply model, and expanding the online supply field. Accordingly, the coordinated and unified development of the supply and demand of physical education for college students can be promoted, to enhance the quality of physical education in Chinese universities.</jats:p>"

However, tomato production in smallholders is based on the principles of the free market economy and is operating at high risk. The paper aims to assess and reduce the level of risks associated with infrastructure, financial, natural and environmental, farm management and political changes among entities in the smallholder tomato supply chain. Uncertainties related to producer, buyer, infrastructure, finance, natural and environmental, management and political changes are taken into account in the assessment of risk levels. These threats were assessed using Fuzzy Linguistic Quantifier Order Weighted Aggregation (FLQOWA) model. The obtained results showed that the level of risk arising in production, cooperation, infrastructure and financial issues was high. At the same time, measures to reduce risk levels were taken in the study. According to the results, application “written contract” and “insurance” to collaborative relationships to reduce risk levels has been shown to reduce risks until 0.6 coefficients. The results obtained from this investigation will have a positive effect if policy makers use the applications to increase the economic cooperation between the subjects in STSC.</jats:p>"

These man-made activities are the primary sources of nitrate contamination in water resources. Nitrate contamination of water is a global issue that has been increasing over time. According to previous research, exposure to nitrate in water above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline limit (50 mg of NO3/L) has been found to induce major health effects such as methemoglobinemia in humans, with the severity depending on the amount consumed. This problem has become a major threat to humans and the environment. Thus, this article presented an overview of nitrate contamination of water resources in Ethiopia, emphasizing anthropogenic activities to indicate the current nitrate water contamination status for the necessary remedial actions.</jats:p>",

However, the current regulations are in large parts still tailored to traditional mechanical water meters. Electronic meters have already been included in the common standards, but reviews and various adaptions are still missing. An important point to be reviewed is the impact of the sampling interval of the electronic water meters on the measurement accuracy of the captured water volume. In this study, the error caused by the sampling interval is investigated by using measured data sets and stochastic water consumption data. It is shown that the error caused by sampling depends on the starting point of the sampling and the observation period. The studies show that for a billing period of one year, which is common in Germany, the sampling interval should be 14 s or less to always ensure a sampling-related error of less than 0.5%. Based on the results, input for further regulations is derived.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We study the management of social responsibility in a three-tier supply chain with a tier 2 supplier selling to a tier 1 supplier, in turn selling to a tier 0 buyer. The tier 2 supplier may violate social and environmental standards, resulting in harm to all firms in the supply chain; we analyze the equilibrium allocation of costly effort by each firm to improve responsibility in tier 2. We also examine how pressure from external stakeholders (consumers, nongovernmental organizations, and governments) influences the optimal level of responsibility. Academic/practical relevance: Recently, there have been numerous serious responsibility violations in tiers 2+ of multinational supply chains, leading to significant negative consequences for firms and society; understanding how best to manage such violations is of practical importance to multiple stakeholders. Methodology: We employ a game theoretic model wherein each firm in the supply chain optimizes its responsibility efforts to maximize its own profit and study the implications of this decentralized optimization for the overall supply chain. Results: Under the conditions of our model, the buyer’s optimal strategy is one of extremes, consisting of direct control (only tier 0 works with tier 2), delegation (only tier 1 works with tier 2), or no effort (neither firm works with tier 2); we determine when each is optimal and discuss key drivers of the optimality of these extreme strategies. We further find that increasing some types of external pressure can backfire, leading to a lower level of responsibility. Managerial implications: For firms using multitier supply chains, we show how to manage risk by choosing between different responsibility management strategies. For external stakeholders seeking to encourage responsibility, we provide insights on how to achieve this while avoiding “backfiring.” For researchers, we provide a modeling framework to study responsibility and risk management problems in multitier supply chains. </jats:p><jats:p> History: This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Section on Responsible Research in Operations Management. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The online supplement is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2021.1063 . </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Decades of feminist research has revealed the dismal labor conditions for women in global supply chains. Given this reality, why does Walmart use women in its supply chain as icons of female empowerment? Combining the Marxist notion of a “spatial fix” with a feminist analysis of symbolic resources, we develop the concept of a “gender fix” to understand a growing field of corporate programs that use women as symbolic resources to restore the image of firms as ethical actors. The gender fix encompasses a wide range of corporate empowerment strategies to capture a broad pattern of action. A second term is necessary to situate Walmart’s particular empowerment strategy within its corporate positioning as leader of a vast supply chain network. We identify Walmart’s particular empowerment strategy as “outsourcing feminism.” Walmart’s use of the outsourcing feminism strategy stems from its commanding position in supply chains, which allows it to extract a symbolic surplus from women business owners from whom it sources products. When Walmart argues that it uplifts these women, its strategy targets the consumer end of the supply chain, emphasizing sourcing practices that promote a racially diverse, selfless, and middle-class femininity. In so doing, Walmart deflects attention from the treatment of women in other segments of its supply chain (e.g., its stores and factories). </jats:p>",

The considered supply chain consists of one main manufacturing center, multiple production units (i.e., suppliers), and multiple heterogeneous vehicles as the transportation fleet. To schedule this complex supply chain network in an energy‐efficient way, several decisions should be made concerning the assignment of orders to suppliers and determining their production sequence, splitting orders, assigning orders to vehicles, and assigning delivery priority to orders. To cope with the problem, a mixed‐integer linear programming model is presented. Due to the complexity of the problem, a novel development of the genetic algorithm named the Multiple Reference Group Genetic Algorithm (MRGGA) is also proposed. Four objectives are considered to be optimized to meet both suitability and energy‐efficiency aspects in the supply chain network. These optimization objectives are to minimize the total orders' delivery times to the manufacturing center, fuel consumption by the vehicles, energy consumption at supplies, and maximize orders' quality. To analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, a real case and a set of generated instances are solved. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with an existing genetic algorithm in the literature. Moreover, the results are also compared with the optimal solutions obtained from the mathematical model for small‐size problems. The results of the comparisons show the efficiency of the proposed MRGGA in finding energy‐efficient solutions for the considered supply chain network.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Advertising and service investment can enhance brand goodwill to increase the sales of branded goods. However, the impact of advertising and services on brand goodwill is not immediate but delayed. At the same time, due to the different service characteristics provided by various channels, the phenomenon of bidirectional free-riding occurs. Therefore, this paper studies the dynamic cooperation between service and advertising in the O2O (online to offline) supply chain dominated by brand owners and explores the impacts of advertising, service delay and service free-riding among channels on the dynamic cooperation decisions of the O2O supply chain. A differential game model between brands and retailers is constructed by incorporating the delay effect and the bidirectional free-riding phenomenon. The optimal advertising and service strategies and performance problems of O2O supply chain enterprises under a centralized decision, brand cost-sharing decision and bilateral cost-sharing decision are compared and analyzed. The influence of delay time, showrooming and webrooming effects on the profit of each firm is investigated by example. The results show that the service strategy, advertising strategy and brand goodwill of the O2O supply chain members are optimal under a centralized decision. Still, the supply chain profit is not necessarily optimal under the delay time, showrooming and webrooming effect coefficients. Bilateral cost-sharing contracts can achieve Pareto improvement of supply chain performance. Appropriate setting of a bilateral cost-sharing ratio can adjust the adverse effects of delay and bidirectional free-riding. The long-term strategies to deal with the delay and bidirectional free-riding phenomena are as follows: the bilateral cost-sharing contract can improve corporate profits. Setting the wholesale price, online direct-selling price and service-sharing ratio by brand owners can effectively promote retailers’ investment in service, achieving a win-win situation. Retailers maintain high pricing and service levels to enhance the brand premium ability of physical stores and achieve long-term development.</jats:p>"

The separation of cations and anions is carried out by inserting a desalination cell in the middle of a novel design of photoelectrocatalytic desalination cell (PEDC). Different parameters were evaluated and optimized for increasing the capability of system to desalt hypersaline water. Ultraviolet illumination (UV) was used as the driving force, exciting coated titanium nanotubes on the anode electrode, producing electron/hole pairs that degraded organic matter. Methylene blue degradation by UV irradiation was performed, owing to a high salt concentration level, and desalinated to produce electrical current. Performance of PEDCs was investigated by salt content, pH, and ion-exchange resin. The results indicated that higher total dissolved solid (TDS) removal occurred in acidic environments in anode chamber whereas the maximum produced electrical current occurred in alkaline environments in the cathode chamber. Also, the higher amount of salt content in the middle chamber resulted in the high TDS removal until the amount of electrical conductivity in the middle chamber reached 190 mS/cm. The TDS removal rates with and without using resins in the middle of the desalination cell after 10 days were 70.69% and 51.37%, respectively.</jats:p>",

Zn fertilization is usually recommended in field orchards, and application strategies toward nutrient use efficiency are key for successful crop management.\nMethods\n Field studies were carried out with sweet orange trees for four growing seasons, testing Zn (nitrate, sulfate or EDTA) applied either via fertigation or foliar spray compared to a control without Zn.\nResults\n The Zn concentrations in the soil increased with nutrient supply by both application methods. Zn-EDTA via fertigation increased soil nutrient availability compared to the control. Likewise, Zn-nitrate via foliar application also increased soil Zn levels. Regarding the plant, Zn-EDTA via fertigation increased leaf nutrient levels only after the third year of fertilization, whereas Zn-nitrate via foliar spray increased leaf levels in the short term, up to 120 mg kg<jats:sup>− 1</jats:sup>. To a lesser extent, Zn-EDTA or sulfate also increased leaf Zn compared to the control. Accumulated fruit yield was ~ 20% higher in trees with Zn-EDTA via fertigation and ~ 20% higher in trees with Zn-nitrate or sulfate via foliar application compared to the control, with these latter exerting greater responses.

Here we combined remote sensing and numerical modelling to resolve supraglacial debris thickness by altitude for 4689 glaciers in High-Mountain Asia, and debris-supply rate to 4141 of those glaciers. Our results reveal extensively thin supraglacial debris and high spatial variability in both debris thickness and supply rate. Debris-supply rate increases with the temperature and slope of debris-supply slopes regionally, and debris thickness increases as ice flow decreases locally. Our centennial-scale estimates of debris-supply rate are typically an order of magnitude or more lower than millennial-scale estimates of headwall-erosion rate from Beryllium-10 cosmogenic nuclides, potentially reflecting episodic debris supply to the region’s glaciers.</jats:p>"

An energy cost indicator has been figured out applying a new quantitative approximation. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been applied to optimize the energy costs of groundwater treatment. Energy costs assessment of groundwater treatment has been carried out with regards to nitrate (NO3−), fluoride (F−), boron (B), iron (Fe (II)) and lead (Pb) removal for March (before irrigation) and October (post irrigation) related to 10 observation points in an arid and semi-arid area. When lead removal leads to the highest energy costs in the plant, nitrate removal has the lowest energy costs. The total energy costs would be reduced averagely at 44.5 and 52.5% in March and October, respectively when biochar adsorption was applied in the plant. According to the DEA model, the optimum energy consumption belongs to biochar adsorption in terms of fluorite removal with the value of 434.95 kWh/d. According to DEA analysis, NO3− is a low energy-intensive parameter and Pb is a high energy-intensive parameter. The results of the DEA model have been overlapping with the energy cost indicator.</jats:p>",

Water applications for process and utility end-users in the manufacturing context require pre- and post-treatment – these are interconnected assets that increase the cost of water, and introduce system inefficiencies, thus, they represent a challenge faced by companies and energy/utility managers. A meta-analysis approach was used to examine data from several independent studies of water management, in order to determine overall trends. The sources utilized during the study were water-related scientific publications, Master theses, books, companies, and standards’ websites. The results of the study highlight that auditing can be used to investigate water flows within productive processes entirely, as well as within individual process units and operations. The present study incorporates water-related thinking about supply and demand costs, opportunities, and strategies, promoting energy systems thinking and providing an internationally replicable solution to calculate the true cost of water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The subject of this study is the cyber vulnerability of wind generators, as part of the cyberphysical system of intelligent power supply networks, Smart Grid. Wind generators produce electricity for further distribution in the network between «smart» electricity consumers, which often include autonomous power systems in medical institutions, autonomous power supply of homes, charging stations for cars, etc. Wind generators operate in two aspects: in the physical and information space. Thus, a violation of the security of the information flow of a wind generator can affect the physical performance of electricity generation, and disable equipment. The study aims to identify types of cyber threats in the wind generator network based on the analysis of known attack incidents, analysis of the Smart Grid network structure, network devices, protocols, and control mechanisms of a wind generator. The tasks of the work are: review and analyze known cyberattack incidents; review the classification of cyber threats to wind farms; consider the most common methods of attacks on the cyberphysical system of wind farms; consider ways of intrusions into the information flow of the cyberphysical system wind generator; consider resilience mechanisms of wind generators in case of a cyberattack, consider the directions of further research. The methods are a systematic approach that provides a comprehensive study of the problem, quantitative and qualitative analysis of incidents of cyber attacks on wind generators, and methods of attacks. The following results were obtained: 11 large-scale known incidents of cyber attacks on the cyberphysical systems of the energy sector and smart power supply networks were analyzed, and information flow features and structure of the wind generators were considered. Main communication interfaces of the Smart Grid network were reviewed, control mechanisms for the physical parts of the wind generator system such as automatic voltage regulator, and automatic generation control were observed, vulnerable data transmission protocols, DNP3 in particular, were analyzed, possible consequences in the case of a cyber-intrusion into the network were considered. Conclusions: wind farms, as part of the Smart Grid system, are a convenient target for cyberattacks, as the number of potential ways to interfere with the information flow of the cyberphysical system is growing due to an increase in the number of sensors, communication channels in the network. This is especially important for the further development of wind farm security systems, which at the time, are not able to provide high accuracy of intrusion detection into the information flow.</jats:p>"

I argue that there is nowhere ‘outside’ of the economy where skills are produced. Rather, a society and an economy need to be seen as an organism, where skill formation is a complex set of moving parts. The concept of supply and demand is unhelpful to think about skill formation because it directs our attention towards specific moving parts in isolation from the broader factors that shape them. This explains why, despite the existence of extensive tools and institutions for skills anticipation, and numerous institutions for social dialogue and stakeholder engagement, researchers and policy-makers argue that South Africa has an inadequate supply of the skills that are needed in the workplace and concomitant skills mismatches. The article also presents more specific problems with the rules and tools, particularly in the way the systems and institutions for understanding labour market demand interact with the systems and tools for the supply of skills – especially those tools that govern and shape skills provision. It argues further that, whereas there are real problems with these rules and tools, and while they can certainly be improved, the broad goals that they are intended to achieve will not be attained even with better tools, but that different conceptual lenses are required instead.</jats:p>"

To discover the frequent topics discussed in the literature, bibliometric analysis (i.e., keyword co-occurrence network) and text mining tools (i.e., N-gram analysis and topic modeling) are employed for the whole corpus and the top-three contributing journals (i.e., Sustainability, International Journal of Logistics Management, Operations Management Research). Moreover, text analytics (i.e., Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency: TF-IDF) is utilized to discover the distinctive topics in the corpus and per journals. A total of 574 papers published up to the first semester of 2022 were collected from the Scopus database to determine the research trends and opportunities. The keyword network identified four clusters considering the implementation of digitalization to achieve resilience and sustainability, the usage of additive manufacturing during the pandemic, the study of food supply chains, and the development of supply chain decision models to tackle the pandemic. Moreover, the segmented keyword network analysis and topic modeling were performed for the top three contributors. Although both analyses draw the research concentrations per journal, the keyword network tends to provide a more general scope, while the topic modeling gives more specific topics. Furthermore, TF-IDF scores unveiled topics rarely studied, such as the implications of the pandemic on plasma supply chains, cattle supply chains, and reshoring decisions, to mention a few. Additionally, it was observed how the different methodologies implemented allowed to complement the information provided by each method. Based on the findings, future research avenues are discussed. Therefore, this research will help supply chain practitioners and researchers to identify supply chain advancements, gaps in the literature and future research streams.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As real-time indoor thermal data became available, the precision of the building thermal control systems has improved, but the use of resources has also increased. Therefore, it is imperative to examine the optimized point of energy use and thermal dissatisfaction for their efficient control. The aim of this research is to find an energy-efficient thermal control strategy to suppress the increase in thermal dissatisfaction. An adaptive control model utilizing the artificial neural network and the adjustment process of initial settings is proposed to examine its performance in controlling thermal supply air in terms of indoor thermal dissatisfaction and energy use. For a clear comparison, the standard deviation of each thermal dissatisfaction value and the weekly heating energy transfer are used. The proposed model successfully performs in reducing the indoor thermal dissatisfaction level and energy use. In comparison with two deterministic models, the performance is improved in terms of the constancy of suppressing thermal dissatisfaction levels by 72.1% and the improvement in energy efficiency by 18.8%, respectively. The significance of this study Is that it is possible to improve control precision by adding only a few modules without replacing the entire existing system, and that the model’s sustainability is increased by reducing the possibility of hardware and software retrofitting in the future.</jats:p>"

First, the agricultural super business model under the blockchain + Internet of Things (IoT) is analysed, and the farm management system of the IoT + blockchain is constructed. Then, the demand forecasting model of agricultural products is established. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are used to predict demand. Finally, the characteristics of the two models in prediction are discussed. The results show that the ARIMA model can reach 99.2% in the application efficiency evaluation of farm operation. Moreover, in the case of proper selection of model indicators, the prediction result is close to the actual value, the prediction error fluctuation is small, and the maximum error value is 0.4318. The local error of SVM model in predicting the demand of farm supply chain is slightly larger, and the maximum error value is 8.5430. By comparing the error results of the two models, the prediction accuracy of ARIMA model is higher than that of SVM model. The ARIMA model designed in this work can provide effective product demand prediction for farm operation and provide a strong technical reference for farm operation. The research not only provides technical support for machine learning and blockchain technology to predict farm supply and demand, but also contributes to the integrated management and sustainable development of enterprises.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, the composition and structure of the production industry's supply chain is becoming increasingly complex. The loss and untimely transmission of supply chain information exacerbated the bullwhip effect. At the same time, due to the lack of a reliable repository of information, difficulties in traceability and accountability have also made supply chain management difficult. Blockchain has the characteristics of supporting distributed networks, synchronization of information between nodes, digital encryption, traceable information and unforgeable block content, which is suitable for use in supply chain and can provide a solution for it. In this paper, a design scheme of an integrated platform for information services provided by supply chain participants and based on the Ethereum blockchain is proposed. Using Ethereum smart contracts, the regular trade involved in the supply chain is realized using blockchain technology, and key information about the production and circulation of the supply chain is stored on the blockchain to ensure that the information cannot be falsified. At the same time, a reputation evaluation method based on smart contracts is used to evaluate the reputation of enterprises in the supply chain, which can provide references for supplier selection among enterprises.</jats:p>"

Qualitative data was gathered from the six zones of the country examining the most popular logistics system, reasons for its popularity, its strengths and weaknesses, and opportunities for scaling up. For the first time ever, this paper defined indigenous logistics systems and supply chain management. The &amp;ldquo;waybill&amp;rdquo; system or sending goods through registered vehicles at motor parks is the choice of the majority of the citizens. The system is consistent with the cultural norms and habits of the people, prioritizes the use of local knowledge and resources in an integrated manner, offers competitive advantage to practitioners, and is sustainable.

The results of this paper show that the higher the concentration of the upstream supply chain of listed companies, the lower their green innovation performance, and the negative effect has always existed and decreased. The further discussion found that the highly concentrated upstream supply chain reduces the input of enterprises' innovation activities and innovation strategy decisions, and thus inhibits green innovation.

The effect of an intact mycorrhizal symbiosis with access to stable isotope organo-34S enriched soils encased in 35 µm mesh cores was tested in microcosms with Agrostis stolonifera and Plantago lanceolata. Hyphae and associated soil were sampled from static mesh cores with mycorrhizal ingrowth and rotating mesh cores that exclude mycorrhizal ingrowth as well as corresponding rhizosphere soil, while plant shoots were analysed for 34S uptake. Static cores increased uptake of 34S at early stages of plant growth when sulfur demand appeared to be high and harboured significantly larger populations of sulfonate mobilising bacteria. Bacterial and fungal communities were significantly different in the hyphospheres of static cores when compared to rotating cores, not associated with plant hosts. Shifts in bacterial and fungal communities occurred not only in rotated cores but also in the rhizosphere. Arylsulfatase activity was significantly higher in the rhizosphere when cores stayed static, while atsA and asfA gene diversity was distinct in the microcosms with static and rotating cores. This study demonstrated that AM symbioses can promote organo-S mobilization and plant uptake through interactions with hyphospheric bacteria, enabling AM fungal ingrowth into static cores creating a positive feedback-loop, detectable in the microbial rhizosphere communities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decade, digital marketing and technology have gradually penetrated the food and beverage industry, redefining its marketing mix. However, the urgency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic spurred the digital transformation of the industry, as businesses were forced to adapt to many changes and restrictions, reshape their operational models, and find ways to survive in an unstable marketplace. The purpose of this paper is to examine the transformation of the marketing mix in the food and beverage service supply chain due to the emergence of digital marketing. To this end, critical success factors for the digital transformation of the food and beverage service supply chain were identified based on the literature. These factors were assessed by experts from the Greek market using a grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach because of the complexity and interdependence of the factors interfering in the decision-making process. After a screening process, eight experts were selected to participate based on their experience and their acknowledged presence in the sector. DEMATEL is a multi-criterion decision-making method used to assist in addressing practical assessment issues. Its main advantage is that it can detect and observe the interdependence among the primary components and their relevance in the decision-making process. Additionally, it facilitates the visual display of the results, assisting in the analysis of the causal influence of factors. The combination of DEMATEL with grey system theory is useful because it makes it easier to analyze ambiguities brought on by uncertainties, lack of knowledge, or inadequate human actions. Fourteen critical success factors were identified, and they were grouped into three broad categories: technology-driven, consumer-driven, and industry-driven. Seven factors were classified as causes, and seven factors were classified as effects. In addition, with the use of the DEMATEL approach, the factors were grouped into core, driving, independent, and prominent factors.</jats:p>"

This paper seeks to establish the influence of early supplier involvement on the supply chain performance of food and beverage processing companies in Kenya. Food and beverage processing companies have been at the stake of declined performance which has mainly been among other reasons as result of continued poor customer satisfaction and increased operational costs. This paper therefore seeks to assess the role played by early supplier involvement in the supply chain performance of these firms. A descriptive survey research approach was used in this study where the target population was 187 food and beverage processing companies in Kenya. A purposive sampling was used to ample 153 food and beverage processing companies in Nairobi. The heads of procurement in these companies were surveyed using a structured questionnaire. The collected data was analysed through descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS. The findings from the study revealed that the involvement of suppliers early in designing the products and sharing with the suppliers the right information on customer specifications early reduce lead time. The study concluded early supplier involvement, process automation had a positive and significant influence of supply chain performance of food and beverage processing companies hence these companies through the management should uphold early supply involvement through sharing information with the suppliers and consulting them when designing and seeking raw materials for the production of customers’ orders. The findings from this study would be significant to the supply chain practitioners, the manufacturing sector in Kenya, the policy makers and the academic and research fraternity.</jats:p>"

Researchers use one intangible measure, corporate social responsibility (CSR), to proxy for the firm’s relationship with its stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to advance research in two ways. First, we examine cash flow forecasts because they are less subjective than earnings forecasts. Second, we focus on a firm’s corporate social irresponsibility (CSIR) reputation formed through negative media coverage of environmental, social, and governance practices. Our paper posits that analysts are less likely to provide cash flow forecasts for a firm with a poor CSIR reputation. We conducted a study with 50,365 firm-year observations over twelve years. We support our hypothesis after controlling for endogeneity: The likelihood of analyst cash flow forecast issuance is associated negatively with firm negative media coverage. Additional analyses show that numerous firm and industry-related variables moderate this effect. This decrease in cash flow forecast issuance likelihood occurs, even if the poor CSIR reputation is from as long ago as three years prior or is due to environmental, social, or governance issues. Furthermore, increases in cash flow volatility and capital intensity positively moderate the likelihood of issuing a cash flow forecast, while increases in ROA and Tobin’s q negatively moderate the likelihood of issuing a cash flow.</jats:p>"

The changes in water quality alongside the pipes were investigated in lab scale through analyzations about the suspensions and sedimentations using effluents from both conventional and deep treatment (ultra-filtration) under different velocity. The morphology of the suspended particles in the effluents was characterized, and water quality indicators, including the turbidity and metal ions (i.e., Pb, Zn, Cu, and Fe) were measured. The results revealed that the correlation between turbidity and particle quantity increased proportionally with the turbidity, while the quantity of the particles decreased with the increasing of their size. The effluent quality from conventional treatment was significantly higher than the deep treatment concerning all the tested indicators, spontaneously with tiny, suspended particles less than 2 µm. The metal leakage of the pipes was related to the velocity and quality of water, as higher flowing velocity and more suspended particles finally resulted in higher metal resolution.</jats:p>"

As a result, effective supply chain management is essential for preserving profitability and market dominance in this industry. Increasing the effectiveness, responsiveness, and resilience of supply chain operations is one of the most important roles that optimization approaches in supply chain planning play in tackling these difficulties. Within the context of the consumer electronics industry, this study investigates a variety of optimization approaches that are used in supply chain planning. The primary emphasis of this investigation is on strategies that are utilized to manage inventory, simplify manufacturing processes, and enhance distribution networks.\r\nIn the first place, the research investigates several ways for optimizing inventory, such as sophisticated forecasting systems and inventory management models. It is crucial to have an accurate demand prediction in order to alleviate the problem of stockouts and excess inventory, both of which may result in lost sales and higher holding costs. Statistical forecasting, machine learning algorithms, and collaborative forecasting with suppliers are some of the techniques that are being evaluated to see how useful they are in terms of increasing inventory accuracy and lowering costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article considers a two-period closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) model, where a manufacturer and a retailer are trading one product. The retailer’s demand rate for each period is dependent on the selling price, product quality, and refund price. The first period’s product quality has an impact on the second period’s demand rate. In the first period, returned products are remanufactured and sold through the retailer with the new products in the second period. The manufacturer is the leader of the Stackelberg game who declares wholesale price(s) and quality of the product to the retailer who follows the manufacturer’s decision and sets his selling prices for two consecutive periods. The manufacturer implements two pricing policies: (I) sets the same wholesale price for both periods (II) sets different wholesale prices for two different periods. The present research’s main aim is to find the optimal strategies for lower pricing and high-quality products. Under these circumstances, four different decision strategies between the manufacturer and the retailer are developed and compared these strategies analytically and numerically. The effects of different decision strategies on the optimal supply chain results are developed with a numerical example. An optimal solution for all four strategies is obtained using Mathematica 9. In addition, graphical analyses are developed to determine under what circumstances a particular decision strategy is dominant over others. Numerical analysis suggests that fast-acting strategies produce dominant results, but adopting strategies with advanced notice can produce higher quality products.</jats:p>",

The constructed models show some interesting results. (1) Both the strategies (a) &amp; (b) drove the same recycling efforts. The remanufacturer maybe mistakenly believe its profits could increase with the lower procurement price in scenario (b). However, the profits were the same in both scenarios. (2) The strong consumer sensitivity to recycling efforts not only increases the retailer’s profits but also drops the remanufacturer’s profits. Therefore, strong consumer sensitivity is only good for some players. (3) The donation ratio should be within a reasonable range. Otherwise, the remanufacturer’s profit decreases, and even the remanufacturer withdraws from the supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates and systematizes planning problems along the supply chain of small and medium-sized companies in the horticultural market of ornamental plants, perennials, and cut flowers. The sector faces considerable challenges such as multiple planning uncertainties, product perishability, and considerable lead times. However, decisions in practice are often based on rules of thumb. Data-driven decision support is thus necessary to professionalize supply chain, logistics, and operations planning in the sector. We explore the practical planning problems with the help of expert interviews with people in charge of typical companies active in the market. We structure the planning problems along the supply chain according to their time horizon and highlight the critical elements of the planning tasks and horticultural specifics. We examine the status quo of research on decision support for these planning tasks with the help of a structured literature review, highlight research gaps, and outline promising future research directions. We find that the tactical planning domains of material/product requirement, production, and demand planning are especially critical in practice, and that there is a great need for research to develop practically relevant decision support systems. Such systems are currently available only to a limited extent in literature and are not fully compatible with requirements in the ornamental horticultural sector. By structuring and detailing the relevant decision problems, we contribute to an understanding of planning problems and decision-making in horticultural supply chains, and we provide a first comprehensive overview of planning problems, aligned literature, and research gaps for the horticultural business.</jats:p>"

The comparison of recipients’ and donor demographics, operative and graft characteristics, post-operative labs, Doppler ultrasound(USG) findings, and complications, along with 30-day mortality, and 1-year survival were reported for both groups.&#x0D;\nResults: The mean age of patients in the SA group was 42.80±7.510 and in the HA group was 43.73±8.171 years. The common indication of LDLT was viral hepatitis in both groups. The operative duration was longer in the SA group (597.50±41.3156 min) than in the HA group (530.75±66.502 min) with a significant p-value= 0.004. Similarly, blood loss was also more in the SA group (1635±226.139 ml) than in the HA group (1477.50±270.316 ml) (p-value= 0.096). The incidence of biliary and vascular complications, early allograft dysfunction, acute cellular rejection, 30-day mortality, and 1-year survival were comparable in both groups. Post-operatively splenectomy was not needed in any SA group recipients.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The SA is easily approachable, suitable, and safe for HAR in the difficult situation of hepatic arterial flow inadequacy during LDLT due to its appropriate length, and good blood flow.&#x0D;\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.39.1.6351&#x0D;\nHow to cite this: Ullah K, Dogar AW, Shams-ud-Din, Bilal H.

The automotive industry is one of the industries that contribute significantly to economic growth in Indonesia. With supply chain disruptions and vulnerabilities amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for supply chain resilience is echoing in the business world. It is essential to develop resilience capabilities promptly because supply chain vulnerabilities can cause severe financial loss for organizations. This research aims to group the variables of vulnerability and capability to perform processing more easily in prioritizing the appropriate vulnerabilities and capabilities. The factor analysis method is designed to group variables in many factors with almost the exact nature and characteristics, making it easier to simplify and analyze further. The results of the study found that the vulnerability variable has three factors, namely (i) financial vulnerability, (ii) operational vulnerability, and (iii) external vulnerability, then these three factors are divided into thirteen indicators. While the factors that are formed from the ability variable are five factors, namely (i) cooperation, (ii) anticipation, (iii) financial strength, (iv) capacity, and (v) flexibility, then the five factors are divided into thirteen indicators. Following the research objectives, grouping and simplifying these priority factors can become a reference for researchers or companies to manage supply chains that are more resilient amid disruptions due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic effectively and efficiently.</jats:p>"

This modular converter is able to produce flexible, high output voltage from low input voltage sources. The proposed converter is accordingly studied and analysed. To verify the operation of the given converter, it is simulated via the MATLAB‐based Simulink software, and an experimental prototype is subsequently implemented on a laboratory scale.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the global financial crisis of 2008, research on supply chain finance (SCF) based on supply chain management (SCM) has increased rapidly. The context of SCF development is continuously changing, which means that it cannot function in isolation and financial ecology must be taken into consideration. Previous research has shown that comprehensive SCF studies incorporating financial ecology are lacking; although it was mentioned, it was at a descriptive level with fragmented dimensions, limiting the broader understanding of SCF. Therefore, to address this research gap and reveal future study prospects, we conducted a systematic literature search, focusing on 132 selected papers published between 2002 and February 2022. The present study provides insights into the development stages of SCF, and the understanding of ‘Supply Chain’ and ‘Finance’ in the context of the financial ecosystem. This study reiterates the necessity of studying SCF from a financial ecology perspective and contributes to the SCF ecosystem understanding framework, bridging the theoretical inadequacies in investigating SCF.</jats:p>"

Although the scale of livestream shopping has demonstrated unprecedented growth globally, especially since the COVID-19 outbreak, livestreaming supply chains have also contributed significantly to carbon emissions. Currently, optimisation models for the low-carbon governance of livestreaming supply chains are relatively lacking. To address the issue of carbon emission reduction in livestreaming supply chains, this study paper proposes three low-carbon governance decision-making models based on environmental and operating costs to compare which governance model is optimal. The most suitable decision result for the policymaker and supply chain is both cost-effective and environmentally successful under the model considering carbon tax and carbon trade. The results show that 1) governance based only on carbon tax and collaborative operation will decrease the total cost of the livestreaming supply chain but increase the environmental cost. 2) Governance based only on carbon trading and collaborative operation will increase the total cost of the livestreaming supply chain, while the environmental cost will not change. 3) Under governance that combines carbon tax and carbon trading, collaborative operations can effectively reduce both the total cost and the environmental cost of livestreaming supply chains. Theoretically, our study enriches the research on the low-carbon governance of livestreaming supply chains. Moreover, the research results provide useful insights into the formulation of a low-carbon policy for livestreaming supply chains.</jats:p>"

The existing problem is that the law prohibits nickel ore exports, and the policy of industrial downstream causes delays in the process of nickel processing. The problems happen because Indonesia's nickel industry is still incapable of downstream. As a result, the nickel supply chain faces dynamic and complex events that can disrupt operational activities. At the same time, supply chains need to withstand and recover from disruptions quickly. Therefore, Supply Chain Resilience, which is the ability to survive, adapt, and recover from disruptions to meet customer needs, is needed. This study uses system dynamics to analyze complex and dynamic systems to provide more practical policy advice. The system dynamics model starts by building a conceptual model through a system diagram. Inside the model is a causal loop diagram, then proceeds with developing a quantitative stock flow diagram (SFD) model. Finally, this SFD model operated with several scenarios used as policy suggestions for the Indonesian government.</jats:p>"

The regional dynamism has made it increasingly difficult to meet the demand for water provision. The aim of this investigation was to allocate the water withdrawn from the Mexicali Valley and San Luis Río Colorado (SLRC) aquifers in a scenario of water scarcity among the various consumer sectors by municipality of the states of Baja California and Sonora, as well as to determine the price that would allow for a reduction in the amount of water taken from the aquifers. A spatial equilibrium model was formulated and validated, considering fixed supply and functions of demand. The 2019 results show that the total demand for water from municipalities in residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural and livestock sectors were 197.2, 21.7, 16.7, 758 and 5.7 hm3, with Tijuana standing out in the first three sectors, whereas Mexicali and SLRC were highlighted in the farming sector. Regarding the water price, the Tijuana, Tecate, and Ensenada municipalities pay a high tariff for its use, whereas Mexicali and SLRC pay the lowest tariffs. A 10 % reduction in water availability would be achieved if the price in the agricultural sector in Mexicali and SLRC increased by 20 and 22 %, respectively, over the base price. As the price rises, the demand in this sector for both municipalities would decrease by 2.6 %.</jats:p>"

Cashback websites have two commission formats: sharing and fixed. We first explore the online rebate strategy of the e‐tailer (under the two commission formats); and then study the e‐tailer's commission format selection strategy when offering rebates. Our analysis reveals that: (i) the product valuation and fraction of low‐end consumers play key roles in shaping the e‐tailer's online rebate and commission format selection strategies; (ii) the e‐tailer's rebates increase the wholesale price under sharing commission, but decrease it under fixed commission; (iii) the e‐tailer's rebates may be a trap for consumers because they may pay a higher retail price after rebates; (iv) under both commissions, the e‐tailer's rebates hurt the manufacturer, but could enhance supply chain performance; and (v) when offering rebates, low‐end consumers and the manufacturer are better off under sharing commission if its product valuation is sufficiently low, while high‐end consumers are better off under fixed commission. Additionally, the e‐tailer has a stronger incentive to provide rebates when the manufacturer acts as the leader; temporary rebate promotion may lead to a triple win situation for the manufacturer, e‐tailer, and consumers.</jats:p>",

In 9 of the 13 sectors considered, there is a negative and significant relationship between trade policies that limit foreign affiliate sales and cross‐border trade, indicating a complementary relationship between the two types of trade flows. This suggests that when services firms export, they rely on multiple modes of supply to deliver their products, considering factors such as the degree of service tradability over the internet, levels of customer interaction, and complexity of particular tasks.</jats:p>",

Although the giving of such subsidies to the new energy vehicle industry has been practiced for a long time, few studies consider how the subsidy policies affect social welfare and the manufacturers’ profits and eco-innovation levels in the presence of the technology gap and the spillover effect. This paper fills the gap in the literature by studying two competitive supply chains consisting of two manufacturers and two retailers. Under three different subsidy policies, we derive the equilibrium outcomes. We find that, as the technology gap increases, the eco-innovation level of the leader increases, whereas the eco-innovation level of the follower decreases. We further investigate the conditions under which subsidy policy is better from the perspective of eco-innovation levels, firms, and social welfare. Specifically, under the centralized setting, the social welfare is lower with the unit production subsidy than with the green technology investment subsidy when the technology gap is low.</jats:p>"

Fruit stored under ambient conditions had higher incidences decay, diseases and physiological disorders compared to samples stored in cold storage, with these incidences varying widely with pre-storage treatments applied on the fruit. The supply chain route significantly (p≤0.05) influenced the physicochemical and subjective quality of tomato fruit. Biocontrol treatment reduced mass loss of fruit and had comparable physicochemical and subjective attributes to chlorine treated fruit. Biocontrol treatment was also effective in maintaining fruit firmness and colour for the first eight days of storage. Biocontrol treated fruit had 7.9% and 7.7% lower mass loss compared to control and chlorine fruit treated fruit, respectively.  Although, biocontrol treatment showed promising prospects in controlling tomato spoilage and improving its shelf life, integrating it with other treatments should be further tested to improve its efficacy.</jats:p>"

The market for these native medicinal species has been growing due to their increasing popularity as a remedy for circulatory and blood problems; however, the supply and demand dynamics of this plant in the forest have not yet been documented. Through qualitative research methods, this study identifies the links and distribution of the wild yam supply chain in Cundinamarca and considers the implications for conservation and sustainability of the resource. Tuber collection was documented in forested areas in 14 municipalities in the Department of Cundinamarca. The tubers are destined for wholesale markets in Bogotá and are purchased by retailers from all over Cundinamarca, even those based in the municipalities from which the tubers were extracted. The collection, distribution, and consumption of <jats:italic>Dioscorea</jats:italic> species in Cundinamarca respond to growing demand and rely on extraction of the species directly from forest remnants within the Department; these could be at risk of overharvesting if management measures are not taken, or if participatory propagation programs that benefit harvesters and sellers are not implemented. This is the first study of the supply chain in an emerging new market for wild yams in Latin America. It highlights the dynamic, evolving nature of the medicinal plant trade from the local to the national scale, and beyond.</jats:p>",

The experiments were carried out with three different inflow Froude numbers (8.77, 9.56, and 10.87), three different distances of the LJF from the abruptly expanding channel (0 m, 0.25 m, and 0.5 m), and one and two LJF (i.e., the number of active orifices in the LJF system). According to the results, the distances of the LJF from the narrow channel and the number of LJF improve the hydraulic jump's stabilization and flow pattern enhancement in the tailwater channel. Additionally, the average sequent depth and the spatial jump length decreased by 14% and 20%, respectively, compared to no LJF. Also, using LJF increases relative energy dissipation by 12.45% on average.</jats:p>",

With the accelerated pace of China’s economic development, many farmers are relocating to cities. This change in farmers’ part-time employment may lead to a shortage of agricultural labor supply and can result in insufficient food production. Therefore, the government implemented grain subsidies to promote food production. This study investigates the impact of grain subsidies on the labor supply of farm households, using panel data from fixed observations in rural China. The results show that grain subsidies increase the agricultural labor time of incompletely divided part-time farmers, especially the time spent growing food. This increase is because the members of these households are more likely to be engaged in temporary-seasonal-nonfarm work, and they can switch between nonfarm and agricultural work more easily. Moreover, this study finds that as the total amount of subsidies received by farmers increases, the effect of per-unit subsidies becomes more pronounced. These findings may provide evidence of subsidy effects and present policy implications for ensuring adequate food supply and sustainable agricultural development in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study analyzes whether firms face a tradeoff in responding to pressures of shareholders versus stakeholders in their quest for supply chain management excellence. Are firms that are recognized and rewarded for their supply chain management practices less likely than other firms to have a strong record in community relations, product qualities, employee relations, environmental sustainability and diversity measures? To answer this question, the study utilizes event study, OLS regression and panel data analyses of firms receiving a Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 ranking and a comparative sample of these same firms in non-ranked years. The findings indicate that shareholders react positively to a Gartner ranking, suggesting that ranked firms receive significant incentives to pursue recognition. Additionally, positive stakeholder practices are significantly stronger for firms ranked versus those not ranked. These findings suggest that firms can successfully navigate the pressures congruent with both shareholder and stakeholder priorities through supply chain excellence. </jats:p>",

The aim of the study was to define the topographic anatomy and arterial supply of the cingulate gyrus located on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere.\n<jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold>We studied thirty-six hemispheres, each hemisected in the midsagittal plane. The vertical thickness of the cingulate gyrus was measured at the anterior commissure (AC), posterior commissure (PC), and genu levels of the corpus callosum. The branches of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries supplying each zone were noted separately. The arterial pathways were transformed to digital data in AutoCAD to identify the condensation and reduction areas.\n<jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold>The mean AC-PC distance was 27.17±1.63 mm. The thinnest region was the genu level of the corpus callosum (10.29 mm). The superior internal parietal artery (SIPA), inferior internal parietal artery (IIPA) and pericallosal artery (PrCA) supplied all zones of the cingulate gyrus. The anterior zone received the greatest supply. The arterial condensation and reduction areas on both sides of cingulate gyrus and its x, y, and z coordinates specified.\n<jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold>The target cingulotomy (TC) area was determined for anterior cingulotomy. The properties of the TC area are that the thinnest region of the cingulate gyrus is supplied relatively less than other areas and is close to the anterior cingulotomy areas in the literature. The arterial reduction area (ARA) was found to be suitable for corpus callosotomy in terms of avoiding haemorrhage.</jats:p>"

The supply chain in many Indian MSMEs has been seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing forth the need to identify avenues that can mitigate the disruptions. This study conducts a two-stage qualitative interview and a structured interview with MSME owners. Domain experts are associated with the automotive, aerospace and design services industries. Based on their responses, we have identified seven major critical enablers specific in the context of Indian MSMEs. To model the interconnection among these factors, we have used the ISM (Interpretive Structural Modelling) approach. Results suggest that ‘top management support’ is the most crucial enabler in the hierarchy. Further, we find that if the supply chain is designed efficiently with redundancy in mind and the culture of the MSME remains conducive, advanced forms of ‘multi-sourcing’ and differentiated logistics can be explored to mitigate supply chain disruption. </jats:p>",

The idea that quality is life has long been deeply rooted in every enterprise. Based on the aforementioned reality, this paper first constructs a demand function affected by product quality, service quality, reference effect and quality competition, and studies the optimal product quality and service quality under centralized decision-making and decentralized decision-making. By comparing the decision values and profit difference between centralized decision making and decentralized decision making, a bilateral cost sharing contract is proposed, and its application scope is discussed. The major findings entail that the centralized decision-making mode of supply chain will be more conducive to improving service quality. However, it is not necessarily conducive to improving product quality, which depends on the marginal profits of competitors, since supply chain decision-makers are more willing to invest resources in products with high marginal profits, thereby improving product quality. The increase of reference effect is conducive to improving the quality of products and services, but it may also lead to higher production costs in the case of centralized decision-making. Therefore, when the reference effect is high, supply chain enterprises should adopt decentralized decision-making mode. Excessive competition is not conducive to improving the profits and increases internal friction among enterprises. Therefore, when the competition is fierce, enterprise alliance is a better choice. Finally, the bilateral cost sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain, that is to say, the system profit is equal to the profit of centralized decision-making. However, only when the supplier’s share rate meets certain conditions can the bilateral cost sharing contract achieve Pareto optimization, that is to say, when it is greater than the profit of the enterprise under decentralized decision-making.</jats:p>"

Machine learning to estimate past wastewater influent flow rates supporting public health applications has not been studied. The aim of this study was to assess wastewater treatment plant influent flow rates when compared with weather data and to retrospectively estimate flow rates in Louisville, Kentucky (USA), based on other data-types using machine learning. A random forest model was trained using a range of variables, such as feces-related indicators, weather data that could be associated with dilution in sewage systems, and area demographics. The developed algorithm successfully estimated the flow rate with an accuracy of 91.7%, although it did not perform as well with short-term (one-day) high flow rates. This study suggests that using variables such as precipitation (mm/day) and population size are more important for wastewater flow estimation. The fecal indicator concentration (cross-assembly phage and pepper mild mottle virus) was less important. Our study challenges currently accepted opinions by showing the important public health potential application of artificial intelligence in wastewater treatment plant flow rate estimation for wastewater-based epidemiological applications.</jats:p>",

However, in Kenya, only 60% of the urban population use safely managed drinking water. This low accessibility of potable water can be linked to socioeconomic disparities among urban dwellers. This article examines how household socioeconomic factors influence water delivery satisfaction in Kisumu city, Kenya. The article is based on a descriptive research design where 384 households were surveyed and ordinal regression was used in data analysis. Water delivery in Kisumu city is characterized by duality where the formal city is supplied by conventional delivery, while the informal settlements are through a pro-poor model. The results of ordinal logistic regression show that significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.01) water affordability is determined by household income (β = 2.10 ∗ 10−5), water accessibility is determined by tenancy (β = 0.483) and household income (β = 2.90 ∗ 10−5), while water reliability is influenced by household income (β = 1.35 ∗ 10−5). Water quality is significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) influenced by the level of education (β = 0.260). Gender does not have significant influence on water delivery satisfaction, but the socioeconomic variables are significant predictors of water service delivery in Kisumu city. Therefore, socioeconomic factors should be considered by water utility agencies during water service delivery in the city.</jats:p>",

The present study has been carried out to examine the suitability of Kusheshwar-Asthan wetland's water for agriculture. A total of 57 water samples were analyzed for various water quality parameters like electrical conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+), and major anions (PO43–, SO42−, N-NO3−, Cl−, HCO3−). Overall, the water of the wetland was found to be alkaline. The pre-monsoon samples had a relatively higher concentration in most of analyzed parameters except for pH, DO, NO3−, PO43− and Cl−. The concentration of cations follows the order of Na+ &amp;gt; Ca2+ &amp;gt; Mg2+ &amp;gt; K+ in both seasons and for anions it is HCO3− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; NO3− &amp;gt; PO43− for pre-monsoon and HCO3− &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; NO3− &amp;gt; PO43− for post-monsoon. According to Piper diagram and Durov plot, Na-K-HCO3 was the major hydro chemical facies of the surface water. The various irrigation quality parameters showed that wetland water can be categorized as good to excellent quality. As a result, this finding can aid in the long-term sustainable use of the wetland water with regulated anthropogenic interventions. The study will be beneficial in designing long-term extensive management plans for the conservation of the wetland.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about companies' social responsibility (SR) practices. As a result, they are increasingly skeptical when companies do not provide clear information about these practices. One way to overcome this skepticism is to strengthen consumer trust through improved supply chain transparency. To create transparency requires a company to both gain visibility into its supply chain and disclose information to consumers. However, the current SR literature has only focused on the effect of disclosure on consumer trust, while the effect of visibility on trust in SR communications is not well understood. Our work addresses this gap. In this paper, we employ an incentivized human‐subject laboratory experiment, an online vignette study, and causal mediation analysis to investigate the impact of visibility on consumer trust in a company's SR communication, and as a result, its impact on consumers' purchase decisions. To further enhance our understanding of consumer behavior, we examine how consumer heterogeneity and workers' conditions in the upstream supply chain influence our results. We find that increasing visibility always strengthens consumer trust. Also, opportunities exist for a trust‐driven revenue benefit (due to greater visibility) when consumers are highly prosocial or have low general trust beliefs, or when the impact of an SR initiative is small. Our results underscore the crucial role that supply chain visibility plays in engendering consumer trust. Moreover, identifying trust as a mechanism to help explain the effect of visibility on sales of SR products offers actionable insights to improve a company's communication strategies. </jats:p>",

However, it can lead to an electromagnetic compatibility problem in the electrical supply system. This problem becomes worse if a large number of fans are included in the technological installation and the electric drives are powered from a substation connected to a limited power source. As an example, in this article we investigate the power supply system of a gas cooling unit with variable-frequency electric drives for fans. The electric drives’ operating mode dependences characterizing the non-sinusoidal voltages and currents of the power source are obtained with the help of simulation modeling in the MATLAB environment with the Simulink expansion package. The typical substation circuit usage for the power supply of a group of fans with a frequency-controlled drive does not meet the requirements of IEEE Standard 519-2014. We can solve the problem of electromagnetic compatibility by changing the substation topology and organizing DC busbars and replacing frequency converters with inverters. We proposed forming DC busbars using 12-pulse rectifiers powered by transformers with two secondary windings with different connection schemes. The simulation results confirmed that the proposed substation topology provides the voltage and current harmonics level on the substation power busbars in accordance with the IEEE Standard 519-2014 requirements over the entire frequency range of the fans’ motor control.</jats:p>"

However, VEH (vibration energy harvester) based on PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric materials have a low output power and energy conversation efficiency due to the relatively low piezoelectric constant, coupling coefficient, and dielectric constant. For this reason, we design a vibration energy conversion power supply, which consists of a VEH with a PVDF piezoelectric thin film planar array vibration structure and an energy harvesting circuit for regulating the electric energy of multiple sources. Furthermore, our solution was validated by simulations of structural dynamics in COMSOL and equivalent circuits model in Multisim. From the circuitry simulation results, the output current and the charging period increase and decrease, doubling, respectively, for each doubling of the number of array groups of films. Moreover, the solid mechanics simulation results show that the planar array structure makes the phase and amplitude of the input vibration waves as consistent as possible so that the same theoretical enhancement effect of the circuitry model is achieved. An identical experimental test was implemented with vibration conditions of 75 Hz-2.198 g. The fabricated harvester quickly charged the 22 V-0.022 F ultracapacitor bank to 5 V in 24 min. The maximum open circuit voltage and output power, respectively, were 10.4 V and 0.304 mW. This maximum charging power was 11.69 times higher than that of a single film. This special power supply can replace batteries to power low-power electronics deployed in vibrating environments, thus reducing the maintenance costs of equipment and environmental pollution rates.</jats:p>"

Compared with other power management modules, it has the advantages of low power consumption, high power supply rejection, and strong anti-noise capability. However, the LDO power tube has a large width-to-length ratio, so when the load changes transiently, the gate of the power tube cannot respond in time, resulting in an overshoot and undershoot of the output voltage and a long recovery time. In this paper, the LDO transient enhancement circuit is designed. When the load changes transiently, the power tube gate capacitor is quickly charged and discharged, which overcomes the overshoot voltage and undershoot voltage. While improving the transient response of traditional LDO, the structure ensures the power supply rejection (PSR) and other performance of the circuit. According to the results, with an input of 2.5 V, the output voltage is regulated to 1.2 V, and PSR is -80 dB. When the load changes by 20 mA in 1 μs, it is stable within 1.2 μs while the undershoot voltage is controlled at 51 mV and the overshoot voltage is controlled at 65 mV.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Logistics and supply chain excellence has become increasingly important as a source of competitive differentiation. Firms' efforts to achieve supply chain excellence include developing supply chain ambidexterity, co‐opetition relationships, and analytical capabilities. This study draws on the co‐opetition theory to investigate the combined role of supply chain co‐opetition, ambidexterity, and analytical abilities in determining higher firm performance. Using field data from individuals occupying managerial positions in United Arab Emirates businesses (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 151), we applied structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy sets techniques to assess the research proposition. The SEM results suggest that (1) supply chain co‐opetition and analytical capabilities have significant effects on firm performance, but supply chain ambidexterity does not. Through fuzzy sets, we found that (2) supply chain co‐opetition, ambidexterity, and analytical capabilities are necessary causal conditions for high firm performance. We also discovered that (3) supply chain co‐opetition all by itself, and (4), supply chain ambidexterity and analytical capabilities are sufficient causal conditions for high firm performance. This study provides a novel comprehension of the benefits of supply chain co‐opetition and analytical capabilities during the COVID‐19 pandemic, offering several theoretical and managerial implications.</jats:p>",

The current study investigates the critical factors in JMF’s dairy supply chain, specifically the processing unit and offers an initial decision framework for its implications. Methods: To summarise the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of the milk processing system in JMF, the necessary data were collected from dairy producer members, including dairy farmers, executives and key informants of processing units. This includes identifying the dairy industry’s objectives as well as the internal and external critical factors (CFs). Because SWOT analysis provides no investigative basis for evaluating the priorities of CFs, the analytic hierarchy process is used to define the priorities of identified CFs. The CFs have also been sorted in the order of importance. Result: The findings of this study show that fully computerised system with self-automation facilities; high operational cost for processing liquid milk; development of new product and value addition; high labour cost or shortage of labour are the major strength, weakness, opportunity and threat of JMF, respectively. Further, the SWOT-based methodology provides critical sensitivity in assessing supply chain strategies for the dairy cooperative like JMF. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A mathematical model of a local autonomous power supply source based on a diesel generator set is presented. The source of primary mechanical energy is a diesel internal combustion engine with an automatic speed controller, operating on the Polzunov–Watt’s principle. The electric energy converter is an asynchronous motor operating in a generator mode with capacitor self-excitation. The complete set of such devices is carried out from the available and normally working components of technological, electrical and transport equipment. They are formed by the personnel of the relevant enterprises in the period preceding the accident, during its development or at the end of its active phase. Therefore, mathematical models of subsystems of a diesel engine, an asynchronous machine operating in a generator mode, capacitive self-excitation and a number of typical electricity consumers are represented by separate structural blocks with functional relationships and connected according to the principle of subordinate regulation. This form of representation makes it possible to carry out large-scale studies of the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the operation of diesel generator sets with various types of both internal combustion engines and asynchronous machines. The coincidence of the results of numerical simulation and full-scale experiments allows to judge the adequacy of the proposed mathematical model of a local autonomous power supply source with a diesel generator. The presented model combines algorithmic simplicity and high computational precision and will make it possible to determine the criteria for the trouble-free operation of autonomous power supply sources to provide energy to consumers of different categories</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study examines the supply chain for fresh fruits and vegetables in cities. In particular, the study determines the functions of intermediaries in the supply chain for fresh fruits and vegetables in urban settings. The study is qualitative with an ethnographic design. The study involved a sample of 92 participants obtained purposively. Data are obtained using In-Depth Interviews (IDIs), document reviews and researchers’ observations. Findings demonstrate that intermediaries typically facilitate transportation services that involve the collection, packing and handling facility selection, and delivery of fruits and vegetables. Secondly, intermediaries provide efficient storage services for storing fruits and vegetables and education about proper storage practices. Thirdly, intermediaries have involved value addition and improvement of the quality of fruits and vegetables through sorting, grading, gathering, inspection, branding, and packing. Fourthly, they execute marketing services and facilitate information flow and exchange. It is presented that to enhance intermediaries’ roles, there is a need to improve the road infrastructure networks and control corruption among unethical police officers. There is a great need to strengthen electricity. This will facilitate a reliable power supply that will enhance the easy storage of fruits and vegetables. Farmers and intermediaries need more education on quality, and financial assistance. This will support the continuum of the fresh fruits and vegetable supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Food security in a just energy transition is a growing debate about designing sustainable food secure networks worldwide. Energy transition, land-use change, and food security are crucial factors for food security and provision. The increased demand for food products and customer preferences regarding food safety provide various issues for the current agriculture food supply chain (AFSC). Along with rising sustainability concerns, strict government regulation, food security, and traceability concerns compel managers, business houses, and practitioners working in AFSC to adopt new tools, techniques, and methodologies to model current food supply chain problems. Thus, in turn, design the food logistics network for food security. Hence, this study investigates the core determinants of food security and supply in Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Lebanon over the period of 2010–2019. In order to estimate the objectives of the study, we employ the fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares estimators (DOLS) to draw the study findings. However, the estimated results show a negative association of land use with food security and supply. Likewise, energy transition, gross domestic product, and agricultural value added (AVA) contribute to the food security supply. In contrast, urbanization's negative but insignificant contribution to the food supply in selected economies exists. Besides, another core objective of the study is to investigate the moderate role of the energy transition on the gross domestic product, agriculture sector, and land use and find the significant contribution to the food supply. However, the current study also tries forecasting for the next 10 years and employs the impulse response function (IRF) and variance decomposition analysis (VDA). Congruently, this study uses the pairwise panel causality test and finds exciting outcomes. The COVID-19 crisis has posed challenges such as energy consumption and food security issues. On behalf of the results, the current study proposes imperative policies to investigate the desired level of food supply. The findings provide valuable insights for experts, policymakers, and officials to take practical measures for energy use and food security challenges.</jats:p>"

However, not so much is understood about the wider effects of sustainability practices on the ability of the SC to endure disruptions. The aim of this study was therefore to scrutinize the effect of sustainability practices on supply chain resilience in the development of a circular economy in Nigeria. This study was steered within the horizon of qualitative method with a philosophical research paradigm of constructivism. The study used twenty-one (21) Consumer Goods Firm in Nigeria as population and sample. Primary data was explored using key informant interview. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data collected. The study reveals that sustainability practices contribute to supply chain resilience in the development of a circular economy. The research concluded that, cradle to cradle practice, environmental sustainability, economic sustainability, and social sustainability play a major role in ensuring resiliency of consumer goods firms’ supply chains especially in developing a circular economy. The outcome of this research is expected to lead to the development of a circular economy in Nigeria. The study will be of significance to Nigerian government, consumer goods companies, practitioners, regulatory bodies, and researchers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research was carried out with the aim of increasing the intensity and pressure of fuel injection in direct-acting fuel supply systems of a diesel engine to improve the quality of its work and reduce consumption. To achieve it, on the basis of theoretical studies, the cam profile of the diesel fuel equipment was modernized using the sinusoidal law of plunger motion. The resulting analytical expression of the sinusoidal law of plunger displacement (from the condition of ensuring its shockless and continuous movement along the cam) makes it possible to calculate the cam profile, which provides an increase in the flow rate and high fuel injection pressure. Taking into account the boundary conditions (based on the overall dimensions of the existing 4UTNI pump) and the permissible level of load on the shaft bearing, the profile, speed and acceleration of the cam were calculated. The manufactured experimental pump with a calculated camshaft of a sinusoidal profile showed good results in comparative tests with the existing standard diesel high-pressure pump D-144. For the improved high-pressure fuel pump, the injection intensity and injection pressure in the nominal mode were 9% higher compared to the standard 4UTNI pump, at a low crankshaft speed, the pressure was 20% higher, and the flow rate was 35%. Increasing the injection rate and fuel injection pressure reduces the pusher lift time. At the same time, the cross-sectional uniformity of fuel supply at a shaft speed of n= 1000 min-1 increases by 1.1%, at n= 200 min-1 - by 18%.</jats:p>",

The relevance of the supply of TVET education must transform into labour market, which enables people, to renew old skills and develop new ones. The supply of TVET education has been increasing rapidly in relation to meagre resources. The enrollment has been doubling in every five years which is the fastest rate of increase in the world. This has been prompted by the economic growth in respective African countries which needs TVET education. The question is: what are the challenges facing this sector in terms of infrastructure, teachers, students and programmes? The study adopted a descriptive research survey paradigm and the theoretical perspectives are guided by the law of supply of education. The results of the study show that the supply of infrastructure, teachers, students and programmes is inadequate. For example, the adequacy of the training facilities has a mean of 3.175 and a standard deviation of 1.022 also the average score of the respondents’ views on the adequacy of teachers in the departments have a mean of 2.93 and a standard deviation of 1.334 while there is an upward trend in the supply of students. The main challenges were: Inability to pay college fees; Poor entry behavior; Market demand; Negative attitude; Inadequate training facilities; Inadequate teaching staff. The study concluded that the supply of science and technology education in Nyanza region of Kenya remains a serious challenge. The study recommended that all stakeholders should increase their participation in marketing the supply of TVET programs for the benefit of the local communities.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/-counters-/edu_01/0973/a.php\" alt=\"Hit counter\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Most of the previous studies on closed-loop supply chains are based on simple and single market conditions, which cannot analyze the real situation well. In this paper, two common behavioral preferences in the market, overconfidence and competitive preference, are incorporated into the study of closed-loop supply chains to investigate how the overconfidence of retailers and the competitive preference of manufacturers jointly affect the decisions and interests of both parties in closed-loop supply chains under different dominant models. It is concluded that in terms of pricing, while the wholesale price increases in the competitive preference, the reselling price in fact decreases when the retailer’s overconfidence level is of a middle level; in terms of recycling, the pursuit of high profits by monopolistic manufacturers is not conducive to recycling quantity in the secondary supply chain with recycling; in terms of profits, in a manufacturer-led model, the profits of all sides in the closed-loop supply chain, including the manufacturer itself, sometimes diminish as the manufacturer’s competitive preference behavior becomes more intense.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The adequate and reliable water supply in the developing towns of Ethiopia is becoming a challenge for most water utilities especially public service providers like Tebela town. The main objective of this research was to check the hydraulic performance of Tebela town's water distribution system by evaluating water demand and production, losses of water, and hydraulic parameters. Both secondary and primary data sources were used for this study. Primary data was collected through field surveys and photographs of relevant sites and infrastructures. The secondary data was collected from design documents, literature, journals, and office. Moreover, to analyse the existing water distribution system, a model was developed by using WaterGEMSv8i software. The model simulation run was performed for peak and low demand scenarios to analyze the distribution system. The analysis shows that the water supply coverage was 25.9%. The water loss of the town was 17.2% from the total water production. Modeling results showed violation of maximum and minimum pressure and velocity criteria at different junctions and pipes. After modifying the existing water distribution system, 96.23% of the junctions are in the recommended pressure range and 73.50% of the pipes are in the recommended velocity range at minimum hourly consumption. Generally the result of the analysis shows that the overall hydraulic performance of water distribution of the town was moderate, which is reflected by medium water production rate, water consumption, and nonrevenue water, also low water coverage, some velocity and pressure is not in permissible range. Therefore, it is important to rehabilitate and improve the water distribution system capacities, establish pressure zones, increase pumping rates, and drill additional boreholes to meet the current water demand and future demand. </jats:p>"

ERP implementations have a mix of critical success factors (CSFs) that are very important. Hence, it is essential to study the CSFs, their mutual influence and their severity in terms of prioritization for the I4.0. The goal of the current study is to identify CSFs for ERP implementations, as well as their interdependence and ranking. The CSFs of ERP deployment were discovered by a thorough analysis of the literature and subsequent input from a group of subject matter experts. Using the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method, the shortlisted CSFs were modeled, and after that, the matrice d’ impacts croises multiplication appliqué an classement (MICMAC) analysis was used to classify them. The interpretative ranking technique was used to carry out the subsequent prioritization and ranking (IRP). In the present research, the modeling of CSFs for successful ERP implementations was carried out to accomplish much-needed sustainability in the supply chain. The result revealed the three top-ranked CSFs for successful ERP implementations: “Top management support”, “Change management” and “Business process reengineering.” This research can help practicing managers prepare an ERP implementation plan to accomplish sustainability in SCM. Each CSF’s role can be studied in terms of the mutual relationships for its control. This research can also help in prioritizing strategies for optimizing the resources required for ERP implementations.</jats:p>"

To answer this pressing question, we coupled a simulation model for assessing security of electricity supply and an economic optimization model. With this, we were able to analyze different reduction scenarios of the amount of gas utilized in the power sector. Our results show that reducing the amount of natural gas in the European power sector by up to 30% has a relatively moderate impact on the security of electricity supply. Restrictions of 40% or more result in substantially higher reductions in electricity demand shortfall and are associated with economic costs of more than EUR 77 billion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a close coordination of gas distribution on a European level would be instrumental in mitigating negative economic consequences. Finally, it can be deduced that a coordinated delay of planned power plant shutdowns could effectively compensate for reduced gas volumes in the electricity sector.</jats:p>"

A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model was proposed for the joint operation of multiple regional IESs, and multi-energy sharing and multi-energy flow coupling of electricity, heat, and oxygen were considered. The probability distribution of the DRE output was described using 1− norm and ∞− norm constraints, and the minimum operating cost under adverse scenarios was determined through DRO. Furthermore, on the premise of ensuring cluster profit, a pricing mechanism of the energy supply within the cluster was proposed. Finally, a typical model involving eight cases was established and analyzed. The results revealed that multi-energy sharing and multi-energy flow coupling improved the economy of IES cluster operation and realized the coordination of robustness and economy. The energy supply price within the cluster enhanced enthusiasm on the demand side.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In modern orthopedic practice, some diseases do not cause pronounced functional disorders in the anatomical segments of the limbs but are accompanied by persistent pain syndrome. Among such diseases is lateral epicondylitis, or «tennis elbow». The superﬁ cial extensor muscles of the posterior group of the forearm begin in the region of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, in particular the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis. The deepening of knowledge about the typical and variant structure, topography, blood supply, and innervation of the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis in human fetuses will allow for improving the approach to carrying out existing fetal surgical techniques, as well as to creating foundation for the development of modern surgical approaches.The study aimed to determine the anatomical variability of the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis in human fetuses.The study was conducted on preparations of the upper limbs of 36 human fetuses aged 4-10 months using macromicroscopic preparation, vascular injection, and morphometry. The topographical and anatomical features of the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis in human fetuses are elucidated: variability and bilateral asymmetry of the external shape and size, variability of the places of origin and attachment, variants of blood supply and innervation, patterns of intramuscular distribution arteries and nerves in these muscles. It was found that the zone of the greatest concentration of intramuscular nerves and arteries is the upper and middle third of the bellies of the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis.Despite the good blood supply of the extensor carpi radial muscles, the relatively small size of their muscle bellies and the transverse course of the intramuscular nerves result in limited opportunities for cutting out muscle ﬂ aps from them. To cut the ﬂ aps on the leg from these muscles, the most rational cuts are in the ascending (transverse) direction, coinciding with the course of the main intramuscular nerves and arteries. Thus, it is possible to use the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis only for plastic ﬁ lling of the remaining bone cavities of the upper third of the posterior- lateral surface of the radius.The movement of the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis is also complicated by the fact that their tendons cross the abductor pollicis longus muscle, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, and create serious obstacles for the mobilization of these tendons.Knowledge of the classic and variant anatomy of the arteries of the upper limb, and in particular the described topographic and anatomical features of the right brachial radial artery in a 6-month-old fetus, will allow choosing the correct treatment tactics and avoiding iatrogenic injuries during manipulations, diagnostic and surgical interventions.</jats:p>"

For this reason, it is a promising solution to the problems faced by the renewable energy (RE) industry. One determining factor for achieving its practical implementation is the correct configuration of its supply chain. This study compares different hydrogen supply chain (HSC) configurations. RH2 production will be by water electrolysis using RE in the Colombian Caribbean region, then, converted into Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC), Cryogenic Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) or Compressed Hydrogen Gas (GH2), later, transported by trucks and delivered to meet the projected demand of the transportation sector. In the reference scenario, we found that the best alternative is to produce RH2 using an AEC-type electrolyser (alkaline electrolysis cells) powered by wind energy and convert it to GH2 at 350 bar for transportation and storage. Then, scenarios of demand, one-way distance and WACC were considered for projections between 2030 and 2050. The results showed that can be determined the one-way distance from which converting and transporting RH2 as LOHC is the best alternative and, also can be determined this limit for demand values, which allows us to identify the best configuration of the HSC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, poor access to improved water and sanitation remains a major contributing factor to high morbidity and mortality rates among the populace. Thus, access to water supply and sanitation is essential for sustainable development. In this study, a cross sectional descriptive survey method was adopted. Data were collected via questionnaires and observational checklist which were designed to extract information on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). The data were then, analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Version 26.0). Four hundred and twenty (420) semi-structured questionnaires were administered to households in Ekosodin Community. Three hundred and ninety seven (397) copies were retrieved and thus analysed. Results indicated that 374 (94.2%) households reported having access to water and that borehole was their main source of water supply. Over 130 (32.7%) household reported not treating their water before use. Types of toilet facilities frequently use by households were water closet system (flush toilet) 243 (61.2%) and pit latrine 85 (21.4%). However, households practice open defecation at low levels 6 (1.5%). Solid waste disposal methods mainly adopted by households are: open dumpsite 224 (56.4%) and burning 150 (37.8%). Majority of the households cleaned their water storage containers every six months or annually. Results further revealed that most of the respondents 382 (96.2%) practice hand washing after toilet 82 (20.65%), before cooking 79 (19.89%), before eating 55 (13.85%) and every other time 94 (23.6%) excluding the aforementioned, after cooking, after eating and after handling children’s faeces. It was observed that 243 (57.9%) houses have no drainage system, 237 (56.4%) have no waste storage facility, 312 (74.3%) have refuse dumpsite and 354 (84.3%) did not have odour of excreta in the surrounding. It was deduced from this study that households have poor access to adequate WASH facilities/services. Hence, it is recommended that water supply infrastructures, sanitation infrastructures and promotion of hygiene should be enhanced in order to improve access to adequate WASH facilities/services in the community. </jats:p>"

The ginger supply chain between China and the EU is long and complex, providing opportunities for fraudsters to deceive consumers. However, limited attention has been given to food fraud in ginger, and there is a lack of research on this topic. In this review, ginger was used as an example for interpreting the fraud issues within low-priced and high-trade volume spice products. This review aims to summarize the open access information from food and food fraud databases, literature, and stakeholders about ginger fraud, and to map, deconstruct and analyse the food fraud vulnerability in the supply chain. In addition, potential testing strategies to detect ginger fraud were also discussed. The investigation of food fraud databases, a semi-structured literature review and online interviews with stakeholders revealed that adulteration is the major fraud type in ginger products. And the most vulnerable ginger products are ground ginger and finely processed ginger. The ginger supply chain from China to the EU comprises nine stages and is medium vulnerable to food fraud, both in regard to opportunities and motivational drivers. To ensure the integrity of the ginger supply chain, there is a need to apply fraud vulnerability tools in the companies of the industry. In addition, screening and confirmatory techniques based on the characteristics of ginger should be utilised for monitoring fraud issues in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, the adverse environmental impacts of conventional agriculture due to the uncontrolled use of key farm inputs like fertilizer and irrigation water cannot be overlooked. In this context, we develop a new eco-label to promote an efficient agricultural method that provides the right balance between yield and environmental impacts through the optimal use of these farm inputs. The proposed eco-label is applied to a game-theoretic model of a farmer-retailer supply chain under demand and yield uncertainties. We consider the demand as a function of the product’s retail price, greenness, and quality; and model yield using a crop-response function. The analytical results derived help optimize the farm inputs, retail prices, and order quantity so that the stakeholders’ profits are maximized. We also investigate the effects of yield information sharing in this supply chain and find that the stakeholders must share yield information when environmentally conscious consumers dominate the market.</jats:p>"

However, conventional water purification technology consumes large amounts of coagulants, with the formation of intractable sludge. Herein, the applicability of high-speed air flotation technology for the purification of actual water sources was evaluated in Tianjin Binhai New Area. During a three-year survey, the raw water exhibited periodic pollution characteristics with algae cells as the main removal targets in all seasons. The raw water had both low temperatures and low turbidity in winter, another obstacle for water treatment. Based on the scientific analysis of the water’s quality, the water purification process was comprehensively optimized via regulating the dosage of agents and operating parameters and using high-speed air flotation equipment. The results showed that a dissolved air pressure of 0.40 MPa, reflux ratio of 8%, and SUEZ-1# dissolved air release head combined with pre-chlorination with PACl plus FeCl3 (PACl/FeCl3 ratio = 2:1) were suitable for attaining a good purification performance. High turbidity removal rates (80.9–86.2%) and algae cell removal rates (92.5–98.1%) were obtained even in the high algae period of summer and low turbidity period in the winter, proving the superior stability and applicability of the high-speed air flotation system.</jats:p>"

The reward amount given to customers is crucial for encouraging them to exchange used products. An exchanged item is accepted if it meets the minimum acceptable quality level (AQL). Both the remanufacturing capacity and the quality of exchanged products present uncertainties. Under the buyback contract, the remanufacturer purchases used products at a higher price than in the decentralized and centralized cases from the collector. In return, the collector undertakes to repurchase a certain number of used products sold to the remanufacturer, but not remanufactured due to capacity shortages. Based on the aforementioned uncertainties, this study analyses channel coordination using buyback contracts and optimizes its parameters. By conducting a numerical analysis, we first ensure that under this contract, the risk of uncertainty is divided among the members, and that each party’s profit is higher than when decisions are made individually. Therefore, a buyback contract would guarantee a win-win situation for both of the parties, and coordination for the RSC. A range of percentages of extra items purchased by collectors is derived, as well as the amount the collector pays for each item and the effect of increasing or decreasing these values is examined.</jats:p>"

Usually, interpolations of hydraulic conductivity data are needed to obtain spatial estimates over larger areas, but the results present a high uncertainty which can be reduced by adding a secondary variable in the estimation. In this paper, the influence of the number and spatial configuration of hydraulic conductivity (K) and hydraulic head (HH) data on the estimation of K is evaluated using univariate and bivariate geostatistical-Kalman filter approaches (similar to kriging and cokriging, respectively). A synthetic case based on a transient groundwater flow model is used to generate different numbers, spatial arrays, and data. With these data, variogram models for the univariate and bivariate cases were fitted and used to calculate the corresponding covariance matrices for the Kalman filter. The results show that K estimates are more reliable when HH data is added than when only K is used, independently of the number and distribution of the data, since there is a better agreement between the calculated errors and estimate error variances. HH data provides valuable information only where K is not sampled. This evaluation could support the design of optimal sampling strategies to obtain reliable K estimates.</jats:p>",

There are many types of software packages available, so most of the research proposed methods for prioritizing the best system. However, they did not suggest how to implement it, or which practices should be employed. So, this paper aims to propose a framework and a method for the selection of an ERP system and the best practice for implementation at the same time. A hybrid method of Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming (LFPP) and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is presented for solving the problem. LFPP is reliable in obtaining weights, while DEMATEL can capture interrelationships between practices. It was applied to a case study supply chain network of a Thai automotive parts manufacturer to demonstrate the applicability; it could establish the priorities of criteria, rank alternatives, and select the appropriate practices at the same time. There is no study about software and practice selection by use of this proposed method before. The comparison of LFPP and the Fuzzy Full Consistency Method (FUCOM-F) was also performed. It shows that FUCOM-F uses a smaller number of pairwise comparisons than LFPP, but the obtained weights of LFPP are more consistent with the evaluation matrix than using FUCOM-F.</jats:p>",

The algorithm was formed on the basis of the Gartner Stage maturity model with the appropriate adaptation of the maturity stages to the specifics of the functioning of railway transport and the specifics of building supply chains. Unlike the classical version of passing the Gartner Stage stages, the presented algorithm does not imply a unidirectional and sequential passage of all stages, but the passage of the second, third and fourth levels repeated several times, due to the complex nature of the digital technologies used and the impossibility of their stable functioning without interaction with each other.</jats:p>",

However, in Kenya, there is a gap between what is being produced and what is being consumed. This gap is growing and, hence, remains a policy concern. Under this backdrop, this study aimed to estimate thecombined contribution of maize area harvested, expenditure on fertilizers,number of tractors used, and maize seed quantity to national maize productionin Kenya using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and Nerlove Model. The findings indicate that maize production in Kenya is negatively associated with maize area harvested, expenditure on fertilizers, and the number of tractors used. However, there is a positive relationship between maize production and maize seed quantity. The response of maize production depicted that the price of maize in the previous period determined the production levels in the current period positively; however, as we move further away, the price level in the fourth period depicted a negative relationship. This study recommended that the government provide an adequate quantity of maize seeds to boost maize production. It also recommended that farmers be educated on the proper use of fertilizers and the optimum use of tractors and land. Furthermore, the government needs to ensure a favorable and stable price for farmers to contribute to increased maize production.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study puts forward a novel data-driven MPC for building thermal inlet, which allows the optimal operation of the district heating system and has been verified by simulation with three public buildings. In this method, the indoor temperature at the next moment reaches the temperature set value by changing the current flow rate. First, based on the energy consumption monitoring platform and the measured data of the buildings, the building indoor temperature prediction model at the next moment is established by using long short-term memory (LSTM). Compared with subspace model identification (SMI), LSTM has higher prediction accuracy, and the R2 was about 0.9 in three buildings. Second, the particle generated by particle swarm optimization, which represents the flow variation, is input to the trained LSTM to predict the indoor temperature. By minimizing the objective function, the optimal flow change at the current time can be calculated. The results showed that the MPC based on a data-driven model can adjust the flow rate in time to maintain a stable indoor temperature with ±0.5 °C error. In addition, when the temperature setting needs to be changed, the indoor temperature can reach the new set value in 3 h, which outperforms the PID control. The method proposed in this paper can greatly reduce the influence of regulation lag by adjusting the flow in advance.</jats:p>"

As the affordable deployment of these technologies grows vulnerable to materials price changes, effective strategies must be identified to mitigate the risk of higher input costs faced by manufacturers. To better understand potential threats to deployment, a market modeling approach was developed to quantify economic risk factors including material demand, substitutability, recycling, mining productivity, resource quality, and discovery. Results demonstrate that price changes are determined by interactions between demand growth, mining productivity, and resource quality. In the worst cases with high demand and low productivity, development of material substitutes and large recycling rates help reduce the prevalence of price risk from over 90% to under 10%. Investing in these strategies yields significant benefits for manufacturers and governments concerned about costs of materials critical to decarbonization and other advanced technologies.</jats:p>",

Once a fault occurs, it will affect the train’s regular operation and even threaten passengers’ personal safety. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose the faults of the transformers and circuit breakers of the traction power supply system. At present, power companies have made many achievements in fault diagnosis of power equipment, but there are still problems with real-time and accuracy. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that connects different types of terminal devices for information exchange and communication to achieve intelligence. It includes data acquisition and transmission, information interaction, processing, and decision-making from bottom to top. It uses sensor terminals to obtain real-time status information on electrical equipment. Moreover, it conducts real-time monitoring and intelligent processing of the equipment status of the traction power supply system. In this paper, the multi-data fusion technology of the IoT combines the real-time information of electrical equipment with fault diagnosis to realize the fault diagnosis of transformers and circuit breakers. First, we built an equipment fault diagnosis system based on the multi-terminal data fusion technology of the IoT. Secondly, the transformer fault diagnosis model is established. We adopt the BP neural network algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to realize transformer fault diagnosis and use PSO to optimize the feature subset to improve the diagnosis performance. Finally, the fault diagnosis model of the vacuum circuit breaker is established. We select the current change and time node as typical fault feature quantities and use the PSO–BP neural network algorithm to realize the fault diagnosis of the circuit breaker.</jats:p>"

It is, however, voluminous, with heterogenous fuel characteristics and uncertainties in its supply. The feasibility of a bioenergy facility is contingent on a secure supply of uniform feedstock; a terminal in the supply chain can be useful in this regard. Biomass can be treated in the terminal to meet quality specifications and stored to overcome seasonality and supply disruptions. Nonetheless, such terminals require a significant capital investment; thus, the decision to use a terminal needs to be made judiciously. The decision process must account for a diverse set of factors that influence the terminal’s effectiveness. These include both quantitative and qualitative factors. The objective of this study is to develop a multi-criteria decision-making framework that takes quantitative and qualitative factors into consideration while selecting a terminal. The framework consists of analytical hierarchy process to analyze qualitative information, and a mixed-integer programming model to evaluate quantitative information including fuel quality (moisture content and thermal value). This hybrid framework was implemented in a case study. It proved to be an effective tool for identifying terminals with the highest potential to generate value for the bioenergy supply chain.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we provide an exploratory research on the flexibility and adaptability of a specific SG to different target groups and students’ needs in the field of operations and supply chain management. We first provide an overview of the SG and introduce its mechanics. Next, we explain how the mechanics has been implemented, by means of a set of parameters and indicators. We report the results of two different game sessions, played by a class of bachelor’s degree students at different levels of difficulty, which were achieved by altering some specific game parameters. By comparing the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in the two sessions, we report and discuss the consequences of the modified game parameters, in terms of impact on the difficulty level of the SG measured by the indicators. Experimental results match with our hypothesis, since the increased level of difficulty of sourcing and delivery times only deteriorates the related subset of indicators in the harder game session, without altering the remaining KPIs.</jats:p>"

Effective management strategies including total quality management (TQM) and supply chain management (SCM) will guide the better performance of businesses. Additionally, the previous published studies in Automotive and Automotive Parts industries in these issues are limited. Hence, the objective of this study is to investigate the causal relationships model which focuses on total quality management (TQM), supply chain management (SCM) and organizational performance (OP) of the Automotive and Automotive Parts Industries in the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). Data were collected from 212 companies operating in the Automotive and Automotive Parts Industries in Thailand’s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). The data comprised answers from a self-administered survey, and these were analyzed using descriptive statistics and the structural equations modeling (SEM) method. The findings suggest that together, TQM and SCM generate positive outcomes for organizational performance. Furthermore, supply chain management mediates the relationship between TQM and organizational performance. Hence, effective total quality management and supply chain management can be integrated into businesses’ management and operational strategies to improve the financial and non-financial aspects of their performance.</jats:p>"

Twenty-nine (29) cabbage farmers were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. The data obtained was analysed descriptively using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software Version 22. Descriptive statistics identified the modes, means of variables, frequencies, and percentages. The results of the study showed that the majority respondents face cabbage losses due to poor management during transportation. Moreover, challenges experienced by the cabbage farmers included mould growth, poor transport services, poor temperature management, poor stock handling practices, and location of the farms in relation to the market. The findings further revealed that insect infestation in some cabbage consignments was also a contributing factor which led to a high rejection rate among the retailers. The researchers propose that extension advisers should train cabbage farmers to address the identified challenges and ensure a regular monitoring and evaluation process to ensure the success of farmers. </jats:p>"

Following process‐based restoration principles, construction efforts are often limited to bank protection removal and local bank erosion initiation. Despite significant advances in our understanding of fluvial processes, the influence of sediment supply on widening morphodynamics is still inadequately understood. Using mobile‐bed laboratory experiments, we studied the morphological development of river widenings in channelized subalpine gravel‐bed rivers in response to different sediment supply levels. The initial setup included a channel with a longitudinal slope of around 1% and a floodplain on one side, which was 25 channel widths long and three wide. After removing the fixed bank, the floodplain was available for erosion and channel shifting. Seven experimental series with sequences of steady bed‐forming discharge and unsteady larger floods were conducted. Sediment was supplied at rates of 20%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the initial channel's transport capacity. The laboratory experiments were combined with two‐dimensional hydrodynamic numerical simulations to closely track both the morphological development and the resulting flow conditions. Sediment supply was found to be a critical driver of morphodynamic activity in river widenings, with sediment supply rates close to channel transport capacity promoting active channel widening, sediment relocation, and lateral channel‐floodplain connectivity. In contrast, low sediment supply maintained a stable, single‐thread channel disconnected from its floodplain. Further, our results indicate that an increase in sediment supply or structural measures triggering local flow deflection can reactivate morphodynamic processes in previously sediment‐starved reaches after a transition period of several years to decades. Our results highlight the fundamental importance of sediment transport in reach‐scale river restoration.</jats:p>",

Horizontal and vertical energy transmission to the scan magnet are independent. The high precision and sinewave are utilised to produce a smooth circle field. This power supply has an air cooling system and a more protective function to keep the machine and magnet from being damaged. During the scan magnet application, the maximum current is 12.5 A, and the inductor is 30 mH at 20 Hz sine wave. Accordingly, Kecpo BOP 72-14 model with a maximum current of 14 A and maximum output voltage of 72 V is chosen. Finally, an integrated high-precision scan magnet power supply is created in the laboratory. Experimental result shows the output current ripple and bandwidth, with the output current being 14 A and the maximum ripple being 0.45 A. This combination is simple because no resistor is in parallel with the magnet coils. Lastly, this work demonstrates the magnetic field, output current ripple, and frequency variation with output current to prove that this power supply meets the requirements.</jats:p>",

A systematic literature review was carried out by using some appropriate elements of the PRISMA statement to identify disciplines that work to mitigate the effects of the livestock industry by organizing them according to their approach to addressing this problem. The main objective is to find information and classify the disciplines, papers, literature review methodologies, research gaps, authors, and journals developing the management of the cattle supply chain. This paper could analyze and mitigate the adverse effects on society and the environment generated by the industry, organizing them according to their approach. Twenty databases were consulted between March and May 2020, from which 146 review documents were chosen. The papers reviewed were published between 2003 and 2020. The eligibility criteria for selection were open access to the full text, publication in an indexed journal, and a focus on any discipline related to cattle. The unselected papers did not have DOIs or duplicates, and those focused on other types of meat and book chapters. Subsequently, the information in the selected papers was described and consolidated, and these papers had 602 authors and were from 99 journals. Next, a discipline categorization was proposed. The results were organized, showing that among all the analysis criteria, the category of veterinary medicine had the best results in terms of indicators; therefore, additional research is needed on the other disciplines, especially in culture, technology, management, quality control, tanneries, and transportation, as there was less research within these disciplines. It is recommended that research on a mix of the different proposed disciplines be conducted. The proposed categorization’s main contribution is to identify and group the cattle supply chain’s different disciplines and the definition of research gaps organized under a structure organizational management model. Finally, a multicriteria selection methodology must be used that prioritizes the discipline categories proposed in this review to guide future research.</jats:p>"

The soil types with added Zn and Cd exerted a significant effect on translocation and accumulation of metals in different tissues. The accumulation of Zn and Cd was higher for Tenosol than that for Dermosol. At control, the concentration of Cd followed a pattern, e.g., root &gt; stem &gt; petiole &gt; pod &gt; leaflet &gt; grain for both soils. A basal Zn supply (5 mg kg−1) increased the grain Zn concentration to a significant amount (up to 67%). It also reduced Cd accumulation in tissues, including grains (up to 34%). No non-carcinogenic effect was observed for either the children or the adults as the EDI and PTDI values were below the safety limit; however, the ILCR values exceeded the safety limit, indicating the possibility of some carcinogenic effects.

This study uses monthly data ranges from January 2010 to December 2020 because of the limited housing price data from each city. For smooth measurement, the logarithm of all data except measurements of nominal interest rate, real interest rate and inflation is used. This research uses the Co-integration Analysis and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to investigate the macroeconomic variables’ effects on the demand and supply. Mortgage credit volume, as a dependent variable, is influenced by real per capita GDP, real house prices, projected inflation, and nominal interest rates. On the contrary, the building site is used as a dependent variable on the supply side that is determined by the real housing price, the real interest rate, and the real cost of construction. In the VECM model, the mortgage credit volume and constriction cost were dominated by error correction variables, showing the adjustment of disequilibrium towards an equilibrium point. In the case of Ankara, supply-side variables have a long-term relationship. Both housing demand and supply-related factors have a long-term impact on the housing market in Istanbul and Izmir. Given a significant p-value, the coefficient of C1 derived from system equations is negative.</jats:p>"

This paper presents the design, simulation, and implementation of a modular and versatile high-voltage pulse power supply used in microwave device characterization and testing. A microcontroller-based digitally controlled pulse generation unit is also developed to generate the trigger pulses for high-voltage switching modules to control the turn-ON and turn-OFF of the switching devices. The digitally controlled pulse generation unit provides better resolution of pulse width, pulse repetition frequency, and system protection over the entire range of operations. The pulse generation and control circuit controls the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and pulse wide (PW). The PRF and PW can be varied from 100 to 1000 Hz and 10 to 100 µs, respectively. The experimental prototype with ten series-connected high-voltage modules is connected to achieve a 25 kV pulsed output voltage. The experimental results of HV-PPS on a resistive dummy load and 5 GHz klystron tube are presented in this work.</jats:p>",

This study explores the antecedents of rural tourism experience memory from the tourism supply perspective, revealing the mechanism of effect of these antecedents on tourists’ tourism experience memory formation through a questionnaire-based survey of 556 participants in Xidi Village, China, and correlation and multiple regression analyses. The results show that perceptions about the supply of rural tourism destinations trigger positive emotions that, in turn, affect the formation of rural tourism experience memory. Through the mediating role of positive emotions, there is a significant correlation between perception of rural tourism destination supply and the formation of rural tourism experience memories.</jats:p>"

To test the effect of the water resources ‘fee to tax’, this research employs a multistage dynamic difference-in-differences (DID) model to explore whether the implementation of the policy can help alleviate water poverty based on panel data from 2009 to 2019. The results indicate the water poverty in western China is significantly more serious than in other regions and the implementation of the water resources tax policy significantly alleviates water poverty (the sign of the policy is positive and significant at the 1% level) in China. Additionally, the mechanism effects suggest that the policy can effectively restrain water poverty by reducing groundwater exploitation and optimizing the water utilization structure. In terms of spatial heterogeneity, the effect of the water resources tax policy on alleviating water poverty is stronger in central and eastern regions than in western regions. The conclusions of this study may, to some degree, serve as a basis to scientifically guide the implementation of China's water resources ‘fee to tax’ policy and, thus, effectively improve the level of water resources management.</jats:p>",

However, the new retail service supply chain system’s node enterprises cannot meet quality supply and demand requirements, which leads to quality risks. The quality risks cascade through the system and are amplified, and thus affect overall performance. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the law of quality risk transmission and realize risk control. In our work, (1) an improved model for quality risk transmission in the new retail service supply chain based on the infectious disease model is developed, (2) we introduce value co-creation rate and control factors from a value co-creation perspective, (3) and solve the threshold and equilibrium point of the service chain node, and conduct a simulation to reveal the quality risk transmission law. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) there is a threshold in the risk transmission system, the larger the threshold the more beneficial it is to control the transfer of risks; (2) the value co-creation rate influences the quality risk transmission process, with the susceptible state value co-creation rate significantly influencing the proportion of immune state numbers, while the opposite is true for the infected state value co-creation rate; (3) both inhibitory and facilitative control factors influence the transmission process of quality risk in the new retail service supply chain. Thus, the value co-creation behavior and risk control measures should be adopted in time to increase the transmission threshold to effectively curb the risk transmission. It will improve the overall quality level of the supply chain so that multiple stakeholders can achieve value co-creation.</jats:p>"

By constructing a game model in CLSC under three modes of the decentralized decision-making with well-capitalized manufacturers, the decentralized decision-making with a capital-constrained manufacturers and the M&amp;A between competing manufacturers, the paper analyzes the influence of bank loan interest rate and M&amp;A coefficient on the optimal decision and revenue to calculate the conditions that competing manufacturers need to meet to implement the M&amp;A strategy. It finds that: firstly, with the increase of bank loan interest rate, the capital-constrained manufacturers will increase the wholesale price to obtain higher returns, and meanwhile reduce the recycling rate of old products to reduce the capital investment, but the well-capitalized manufacturers will also lower wholesale prices, but they will increase the recycling rate of old products to reduce production costs. Secondly, with the increase in bank interest rates, the revenue of capital-constrained manufacturers decreases, while the well-capitalized manufacturers increase. Thirdly, when competing manufacturers can increase market power or improve core production technology to reduce costs after mergers and acquisitions, they will increase the recycling of old products and reduce the wholesale price of products to gain more market share. Moreover, the better performance of the M&amp;A strategy, the higher the benefits of closed-loop supply chain members will be. Finally, whether manufacturers are capital constrained or not, the M&amp;A strategy are not always beneficial to the manufacturers. And whether the M&amp;A strategy is beneficial or not is related to market demand parameters, recovery cost parameters and merger coefficient. But when these parameters meet certain conditions, the competitive manufacturer’s M&amp;A strategy can benefit all members of the closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>"

Choosing the right method for a profitable business has become quite tricky. The proposed study introduces different business strategies based on trade credit, revenue sharing contract, variable demand and production rate. As trade credit is one of the best policies to attract customers, there are two types of models based on it. In the first model, demand depends on average selling price, green degree, and products quality. An additional trade-credit factor is in the second model. However, considering coordination, non-coordination, and revenue sharing contracts, each model has three sub-cases. The main aim is to find the best strategy for the profit maximization of the supply chain members. Green investment, maintenance, and multi-factor dependent demand make the model more sustainable. The global optimization is established theoretically and different propositions are developed. Through numerical experiments, the global optimality is also verified. Some special cases, with a comparative graph, are provided for the validation of these results and to find the best strategy for profit maximization. Finally, some concluding remarks along with future extensions are discussed.</jats:p>",

This paper tries to fill the gap through the relational understanding between the provision of safe water and communities’ socioeconomic upliftment, which remains the main reason behind the establishment of the potable water facility in Porapara village located in West Midnapur district of the state of West Bengal, India. The study findings revealed that community participation through the process of empowerment results in good governance of the potable water project and the socioeconomic well-being of the community in Porapara village.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the globe, small and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs’) survival space has been increasingly constrained, and their financing challenges and costly concerns have also become more evident. With the emergence of the supply chain financing model, the problem of difficult financing for SMEs has been effectively alleviated. How to effectively improve the performance of supply chain financing for SMEs is a hot issue of common concern for both business and academic circles. This paper used 90 SMEs involved in supply chain financing business for a case study based on the “Technology–Organization–Environment” (TOE) framework, using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), and explored the linkage effects of technology, organization, and environmental conditions on SMEs’ performance in improving supply chain financing and their path choices. The study found that: (1) individual conditions do not constitute a necessary condition for high/low supply chain financing performance. However, technical level preconditions play a more important role in shaping the high supply chain financing performance of firms. (2) The three preconditions at the technological, organizational, and environmental levels work together to form a diverse set of conditions that drive the high supply chain financing performance of firms. That is, the paths driving the high supply chain financing performance of SMEs are characterized by “different routes to the same destination.” There are three different models: “technology-supply chain capability-driven,” “IT-supply chain capability-driven,” and “IS-supply chain capability-driven.” (3) The degree of application of corporate information technology, information sharing capability, and supply chain capability, and the lack of environmental competitiveness are the reasons for the generation of the low supply chain financing performance of SMEs. The above research findings can provide a direct theoretical basis for enterprise supply chain financing practice and are of great practical significance in guiding Chinese SMEs on how to improve their supply chain financing performance.</jats:p>"

The recent event of the coronavirus disease pandemic placed unprecedented pressure on food supply systems worldwide, and it constitutes a unique opportunity to evaluate the performance of food chains. Through a scoping review of the academic literature, this study provides a critical assessment of the implications of the pandemic on short food supply chains in multiple economies. Following the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA-ScR framework, the SCOPUS and ISI Web of Science databases were searched for the academic literature on the topic. The results of the review indicate that, besides the direct effects of the pandemic, the indirect effects resulting from public policies implemented to contain the spread of the virus affected all relevant dimensions of sustainability. Moreover, the consequences of the pandemic were more disruptive in the short food chains of low-income countries than in those of high-income countries. The main challenges and opportunities for the sustainable development of short food supply chains are identified, and recommendations for future research are outlined.</jats:p>"

However, the conventional thermoelastic theories are no longer applicable in high-temperature settings. This study provides an insight into the thermomechanical features of a nonlocal viscous half-space exposed to a cyclic heat source. Using a novel concept of fractional derivatives, introduced by Atangana and Baleanu, it is assumed that the viscoelastic properties follow the fractional Kelvin–Voigt model. The nonlocal differential form of Eringen’s nonlocal theory is employed to consider the impact of small-scale behavior. It is also proposed that the rule of dual-phase thermal conductivity can be generalized to thermoelastic materials to include the higher-order time derivatives. The numerical results for the examined physical variables are presented using the Laplace transform technique. Furthermore, several numerical analyses are performed in-depth, focusing on the effects of nonlocality, structural viscoelastic indicator, fractional order, higher-order and phase-lag parameters on the behavior of the nanoscale half-space. According to the presented findings, it appears that the higher-order terms have a major impact on reactions and may work to mitigate the impact of thermal diffusion. Furthermore, these terms provide a novel approach to categorize the materials based on their thermal conductivities.</jats:p>"

This is in relation to its ability to substantially reduce greenhouse emissions, energy consumption, pollution, and other drivers of negative environmental change in the built environment. Despite the implementation of GSCM practices, climate change continues to occur with a steady rise in greenhouse gas emissions per year that are associated with the built environment. Hence, there is a need for a proactive regenerative approach that focuses not only on reducing negative environmental footprints but also aims to create net positive impacts on the environment. This study aims to address this issue by first identifying the dominant forms of construction GSCM practices and their performance limitations through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The result revealed that regenerative factors were lacking in current GSCM practices. To further explore the nature of expanding current GSCM practices, a regenerative-based GSCM model was developed that demonstrates the relationship between regenerative and GSCM practices. This research addresses the gaps in current GSCM practices which could serve as a strategic response to climate change in terms of both mitigation and adaptation responses.</jats:p>",

The checklist technique was used by researchers to obtain information from respondents about the application or implementation of risk management. The objective of this research is to identify risk management in the development of the Pasigala Regional Drinking Water Supply System (SPAM), Central Sulawesi Province. This type of research is a case study. This checklist consists of three parts, each of which is used to obtain data on risk identification, risk analysis, and risk treatment. From the analysis, 6 risks fall into the high category, these risks are that the quality of drinking water is not as expected, the Water Treatment Plant (WTP) has never functioned according to the planned capacity, the raw water transmission pipe is not in accordance with the minimum standard / technical specifications, the design raw water production units that have not been able to overcome turbidity due to sedimentation, natural disasters in the location area, and damage to the ecosystem around water sources.</jats:p>",

The problem addresses the extra rented warehouse (RW) to store extra inventories if the manufacturer is producing more inventories than their owned warehouse (OW) capacity. Now, the problem is which inventories should be used first with minimum cost and minimum deterioration. To solve this problem, we have assumed a MFIFO (mixed first in first out) dispatching policy and constant demand rate over a finite time horizon. Along with these we have also assumed an inspection policy during the supply chain to separate deteriorated items and a carbon tax policy is also considered to control carbon emissions. The rate of deterioration depends on the number of inspections. If the number of inspections increases, it minimizes the rate of the decaying process. Due to the adoption of the inspection policy, the supply chain moves toward a green supply chain as it removes deteriorated inventories that minimize further decay by contact, and simultaneously separated deteriorated products can be utilized for other purposes that solve the problem of the disposal of deteriorating inventories and reduce emission generation. We have also established the uniqueness of the established model. The motto of solving the mathematical model is to find the values of the optimum value of N, the number of cycles, and n, the number of inspections that helps to minimize total cost. At last, we illustrate the result with the help of a numerical example.</jats:p>"

For accommodating multi-source passenger traffic with different travel demand, while optimizing the energy consumption, we propose a multi-cycle train timetable optimization model and a decomposition algorithm. A periodized spatial-temporal network that can support the integrated optimization of passenger service satisfaction and energy consumption considering multi-cycles is studied as the basis of the modeling. Based on this, an integrated optimization model taking the planning of the train spatial-temporal path, cycle length and active lines as variables is proposed. Then, for solving the issues caused by the complex relationships among the cycle length, line and train spatial-temporal path in large-scale cases, a hybrid heuristic Lagrangian decomposition method is investigated. Numerical experiments under different passenger flow demand scenarios are performed. The results show that the more fluctuating the passenger flow is, the more obvious the advantage of a multi-cycle timetable is. For the scenario with two passenger flow peaks, compared to a single-cycle timetable, the demand satisfaction ratio of the multi-cycle timetable is 4.44% higher and the train vacancy rate is 11.49% lower. A multi-cycle timetable also saves 3.24 h running time and 15,553.6 kwh energy consumption compared to a single-cycle timetable. Large-scale real cases show that this advantage still exists in practice.</jats:p>"

We selected hydropower stations in the Lhasa River of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as the beneficiaries of hydropower development. We then identified three ecosystem services. We assessed the supply of ecosystem services and the demand of hydropower for them. Finally, we discussed the relationship between hydropower and watersheds. </jats:p><jats:p> The results demonstrated the following: (1) Water yield was 309.0 ± 110.3 mm, with a decreasing spatial pattern from the northeast to the southwest.

Flood mitigation was 21.3 ± 2.9 mm, and the lower values were in lower elevation areas. (2) Hydropower has produced demands for the three services. The demand for the water yield of the five stations was 0.45 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> − 1.64 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The demand for soil conservation from the Pangduo and Zhikong stations were 7.87 and 4.53 times their storage capacity, respectively. The demand for the flood mitigation of these two stations were 1.49 times and 1.09 times that of their flood regulation storage capacities. (3) The supply of the water yield service was greater than the demand for nearly the entire year, with an ecosystem supply and demand index between 4.73 and 14.06. The supply and demand of soil conservation services was nearly balanced. The flood mitigation service provided by the upstream ecosystem of Pangduo was 70.18 times the demand and 20.58 times the service of Zhikong. The results demonstrated that hydropower has a strong dependence on ecosystem services. This indicated that both enhancement and mitigation should be considered in the design payment of ecosystem service roles. </jats:p>",

This paper describes the Mexican avocado supply chain characteristics, identifies the actors involved in the supply chain, and emphasizes the problems that the current actors have when exporting them to the US market. On this basis, we propose a technological solution system to automate the traceability process. The system was designed to comply with the authority and consumer requirements.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study aimed to determine Ukraine's food security level, and develop the main directions for its increase. To realize the research purpose several tasks were conducted. Firstly, to calculate Ukraine's Food Security Index and compare it with the average World and average European Food Security Index. Secondly, make a forecast of Ukraine's Food Security Index for the next 5 years, and assess its trends. Thirdly, to establish the main factors that have an impact on Ukraine's Food Security Index. Fourthly, to identify the main bottlenecks and, on the basis of these data, propose the main directions for increasing the level of Ukraine's food security.The global environmental crisis has significantly increased the risk of food insecurity in the world and the likelihood of famine in certain regions. Besides, Russia's war against Ukraine, which destroyed the supply chain infrastructure and exacerbated the problems of providing food to the population, updated the researched issues. Accordingly, the research aimed at identifying the \"bottlenecks\" of Ukraine's Food Security and developing directions for increasing its level.Based on the results of theoretical and empirical research, the main \"bottlenecks\" of the process of ensuring food security have been identified and directions for increasing its level have been established.The study carried out the calculation and forecasting of Ukraine's Food Security Index. Moreover, the paper proposed a method of determining the main \"bottlenecks\" of Ukraine's Food Security Index by assessing the influence of various factors. Based on the analysis, the study developed the main directions for increasing Ukraine's food security level.</jats:p>"

COVID-19 RT-PCR tests are the gold standard based on their higher sensitivity. However, in this era of inflation and supply chain disruptions, the use of only RT-PCR tests would be more expensive and may be vulnerable to reagent supply chain shortages. Triage of resources of both test types is important in ensuring access and equity in testing distribution as well as ensuring economical RT-PCR testing access for sicker patients. A comparison of costs was explored by contrasting a model of cost effectively reserving RT-PCR tests for those with significant disease requiring hospitalization and using POC tests for those with mild disease (defined as at most mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization) versus universal provision of RT-PCR to all.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods/Case Report</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Cost information from the regional Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), specifically for the Alinity-m (RT-PCR) and BinaxNOW (POC) by Abbott (Chicago IL), and from the community (median COVID-19 RT- PCR pricing obtained from the Peterson KFF Health System Tracker) were included.

Carbon emissions can be decreased more efficiently by coordinating the management of firms upstream and downstream in the supply chain, which has an increasingly important role in the low carbon process. Research on the low carbon supply chain (LCSC) has gradually evolved into important branches of global sustainable development. This paper aims to conduct a complete thematic analysis of 754 articles published between 2012 and 2021, identify the structural dimensions of evolution, and classify them according to systematic methodology. It provides a stage-by-stage summary of relevant research results from the past decade. At present, research in the LCSC field has resulted in a complete theoretical framework and research system and has formed the evolutionary path of method-policy-practice research. This study will help to promote further in-depth study of the LCSC and the fabrication and improvement of its theoretical system. It provides a valuable reference for researchers interested in LCSC, and points out the focus and direction of future research.</jats:p>"

In this case, the measuring range of the human heart rate is between 60-100 BPM, in which the measurement unit is expressed as Beat per Minute (BPM). Therefore, it is very important to use Electrocardiograph equipment to tap the electrical signals of the heart with correct readings and minimal interference such as frequency of electric lines and noise. The purpose of this study was to compare the instrumentation amplifier using a single supply with a bi-polar supply in the ECG design to select the best instrumentation amplifier, which is expected to contribute to other researchers in choosing the right type of instrumentation amplifier that is efficient and qualified. In this case, the research was carried out by comparing two single supply instrumentation amplifiers using the AD623 IC and the bi-polar supply using the AD620 IC, continued by the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to determine the frequency spectrum of the ECG signal. The test results further showed that the use of single power instrumentation could reduce more noise compared to the Bi-Polar instrumentation amplifier by strengthening 60 dB Low pass filter circuit. Meanwhile, the FFT results in finding the frequency spectrum explained that the FFT results on the ECG signal provided information that the ECG signal had a frequency range between 0.05 Hz and 100 Hz. When the frequency is more than 100 Hz, the frequency started to be suppressed and when the frequency is less than 100 Hz, the frequency is passed. This research could be further used as a reference by other researchers to determine which type of instrumentation amplifier is better.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water is an essential resource for the well-being of humans as well as for ecosystems. In this regard, the increasing water scarcity areas has become one of the major problems faced by humanity. In Malaysia, Selangor is considered a water-stressed area due to the increase in water demand and limited suitable fresh water resources for treatment and distribution. The increase in population as well as urbanization and industrialization made the rivers in Selangor arguably the most polluted compared to other states. These situations result in a series of unscheduled water supply interruption over the years and negatively impact the majority of consumers. Projected water demand also indicates that the existing water supplies are not sufficient in the long run, therefore, it is deemed required to study the water demand and supply gap in Selangor to ensure the current water management is sustainable for the remote future. This paper mainly discusses on the current water production from Water Treatment Plants as well as projection of water demand which also foresee the future water deficit in Selangor. The method used in this study was based on review of secondary data acquired from available published report and website, while the assessment of water demand conducted comprise of calculation of projected population, projected domestic water demand, projected total water demand and water deficit up to year 2050. According to the result obtained, the existing water demand and supply in Selangor is 4,967 MLD, meanwhile, the projection of water demand in Selangor up to year 2050 is 7,011 MLD with the projected water deficit of 2,044 MLD. The findings of this paper are essential in water resources planning and management, particularly in terms of additional raw water supply that will be required to cater to the future water demand in Selangor.</jats:p>",

This country has a high range of energy demand, while renewable energies play a minor role in its energy supply chain. Furthermore, the world is going through a transition towards renewable resources, which currently consist of only 10% of the total energy mix. As the first contribution in this area, this paper aims to design a 100% renewable DHS integrated with radiant floor heating for a group of residential buildings in Sarein, Iran. Moreover, the literature proposes a novel approach for combining geothermal energy and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) to achieve a 100% renewable energy system. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is used for thermal analysis by 3D designing the buildings in SketchUp and OpenStudio and simulating the heat load in EnergyPlus. Three scenarios are presented to better compare the DHS with the decentralized heating system regarding fuel consumption, as well as environmental and economic aspects. The town’s existing heating system that consumes natural gas for both space heating and hot water demand is referred to as the IHS-G scenario. The DHS-G scenario represents an 87% renewable DHS system, working with natural gas and geothermal energy, while the DHS-MSW scenario is a 100% renewable system, consuming both geothermal energy and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). Finally, findings suggest that DHS-MSW and DHS-G scenarios reduce the annual energy consumption of buildings by about 595 and 33 toes, respectively. Hence, the greenhouse gas effect will alleviate by mitigating the emission of 1403 and 1339 tons of CO2-eq./year, respectively. Moreover, exporting the extra natural gas through both LNG and pipeline provides about 26 million and 28 million USD/year revenue in DHS-G and DHS-MSW scenarios.</jats:p>"

The town is situated in an area with a dense hydrographic network but still encounters difficulties in water supply. The purpose of the study is to make an analysis of changes in water demand in the town of Berkovitsa, assessed by the Water Stress Index. The water supply in the municipality of Berkovitsa is taken care of by the operator \"ViK Berkovitsa\" EOOD. The separate territory of ViK Berkovitsa EOOD consists of a total of six different sized water supply systems (WSS), one of which is WSS Berkovitsa � for the town of Berkovitsa. The WSS Berkovitsa is supplied with water from several water sources, which receive water from mountain catchments. These water sources are surface river catchments, shallow underground water sources and \"Srechenska Bara\" Dam. For this study is used data for intake capacity of water sources and for water demand in the town of Berkovitsa. The data for the resource of the water sources is based on information from the issued water permits of Danube River Basin Directorate Pleven. The data for the water demand � from the Business plan for the development of the activity of the \"ViK Berkovitsa\" EOOD for the period 2017-2021 and from the forecast for the demand made in the regional Master plans for water and waste water. Then with this data is calculated the Water Stress Index for water supply of the town of Berkovitsa, which takes into account the percentage of intake water to the available water resource. In order to avoid water stress, this ratio should be under 20%, but for the town of Berkovitsa is around 75%. The study shows that the main cause of high water stress is large water losses. Some comparisons with the Business Plan and Master Plans are discussed. Conclusions have been made in connection with the reduction of water stress on Berkovitsa town's water sources. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, everyone has observed many disruptions in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Indeed, this global and complex supply chain is vulnerable, especially when it must face a sudden rise in global demand. To adapt to the increasing demand and the numerous shortages, the United States White House has suggested several recommendations (The White House, 2021). Three of them will be detailed in this report: boosting local production, building an emergency capacity, and promoting international cooperation. With more than 10,000 locations and retail stores in the United States and with the competition of large retail stores like Target and Walmart, CVS has continued to enhance its supply chain by rolling out vendor technological portals designed to facilitate its supply chain programs and models. Most of CVS’s generic products and retail merchandise are manufactured outside the United States. To ensure the sustainability and efficiency of their models, integrated planning, internal and external collaborations, and dissemination of forecasting models with suppliers help them to predict and manage demand uncertainties. CVS is digitally connected to give people more options by using their artificial intelligence platform, thereby harnessing the power of digital technology and the Omni channel sourcing to ensure that their customers are reached/served whenever, and by whatever means possible. During the COVID-19 pandemic, CVS faced three major issues related to the distribution of common drugs between patients with chronic illnesses and patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, a high volume of customer calls, and high procurement costs of medicines from suppliers due to shortages. This led CVS to implement temporary mitigation measures that set it apart from its competitors and helped serve more patients in an orderly fashion. Based on the learnings from CVS, this report presents a set of short-term solutions that can be implemented by CVS to insulate it from future shortages until the long-term solutions are implemented in collaboration with the FDA and drug suppliers.</jats:p>"

In response, many domestic suppliers pivoted to producing PPE, such as masks and face shields, made possible by low material costs and simple designs. A key challenge that remained was the lack of an established marketplace for nontraditional suppliers of PPE to connect with healthcare facilities in need. To address this inefficiency, we launched an online platform, Shield-Net, to match requests for face shields with new suppliers of PPE. Our platform was based on an optimization model that produced supplier-requester pairs and took into account request urgency, request size, production capacity, location, and product type. During the period of March to September 2020, Shield-Net produced 390 matches, resulting in the shipment of more than 50,000 face shields to 68 unique requesting organizations. Supplier-requester proximity was found to be the only statistically significant variable in the success of a match. In this paper, we discuss the development and impact of our matching platform, as well as lessons learned during its operation. </jats:p><jats:p> History: This paper was refereed.

The present study is focused on investigating three important contaminants, namely microplastics (MPs), heavy metals, and fecal coliforms in the surface water of the river, with major emphasis on MPs occurrence and characterization. MPs showed an increase in abundance in the river from the Wazirabad barrage (n = 500 MPs/m3) to the Okhla barrage downstream (n = 3,900 MPs/m3) in Delhi, with a maximum abundance downstream to the Najafgarh and Shahdara drain outfalls. White color and fragmented shape were prevalent characteristics of the isolated MPs. Attenuated total reflectance–Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed five types of polymers. Heavy metals (chromium, lead, manganese, and iron) and fecal coliforms were at unacceptable levels at most of the sampling sites. Due to the emergence of issues concerning the tendency of MPs to actively interact with heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms, investigation of the co-occurrence of such harmful pollutants is very important. The present study is aimed at this issue and urges similar kinds of investigations in other riverine regions of our country, as well as globally, due to their scarcity in literature. This study can further provide a baseline database to help the Government of India's efforts to clean and revive the Delhi stretch of the Yamuna River.</jats:p>",

This study resolves the supply chain network’s logistic problem to determine the appropriate order allocation of products from multiple plants, warehouses, and distributors to minimize total transportation and inventory costs by simultaneously determining optimal locations, flows, shipment composition, and shipment cycle times. The multi-objective logistic cost minimizes through the value function approach for obtaining the optimal order allocation.

However, smallholder farmers, in particular, have experienced mixed impacts in inclusion and exclusion from modern supply chains (MSC). Therefore, by taking Pakistan’s mandarin industry as a case, this study aims to analyze the farmers’ efficiency and inclusiveness in modern supply chains and compare them across the farm size categories, i.e., small, medium, and large. For that purpose, cross-sectional data from 300 farmers were collected to test the posit objectives. The empirical investigation was made using the endogenous treatment effect model and the propensity score matching approach. Findings show that large farmers prefer to participate in MSC, driven by contractors, processors or exporters. Conversely, the smallholders are more inclined to participate in the traditional supply chains (TSCs), driven by village vendors, local retailers/consumers, middlemen, and traditional fruit and vegetable markets. The results also revealed a positive connection between efficiency and farmers’ inclusion in the MSC. Orchard size, education, off-farm income, and extension services positively impact profitability. In terms of an increase in farmers’ profitability, the efficiency improvement can benefit the resource-poor smallholders who make up 74% of the total farmers in the sample. Therefore, these results are noteworthy for devising policy actions to facilitate smallholder inclusion in the modern agri-food supply chains to alleviate rural poverty and ensure farmers’ wellbeing.</jats:p>"

The aim of this article is to explore the links between the ES supply from PULs and how they support different SDGs from a global perspective. For this, we implemented a review of the literature oriented to identify (1) the most relevant ES provided by PULs at a global level, (2) how they support the achievement of different SDG, and (3) the type of policy interventions and actors related to PULs. We identified the supply of 17 different ES by PULs and a relationship to 12 SDGs. In 58% of the cases, the SDGs were related to two ES sections, where regulation and maintenance was dominant. Pure research was the main type of intervention, mainly at the municipal scale. Increasing the cooperation between science and policy and expanding the scale of analysis beyond municipal boundaries are critical aspects.</jats:p>"

Data sharing is an imperative way to unlock the data value of a supply chain system. A safe and effective access control mechanism for privacy-sensitive data is key in data sharing. At present, traditional access control mechanisms are static, single-factor control, and prone to a single point of failure. For dealing with these, a fine-grained access control (FGAC) framework for supply chain data sharing is proposed, based on the blockchain Hyperledger Fabric. It augments role-based access control (RBAC) by giving different attribute keywords to different types of users. This framework is implemented in smart contract Chaincodes and quantitatively verified by using the model-checking tool UPPAAL. The experiment results show that the FGAC framework enhances the efficiency and safety in the process of data sharing for the supply chain system, compared with the existing works.</jats:p>"

Considering the current packaging practices, the study aimed to develop improved sustainable packaging practices with a supply chain aspect in order to cut down the negative environmental aspect such as standardization in packaging for all customers, elimination of wood pallets, developing local suppliers, change in packaging design, making the packaging more compact and lightweight, reducing carbon footprint and fuel consumption by encouraging trade through sea instead of air. The results concluded that internal factors such as alternate packaging material (like Mondi’s Aegispaper, Arjowiggins’ and Corrugated Bubble Wrap) along with the suggested sustainable packaging practices discussed above and external factors such as availability of local vendors are important requirements for successful sustainable packaging development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objectives : A water treatment system, combining aeration and reverse osmosis (RO) processes, was introduced to improve water supply facilities in a small village where additional water treatment was required due to high concentrations of natural radioactive substances, nitrate nitrogen, and fluoride. In this study, CCRO(Closed-circuit reverse osmosis) was first introduced for commercial use in Korea. With this system, we evaluated its water treatment efficiency and effectiveness of blending the aerated water and RO permeate for improved waterworks in rural areas.Methods : The removal rate of major pollutants and other ionic substances was evaluated by analyzing the water quality of raw water and unit processes. In addition, the operational efficiency of a small-scale water supply facility was verified and optimized by evaluating a change in operational characteristics depending on the blending ratio of the treated waters by aeration and CCRO processes.Results and Discussion : Up to 86% of the radon contained in raw water was removed by the aeration process within 2 hours, and 98.9% of uranium, 85.5% of nitrate nitrogen, and 82.8% of fluoride were removed by the RO process. In the case of other ionic substances, more than 80% was removed on average by the RO process. The higher blending ratio of RO permeate up to 75% resulted in the better quality of the final treated water. However, since requiring the high flux and pressure (at 1.8 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/hr and 7.6 bar, respectively), CCRO operation resulted in a relatively high specific power consumption at 0.27 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.Conclusion : In this study, we found that the major contaminants (natural radioactive substances, nitrate nitrogen, and fluoride) were effectively removed by the water treatment system wherein the aeration and CCRO processes were combined. In particular, it was confirmed for the first time in Korea that the stable operation and water treatment efficiency of the CCRO process was satisfactory for commercial purposes. It could produce high-quality tap water through the blending of waters treated by aeration and CCRO, expecting that meeting drinking-water quality standards would be attainable even when raw water contains high-concentration pollutants.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most common ways to reduce vibration in aircraft engines is the use of damping devices. Squeeze-film dampers are the dampers most widely used in aircraft engine designs. The efficiency of squeeze-film dampers is determined by their damping capacity which depends, among other parameters, on the static pressure of oil supply to the damper. This article proposes a method for calculating the static pressure in the feed groove of a hydrodynamic damper depending on the geometric size of the end gap and the value of the lubricant supply pressure. The parameters influencing the static pressure in the damper end gap are determined. Calculations are performed for different values of a hydrodynamic damper end gap, the number and diameter of the supply ports. All calculations presented in the article were performed for a short squeeze-film damper with end gaps and throttles. For comparison of parameters, the dynamic pressure was also calculated for a long squeeze-film damper. It was shown that the size of the end gap has the strongest impact on the pressure in the groove of a squeeze-film damper. It was also shown that the dynamic pressure in the gap may be significantly higher than the static pressure of supply, and failure of the lubricating film may result. In addition, it was also shown that the size of the damper end clearance affects the lubricant flow through the damper.</jats:p>"

It can also help in monitoring their real‐time conditions such as location, speed of moments, and temperature. Presently most of the supply chain management systems are not effective due to their inefficient tracking of real‐time shipments, long delays in shipments and lost identification on a real‐time basis, and uneconomical storage of goods. To solve these problems, an IoT‐based secure and sustainable smart supply chain system using sensor networks is proposed that provides real‐time shipment tracking, storage, delay, and lost identification. Threshold‐based weighted probability formula is devised by considering the average distance and node spacing of sensor nodes, total network energy, residual, and maximum energy parameters to alleviate the hot spot problem. Additionally, the communication signals are transmitted in compression form with end‐to‐end encryption that reduces the use of bandwidth by decreasing the signal size. The percentage increment in the stability and the network lifespan of the proposed method is 35.19% and 7.23% &amp; 119.33% and 71.72% as compared to the T. Senthil et al method and S.

Accuracy and effectiveness of model prediction play a decisive role in it. In this paper, the certainty coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute deviation (MAE) and Nash-Suthcliffe coefficient (NSE) are used to consider the effect of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Xin'anjiang (XAJ) model on the inflow prediction of Jinxi Reservoir. Results indicate that the certainty coefficient of XAJ model is 90.95% and SWAT model is 84.98%. The NSE of SWAT model is 84.42% and the NSE of XAJ model is 82.33% in which the NSE of the SWAT model is superior to the XAJ model. In view of this, based on the two hydrological models results, Bayes Model Averaging (BMA) method is used to study the inflow combination forecast. The SWAT-XAJ coupling model based on BMA method is proposed. During the calibration period and the verification period, compared with single model, the maximum increment of the deterministic coefficient of BMA is 2.87%, the maximum decrement of RMSE is 82.00, and the maximum increment of NSE is 6.80%. This shows that the new model can effectively overcome the shortcomings of single hydrological model and give full play to the advantages of different forecasting models.</jats:p>",

FAS have to function properly under different operating conditions associated with their operation, as well as power supply and information inflow. Due to their functions, i.e., ensuring the safety of people, vehicles, logistics bases, airports, etc., FAS have to exhibit an appropriately organized reliability structure associated with their implementation and power supply. Operational studies involving FAS operated in various facilities were conducted to this end. The authors determined damage and recovery time intensities. FAS reliability indicators were also determined. The article presents graphs associated with developing the energy balance for selected FAS. The graphs are consistent with the latest and applicable legal regulations. The next stage of the work related to this article was developing an FAS operation process model and conducting computer simulations in order to determine reliability indicators. Such an approach to the FAS operation process enables a rational selection of technical and organizational solutions aimed at guaranteeing reliability in the course of executing operational tasks associated with ensuring fire safety. FAS operational analysis, developing balance graphs and models, as well as the computer simulation, enabled inferring conclusions that might be useful to the process of engineering and operating such systems.</jats:p>"

While a lot of investment is spent on establishing new water supply projects, little attention is paid to the functioning of these systems, leading to the abandonment of most projects due to pump failures. The purpose of the study was to assess the operational situation of water pumps and develop an appropriate application for early faults detection to foster prompt remedial actions. A site visit and online survey with questionnaires were performed to collect information on water pump problems in 13 regions in Tanzania. The study revealed that 82% of pumps face excessive power consumption, 53% fail due to broken seals, 41% encounter no or low flow, 35% have no or low pressure and 24% produce excessive noise or vibration. The Pump Diagnosis Tool (PDP) application is developed to provide rapid insight into the condition and state of the pumping system and the required measures to address the problem. The PDT has the potential to detect and diagnose pump problems in a timely manner to avoid total failure which is potentially the major driver behind water supply work breakdowns.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply chain management plays a crucial role in delivering products from a supplier, through the manufacturer, distributors, and retailers to the targeted customers. The lifecycle of the products can be ended at any stage due to imperfect quality or waste, which are typically not managed well for a good price. This product’s life can be extended and increased with the use of the circular economy for the value addition processes which turn the waste into byproducts, which can be sold with maximum profit. The automobile industry is associated with various other small industries and is very significant for the economy at the local, national, and international levels. However, the industry also requires sustainable development in its supply chain management, gained by introducing the circular economy concept to manage and reduce the generated waste. The consumption of carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRCs) in the manufacturing of numerous automotive parts has acquired immense attention this decade, but the process also generates imperfect products (waste). The proposed model is based on a mathematical formulation to manage imperfect production by reworking and recycling, where the former is required to re-add value to the proportion of the rejected parts, and the latter is to recycle the remaining scrap into useful products by using a circular economy. The outsourcing operation is also added to provide an optimal level of inventory and lot sizing for minimizing the total cost of the supply chain management. Data from the automobile part industry are tested to provide the practical implications of the proposed SCM mathematical model. Sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the significance level of the individual parameters affecting the objective function, i.e., the total cost of the SCM. The results show a meaningful insight for the managers to obtain the benefits of the circular economy in multi-stage automobile part production for sustainable and resilient supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Entire EOL tyres infilled with compacted soil can form segmental tyre encased soil elements (TESEs) with considerable load-bearing capacity. The TESEs can be used to construct structures like low-rise buildings, railway foundations and geotechnical structures. One of the most important aspects of TESE systems, i.e., the shearing interaction between neighbouring units is not yet well understood. In this study, thirty-six laboratory tests have been conducted to investigate the response of TESEs under intercourse shear actions. This was followed by a supply chain environment and economic analysis to investigate the acceptability of the system. The results revealed that the type of encased soil had more effect on the interface interactions between courses of TESEs compared to the TESEs’ construction pattern. It was also found that the frictional coefficient could be increased by either using coarse and angular aggregates as the encased soil or reducing the amount of the encased soil to form a high portion of rubber-to-rubber contact at the composite interface. Supply chain environment and economic analysis revealed that using entire tyres as construction materials has low CO2 emission and considerable economic benefits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study focuses on the impact of a supply chain manufacturer’s fairness concern and risk aversion on the green supply chain and constructs a two-level green supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer. It compares three models: the manufacturer is a risk-neutral and fair-neutral, the manufacturer is a risk-averse and fair-neutral, and the manufacturer is a risk-averse and fair-concerned decision maker. In three cases, this paper examines how the manufacturer’s risk aversion and fairness concerns the impact product green level, retail price, and the wholesale price in the green supply chain. Consumers are sensitive to pricing strategies and product green level. The results are as follows: the manufacturer’s risk aversion leads to an increase in the retailer’s profit, and the manufacturer’s profit decreases with the increase in the risk aversion coefficient. Second, when demand meets certain conditions and the manufacturer has advantageous fairness concerns, the manufacturer benefits from fairness concerns, the retailer’s profit decreases with the manufacturer’s fairness concerns coefficient, and the manufacturer’s risk aversion will lead to a decline in the product green level. Third, when the manufacturer believes that the risk is relatively large, they reduce the technology investment of green products; thus, the fairness concerns of the manufacturer will affect the investment of green products and increase the green level of products. For enterprises: When supply chain members face various risks, they need to consider the specific needs of consumers and other members’ behavioral preferences. They can put forward a more scientific prediction of market demand and rational decision making. For customers: they should not only pay attention to changes in market prices, but should also pay attention to changes in the behavioral preferences of supply chain members, as customers are in line with their own interests based on the choice of high-quality green production.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Funneliformis mosseae in lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Salinas) cultivated in a soilless system with sub-optimal phosphorus (P) compared with non-inoculated controls at two different P concentrations. Results show that lettuce inoculation with the selected AMF can improve the growth and the nutritional quality of lettuce even at sub-optimal P. Leaf content of chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phenols, known as important bioactive compounds for human health, was higher in mycorrhizal lettuce plants compared with non-mycorrhizal plants. The antioxidant capacity in AMF plants showed higher values compared with control plants grown at optimal P nutrition level. Moreover, leaf gas exchanges were higher in inoculated plants than in non-inoculated ones. Nitrogen, P, and magnesium leaf content was significantly higher in mycorrhizal plants compared with non-mycorrhizal plants grown with the same P level. These findings suggest that F. mosseae can stimulate plants growth, improving the nutritional quality of lettuce leaves even when grown with sub-optimal P concentration.</jats:p>"

The term “blanket” approach FMEA describes a comprehensive simultaneous look at the variety of interrelated factors that may directly and indirectly affect patient safety. Applying FMEA with the “blanket” approach is not common, due to FMEA’s limitations. Algorithmic prediction of failure modes in health care (APFMH) is leaner and enables the application of the “blanket” approach, but, like FMEA, it lacks formal validation. The authors set out to validate the APFMH method while applying a “blanket” approach. They analyzed the sterile supply handling at a 1900-bed academic medical center. The study’s first step took place in the operating room (OR) aspect of the process. An APFMH analysis was performed using the “blanket” approach, to identify the hazards and define the common root causes for predicted hazards. The second step took place a year later at the sterile supply and equipment department (SSED) and aimed to validate these root causes, thus validating the reliability of APFMH. The “blanket” approach analysis with the APFMH method consisted of categorization into 3 risk-dimensions: patient safety, equipment damage, and time management. Root causes were defined for 8 high-ranking hazards. All the root causes for failures, identified by APFMH at the OR department, were revealed as actual hazards in the processes of the SSED. The independent findings at the SSED level validated the list of identified hazards that was formed at the target department (ie, the OR). APFMH methodology is a lean in time and human resources process that ensures comprehensive hazard analysis, which can include the “blanket” approach, and which was validated in this study. The authors suggest using the APFMH methodology for any organizational analysis method that requires the inclusion of “blanket” approaches.</jats:p>"

Six statistical metrics including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean error (ME), Willmott's score (WS), Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) are implemented for quantitatively assessing the agreement between estimated and observed water levels at 12 locations of interest within the system in the period from 2000 to 2021 (with an interval time of 6 hours). The results showed that MLR and LSTM models can be used for evaluating water levels with high accuracy. The values of dimensional statistical errors equal only about 6% of the maximum water level monitoring at the locations of interest for both MLR and LSTM models. The values of dimensionless statistical errors range from 0.76 to 0.99 for all 12 locations of interest in the studied system.

New state borders (previously internal) prevented the export and transit of products to \"third countries\". The purpose of the study is to characterize the export of certain types of products in the post-Soviet space by country in dynamics from 1995 to 2020. The data was from UNCTAD. We used the principles of a systematic approach, in particular historical, analytical, mathematical-statistical and cartographic research methods. Russia remains the main supplier of mineral resources to the republics of the former Soviet Union, but its role in the foreign trade of the republics as a whole is declining. Exports began to consist mainly of exports of raw materials. Goods from the countries of the former USSR are exported mainly to the Asian market. Trade between countries is affected not only by geographical factors - it is easier to trade with neighbors, but also by other factors, including the ability to transport products around the world. Therefore, the spatial diversification of exports of steel, mineral fertilizers, and grain is higher than that of oil and natural gas, which are traded mainly through pre-laid pipelines. Interstate territorial disputes that have grown since the collapse of the USSR are harmful to economic cooperation. Difficulties arise in relations between such republics of the former Soviet Union as Russia and Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan. In Soviet times, there was close cooperation between them, but now it is broken. This hinders the economic development of these countries.</jats:p>"

The two retailers are involved in Cournot competition and purchase one single product only from the supplier in the same supply chain. The two suppliers are heterogenous in the production cost. In addition, both retailers are in short of capital, hence both of them need to raise bank loans. All players are risk neutral and their objectives are to maximize their own profit. Based on these features, we establish an analytical model and characterize each player’s optimal decision. Compared to the benchmark model when both retailers have sufficient capital, we find that, in optimal, each supplier provides a lower wholesale price to its own retailer. Moreover, when one of the supplier’s cost is small enough, the corresponding supply chain’s competitive advantage is amplified by the financial cost (i.e., loan interest), generating a larger selling quantity to the market. Therefore, the supply chain achieves a higher profit than the benchmark case, while the other supply chain is worse off. However, if the difference of the two suppliers’ costs is not that significant, all players in the two supply chains would be worse off. Moreover, the numerical experiment further shows that when each supplier’s cost is low enough, both retailers can be better off even if they are capital-constrained. Our results provide useful insights into the supply chain competition when retailers use bank loans to finance their operations.</jats:p>",

To solve this question, we asked whether neuronal fueling by glucose or lactate scales differently upon increasing neural computation and cognitive loads. Here, using electrophysiology, two-photon imaging, cognitive tasks, and mathematical modeling, we show that both glucose and lactate are involved in engram formation, with lactate supporting long-term synaptic plasticity evoked by high-stimulation load activity patterns and high attentional load in cognitive tasks and glucose being sufficient for less demanding neural computation and learning tasks. Indeed, we show that lactate is mandatory for demanding neural computation, such as theta-burst stimulation, while glucose is sufficient for lighter forms of activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP), such as spike timing–dependent plasticity (STDP). We find that subtle variations of spike number or frequency in STDP are sufficient to shift the on-demand fueling from glucose to lactate. Finally, we demonstrate that lactate is necessary for a cognitive task requiring high attentional load, such as the object-in-place task, and for the corresponding in vivo hippocampal LTP expression but is not needed for a less demanding task, such as a simple novel object recognition. Overall, these results demonstrate that glucose and lactate metabolism are differentially engaged in neuronal fueling depending on the complexity of the activity-dependent plasticity and behavior.</jats:p>",

This study contributes to the literature through a comprehensive impact analysis of the effects of COVID-19 on both the demand and supply of beef in Latin America and thus provides valuable information for two of the most important links of the beef value chain. Robust econometric methods and a graphic analysis were used that give solidity to the investigation. The analysis used a data panel of supply and demand variables between 2018 and 2022 derived from the US Department of Agriculture. The results suggest that the beef market was strongly affected by the pandemic related health emergency, presenting decreases in both consumption and production. These effects are transitory, however, since the analysis of the post-pandemic data revealed that consumption and production return to normal and seem to grow until smoothing out over time.</jats:p>"

The business environment among SMEs is marked by fierce rivalry, quick change, and tremendous instability. While an agile supply chain is seen as a winning option for manufacturing SMEs, a transformational leadership style of the CEO can be a source of competitive advantage to improve their performance. Thus, an attempt has been made to integrate transformational leadership and supply chain agility elements and delineate their structural relationship using the total interpretive structural modeling method. Results indicate that transformational leaders drive agile initiatives in the supply chain by setting and communicating a vision, encouraging supply chain members to think of innovative solutions for problems, and mentoring them individually to achieve high-performance standards. These practices will make the team members put in extra effort to accomplish the task, thereby establishing a committed and flexible workforce. Conclusions are drawn, and implications are discussed for enhancing firm performance.</jats:p>",

A common aid to this approach is the digital configurator, a software platform that allows for users to explore options with predefined constraints such as kits-of-parts. This paper argues that this approach has fundamental limitations, in particular that (1) configurators are developed as standalone products to context-specific problems and that (2) current implementations lack a capability for downstream and upstream flows of information between design and construction processes of a building. This research proposes an open-source Common Configurator Framework that institutes a separation between the authoring of objects for the design processes and rules applied in the verification processes; a consequent standardisation and reuse of sets of parts (objects) and sets of rules (specifications) is demonstrated. Additionally, this work formalises the decoupling of the downstream part verification process and the upstream design requirements definition, so that a Common Specification-driven design and manufacturing process becomes possible. The work is supported by a reference implementation based on the proposed Framework with a series of case studies, prototypical configurators and examples of verification/validation of pre-existing kits of parts against pre-authored specifications.</jats:p>",

Second, a multi‐objective programming model is established, and an optimal solution is found by the genetic algorithm. It is concluded that the enterprise should allocate the appropriate amount of funds to obtain the optimal financing effect; to obtain the maximum financing benefit, the optimal strategy should be 65.2% of the supply chain finance capital.

Second, the specificities of strategies and practices that distinguish this topic in emerging economies are discussed and the drivers and barriers are identified with respect to sources of institutional pressure. Third, a research framework for FGSCM in emerging economies is developed and 12 gaps for future research are identified.

Найбільш перспективними паливами, що дозволяють одночасно знизити і вартість перевезень і кількість шкідливих викидів, є газові палива (ГП) різного походження. Застосування природного газу дозволяє істотно скоротити кількість шкідливих викидів в порівнянні з паливами нафтового походження - повністю виключити викиди сірки, кардинально (на 90%) знизити викиди оксидів азоту (NOх) і істотно (на 30%) знизити викиди твердих частинок і діоксиду вуглецю (CO2 ). Відсутність зольності призводить до поліпшення умов змащення і підвищенню терміну служби циркуляційного масла. В результаті ресурс двигунів, що працюють на газі, може бути збільшений в 1,3...1,5 рази, та у стільки ж разів знижені витрати на обслуговування і ремонт. Основна маса суднових двигунів створюється сьогодні двопаливними (dual-fuel (DF)), тобто здатними працювати на газовому, рідкому паливі або на обох паливах відразу в різних пропорціях.</jats:p>",

This paper analyzed changes in Chinese pork imports following the outbreaks of African Swine Fever (ASF) and COVID-19 between January 2017 to November 2020 and evaluated the impact of imported pork on the development of the swine industry in China. The results demonstrated that the shortage of domestic pork supply changed the import volume. ASF transformed imported pork from a complementary product to meet the diversified needs of domestic consumers into a critical substitute required to fill the supply gap. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the substitution effect of imported pork decreased. ASF, has caused the supply capacity of pork in China to decrease, the price of pork to increase, leading to increased pork import in January 2019. At the end of 2019, pig slaughter decreased, while China cut tariffs on imported pork. The COVID-19 outbreak did not reduce China's pork imports in China, which declined after the global COVID-19 outbreak. Imported pork has made up for the supply gap during COVID-19, not impacting the level of production of the swine industry in China.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to assess the response to agronomic management, including water and nitrogen supply, of crop physiological and agronomic traits in relation to water use efficiency and grain protein composition. Two varieties, Pascià and Sultano, were grown at two different sites in South Italy under rainfed and irrigated conditions, with and without starter nitrogen fertilization. Crop physiological assessment was carried out by hyperspectral phenotyping at flowering and during grain filling. Increases in grain yield and grain size in relation to water supply were observed for water use up to about 400 mm. Water use efficiency increased under starter nitrogen fertilization, and Pascià showed the highest values (4.8 kg mm−1). The highest correlations of the vegetation indexes with the agronomic traits were observed in the later growth stage, especially for the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI); furthermore, grain filling rate showed a strong relationship with photochemical reflectance index (PRI). Experimental factors mainly influenced protein composition rather than protein content. In particular, the 7s vicilin protein fraction showed a negative correlation with grain yield and water use, while lectin showed an opposite response. Both fractions are of interest for consumer’s health because of their allergenic and antinutritional properties, respectively. Data from spectral phenotyping will be useful for digital farming applications, in order to assess crop physiological status in modern agricultural systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The hydropower industry is a crucial catalyst for improving the National Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAPs) and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in line with the Renewable Energy Directive of the European Union. Hydropower has been described as one of the most scalable electricity generations, enabling the incorporation of variable production for wind and solar energy systems. Nonetheless, despite ensuring that hydropower production securely matches demand in the real-time market, uncertainty about investment cost and concession rights continue to impede the achievement of the goal. The study used the supply and demand functions to analyse the market hydropower energy industry in the EU from 1990-2018. The research employed two-stage least square (2SLS) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for the analyses. The outcomes of the supply side indicated that an increase in input resource (precipitation) and hydropower price are essential factors influencing the growth in hydropower supply in the EU region. By contrast, the result reveals that a rise in input cost discourages more hydropower energy production in the EU. As for the demand side, statistical findings have shown that income is directly associated with the demand for hydropower. Whereas an increase in the price of hydropower energy causes reductions in demand. More importantly, we find solar energy to be a substitute for hydropower in the EU region. The results of the forecasted hydropower market demonstrate that supply would be enough to cater to hydropower consumption in the European Union region until 2030. A typical pumped-hydro for supply-push is needed for managing prices during off and peak load situations. There is also a need to streamline the variable cost of topology and geography when constructing a Dam. This study recommends that the EU expand and make hydropower transmission from the grid a national project to be easily accessible for consumption.</jats:p>",

But, ginger required a long period to cultivate. It makes farmer’s interest in cultivating ginger decrease and ginger production continues to decline every year. Aside from that, ginger certified seeds are also limited. Meanwhile, demand for ginger continues to rise. To meet these demands, an effective and efficient supply chain management is needed. One of the largest ginger productions in West Java is located on Cianjur. So the purpose of this research is to determine an efficient ginger supply chain of farming sustainability in Cianjur. The method used is descriptive analysis use framework of the Asian Productivity Organization (APO). Then develop it as a strategy use SWOT-AHP method. The results showed ginger supply chain’s members in Cianjur consisted of farmers, collectors, wholesale market, local market, and consumers. Ginger supply chain management in Cianjur isn’t effective because there are still some obstacles in each member. The strategy chosen is to improve productivity and product quality for a better supply chain. There is also a need for mutual awareness between each chain in increasing the productivity and quality of ginger so that producers are more enthusiastic about cultivating ginger in the future. So that farming activities remain sustainable.</jats:p>",

Contrary to literature reports, neither selenate nor nano-Se showed a beneficial effect on essential oil accumulation; the oil yield did not differ between the selenate treated and control plants but was halved by the nano-Se application. Extremely high variations in the number of essential oil components, as well as in the eucalyptol, artemisia ketone, camphor and germacrene D ratio in the 2021 and 2022 experiments were recorded. The analysis of the 2016–2022 data for oil yield and composition in the control plants revealed a direct correlation between the number of components and of solar flares, and a negative correlation between oil yield and the percentage of spotless days. Both control plants and plants fortified with selenium showed higher levels of germacrene D and lower levels of artemisia ketone in 2022, characterized by more remarkable solar activity compared to 2021. Nano-Se supply resulted in the highest percentage of germacrene D accumulation.

During our review, we learned that the entire world is working to stop the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. We explore ways that may lower the danger of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and useful strategies to avoid the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 spreading through food. While hygienic protocols are required in the food supply sector, cleaning, disinfection, and the avoidance of cross-contamination across food categories and other related goods at different stages of the manufacturing process remain especially important because the virus can survive for long periods of time on inert materials such as food packaging. Furthermore, personal hygiene (regular washing and disinfection), wearing gloves and using masks, garments, and footwear dedicated to maintaining hygiene provide on-site safety for food sector personnel, supply chain intermediaries, and consumers. Restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic (e.g., closure of physical workplaces, canteens, cafes, restaurants, schools, and childcare institutions), changes in household grocery shopping frequency, individuals' perceived risk of COVID-19, income losses due to the pandemic, and sociodemographic factors are among the factors. The conclusions drawn from this study consider the implications of healthy diets, food system resilience, behavior change, and nutritional imbalance for policymakers and food supply chain participants, as well as the antimicrobial effects of vitamins and nutrients. During a public health crisis, people should eat less, necessitating preventive policies and nutritional advice to deal with this.</jats:p>"

There is a lack of specific methods to assess the power of their subsequent attributes. This paper identifies 12 unique challenges related to the implementation of LARG practices under the context of AFSC. The identification of challenges and the interdependency relationships among the LARG challenges are developed using a multistage approach. The multistage approach is composed of the generalized interval‐valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GIVTFNs), the degree of similarity method, and the decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The finding of the study indicates that “Lack of understanding between the customer and other stakeholder requirements” and “Lack of transparency and trust” are the most significant challenges in the cause group and are the driving elements for implementing LARG practices. Furthermore, “Lack of competitive advantages” and “Lack of monitoring and auditing the ongoing supply chain activities” fall under the effect category, which are influenced by the cause groups' challenges. The identified challenges can be controlled and handled strategically on a priority basis for successfully implementing LARG practices in the agri‐food industry. The finding of study will help practitioners to overcome the LARG challenges and to improve the overall performance of AFSC.</jats:p>",

Most studies in sub-Saharan Africa point to the lack of knowledge as one of the mitigating factors against its development. However, there is a dearth of studies assessing the level of knowledge of stakeholders.

Unlike other studies, the supply chain is modelled as a closed-loop system, in which returning the products is incorporated into classical supply chain models and the full backorder is permitted. Among the most important research questions is the order amount of chain members to maximize Retailer delays and the profit chains. The study determines the portion of the time interval in which inventory system experiences shortage and determines the optimal replenishment time and the frequency. Ultimately, it was shown that, if the delay from the supplier to the retailer increases, the chain profit also increases. For all three proposed models, a closed-form solution is developed and a solution algorithm is presented. Applying the coordinated model considerably increases the total profit earned by the whole SC as well as all SC members. An example of our model is a bottle supplier for the drink producer. Another example is military oriented. Furthermore, the study elaborates the feasibility of the suggested models by means of some numerical examples and discusses the results using sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>",

Phenolics identification was operated using HPLC-MSn for both compartments revealing an unbalanced repartition. Peels had a richer and more complex profile, counting xanthone glycoside (mangiferin), flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol) and majorly gallotannins. Pulps presented smaller amounts of phenolics and a simpler profile majorly represented by gallotannins and gallic acid derivatives. During fruit ripening, the phenolic contents decreased in both compartments, but faster in the pulp. This behavior can be attributed to the oxidative stress observed in mango pulp during ripening. Cutting down the water supply during the fruit growth triggered an increase in phenolic contents of both the peels and pulp of mango fruits. This increase affected all compounds. Cold storage at 12 or 7 °C led to an increase in mangiferin and flavonoids contents in the fruit peel, interpreted as a stress-response reaction.</jats:p>"

A more practical model of optimal ordering strategy is proposed, considering supply reliability, demand uncertainty, risk aversion, and retailer wealth, in which two random variables, supply reliability factors and demand, are introduced into the retailer’s function of expected utility. To avoid nonconvergence at both ends, the demand follows a triangular rather than a normal distribution. It is found that the optimal order quantity will increase with the improvement of supply reliability when the risk-averse degree is fixed. The results also show that the optimal order quantity of risk-averse retailers is smaller than that of risk-neutral retailers. Additionally, the optimal order quantity for the risk-averse retailer decreases as the degree of risk aversion increases, when supply reliability is fixed. Further research shows that the retailer is a constant absolute risk aversion (CARA). That means retailer’s wealth has nothing to do with the risk aversion and changes in the retailer’s wealth will not affect the retailer’s optimal order quantity. This study provides valuable insights for sustainable supply chain management and marketing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tacrolimus (FK506) is a macrolide widely used as immunosuppressant to prevent transplant rejection. Synthetic production of FK506 is not efficient and costly, whereas the biosynthesis of FK506 is complex and the level produced by the wild type strain, <jats:italic>Streptomyces tsukubaensis</jats:italic>, is very low. We therefore engineered FK506 biosynthesis and the supply of the precursor L-lysine to generate strains with improved FK506 yield. To increase FK506 production, first the intracellular supply of the essential precursor lysine was improved in the native host <jats:italic>S. tsukubaensis</jats:italic> NRRL 18488 by engineering the lysine biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, a feedback deregulated aspartate kinase AskSt* of <jats:italic>S. tsukubaensis</jats:italic> was generated by site directed mutagenesis. Whereas overexpression of AskSt* resulted only in a 17% increase in FK506 yield, heterologous overexpression of a feedback deregulated AskCg* from <jats:italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</jats:italic> was proven to be more efficient. Combined overexpression of AskCg* and DapASt, showed a strong enhancement of the intracellular lysine pool following increase in the yield by approximately 73% compared to the wild type. Lysine is coverted into the FK506 building block pipecolate by the lysine cyclodeaminase FkbL. Construction of a <jats:italic>∆fkbL</jats:italic> mutant led to a complete abolishment of the FK506 production, confirming the indispensability of this enzyme for FK506 production. Chemical complementation of the <jats:italic>∆fkbL</jats:italic> mutant by feeding pipecolic acid and genetic complementation with <jats:italic>fkbL</jats:italic> as well as with other lysine cyclodeaminase genes (<jats:italic>pipAf, pipASt</jats:italic>, originating from <jats:italic>Actinoplanes friuliensis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Streptomyces pristinaespiralis</jats:italic>, respectively) completely restored FK506 production. Subsequently, FK506 production was enchanced by heterologous overexpression of PipAf and PipASp in <jats:italic>S. tsukubaensis</jats:italic>. This resulted in a yield increase by 65% compared to the WT in the presence of PipAf from <jats:italic>A. friuliensis</jats:italic>. For further rational yield improvement, the crystal structure of PipAf from <jats:italic>A. friuliensis</jats:italic> was determined at 1.3 Å resolution with the cofactor NADH bound and at 1.4 Å with its substrate lysine. Based on the structure the Ile91 residue was replaced by Val91 in PipAf, which resulted in an overall increase of FK506 production by approx. 100% compared to the WT.</jats:p>"

Using design science research as methodological research strategy, this study presents and analyses a blockchain framework and its development processes. The framework performance was evaluated through its potential to generate organizational knowledge and its impact on the current management context. The challenges of the proposed system are the integration of Hyperledger systems, the development of channels and the layout of the supply chain within the blockchain, as well as the addition and control of members within the network.

The focus was on the comparison of three classical indices WQINSF (National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index), WQICCME (Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index) and WQIAP (weighted arithmetical Water Quality Index), the development of a new index and the prediction by ANN (artificial neural network) of WQI indices. The principal components analysis (PCA) allows the selection of 10 parameters to be used in the calculation of the classical WQI, and eight principal components to be used as input for the new proposed index (regularized WQI). However the ANN is applied for the search for prediction models of classical WQI and developed WQI. The results show that the WQIAP index assesses water quality better, and that the regularized WQI further promotes the assessment of water quality. WQIR shows that, after the pollution peak, the water quality does not return to its initial state. The modeling approach by ANN offers an effective alternative to predict the WQI, it subsequently appears that the ANN predicts the new index WQIRregularized (R2 = 0.999) better than the classic model WQIAP (R2 = 0.99).</jats:p>",

Therefore, building a sound and stable supply chain of agricultural products has important practical and theoretical significance for improving the level of economic and trade cooperation of countries along the “Belt and Road” and promoting China’s high-quality economic development. The results show that the trend line of agricultural product trade supply chain performance between China and Central Asia shows a significant downward trend (non-Data Envelopment Analysis efficiency still accounts for a large proportion, and the comprehensive benefits are affected by economies of scale, which is mainly related to the economic conditions of Central Asian countries). The influencing factors of each dimension have significant positive effects on the performance of the agricultural trade supply chain between China and Central Asia to varying degrees and can maximize the performance of China’s Central Asian agricultural trade supply chain through the influencing factors of each dimension of Central Asian countries within the optimal promotion interval. This study recommends improving the information processing efficiency of both parties, predicting market demand, and shortening relevant payment and trade links to improve the efficiency of logistics and transportation between China and Central Asian countries.

The relationships between three urbanization indicators, gross domestic production (GDP), population density (PD), and artificial land proportion (ALP), as well as ESDRs of ESs were investigated using Pearson Correlation analysis across three major functional areas. The sensitivity of ESDRs to urbanization was further evaluated using the Random Forest model. The results showed that the supply of carbon fixation, water provision, and food provision increased, whereas their demands far exceeded their supplies, resulting in an increased imbalance between ES supply and demand. With the exception of soil conservation, significantly negative relationships were observed between urbanization indicators and the other three ES supply–demand budgets. The ESDRs of water provision, carbon fixation, and food provision were the most sensitive variables that depended on the population density (PD) in almost all functional areas, whereas the ESDR of carbon fixation exhibited the highest sensitivity to GDP in developed urban areas and rural areas within the preferred development area (PDA) and key development area (KDA).

A questionnaire was developed, research data were gathered from businesses in the agricultural SSC in western China, and an empirical study was carried out by using the AMOS multivariate statistical analysis approach after a thorough review of the literature in recent years. The study demonstrates that the OC model has a considerable impact on service innovation, SSC collaboration has an intermediary effect, and the quality of supply chain (SC) relationships has a regulation effect in the model. The results inspire academics and industry professionals to focus on SSC collaboration, improve the OC model’s administration, and promote service innovation in agricultural SC. Finally, the paper proposes suggestions to promote agricultural product development in western China in terms of enhancing SSC collaboration, OC model, and service innovation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For a long time, the transference of land-contracting management rights was hindered by the unwillingness of farmers and inefficient use of farmland. The endowment effect is prevalent for farmers and is the main reason for the inhibited flow of farmland. However, recent studies have evaluated the endowment effect by treating buyers and sellers as one subject, which cannot be applied to individual land transfer transactions. Therefore, this paper redefines the endowment effect of farmland management rights by introducing market price as a reference point to evaluate the level of the supply- and demand-side endowment effects. The supply-side endowment effect is the gap between sellers’ willingness to accept and the market rent; the demand-side endowment effect is the gap between the market rent and buyers’ willingness to pay. In the empirical study, two multiple regression models are designed to measure the respective factors affecting the supply and demand sides, employing farm household survey data in Shaanxi Province. The obtained results reveal that the agricultural land transfer in Shaanxi Province is at a normal proportional level, and the supply- and demand-side endowment effects in agricultural land transfer are prevalent. The dependence of people on goods and the substitutability of the goods significantly affect the endowment effect of supply-side farmers, while the perception of expected income, cost and risk impact the endowment effect of demand-side farmers. Based on this, some policy recommendations are proposed to offset the influence of the endowment effect, thus promoting the development of the farmland transfer market.</jats:p>"

However, water rights trading generally results in an externality loss for the seller. The scientific compensation of water rights trading should be considered from the aspects of economy, society and eco-environment. In this study, we quantified the water rights trading compensation along the route from economic, social, and environmental aspects, using a method based on emergy theory. Taking Pingdingshan-Xinmi water rights trading as an example, the eco-economic compensation of Pingdingshan was quantified and analyzed. The results showed that the impact of water rights trading on Pingdingshan was mainly social and ecological in the short term, and the average social and ecological compensation was 0.027 ¥/m3 and 0.32 ¥/m3 respectively. As the economic loss caused by water shortage becomes more prominent in the long term, the social, ecological and economic compensation were shown to be 0.028 ¥/m3, 0.30 ¥/m3 and 4.55 ¥/m3 respectively in 2030. The economic impact of water rights trading on the water seller will become more and more obvious, and reasonable compensation is the key to the sustainable development of the water market.</jats:p>",

Also, by measuring changes in the trade structure and competitiveness between Korea, China and Japan during the same period, the effect on the changes in the supply chain between the three countries is examined.\r\nResearch design, data, and methodology: This study analyzes the trade structure, export competitiveness, and supply and distribution structure of 10 manufacturing industries in Korea, China and Japan. The analysis period was set from 2000 to 2020. The statistics use the UN Comtrade and the Asian International Input-Output Table. In the analysis of the trade structure between Korea, China and Japan. The Revealed Symmetric Comparative Advantage (RSCA) index was introduced to analyze the trade structure between Korea, China and Japan. And for the supply chain structure between the three countries, the Leontief inverse multiplier decomposition of the International Input-Output Analysis was used.\r\nResults: As a result of the analysis, it was observed that the supply chain of the manufacturing industry between Korea, China and Japan has changed to an interdependent structure since 2010, and the reason for this is that the production technology gap between the three countries has been greatly reduced. Accordingly, the supply chain of the manufacturing industry between the three countries has shifted from the past one-way dependence structure to a two-way dependence structure. In terms of industry, the deepening dependence among the three countries centered on electrical/electromechanical machinery, metal products, general machinery, chemical products, transportation machinery, precision machinery and textile products, which are key export industries for both Korea, China and Japan, means that the supply and distribution structure is being strengthened.\r\nImplications: Considering the relationship between the supply chain between Korea, China and Japan from 2000 to 2020, institutional integration, such as the trilateral FTA, is delayed, but functional integration is deepening due to interdependence and complementarity and increased production and trade. However, if trade frictions or disputes between Korea, China and Japan occur between specific countries, it is interpreted that this can lead to negative effects, so-called big losses, not only for the country concerned but also for the other country.</jats:p>",

In an attempt to extend its shelf life and maintain its quality while retaining its antioxidant potential, the harvested fruits of strawberry cv. Chandler were dipped in 30% eucalyptus leaf extract (ELE). Weight loss, fungal decay index, percentage of decayed fruits, respiration rate, and electrolyte leakage were all reduced in ELE-treated strawberries. The enzymatic activities of catalase in fruits increased initially until the fifth day of storage but then started to decline during the later period while superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities continued to rise until the 10th day and then declined. With higher contents of total phenolics, ascorbic acid, total antioxidants, and anthocyanin, the application of ELE maintained the general acceptance, firmness, flavor, and marketable fruit percentage. Titrable acidity (TA) and sugar–acid ratio (SAR) were also significantly affected by ELE application. A declining trend was observed in TA during storage, along with an increase in SAR. The pH and soluble solid contents of strawberry juice were not significantly changed by the application of ELE; however, both attribute scores were greater than those for the control. In conclusion, ELE could be used as an environmentally safe method to postpone senescence and maintain postharvest quality for up to 15 days.</jats:p>"

Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect primary data. Data were analysed using SPSSv22, while mediation was tested using Analysis of Moments Structure (AMOS) v22 software. Accountability was found to partially mediate the association between managerial competencies and supply chain performance in relief aid organizations in western Uganda. A mediation effect of accountability in the relationship between managerial competencies and supply chain performance was tested.

Наиболее значимыми из них являются расчетные нагрузки по объему потребления воды и отведения сточной жидкости, а также численность населения, которое будет пользоваться этими коммунальными услугами в будущем. По этой причине в СП 31.13330.2021 рекомендуются не конкретные величины, а интервал значений удельных расходов воды, например 165–180 л/(сут·чел.). Какое из них принимать в расчетах – проблема.

Предлагается новый подход к обоснованию параметров систем водоснабжения и водоотведения, основанный на нечетком представлении перспективной численности населения и удельного водопотребления. Этот подход базируется на исследовании области неопределенности путем разбивки ее на интервалы, имеющие весовые функции принадлежности, а также на применении методов теории принятия решения на основе матрицы финансовых рисков.

The most significant of these are the design loads in terms of water consumption and wastewater disposal, as well as the population base that will use these utilities in future years. For this reason, CP 31.13330.2021 recommends not specific values, however, a range of values for specific water consumption, for example, 165–180 l/(day·person). Which one shall be taken into account is the problem. At the same time, designers must understand that the risks that arise in case of overestimation or underestimation of design loads are very high, since in both cases reconstruction will be required involving huge financial investments. A new approach is proposed to substantiate the parameters of water supply and wastewater disposal systems based on a fuzzy representation of the prospective population base and specific water consumption. This approach is based on the study of the area of uncertainty by dividing it into intervals with weighted membership functions, as well as on the application of decision theory methods based on the financial risk matrix. Herewith, the risks are estimated through the life cycle cost under various project implementation scenarios. The developed approach is recommended to be used while substantiating the parameters of prospective water supply and wastewater disposal schemes.</jats:p>",

Por ello, el objetivo de este estudio fue estimar la calidad ecológica en microcuencas con diverso estado de conservación del suelo y que abastecen con agua para su potabilización en la ciudad de Loja al Sur del Ecuador. Para ello, fueron usados diversos índices bióticos, partiendo desde los más comunes como los índices de diversidad, el índice ABI (Andean Biotic Index) basado en el BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party), el EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera y Trichoptera); y el índice de calidad de hábitat SVAP (Stream Visual Assessment Protocol). Los resultados de estos índices ubican a las tres microcuencas que abastecen actualmente de agua (San Simón, El Carmen y Mendieta) con buena calidad; sin embargo, no se deben descuidar sus condiciones de uso, manejo y conservación. Para las dos microcuencas restantes, se estimó una calidad de agua dudosa debido al impacto de ciertas actividades antrópicas que se presentan en ellas. Por esta razón, usar el índice de calidad ecológica (ICE) en cuencas abastecedoras de agua, puede ser muy útil para la gestión integral de cuencas, el ordenamiento territorial, o generar normativa por parte de los gobiernos autónomos descentralizados (GAD) con una visión más holística y prospectiva.</jats:p>"

Для более углубленного понимания природы проявления шоков совокупного спроса и совокупного предложения, авторами изучены предпосылки их формирования в Казахстане, проявившиеся в пандемический 2020 год (в период пика коронакризиса) и в постпандемический 2021 год (в период выхода из кризиса), как следствие процессов, происходящих на глобальных рынках, связанных с перебоями в поставках товаров, сложностями с логистикой и удорожанием услуг транспортировки, а также ростом мировых продовольственных и промышленных цен. Авторами исследованы предпринятые странами мира антикризисные меры в период пандемии, проявившиеся, прежде всего, в ужесточении Центробанками проводимой ими денежно-кредитной политики.

Such shocks primarily affected export-oriented and household consumption-oriented industries, including in the regions of Kazakhstan. For a deeper understanding of the nature of aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks, the authors have studied the prerequisites for their formation in Kazakhstan, which appeared in the pandemic year 2020 (during the peak of the coronavirus crisis) and in the post-pandemic year 2021 (during the crisis recovery), as a consequence of processes occurring in global markets, associated with disruptions in the supply of goods, difficulties with logistics and rising costs of transportation services, as well as rising world food and industrial prices. The authors have studied the anti-crisis measures taken by the countries of the world during the pandemic, manifested primarily in the tightening of monetary policy pursued by central banks. Anti-inflationary measures taken in Kazakhstan aimed at stabilizing monetary and non-monetary factors of inflation have been analyzed. The analysis of regional occurrences of demand and supply shocks in Kazakhstan in 2020 and 2021 has been conducted, and the response of regions to aggregate demand and aggregate supply shocks in these years has been also studied. The relevant conclusions and recommendations on the response of macroeconomic agents, as well as industries and regions of Kazakhstan in the post-pandemic period are made.</jats:p>",

For Yellowstone National Park (YNP), the impacts that global change has already had on the park's capacity to sustain its large migratory herds of wild ungulates is incompletely understood. Here we examine how two understudied components of global change, the historical increase in atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and the spread of nonnative, invasive plant species, may have altered the capacity of YNP to provide forage for ungulates over the last 200‐plus years. We performed two experiments: (1) a growth chamber study that determined the growth rates of important invasive and native YNP grasses that are forages for ungulates under preindustrial (280 ppm) versus modern (410 ppm) CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> levels and (2) a field study that compared the effect of defoliation (clipping) on the shoot growth of invasive and native mesic grassland plants under ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> conditions in 2019. The growth chamber experiment revealed that modern CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased the growth rates of both invasive and native grasses, and invasive grasses grew faster regardless of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> conditions. The field results showed a continuum of positive to negative responses of shoot growth to defoliation, with a subgroup of invasive species responding most positively. Altogether the results indicated that the historical increase in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and the spread of invasive species, some of which were planted to provide forage for ungulates in the early and mid‐1900s, have likely increased the capacity of forage production in YNP. However, rising CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> has also resulted in regional warming and increased aridity in YNP, which will likely reduce grassland productivity. The challenge for global change biologists and park managers is to determine how competing components of global change have already affected and will increasingly affect forage dynamics and the sustainability of Yellowstone's iconic ungulate herds in the Anthropocene.</jats:p>",

However, approaches to large-scale spatial planning of tidal wetland restoration remain sparse. Previous studies on site selection for restoration planning have focused on the potential supply of ecosystem services (ES) or restoration feasibility with less emphasis on the mitigation of the status of regional ES supply and demand mismatches. We developed a five-step workflow based on systematic conservation planning to identify priority areas for tidal wetland restoration and applied it to the coastal reclaimed areas of Shanghai, China. With this workflow, we analyzed the changes in spatial distribution and the potential ecosystem services supply and restoration costs of priority areas between the two different scenarios of ES demand ignored and ES demand considered. Results showed that the potential restorable areas only accounted for 31.4% (425.2 km²) of the original reclaimed area because of other land use demands (e.g., permanent basic farmland conservation). We extracted 50% of the potential restorable areas as priority areas based on Aichi Target 15. Compared with the ES demand-ignored scenario, the ES demand scenario resulted in a substantial increase in the priority areas of Baoshan District (~177%) and Pudong New Area (~15%) and a small decrease in Chongming District (~4%). No significant change in the potential ES supply for all priority areas was observed between the two scenarios. However, the total restoration cost of the ES demand scenario is 10% higher than that of the ES demand-ignored scenario. Our study highlights the importance of considering the status of regional ES supply and demand (mis)matches in large-scale spatial planning for tidal wetland restoration.</jats:p>"

Adopting lean manufacturing methods, non-value-added activities may be eliminated in the outbound logistics operation. This chapter will investigate the manufacturer's existing operation waste management practises. The unnecessary costs can be utilized for ongoing development where they will be discussed in this chapter for the elimination of non-value-added work and building logistics efficiency. The findings from this chapter will assist the company to reduce costs while maintaining product quality and customer satisfaction.

The responses from 76 production supervisors and managers in Indonesian footwear companies were collected. The results revealed three distinct combinations of GHRM practices to affect supply chain integration. The first configuration suggested that green development and training and teamwork would affect supply chain integration. The second configuration indicated that green recruitment and selective hiring and green performance evaluation also influence supply chain integration. In addition, achieving all GHRM practices was also important. This study provides implications from the complicated relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables other than structural equation modeling. </jats:p>",

Contrary to most of the previous research, which emphasized risks in merely one or two phases of the green supply chain, this study provides a systematic checklist of the cradle-to-grave approach to risk identification and prioritization using a hybrid method. Based on a world-leading Taiwanese laptop manufacturer, we first identified the risk factors of the green supply chain with respect to the components and subcomponents of Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) on the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Second, we used the Analytic Network Process (ANP) to derive the relative weights of the subcomponents of RPN. Third, we combined grey relational analysis and ANP weights to derive the relative importance of each risk criterion in each risk factor in the green supply chain. The empirical results verified that our proposed method can be applied to the laptop manufacturing industry and found industry-specific green risk criteria in each factor. Therefore, following this, enterprises can control the possible risks for continuous improvement in their green activities.</jats:p>"

The Gehu Lake Basin's MP abundance throughout the entire lake region ranged from 1.40 to 5.53 n/L. Microplastic abundance in surface water (3.13 ± 0.32 n/L) was highest, and the average abundance of MPs in the middle water (2.28 ± 0.24 n/L) and bottom water (1.03 ± 0.14 n/L) was appreciably reduced (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The microplastics observed in water samples were analyzed, and it was found that the particle size of most of the obtained microplastic particles was between 100 and 500 microns, the main shape was fibrous MP, and the MP content of transparent color was highest, and the four most common MPs was polyethylene (PE), polystyrene, polyester (PES), and polypropylene (PP). In this article, we emphasize the importance of comprehending the specific distribution characteristics of MPs in Gehu Lake. It provides a data foundation for future monitoring of MPs present in Gehu Lake, provides scientific and technological support for the assessment and prevention of microplastic pollution in this area, and offers some assistance for future lake water quality regulation.</jats:p>",

The results indicated that increased Fe dosage improved the treatment performance, the removals of total coliform, turbidity and DOC were better when the mass ratio of Fe(VI): Fe(III) was 1:2 and pH was 8, regardless of the water source. Alkalescency condition beneﬁts Fe(III) coagulation and Fe(VI) disinfection efﬁciency due to the better stability and greater exposure to Fe(VI). Union use of Fe(VI) and Fe(III), as a coagulant and oxidant to enhance flocculation precipitation, can simultaneously remove turbidity, degraded natural organic matter (NOM) degradation, and destroy bacterial activity. At optimized dosage and pH, chemical oxidation plays the dominant role in the disinfection performance and secondary removal of DOC for Fe(VI) treatment, while for the mechanisms of Fe(III), coagulation and adsorption make the dominant contribution to the removal of turbidity and DOC. The application of the optimal ratio can maximize the advantages of both Fe(VI) and Fe(III), and enables the maximum purification effectiveness at minimum dosage and cost, so it will be a simple and efficient treatment for different drinking water.</jats:p>",

They are increasingly seen as an instrument to support sustainability transitions, such as transitions to a circular bio-based climate smart society. Living labs can create spaces for joint experimenting and learning by exploring the barriers and possibilities for transition and co-creating appropriate and viable solutions. These high expectations for and increased interest in living labs has sparked a keen interest in methods for assessing the performance of living labs. However, there is not yet an evaluation method or framework that is generally accepted and used. The few existing methods and frameworks mostly focus on the functioning of the living lab itself, and not on its wider impacts. Building on existing approaches and informed by the experiences in three living labs, we developed an assessment framework that enables the capturing of the dynamic role and contribution of living labs. This paper describes the framework and how it was developed. The paper contributes to the development of appropriate ways of assessing the functioning of living labs and the ways in which they contribute to sustainability transitions.</jats:p>"

Considering that more than half of the emissions (CO2eq) generated in agriculture come from the use of fossil fuels to power tractors and other agricultural machinery, replacing diesel fuel in tractors with biofuels produced within the agricultural supply chain could contribute to greenhouse gas emissions reduction and to energy self-sufficiency for the local agricultural sectors. This study evaluated, at the regional level (Piedmont—north-west Italy), the potential production of biomethane from local agricultural wastes (crop residues and livestock manure), the potential energy supply to power tractors and the potential CO2 emission reduction by replacing diesel fuel. Based on mean annual available agricultural wastes over the last seven years (2015–2021) in the Piedmont region, the annual potential biomethane yield of 910 × 106 m3 year−1 was estimated, equivalent to a thermal energy of 30.1 × 109 MJ year−1, which is 3.8 times higher than the energy requirements for the regional tractors’ fleet. The estimated potential CO2 emission reduction is about 93.8 t of CO2 year−1, corresponding to 16.8% potential reduction. The study demonstrates the potential of local agriculture to replace diesel fuel with biomethane from waste to meet energy needs and carbon neutrality.</jats:p>"

Thus, this study was conducted to fill the knowledge gap by identifying factors affecting highland bamboo culm market supply in Semen Ari district of the South Omo zone. Multistage sampling technique was employed to draw 183 bamboo producer households from three randomly selected highland bamboo producing sites. Household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect data. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression model. The result indicated that market information, extension service, land allocated for bamboo production, the experience of households in selling bamboo products, market distance, family size, sex of the respondent, and age of household head were variable that significantly affected the supply of bamboo culm to the market. Hence, enhancing the production and productivity of bamboo products through extension, regular training for farmers concerning the processing of bamboo products, improving the relationships of value chain actors, and improving infrastructure could increase producers’ revenue as well as the marketed supply of highland bamboo culms.</jats:p>",

The unique features of the region, namely the scarcity of rainfall, the high concentration of arsenic in freshwaters and the increasing pressure of the mining sector, have made the supply of drinking water for local communities a challenge. In the 1950s, the town of Antofagasta experienced a serious drinking water crisis. The 300 km long aqueduct starting from the Toconce catchment, opened in 1958, temporarily ended this shortage of drinking water but created an even more dramatic problem. The concentration of arsenic in the water consumed by the population had grown by approx. ten times, reaching the value of 0.860 mg/L and seriously affecting people’s health. The water treatment plants (WTPs) which were installed starting from the 1970s in the region (namely the Old and New Salar del Carmen in Antofagasta and Cerro Topater in Calama, plus the two recent desalination plants in Antofagasta and Tocopilla), have ensured, since 2014, that the drinking water coverage in the urban areas was practically universal (&gt;99.9%). However, the rural areas have continued to experience significant shortcomings regarding their capacity to ensure the quality and continuity of the water supply service in the long run. Presently, approx. 42% of the rural population of the region of Antofagasta does not have a formal supply of drinking water. The recent amendments to the Chilean Water Code (March 2022) and the interventions carried out in the framework of the Agua Potable Rural (APR) program were intended to reduce the socio-ecological inequalities due to the lack of drinking water in the semi-concentrated and isolated rural population.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the probability of R &amp; D failure that is not considered in most articles is introduced into the model, and the supply chain composed of green product manufacturers and retailers is considered. The optimal operation decision of the green supply chain under the two modes of government subsidizing manufacturers’ R &amp; D costs and subsidizing green product production costs is analyzed. Under the same subsidy expenditure, this study examines which subsidy method can maximize social welfare. The results show that, when the production cost of green products developed by manufacturers is high, if the government budget is low, the production cost of green products shall be subsidized; if the government budget is high, the manufacturer’s R &amp; D cost should be judged. If the R &amp; D cost is high, the production cost of green products should be subsidized to encourage retailers to order more green products. However, if the R &amp; D cost is low, the R &amp; D cost of green products should be subsidized to encourage manufacturers to invest the most in R &amp; D. When the production cost of green products developed by manufacturers is low, the production cost of green products should be subsidized no matter the R &amp; D cost of manufacturers.

Since DfRem is thought to be advantageous for recycling and remanufacturing, it will lower the production costs for remanufacturers but raise them for manufacturers. On the other hand, manufacturers cannot abandon the DfRem because of environmental responsibilities. This work thus formulates three two-period game models of the competition model with patent protection, the competition model without patent protection, and the cooperation model, which consists of a manufacturer and a remanufacturer, to investigate the decision of the manufacturer and remanufacturer co-opetition strategies. The price, the level of DfRem, the recovery rate, the profit, and other factors are compared across the three models using reverse induction and numerical simulation. In addition, we analyzed the influence of different equilibrium solutions on customer willingness to pay for remanufactured products. We find that cooperation not only contributes to the improvement of DfRem but is also the best choice to ensure the stable development of the supply chain system. Manufacturers, in particular, prefer to work together wherever feasible and actively pursue collaboration rather than advocating for patent protection to fend against remanufacturers, even when they have patent rights.</jats:p>"

This empirical research identifies key determinants influencing the adoption of GSCM practices. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we selected a sample size of 350 different manufacturing firms in Pakistan. The results of the study revealed that six factors, namely, environmental, government, organization, suppliers, market, and operational factors, significantly influence the intention to adopt GSCM and positively impact sustainable production. The study's findings reveal that market and operational factors are highly significant for adopting GSCM practices at a <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-value of 0.05. Environmental and organizational factors are equally significant to adopt GSCM practices at a <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-value of 0.10. This research also analyzed CIT as a moderator between environmental, government, organization, customer, supplier, economic, market, and operational factors in the context of Pakistan. Hypotheses H9a, H9b, H9f, and H9g were validated and support the use of CIT to boost enterprise production and consumption. The research findings would help policymakers understand how to implement GSCM practices and guide enterprises to implement GSCM and CIT practices for enhancing enterprise performance and environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Sediment supply is widely believed to be a key control on alluvial fan morphology and channel dynamics. Although the sediment supply to natural fans is rather episodic, experimental studies of alluvial fans often use constant sediment supply rates, making it difficult to relate fan dynamics to the magnitude and frequency of sediment supply in the field. This paper presents a series of experiments designed to test the impact of episodic sediment supply on fan evolution and dynamics. We compare four experiments, each with the same mean sediment supply but different durations of high- and low-supply periods. The experiments show that fan morphology and channel dynamics respond systematically to the temporal elongation of sediment supply oscillations: longer supply cycles generate flatter fans with more trenched channels. These results highlight how different basin conditions might generate different fan morphologies: supply-limited basins with intermittent sediment supply might generate fans that are flatter than expected. Our results raise the question of whether a constant sediment supply in experimental models can adequately characterise the dynamics of natural fans in the field. We therefore suggest that experimental modellers should include variability when investigating fan responses to sediment supply.</jats:p>"

Pollution from road transportation is a well-documented problem potentially leading to chronic health impacts. However, research on the raw material production, construction, operation, maintenance, and end-of-life phases of paved roads, and corresponding supply chains, is generally limited to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. No previous research efforts on the life-cycle stages of pavements and road operation connect pollutant emission inventories to intake of inhaled pollutants and resulting damages to exposed populations. We have developed a first-of-its-kind model quantifying human exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub>) due to emissions from routine pavement resurfacing and vehicle operation. We utilize the Intervention Model Pollution Source-Receptor Matrix to calculate marginal changes in ground-level PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> concentrations and resulting exposure intake from a spatially resolved primary and secondary PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> emission precursors inventory. Under a scenario of annual road-resurfacing practices within the San Francisco Bay Area in California (population: 7.5 million), resurfacing activities, material production and delivery (i.e. cement, concrete, aggregate, asphalt, bitumen), and fuel (i.e. gasoline, diesel) supply chains contribute almost 65% to the annual PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> intake from all the sources included in the study domain (the remaining 35% being due to on-road tailpipe emissions). Exposure damages range from $170 to $190 million (2019 USD). Complete electrification of on-road mobile sources would reduce annual intake by 64%, but a sizable portion would remain from material supply chains, construction activities, and brake and tire wear. Future mitigation policies should be enacted equitably. Results show that people of color experience higher-than-average PM<jats:sub>2.5</jats:sub> exposure disparities from the emission sources included in the study, particularly from material production.</jats:p>",

Using data for 2017 from Chile and an instrumental variable approach, the results suggest that cities’ cultural employment shape workers’ decisions to consume cultural goods.

Accordingly, real-time, around-the-clock accident monitoring is necessary to minimize secondary damage. In the present study, a section of a large-scale waterworks transmission mains system with frequent changes in its physical boundaries was defined for sensor network map-based deep learning input and output. A deep neural network (DNN)-based pressure prediction model, able to detect pipe burst accidents in real-time using short-term data collected over periods within 1 month, was developed. A sensor network map refers to a sensor-based hierarchy diagram, which is expressed using a hydraulically divided area. A hydraulically independent area can be determined using known value information (e.g., the known flow, pressure, and total head) in a complex water supply system. The input data used for the deep learning model training were: the water levels measured at 1 min intervals, flow rates, ambient pressure, pump operation state, and electric valve opening data. To verify the developed methodology, two sets of real-world data from past burst accidents in different multi-regional waterworks systems were used. The results showed that the difference between the pressure as measured by pressure meters and an estimated pressure was extremely small before an accident, and that the difference would reach a maximum at the time point when an accident occurs. It was confirmed that an approximate estimation of an accident occurrence and accident location could be estimated based on predicted pressure meter data. The developed methodology predicts a mutual influence between pressure meters and, therefore, has the advantage of not requiring past data covering long time periods. The proposed methodology can be applied immediately and used in currently operational large-scale water transmission main systems.</jats:p>"

Although computed tomography angiography (CTA) is an appealing alternative to cardiac angiography (CA), its ability to differentiate between single- versus dual-supply MAPCAs is not well-established. We investigated whether CTA is non-inferior to CA in defining MAPCAs supply.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>\n            Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent both CTA and CA for MAPCA delineation between 2016-2021. Diagrams were created for patients labeling MAPCAs numerically for consistency in data collection. Images were independently reviewed by blinded CTA and CA readers. The diagnostic performance of CTA was compared to CA as the gold standard. Nonparametric paired tests were used for statistical analysis, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using exact methods.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>\n            Seventeen patients, with 55 MAPCAs, met the study criteria. The median age at CTA and CA was 7 days (1-745) and 74 days (7-751), respectively. CA was performed under general anesthesia (GA) in all patients compared to 17% of CTAs (p=0.0001). Contrast load (median 2 vs 7.1 ml/kg) and adverse events (0 vs 47%) were lower in CTA than diagnostic CA (p &lt;0.0001 and p.=0.008, respectively). Fifty-three MAPCAs (96%) were concordantly classified as single or dual supply (95% CI, 87-100%). Compared to CA, CTA detected dual-supply MAPCAs with sensitivity of 97% (95% CI, 84-100%) and specificity of 96% (77-100%); similarly, PPV was 97% (84-100%) and NPV was 96% (77-100%). The proportion of MAPCAs labeled discordantly was non-inferior at both the 10% margin (p=0.0001) and 5% margin (p=0.031).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold>\n            CTA is accurate in differentiating single- versus dual-supply of MAPCAs. Additionally, CTA required a lower contrast load, less frequent use of GA, and resulted in fewer adverse events. Our results suggest that CTA may be used as the initial diagnostic modality for complete MAPCAs delineation, with CA reserved when an intervention or hemodynamic assessment is necessary.\n          </jats:p>",

However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, aircraft maintenance repair organization (MRO) businesses were adversely impacted, including but not limited to retrenchments, restructurings, and permanent business closure. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to propose a business optimization strategy for Malaysian MRO affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to promote business growth. The data and methodology used to produce this proposal were derived from an analysis of numerous literature reviews that were identified as having a high impact Malaysian aviation. This chapter finds that the COVID-19 pandemic has a global impact on aviation businesses; travel restrictions imposed by the majority of countries have caused major disruptions in the aviation and aircraft maintenance businesses, as the majority of airlines have grounded their aircraft; however, there are still some aviation business opportunities as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The specific mechanism by which phosphorus affects nodule nitrogen fixation and nitrogen absorption in soybeans remains inconclusive. To further quantitatively analyze the effect of phosphorus on nodule nitrogen fixation and nitrogen accumulation in soybeans, this experiment was carried out under sand culture conditions. The experiment consisted of six phosphorus supply levels (1 mg/L, 11 mg/L, 21 mg/L, 31 mg/L, 41 mg/L, 51 mg/L). The acetylene reduction method and 15N tracer method (50 mg/L (NH4)2SO4) were used to determine and analyze the nodule growth status, nodule nitrogenase activity, nitrogen content, and nodule nitrogen fixation rate at initial flowering (R1 stage), initial pod (R3 stage), seed filling (R5 stage) and maturity stages (R8 stage). The results are described as follows: 1. The nitrogen fixation of soybean nodules at different growth stages has different requirements for phosphorus supply levels. The initial flowering stage and seed-filling stage were 31 mg/L–41 mg/L, and the initial pod stage was 51 mg/L. 2. The nitrogen source in different parts of soybean showed different trends with different growth periods and phosphorus supply concentrations. Among them, from the initial flowering stage to the seed filling stage, the main body of the nitrogen supply of soybean shoots in the low phosphorus treatment (1 mg/L–31 mg/L) gradually changed from fertilizer nitrogen to nodule nitrogen fixation, while the main body of the nitrogen supply of soybean shoots in the high phosphorus treatment (41 mg/L–51 mg/L) always showed nodule nitrogen fixation and was transformed into fertilizer nitrogen at the mature stage. The main nitrogen supply to the roots of soybean at different levels of phosphorus supply from the initial flowering to the initial pods and maturity stage was fertilizer nitrogen, and the main nitrogen supply at the seed filling stage was nodule nitrogen fixation. The nitrogen supply to the main body of soybean nodules was constantly nodule nitrogen fixation. 3. Different phosphorus supply levels significantly affected the nitrogen fixation of soybean nodules (R2 ≥ 0.803), and both the acetylene reduction method and the 15N tracer method could be used to determine the nitrogen fixation capacity of soybean nodules. This study indicated the optimal phosphorus supply level of nodules in different growth stages of soybean and clarified the main body of phosphorus supply in different parts of soybean at different growth stages, which pointed out the direction for further improving the utilization efficiency of soybean nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer.</jats:p>"

Based on the data of 2000, 2010 and 2020, this paper takes Jingyu County in the Changbai Mountain as the study area. By land use conversion matrix, geostatistical analysis, InVEST model and scenario analysis, this paper aims to find out the variation of water conservation and the its related influencing factors in Changbai Mountain region. From 2000 to 2020, forest and cultivated land decreased, while grassland and developed land increased. The water conservation increased from 2.94 × 108 m3 to 4.83 × 108 m3, with a total increase of 64.29%. Forest has the highest average water conservation, followed by grassland, cultivated land and developed land. Climatic factors were important to 91.92% of the study area, whereas 6.22% of it was influenced by land use. When forest decrease in some areas, the main control factor of 48.71% of the area shifted into land use, that could lead to a sharp decrease in water conservation. Climate determines the overall spatial pattern of water conservation; land use determines the local characteristics by controlling runoff. The increase of water conservation is beneficial to improve the reserves and development potential of mineral water.</jats:p>",

Using a combination of AI and ML, and case studies based on data collected from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan, we developed a FNaD detection model aimed at preventing SCDs.

Two key objectives were set: (i) the comparison of two—different quality—samples from different areas, and the verification of their differentiation, based on mesozooplankton biodiversity indices; and (ii) the development of a methodology, which was able to assess the quality of new marine water samples. Our analysis was based on a 24-year-long in situ dataset (1987–2010) of 139 samples in which 86 mesozooplankton taxa were identified. High-diversity and high evenness values were reported in the case of the “good” status sample, while low diversity, low evenness and high dominance values occurred at the lower quality one. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was conducted that discriminated the tested samples at 100%. This LDA was then used to evaluate samples of unknown quality. Finally, 90% of them were classified with a probability of correct classification (posterior probability) &amp;gt;95%. The present study proves that mesozooplankton diversity indices can discriminate different levels of anthropogenic impacts. In this sense, it can be used as a reliable indicator for environmental assessment in the pelagic habitats of the Mediterranean Sea.</jats:p>",

With the application of two-stage three-phase continuous power supply structure, the electrical characteristics exhibit new features differing from the existing traction system. In this work, the principle for voltage levels determining two-stage network is dissected in accordance with the requirements of traction network and electric locomotive. The equivalent model of three-phase traction system is built for deducing the formula of current distribution and voltage losses. Based on the chain network model of the traction network, a simulation model is established to analyze the electrical characteristics such as traction current distribution, voltage losses, system equivalent impedance, voltage distribution, voltage unbalance and regenerative energy utilization. In a few words, quite a lot traction current of about 99% is undertaken by long-section cable network. The proportion of system voltage losses is small attributed to the two-stage three-phase power supply structure, and the voltage unbalance caused by impedance asymmetry of traction network is less than 1‰. In addition, the utilization rate of regenerative energy for locomotive achieves a significant promotion of over 97%.</jats:p>",

This work describes the development and testing of activated carbon made from orange peels, which is effective at removing methyl red (MR) from aqueous solutions, and thus provides a solution to this problem. Adsorbents made in the lab can be characterized by their bulk density, particle size, surface area, and proximate analysis. The surface area of the prepared adsorbent was 512.2 m2g−1. Standard procedures such as XRD, SEM, and FTIR analysis are also used to characterize prepared orange peel-activated carbon. Adsorbent dosage (0.25 to 1.25 g/L), MR concentration (100 to 400 mg/L), temperature (40 to 60 °C), contact time (10 to 60 minutes), and pH (3 to 11) were all examined in this experiment. At an amount of adsorbent of 1 g/L adsorbent, MR concentration of 100 mg/L, and a pH of 11, maximum adsorption has been observed. In order to analyze the results, adsorption models such as the Langmuir and Freundlich were applied. At 60 °C, the adsorption isotherm was found to fit the Langmuir model with 111.11 mg/g. The linear regression correlation coefficient, the R2 value is 0.999. Analytical results showed that MR could be effectively removed by using AC made from waste orange peels as an adsorbent.</jats:p>",

This exercise is part of a wider research agenda focused on ‘Supporting Alternative Food Networks’ (SAFeNET). This is a research agenda to conceive, build, implement, and develop better-informing decision-making processes that support effective and efficient AFNs (also known as Short Food Supply Chains) logistics operations in a digital environment, through smooth flows of goods and information among producers, AFNs coordinators, and consumers. This view calls for taking a systemic approach to help collectives of people to improve their autonomy and viability. Initial plans were to conduct this collaborative design exercise, using the Viable System Model (VSM) as a conversational tool. Accordingly, a series of face-to-face interviews and a focus group were planned. However, the lockdown due to COVID-19 forced researchers to abandon the face-to-face option and conduct the primary data collection online. The VSM intervention had to be adapted for its use on an online platform, in such a way that the platform would support knowledge building interactively, with a series of participants. This paper describes the format and visual appearance of the online VSM framework, its application, and the lessons learned through this exercise. Two points deserve to be highlighted: First, although the exercise outcome was very valuable for the next stage of the design, the participants’ capacity for collective and individual reflection during the workshop was limited. Second, participants continued adding comments via the adopted online visual collaboration platform after the workshop ended, showing an understanding of the process and commitment beyond the researchers’ expectations. The outcomes from this experiment are promissory, suggesting that online Systems Thinking interventions deserve further development.</jats:p>"

We develop a framework that investigates the impacts of integration between an e‐commerce platform and suppliers on supply chain resilience and the moderating effect of the suppliers' product flexibility. An analysis of data from a Chinese e‐commerce platform using operational indicators finds that integration between the e‐commerce platform and suppliers in terms of information sharing, joint planning and logistics cooperation has positive impacts on supply chain resilience, while procurement automation has the opposite effect. Furthermore, product flexibility positively moderates the impacts of information sharing, joint planning and logistics cooperation. The results enhance current understandings of the factors that contribute to the development of supply chain resilience and reveal that the relationship between integration and resilience should be examined within a contingency framework. The findings also provide guidelines for managers taking measures to mitigate the negative influences of supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>",

The 3D point cloud data was obtained by reconstructing the laser line projected onto the surface of the high-voltage cable joint. In order to remove noise generated by reconstruction which is located above or below the curve, a simple and effective strategy that the noise can be filtered by the gradient change in the neighborhood is adopted. Then a continuous iterative residual fitting method is proposed to effectively reduce the interference of the defect area on the curve fitting accuracy, thereby obtaining the accurate equation expression of the cable surface curve. By comparing the residual value of the high-voltage cable surface points relative to the fitting curve, the points of the defect area are marked. Finally 3D defect area is extracted through segmentation and clustering. Experiments have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method on artificial standard size defects and real manual ground defects. The absolute error of the depth (height) of artificial standard size defects is less than 0.05 mm. Compared with the traditional cylindrical fitting method, it can be seen that the recognition rate of the proposed method for manually ground defects of high-voltage cable joint is much higher than that of cylinder fitting method.</jats:p>",

However, the limited lifespans, as well as the frequent charging or replacement requirements, pose a set of challenges for their application in the Internet of things (IoTs), because the full power of the IoTs can only be realized by the sustainable operation of physical objects, especially embedded sensors, for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems continually in real-time. A viable option for achieving the sustainability of the IoTs may be the combination of renewable energy harvesting technologies such as triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with electrochemical energy storage technologies, where TENGs can harvest mechanical energies from ambient environments and transform them into electricity for charging electrochemical batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) conveniently, thus developing a new type of TENG-based uninterrupted power supply (TENG-UPS). In this review, we begin from a brief description of the operating mode of TENG and the integration strategy of TENG-UPS. The latest advances in the TENG-UPS are then thoroughly discussed from the perspective of structural design and system integration. Cutting edge developments of the as-designed self-powered sensing systems are then concisely illustrated to disclose the application potential in the IoTs. The main obstacles and future prospects for developing TENG-UPS-based intelligent systems are also highlighted in terms of design and manufacture at the conclusion. We expect this review will appropriately shine a light on the understanding of the key role of electrochemical energy storage devices in the development of TENG-based energy harvesting technology as well as the self-powered intelligent systems.</jats:p>"

An increase in the percentage of bacteria showing resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in the microflora of wastewater during the treatment process was found.

The test diets showed positive effects, upregulating the expression of genes of major nuclear receptors and those of lipid metabolism including digestion, LC-PUFA synthesis and antioxidant pathways. The results indicated that the DCO feed containing both DHA and EPA performed better than the ECO feed with much lower DHA.

Based on the matrix equations, we established the matrixed model of a typical heat supply system and obtained the corresponding matrix equation reflecting the power topology structure of the system. Moreover, we derived and reconstructed a single heat exchanger's entropy generation rate expression based on the standard thermal resistance, which was only related to inlet temperatures, structural parameters, and operating parameters. The total system entropy generation rate was then derived and minimized by the Lagrange multiplier method. The optimization results provided the optimal distribution of the mass flow rate of each fluid. Besides, the influence of the heat transfer rate and outer loop inlet temperature on the optimization results revealed that local equipment parameters and conditions could affect the system's minimum entropy generation. The total entropy generation rate decreases by 17.5% when the outer loop inlet temperature was increased from 274 to 280 K. In conclusion, the matrixed modeling and entropy generation analysis are feasible for thermal system modeling and optimization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapid economic growth and industrialization have brought us material abundance and greater convenience, while also causing socio-environmental problems such as the rapid depletion of resources, unexpected natural disasters, and environmental destruction. For these reasons, environmental issues have attracted public and governmental attention around the world over the past few decades. As a result, environmental sustainability has become a critical indicator for evaluating the success and efficiency of supply chain management schemes. For a sustainable supply chain, many governments are employing subsidy policies to encourage consumers to purchase environment-friendly (green) products. This article considers a supply chain composed of two competing manufacturers and two retailers. The first manufacturer produces a green product, while the second manufacturer produces a nongreen product. Each of the two retailers can sell only a green product, only a nongreen product, or both green and nongreen products. In the market, consumers purchasing the first manufacturer’s green products can receive certain subsidies from the government. The amounts of the government subsidies that a consumer receives depend on the greenness degree of the product. Using a three-stage Stackelberg game framework, this article discusses equilibrium decisions on pricing and greenness for four different distribution channel structures. Major findings of this study reveal that (i) the government subsidy has a positive impact on the greenness degree and the demand for green products; (ii) the government subsidy level depends on the manufacturers’ distribution channel strategy types; and (iii) the greater the environmentally negative impact of a green product, the lower the level of the government subsidy paid for purchasing green products. Based on these findings, this article suggests that policymakers focus on establishing the policies that encourage the purchase of green products for the sustainability of a society and a supply chain.</jats:p>",

Although, existing technologies such as RFIDs, Next-Generation Wireless Communication (NGWC) and RuBees are applied MSC, they are not sufficient in ensuring end-to-end visibility across the entire SC. However, digital technologies such as the internet of things, cloud computing, Application Programming Interface (APIs), machine learning, augmented and virtual reality, big data, analytics and pervasive computing play a critical role in improving visibility to ensure effective SC management. Hence, the introduction of the concept of digital twin enabled by these technologies creates a digital replica of the whole supply chain operations, ensuring adequate end-to-end visibility through real-time data that ensures effective tracking, monitoring and reporting of all SC activities. The focus of this paper is to explore the enabling technologies of digital twin and its implementation to achieve end-to-end visibility in the military supply chain. In this paper, the authors identify the digital twin’s tracking and monitoring capability, which will improve supply chain management by enabling a cycle of continuous adjustment of the SC against unexpected disruptions.</jats:p>",

Focusing on the case of blockchains, we assess industry claims that this set of distributed ledger technologies for undertaking, verifying, and publishing digital transactions provides the greater transparency necessary to resolve sustainability challenges. Our central contention is that blockchain-based initiatives to promote sustainability in global supply chains double-down on modes of third-party audit and disclosure governance that have thus far failed to address labour and environmental abuses. The turn towards these digital technologies, we show, extends interlinked processes of managerialization and the spread of ‘audit culture’ in the governance of global supply chains. These tendencies heighten obstacles to enhancing sustainability across global supply chains, exacerbating the very challenges blockchain initiatives are ostensibly meant to address. Worse than not fundamentally addressing sustainability problems, applications of this set of ‘sustech’ render failures to address sustainability abuses more opaque. The technological novelty of blockchain helps to construct what we call a ‘veil of transparency’ over sustainability abuses and marginalities in and across global supply chains. </jats:p>",

In previous studies, annual water extraction defined with an annual Z curve in terms of the total water storage in the reservoirs on November 1 was optimized using genetic algorithms. In this study, a percentage of total annual extraction for each reservoir was also optimized, but monthly water extractions were adjusted too, when the water level fell outside the upper or lower limits of guide curves stablished for each reservoir. The capabilities of the genetic algorithms combined with a detailed simulation of reservoirs operation were used to optimize the levels of the guide curves and also to optimize the adjusted monthly programed extractions as linear functions of the difference between the actual storage level at the beginning of each month and the corresponding level of the guide curves. Therefore, 90 parameters were established: four to define the Z curve, two to establish the percentage assigned to each reservoir, 72 to establish the monthly levels of the guide curves and 12 to define the parameters of the linear functions used to adjust the monthly programed extractions when the actual water level exceeds the limits of the guide curves. For each alternative of the 90 parameters, a detailed simulation is done using the last 20 years of hydrological data on the inflow of water to the three main reservoirs, including the net contributions of five diversion dams, and the objective function sought to maximize water delivery to the treatment plant, while penalizing possible spills and deficits in the system is evaluated. The optimal policies found in this research resulted in smaller spills than those that occurred during the historical operation of the reservoir system. Therefore, the optimal monthly operating decisions required for each reservoir are provided by the genetic algorithm.</jats:p>",

In addition, biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant strains (MDRs) are even more aggravated if we consider antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as an important public health issue. Quorum sensing (QS) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are mechanisms that significantly contribute to the recalcitrance (resistance and tolerance) of biofilms, making them more robust and resistant to conventional sanitation methods. These mechanisms coordinate different strategies involved in AMR, such as activation of a quiescent state of the cells, moderate increase in the expression of the efflux pump, decrease in the membrane potential, antimicrobial inactivation, and modification of the antimicrobial target and the architecture of the EPS matrix itself. There are few studies investigating the impact of the use of inhibitors on the mechanisms of recalcitrance and its impact on the microbiome. Therefore, more studies to elucidate the effect and applications of these methods in the food production chain and the possible combination with antimicrobials to establish new strategies to control MDR biofilms are needed.</jats:p>"

The relevance of developing a group controller based on fuzzy logic is manifested in the fact that when selective controllers are used as part of an automatic control system (ACS) for fuel supply to the combustion chamber of a gas turbine engine (GTE), there is a contradiction in the choice of control channels in transient modes. The aim of the research is to develop a group controller for automatic control of fuel supply to the combustion chamber of a gas turbine engine based on fuzzy logic instead of a selective controller to improve the quality of control. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were posed: 1) building an ACS model by supplying fuel to the combustion chamber of a gas turbine engine; 2) replacement of the selective controller with a fuzzy group controller; estimation of the quality of control of an ACS with a selective controller and with a fuzzy group controller according to the objective function. Methods. The idea of using minimum and maximum fuzzy controllers instead of elements based on multivalued logic is that the output of the fuzzy controller is formed considering both input values in the case when the difference between the input values is small. Replacing multi-valued logic with fuzzy controllers allows smooth switching of control channels. The fuzzy controller consists of a fuzzifier, a block of rules, and a defuzzifier. The fuzzifier contains two triangular term-sets \"O\" (negative deviation of input \"x2\" from input \"x1\") and \"P\" (positive deviation of input \"x2\" from input \"x1\"). The rule block contains two rules. The defuzzifier calculates the output using the weighted average method. An analysis of the simulation results showed that the use of fuzzy group regulator (FGR) as part of the ACS by supplying fuel to the combustion chamber of the GTE instead of the selector allows one to reduce the time of the transient process, but leads to an increase in over regulation. Conclusions:1) we developed FGR, which provides the formation of a control action on the fuel dispenser, taking into account several control channels of ACS of GTE; 2) simulation modeling of ACS of GTE with a selector and FGR was carried out in the MATLAB Simulink; 3) the results of the experiments showed that the use of the FGR instead of the selector leads to an improvement in the quality of control by 2.05% in terms of the target function; 4) further research on the development of ACS problems by overdetermined control objects have been outlined; in addition to this it seems reasonable to expand the study in the field of group control of GTE ACS channels, in particular, to consider the problem of adaptive fuzzy control.</jats:p>",

The control of network pressure is essential to reducing these losses, providing a quality supply to consumers, saving electricity and preserving piping from excess pressure. However, to obtain these benefits, it is necessary to overcome some difficulties such as sensing the pressure of geographically distant consumer units and developing a control logic that is capable of making use of the data from these sensors and, at the same time, a good solution in terms of cost benefit. Therefore, this work has the purpose of developing a pressure monitoring and control system for water supply networks, using the ESP8266 microcontroller to collect data from pressure sensors for the integrated ScadaLTS supervisory system via the REST API. The modeling of the plant was developed using artificial neural networks together with fuzzy pressure control, both designed using the Python language. The proposed method was tested by considering a pumping station and two reference units located in the city of João Pessoa, Brazil, in which there was an excess of pressure in the supply network and low performance from the old controls, during the night period from 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. The field results estimated 2.9% energy saving in relation to the previous form of control and a guarantee that the pressure in the network was at a healthy level.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the work is the development of algorithms and information tools to increase the reliability of istribution electric networks and improve the quality of electricity supply of industrial and civil objects due to decentralized Electricity generation. Today, for the energy security of Ukraine, the energy sector is moving from a purely centralized model of electricity supply to consumers, the basis of which are powerful TPPs and nuclear power plants, to a combined one, when part of the electricity is produced by decentralized generation in RES sources of electricity. By distributed generation (RG) we understand sources of electric energy connected directly to the distribution network or connected to such a network from the side of electricity consumers. The wide spread of distributed generation is primarily associated with the appearance of highly efficient gas turbine and steam-gas plants and the development of renewable sources of electricity. Among them, wind power plants (SPP) and direct conversion solar power plants (SPP) have become the most widespread. The introduction of RG in electrical networks, especially built on the basis of renewable energy sources (RES), in addition to reducing the ecological burden on the environment and solving many problems associated with waste emissions during the production of electricity, will allow, firstly, to significantly increase the efficiency of the use of primary resources and , in the future, to reduce the cost of electricity; secondly, it will unload both the system-forming and trunk and distribution electric networks. However, this process has both positive and negative consequences for the functioning of RES. The integration of RES into the electric power system is complicated by the fact that the existing RES were designed and operated with a focus on centralized power supply. The growth of the share of RES in the total balance of electricity generates new problems and tasks that are not typical for the past period. They are connected, first of all, with the instability of RES generation due to their natural dependence on the influence of the environment.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, beginning of 2020, the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has hindered most of the yearly turn around (TA) to maintain the assets due to travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine regulations. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a strategic plan during the COVID-19 pandemic to position augmented reality (AR) in the maintenance support of the oil and gas industry.

The rates of adsorption were found to be consistent with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The data at equilibrium resulted in a maximum adsorption capacity of 4.466 mg/g at 298 K, which was in good agreement with the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption of DOM relies on pH. The higher removal efficiency of DOM was observed at pH 4.0 and 7.0. To clarify the related adsorption mechanism, isolated DOM fractions and their removal potentials were identified. The results showed hydrophobic acid (HoA) and hydrophobic neutral (HoN) fractions which contained abundant fulvic-like substances were more preferentially removed by the GSC. The adsorption mechanism of DOM in road runoff by GSC involves both electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange reactions. GSC synthesized using the sludge from waterworks is a very promising filler to replace soils or gravels that can be applied in some green infrastructures for removing DOM from road runoff.</jats:p>",

Mode mixing can be dealt with using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), and the endpoint effect of CEEMDAN can be successfully dealt with using the mutual information criterion. To increase the computational effectiveness of broad learning (BL), orthogonal triangular matrix decomposition (QR) was used. A novel improved coupled CEEMDAN-QRBL flood forecasting model was created and applied to the prediction of daily runoff in Xiaolangdi Reservoir based on the benefit of quick calculation by the model output layer. The findings indicate that the enhanced QRBL is 28.92% more computationally efficient than the BL model, and that the reconstruction error of CEEMDAN has been decreased by 48.22%. The MAE of the improved CEEMDAN-QRBL model is reduced by 12.36% and 16.31%, and the Ens is improved by 8.81% and 3.96%, respectively, when compared with the EMD-LSTM and CEEMDAN-GRU models. The predicted values of the CEEMDAN-QRBL model have a suitable fluctuation range thanks to the use of nonparametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE), which might serve as a useful benchmark for the distribution of regional water resources.</jats:p>",

The balance between the supply and demand of urban facilities has been an influential standard for determining the rationality of this allocation. However, at this stage, research on evaluating planning from the perspective of supply–demand in GSI is still limited. This study proposed an evaluation method for assessing supply–demand levels in GSIs in Guangzhou, China, using the coupling coordination model consisting of Coupling Degree (CD) and Coupling Coordination Degree (CCD). Furthermore, the spatial distributions of supply–demand balance and resource mismatch were identified. The results indicated that the supply and demand levels of GSI exhibited significant spatial differences in distribution, with most streets being in short supply. The GSI exhibited a high CD value of 0.575 and a poor CCD value of 0.328, implying a significant imbalance in facility allocation. A lot of newly planned facilities failed to effectively cover the streets in need of improvement, so it became essential to adjust the planning scheme. The findings of this study can facilitate the decision-makers in assessing the supply–demand levels in GSI and provide a reference of facility allocation for the sustainable construction of Sponge City.</jats:p>"

Benefits received and issues experienced by actors were related to the formality of the business. Heavy reliance on natural forests for fuelwood production among chain actors can add pressure on the forest resources and ecosystem.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our recent study suggested that moisture from the subtropical Western Pacific (WP) contributed the most to an atmospheric river (AR) event and the related heavy rainfall during the heavy rain of 2020 in Japan based on a Lagrangian approach. However, the actual role of moisture from the subtropical WP region in the AR and heavy rain formations remains unclear. To evaluate that, we conducted a set of numerical sensitivity experiments by adjusting the surface moisture supply over the subtropical WP region with factors of 0%, 50%, and 200%. The sensitivity experiments suggest that the reduced surface evaporation over the subtropical WP suppressed the local convective activity and decreased moisture content in the whole troposphere, leading to shallow and weak positive geopotential height anomalies. Although the slightly strengthened WP subtropical High (WPSH) and related anomalous anticyclonic circulation enhanced the southwesterly wind, convective activities along the Meiyu-Baiu front were still weakened due to the largely reduced moisture supply, resulting in another anomalous anticyclonic circulation over Japan but had much stronger and deeper structures. These two anomalous circulations and the reduced moisture modulated the AR over Japan, which eventually caused the weakened rainfalls and the northward migration of the rainband. By contrast, larger surface evaporation enhanced the local convective activities and weakened the dominant WPSH, resulting in the weakening and the southward migration of the AR. Overall, this study confirmed the large contributions of moisture supply from the subtropical WP region to the AR and related precipitation over Japan during the record-breaking Meiyu-Baiu season in 2020 <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> both dynamic and thermodynamic influences. In addition, it reveals that, although larger evaporation over the WP region would increase the total rainfalls but would not have led to more several rainfalls over certain regions, such as the relatively small Kyushu Island.</jats:p>"

This is because it is relatively difficult to quantify water mixing using traditional methods. Dual water isotopes in the northwestern South China Sea during Typhoon Wipha (July–August 2019) were investigated to address this issue. Weak mixing among different water masses was observed before the typhoon because of strong thermal stratification. After the typhoon, temperature and salinity dropped in the water column, particularly in the upper layer (&lt;20 m), due to strengthened mixing. Mixing in the upper layer predominantly originated from coastal diluted water (36%) in the nearshore, whereas it changed to upwelling (51%) offshore. Upwelling was stronger on the right of the typhoon path (50%) than on the left (36%). Nutrients predominantly originated from the coastal diluted water input (50%) in the upper nearshore layer, while upwelling occurred (53%) offshore. The nutrient supply from upwelling on the right of the typhoon path (43%) was also more considerable than that on the left (25%). This study suggests that typhoon‐induced nutrient supply to the coastal upper water layers from the upwelling water (38%) was more substantial than that from the runoff input (30%), providing new insight into the biogeochemical and ecological responses of coastal marine systems to typhoons.</jats:p>",

However, mismatches occur relative to the spatiotemporal changes in travel demands over longer time periods (e.g., 1 week). To more effectively match rail supply with passenger demand, a weekly line planning (WLP) model considering both peak and nonpeak passenger demand over an entire week and during all periods of each day is proposed. This model maximizes the defined supply–demand matching utility and minimizes train operational cost. Important constraints to ensure proper daily and hourly train repetition over multiple days are included. A customized genetic algorithm (GA) is developed, which outperforms the CPLEX solver in real‐world cases of high‐speed railways in China. Compared with practical and single‐day planning, WLP shows clear improvement in terms of operational cost, passenger travel speed, and supply–demand matching.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the aim of this paper is to understand the influence of stakeholders on the decision of adopting sustainability practices into the supply chain. We conduct a literature review, including content analysis, examining publications on sustainable supply chains published in English. We form the link between the institutional isomorphism as a driver for SSCM and its relation with stakeholders of the organization.

Increased production is directly related to an increase in the environmental impact of agriculture and in the energy needs associated with it. To reduce food waste, the supply chain should maintain ideal preservation conditions. In horticultural products, temperature, and relative humidity are two of the main parameters to be controlled. Monitoring these parameters can help decision-making in logistics and routes management, as well as to diagnose and timely prevent food losses. In the present work, eighteen wireless traceability devices with temperature and relative humidity sensors monitored crates with horticultural products along a short-range distribution route with five stops (4 h 30 m). Sensor data and a location tag were sent via GSM for real-time monitoring. The results showed fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity that reached up to 7.4 °C and 35.3%, respectively. These fluctuations happened mostly due to frequent door opening, operational procedures, and irregular refrigeration conditions. Furthermore, the results brought attention to a procedure that creates unnecessary temperature fluctuations and energy losses.

We used 845 original research and review articles on pipe bursts in the period of January 1991 − June 2022 that cited 16,813 references in the CiteSpace® software for reference co-citation analysis. The results indicate that the knowledge structure of pipe burst research is classified into four categories including pipe burst mechanism, pipe burst detection, pipe burst prediction, and use of sensors. The entire research on pipe bursts advances remarkably. First, pipe burst prediction is the core research category with continuous efforts to improve prediction performance. Second, pipe burst detection is likely to define new research focus to extend existing research focus on pipe burst prediction. Third, computer science and technology are widely and increasingly applied in burst process simulation and data pattern analysis to increase accuracy and effectiveness. This study grasps a full view of current achievements in pipe burst research and provides guidance for future research directions and technological development.</jats:p>",

This study employed the dried biomass of freshwater green microalgae Chlorella vulgaris to remove phenol and 2-chlorophenol from an aqueous environment. C. vulgaris was grown under different phosphorus- (P) starved conditions, and biomass was treated with sulfuric acid. It was observed that reducing the P level enhanced the lipid content by 7.8 times while decreasing protein by 7.2 times. P-starved C. vulgaris dried biomass removed phenol and 2-chlorophenol by 69 and 57%, respectively, after 180 min from the contaminated water. Acid-treated P-starved C. vulgaris dried biomass removed phenol and 2-chlorophenol by 77 and 75%, respectively, after 180 min. Thus, an economical and eco-friendly P-starved and acid treated C. vulgaris biomass has better potential to remove phenol and 2-chlorophenol from contaminated ground water and industrial wastewater.</jats:p>"

To diagnose and localize faults in the rectifier, this paper proposes a frequency-domain analysis-based fault diagnosis algorithm for the rectifier in AGPS. First, time-domain expressions and spectral characteristics of the output voltage of the TPTL-NPC inverter-based power supply are analyzed. Then, frequency-domain analysis-based fault diagnosis and frequency-domain analysis-based sub-fault diagnosis algorithms are proposed to diagnose open circuit (OC) faults of diode(s), which benefit from the analysis of harmonics magnitude and phase-angle of the output voltage. Only a fundamental period is needed to diagnose and localize exact faults, and a strong Variable-duration Fault Detection Method is proposed to identify acceptable ripple from OC faults. Detailed simulations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, quickness, and robustness of the proposed algorithms, and the diagnosis algorithms proposed in this article provide a significant method for the fault diagnosis of other rectifiers and converters.</jats:p>",

This transition to land-intensive energy generates inevitable land use conflicts with existing land cover, such as forest or agricultural land. South Korea is one of the countries currently experiencing conflicts in land use between ecosystems, food and energy. In addition, various land use problems occur, such as deforestation due to developments and an increase in idle agricultural land due to a decrease in the labor force. Thus, it is important to establish future land use policies that consider these issues. This study conducted a net present value (NPV) analysis for solving land use conflict by comparing monetary value according to different land use cases. Two land use scenarios were investigated: 1) land cover maintained (forest or agricultural land) and 2) land use change for solar energy generation. These two scenarios were compared in the target areas selected in this study to determine the criteria for the solar energy generation site. The economic values from Scenario 1were calculated primarily using ecosystem services assessment and market value, and those of Scenario 2 were calculated based on statistical data. The total suitable area for solar energy generation in Korea was 551,393 ha. As results, the NPV of forest ecosystem services was higher than that of solar energy generation in forest. In the case of idle agricultural land, agriculture caused a continuous deficit owing to carbon emissions, and accordingly, the carbon reduction effect through solar energy generation had a greater value than agricultural activities. This study attempted to resolve land use conflict by considering carbon neutrality through comparing economic values and introducing ecosystem services assessment and carbon credit price in the process of the analysis.</jats:p>"

Products deemed insufficiently environmentally friendly are beginning to be removed from the market, and manufacturers must achieve social responsibility and economic benefits. However, in a conventional linear supply chain, an increase in sales volume directly leads to an increase in waste and resource consumption, resulting in a trade-off between the environment and the economy. Closed-loop supply chains resolve trade-offs, achieve corporate social responsibility, and enhance competitiveness. Closed-loop supply chains must recover used products with a high degree of uncertainty. Uncertainty in the quantity, quality, and timing of used products can cause serious problems such as the bullwhip effect in the dynamic behavior of the supply chain. This study aims to analyze the dynamic impact of used product uncertainty on a closed-loop supply chain and propose ways to deal with it. Products deteriorate with their use and eventually become worthless for recovery and remanufacturing. This study confirms that, even when there is no demand variability and lead time, the uncertainty of used products, especially qualitative uncertainty, causes large variability in the closed-loop supply chain. The results of the numerical example using the model proposed in this study show that the policy of limiting the quantity of remanufacturing can mitigate the variability. Furthermore, the appropriate limits vary depending on the characteristics of the product, such as its lifetime. This suggests the need to control the amount of remanufacturing for the sustainability of the closed-loop supply chain rather than remanufacturing as much as possible, to reduce environmental impact.</jats:p>",

This influence is more complicated in a dual-channel supply chain with free riding. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how manufacturers design multi-period incentive strategies in a dual-channel supply chain to deal with moral hazard problems from retailers. In this study, we built a game theory model that contains a retailer (she) who is delegated by a manufacturer (he) to sell products in her offline and online channels and to provide experience services in a physical store. The retailer has the option of exerting effort when providing experience services to boost demand. We explored and compared the manufacturer’s strategies that cover a time horizon of multiple periods under two circumstances: full information and repeated moral hazard. The following conclusions were drawn from this study. In the repeated moral hazard game, the incentive constraints of the retailer are only related to her current and the next-period profits and independent from the profits in other periods. Moreover, the incentive strategies in each period are affected by the historical information in the previous period, while the strategies under information symmetry are not affected by history. Specially, the manufacturer can induce effort by charging an up-front payment from the retailer in the previous period and then returning a utility based on the achieved demand. Therefore, the manufacturer can postpone the payment of incentive costs and shift the risk to the next period. Furthermore, the manufacturer’s incentive strategies are also affected by the free-riding effect between channels. That is, compared with the low-state transfer payment, the high-state transfer payment was found to be more sensitive to free riding.</jats:p>"

Enhancing acid resistance in E. coli is essential for improving cell performance and production value. Here, we propose a feasible strategy for improving cellular acid tolerance by reducing ATP supply restriction. Transcriptome assays of acid-tolerant evolved strains revealed that the galactitol phosphotransferase system transporter protein GatA is an acid-tolerance factor that assists E. coli in improving its resistance to a variety of organic acids. Enhanced GatA expression increased cell survival under conditions of lethal stress due to D-lactic acid, itaconic acid and succinic acid by 101.8-fold, 29.4-fold and 41.6-fold, respectively. In addition, fermentation patterns for aerobic growth and oxygen-limited production of D-lactic acid were identified, and suitable transition and induction stages were evaluated. GatA effectively compensated for the lack of cellular energy during oxygen limitation and enabled the D-lactic acid producing strain to exhibit more sustainable productivity in acidic fermentation environments with a 55.7% increase in D-lactic acid titer from 9.5 g·L−1 to 14.8 g·L−1 and reduced generation of by-product. Thus, this study developed a method to improve the acid resistance of E. coli cells by compensating for the energy gap without affecting normal cell metabolism while reducing the cost of organic acid production.</jats:p>"

This intensifies when it comes to the Brazilian Amazon region, a place that historically already lives with several maintenance projects focused on supply chain management (SCM). Methods: Thus, this research aimed to understand the main challenges faced by professionals in the supply chain area in the Amazon region through the development of a survey with professionals in the area. This study conducted a structured questionnaire containing 10 challenges related to SCM during the pandemic period to generate a ranking of these challenges using data analysis using means and comparative ordering using the TOPSIS Multicriteria Technique. Results: It was observed that the most relevant challenges for companies in this region were, respectively, distribution, economic problems, and interruptions in supply and demand. These obstacles promote debates with the literature and foster the expansion of knowledge about the insertion of resilience elements in supply chains in the Amazon. Conclusions: From a theoretical point of view and because it is exploratory research, the results serve as a basis for researchers in the area who aim to understand and expand the debates on this topic through future research. From a practical point of view, the results can help supply chain managers in the Amazon region who work directly in its maintenance and aim to maintain its resilience, since they already have the main challenges for the proper functioning of supply chains identified and ranked. Because it is an exploratory study, the results achieved can contribute significantly to the expansion of debates in the area and in a practical way with managers involved in activities that compose supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Safe and qualitative drinking water is among the most significant conditions for minimizing environmental risks to public health. Our research goal was to develop and test methodical approaches to complex assessment of activities aimed at improving drinking water quality in centralized water supply systems. Within these approaches, effectiveness of such activities should be estimated as per health risk criteria. Materials and methods. Fuzzy set theory (fuzzy logic) was selected as relevant methodical grounds for estimating effectiveness of implemented activities. Our research objects were activities performed within regional programs and indicators of drinking water quality. A rate of public health risk was selected as a criterion to estimate effectiveness of an activity. Results. We developed a set of methodical tools that allowed assessing drinking water quality considering a variety of heterogeneous and instrumentally measurable indicators that were divided into several groups. Overall, we included more than 100 indicators that were grouped as organoleptic, sanitary-microbiological and parasitological, sanitary-chemical and radiological ones. We suggested a weighting factor for each indicator of drinking water quality. This weighting factor correlated with severity of health disorders under exposure to improper values of a specific indicator. Ranges of values for each indicator were scaled as per a degree of its hazard for human health and weighting factors were established for each indicator group. The total risk considered effects produced by all the indicator groups, their share contribution to a negative health outcome also taken into account. We determined a value of the membership function to establish where a specific risk would be found on the scale with risk rates from low to extremely high. Health risks were assessed prior to implementation of activities and after it. We also suggested a scale to measure effectiveness of implemented activities. Those activities that resulted in health risk reduction by less than 20% were estimated as low-effective ones. If a risk went down by 20-60%, activities were estimated as moderate or average-effective; a reduction by more than 60% indicated that implemented activities were effective or even highly effective. Limitations. The use of the existing information database on adverse effects and reference levels under exposure to environmental factors. Should new relevant data become available, this might result in the necessity to revise risk scales and weighting factors of specific indicators. Conclusion. We tested the suggested methodical approaches within actual projects implemented currently. The testing revealed their relevance to the existing tasks since these approaches facilitate proper assessment of activities as per a system of heterogeneous qualitative and quantitative indicators.</jats:p>",

Thanks to the actual context, in which it is possible to manage big volumes of data, connect multiple devices with IoT (Internet of Things), etc., it is feasible and of great interest to monitor the voltage at specific points of the network. This makes it possible to detect voltage sags and swells and diagnose which points are more prone to this type of problems. For the detection of sags and swells, a program written in Python is in charge of crawling all the files in the database and target those RMS values that fall outside the established limits. Compared to LabVIEW, which might have been the most logical alternative, being the acquisition hardware from the same company (National Instruments), Python has a higher computational performance and is also free of charge, unlike LabVIEW. Thanks to the libraries available in Python, it allows a hardware control close to what is possible using LabVIEW. Implemented in MATLAB, the ITIC (Information Technology Industry Council) power acceptability curve reflects the impact of these power quality disturbances in electrical power systems.

Local governments’ industrial land supply behaviors have a great impact on local investment, economic growth, and environmental pollution, which has not been effectively evaluated. To fill this gap, this paper quantitatively investigates the impact of industrial land supply by local governments on environmental pollution based on a two-way fixed effects model. A comprehensive and reliable data set for 277 Chinese prefecture-level cities from 2009 to 2017 has been collected for analysis. The findings suggest that the increase of the ratio of industrial and mining storage land to total land supply significantly increases the concentration of PM2.5. The results remain significant and robust after a series of robustness tests. The negative impacts on environmental quality caused by differences in land supply behavior are greater in the central and western regions. We further explored intermediate mechanisms for the environmental impact of local governments’ allocations of industrial land. The findings suggest that greater industrial land transfer by local governments leads to an expansion in the scale of regional secondary industry and increases in local fiscal deficit. Unbalanced industrial development, insufficient corporate innovation, and insufficient investment in environmental protection will increase pollution. This study provides a reference for improving regulatory measures on land transactions and for formulating regional polices for environmental protection.</jats:p>"

We assessed country-level supply trends of food and nutrients and their sources within the context of policy changes and political, socio-economic and climatic events from 1961 to 2013 in Zambia. Due to the lack of national food consumption data, food supply data from the FAO food balance sheets, matched to food composition tables, were used to estimate the energy, macronutrient and micronutrient content of 264 food items available to Zambia. We calculated historical nutrient supplies based on demographic characteristics and population-level dietary requirements. Results showed that Zambia was nutrition insecure from 1961 to 2013 for key micronutrients vitamin A, folate, riboflavin, vitamin B12, calcium, zinc, iron, and energy-deficient from the late-1980s. The diet has not substantially changed over time, with maize being the dominant food source. However, refined energy-dense food has steadily increased in the diet coupled with a reduction in fibre. These nutrient supply and dietary pattern trends coincide with specific socio-economic, policy, political, and climatic events from the 1970s to the early-mid 2000s, such as population growth, maize subsidy and crop diversification policies, regime change and drought. This study shows how policy, political and climatic events have been central features shaping nutrient supplies and the consequences for nutrition security. The study provides a context to inform future food policies to improve food and nutrition security.\n</jats:p>",

However, assessing and detecting the spatial matching of RES remains challenging. This study considered the nature of RES supply-side and demand-side in assessing and detecting the spatial matching relationship from the resource, management, and beneficiary perspectives. The proposed method consisted of assessment and overlay analysis parts. RES Supply Potential and Recreation Accessibility were assessed from the resource and management perspectives. RES Demand Potential, RES Flow, and RES Match/Mismatch were assessed from the beneficiary perspective. An overlay analysis was then conducted to examine the spatial relationship between the RES Match/Mismatch and the resource supply and management status to provide specific management information for protected areas. For the Yangmingshan National Park (YNP) in Taiwan, as a case study, this study revealed four RES Match/Mismatch levels in YNP, including MM+2 (RES Demand Potential ≫ RES Flow), MM+1 (RES Demand Potential &gt; RES Flow), M (RES Demand Potential ≈ RES Flow), and MM−1 (RES demand Potential &lt; RES flow). Only 5.51% of YNP belonged to M, where the areas’ RES Demand Potential were close to RES Flow and mainly located in Zone SA (Scenic Area). MM−1, where the areas were over-visited, accounted for 7.12% and were mainly located in Zones SA and EUA (Existing Use Area). As a protected area, most areas of YNP were with high RES Supply Potential; and were mainly located in MM+2 (70.87%) and MM+1 (16.50%), where the areas’ RES Demand Potential much greater or greater than RES Flow and the Recreation Accessibility were low. MM−1 were the areas where the managers should first launch actions to avoid or minimize over-visited impacts. The proposed method could detect RES Match/Mismatch rationally and directly and obtain multiple spatial datasets to support decision-making.</jats:p>"

Extended drought in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCOL) and the prospect of a warmer climate in the future pose water availability challenges for those charged with managing the river. Limited water availability in the future also may negatively affect aquatic ecosystems and wildlife that depend upon them. Water availability components of special importance in the UCOL include streamflow, salinity in groundwater and surface water, groundwater levels and storage, and the role of snow in the UCOL water cycle. This manuscript provides a review of current “state of the science” for these UCOL water availability components with a focus on identifying gaps in data, modeling, and trends in the basin. Trends provide context for evaluations of current conditions and motivation for further investigation and modeling, models allow for investigation of processes and projections of future water availability, and data support both efforts.

We assumed the manufacturer to be the Stackelberg leader and the remanufacturer and the retailer to be Stackelberg followers. The game model was solved using backward induction. We discuss the optimal operation strategies for green, low-carbon supply-chain members in a centralized decision-making model, decentralized decision-making model, manufacturer–remanufacturer cooperative decision-making model and manufacturer–retailer cooperative decision-making model. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of the unit cost savings for remanufacturing, the recovery cost coefficient and the green improvement cost coefficient on the green supply-chain members’ optimal decision and profits. The results show that increased unit cost savings from remanufacturing can increase the total profit of the supply chain and promote the recycling and remanufacturing of waste products. Moreover, the total profit of the green, low-carbon supply chain is the highest in the centralized decision-making model and lowest in the manufacturer cooperative decision-making model. When there is a cooperation relationship between the manufacturer and the retailer, the optimal recycling effort level and the optimal greenness level for the new product and the remanufactured product are the highest.</jats:p>"

Considering the created database and the digital elevation model of the terrain, it was possible to easily design the water supply and sewerage infrastructure that allowed a better management of the field measurements. In order to ensure a higher degree of details, but also to complete and verify the measurements made with GPS receivers, photogrammetric and LiDAR data were obtained using a UAS equipped with the TopoDrone LiDAR 100 Lite sensor and the Zenmuse X4S DJI camera. The field data were imported into the ArcGIS application and analyzed in order to achieve the water supply and sewerage infrastructure. In order to visualize the digitization of the elements in the field, web maps were made using ArcGIS online application. The first map allows a 3D view of the area of interest and the second map includes 5 applications: database visualization, selection of desired layers, determination of distances and surfaces, use of different basemaps as well as sharing information through email, Facebook, etc. Database and webmaps that were created contribute to an easier design of urban networks and the visualization of the land in real time.</jats:p>"

Based on transaction cost theory and resource dependence theory, this research explores the mediating effect of supply chain trust in the relationship between BCT adoption and GSCI and the moderating role of organizational culture. We examine hypotheses using two waves of survey data from 317 Chinese manufacturers. The results reveal that BCT has a positive effect on supply chain trust, and supply chain trust partially mediates the impacts of BCT on three dimensions of GSCI. Moreover, a flexible‐oriented culture alleviates the impact of BCT on supply chain trust, whereas a control‐oriented culture strengthens the relationship. This research unfolds the “black box” in the BCT–GSCI relationship by exploring the mediating role of supply chain trust, and it is seldom a study that simultaneously combines information management area (BCT), operation management area (GSCI), and organizational behavior area (organizational culture) in a framework.</jats:p>",

In this study, we analyzed the sediment-transport efficiency at different sediment concentrations and discharge levels using data from 306 non-overbank floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River from 1960 to 2016. When the sediment concentrations were below 20 kg/m3, 60 kg/m3, and greater than 100 kg/m3, the clear water volumes for transporting sediment were above 50 m3/t, approximately 16 m3/t, and less than 10 m3/t, respectively. Given current scheduling, the Xiaolangdi Reservoir can lower its water level and increase non-overbank large water flows with an outflow discharge of &amp;gt;3,000 m3/s when the incoming water flow has a sediment concentration of &amp;gt;60 kg/m3. Mathematical modeling indicates that, for an incoming sediment load of 600 million tons in the Middle Yellow River, the average sediment-transport water volume at the downstream Huayuankou Station decreased by 27%, Optimized scheduling at the Xiaolangdi Reservoir could reduce the sedimentation in the downstream channel by 1.1 billion tons more than current scheduling, and extend the reservoir's sediment-trapping period by ten years. These findings can be applied widely in sandy rivers.</jats:p>",

Hydrogen peroxide disinfection has been widely known as an effective approach for microorganism inactivation, however, it has not been much explored as a standalone solution in sanitation. In this sense, this review presents systematically organized information extracted from papers on H2O2 disinfection from 2011 to 2021. Filtered data was analyzed by content and network visualization, raising a discussion on whether H2O2 could be a potential HWT intervention, and which limitations and prospects are there for its research and implementation. In short, we found a lack of consistency in operational conditions, as most of the retrieved studies address individual use of H2O2 as control to combined treatments. Additionally, oxidant demand and kinetics considering local water quality are lacking, as well as information on residual neutralization, toxicity, and up-scaling. This critical review reveals gaps that encourage further research tackling different disinfection challenges, so that this alternative can be evaluated for implementation as an HWT technology, particularly at context-specific situations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past few decades, the water resources in the Tang–Bai River Basin showed a declining trend, due to the human–driven alteration of surface water and groundwater management. There are potential risks to the sustainable utilization of future water resources in response to agricultural, industrial, and domestic water supply. In this work, we used the water allocation and regulation model based on SWAT (SWAT–WARM model) to quantify the characteristics of water resources response under human activities in this basin. The multi–source water supply module was modified to improve the applicability of the SWAT–WARM model in this basin. We validated our simulations against observed runoff, water consumption, and supply. The main results were as follows: (a) We used the percent bias, the correlation coefficient, and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient to measure the model validity and found that the modified model did not show obvious advantages in runoff simulations, whereas it reproduced water consumption and supply better than the original model. The modified model had more advantages in reflecting the process of water resources transformation and utilization in the basin driven by strong human activities. (b) By comparing the variation of watershed water circulation fluxes under natural and human disturbance conditions in the Tang–Bai River Basin from 1995 to 2016, we found that human activities increased evapotranspiration by 6.8% and surface runoff increased by 10.0%, while groundwater resources decreased by 0.23 million m3/yr. (c) There was water shortage in the basin at different flow frequencies, among which agricultural water shortage accounted for the largest proportion, &gt;70%. The basin should further strengthen agricultural and industrial water saving, reduce water consumption fundamentally, and ensure the sustainable development of economy and society.</jats:p>"

This process contributes to various physiological activities, including embryonic development, hair growth, ovulation, menstruation, and the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue. On the other hand, it is essential in treating a wide range of pathological diseases, such as cardiovascular and ischemic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, malignancies, ophthalmic and retinal diseases, and other chronic conditions. These diseases and disorders are frequently treated by regulating angiogenesis by utilizing a variety of pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic agents or molecules by stimulating or suppressing this complicated process, respectively. Nevertheless, many traditional angiogenic therapy techniques suffer from a lack of ability to achieve the intended therapeutic impact because of various constraints. These disadvantages include limited bioavailability, drug resistance, fast elimination, increased price, nonspecificity, and adverse effects. As a result, it is an excellent time for developing various pro- and anti-angiogenic substances that might circumvent the abovementioned restrictions, followed by their efficient use in treating disorders associated with angiogenesis. In recent years, significant progress has been made in different fields of medicine and biology, including therapeutic angiogenesis. Around the world, a multitude of research groups investigated several inorganic or organic nanoparticles (NPs) that had the potential to effectively modify the angiogenesis processes by either enhancing or suppressing the process. Many studies into the processes behind NP-mediated angiogenesis are well described. In this article, we also cover the application of NPs to encourage tissue vascularization as well as their angiogenic and anti-angiogenic effects in the treatment of several disorders, including bone regeneration, peripheral vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, ischemic stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, post-ischemic cardiovascular injury, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, gene delivery-based angiogenic therapy, protein delivery-based angiogenic therapy, stem cell angiogenic therapy, and diabetic retinopathy, cancer that may benefit from the behavior of the nanostructures in the vascular system throughout the body. In addition, the accompanying difficulties and potential future applications of NPs in treating angiogenesis-related diseases and antiangiogenic therapies are discussed.</jats:p>"

The blockchain technology, due to its transparency, visibility, and dis-intermediation characteristics, helps to improve operations management of cross-border e-commerce supply chain by innovative industrial applications. However, practical applications of the blockchain technique-enabled cross-border e-commerce sector are still in their infancy and still at the proof-of-concept stage. This paper presents a systematic review on blockchain-enabled cross-border e-commerce supply chain management by employing a bibliometric data-driven analysis. All relevant publications from the Web of Science database from 2013 to 2021 were collected as the research samples. Besides, the VosViewer is adopted to conduct the network and co-word study by visualizing collaborative relationships of sampled literatures. Results show that the blockchain technique has substantial applications in the field of cross-border e-commerce supply chain, whose contributions mainly focus on cross-border e-commerce platform, supply chain operations, and data governance and information management. Academic researchers and industrial managers can promote innovative management practices in cross-border e-commerce supply chain by adopting blockchain.

Con cada altura de suministro se midieron los caudales suministrados y bombeados por los arietes hidráulicos, y la presión en la tubería de impulsión, cerca de cada ariete, en la cámara de aire y en la tubería de entrega. Esta información permitió comparar por primera vez el desempeño de arietes hidráulicos funcionando solos o en paralelo mediante el análisis de caudales, presiones, frecuencia del golpe y eficiencia de los dispositivos. Como las bombas radiales, los resultados indican que dos arietes hidráulicos en paralelo entregan más que uno, pero menos que la suma del caudal bombeado por cada uno con descarga independiente. En el rango de alturas de suministro ensayado la frecuencia del golpe de ariete y el caudal bombeado crecen con la altura de suministro, como se reporta en otros estudios. No obstante, el resultado más destacado es el efecto del bajante porque incrementa varias veces el caudal bombeado, al aumentar la frecuencia del golpe de ariete.

This goal is achieved through a critical analysis of the results of the actual state of pipelines and equipment, known approaches to the reconstruction of heat supply systems and the establishment of a generalized indicator of the conditions for increasing the efficiency of using primary fuel energy. This made it possible to formulate a generalized approach to the modernization of heat supply systems with the introduction of heat pump technologies. The most important result of the study is the established generalized dependence of the assessment of the increase in the efficiency of heat supply systems on the initial conditions of regime parameters with the rationale for the feasibility of modernizing district heating systems based on the diverse phased introduction of heat pump technologies at all stages: generation, transportation, distribution, conversion and controlled consumption of heat by subscriber system. The significance of the obtained research results lies in the fact that the proposed approach to the modernization of centralized and decentralized heat supply systems based on heat pump installations with real conversion factors in the range (3--5) with an increase in the available heat potential is to increase the efficiency and expand the use of heat from primary fuel with its savings of 1-2.7 times.</jats:p>"

Compared with conventional faults, the diagnosis of associated faults is difficult because the fault source is hard to trace and the fault mode is difficult to identify accurately. To this end, this paper proposes a graph-matching approach for the associated fault diagnosis of power supply systems based on a deep residual shrinkage network. The core of the proposed approach involves supplementing the incomplete prior fault knowledge with monitoring data to obtain a complete cluster of associated fault graphs. The association graph model of the power supply system is first constructed based on a topology with characteristic signal propagation and the associated measurements of typical components. Furthermore, fault propagation paths are backtracked based on the Warshall algorithm, and abnormal components are set to update and enhance the association relationship, establishing a complete cluster of typical associated fault mode graphs and realizing the organic combination and structured storage of knowledge and data. Finally, a deep residual shrinkage network is used to diagnose the associated faults via graph matching between the current state graph and the historical graph cluster. The comparative experiments conducted on the simulation model of an aircraft power supply system demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high-precision associated fault diagnosis, even under circumstances where there are an insufficient number of samples and missing parameters.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tidal marshes are among the world’s most valuable ecosystems; however, they are increasingly threatened by rising sea levels and a decline in fluvial sediment supply. The survival of a tidal marsh under these twin threats depends upon the net input of tidal sediments, because this will determine the deposition rate. The rate of relative sea level rise currently affecting the Yangtze Delta is rapid (~4 mm/a), and the sediment discharge from the Yangtze River has decreased by &gt;70% over recent decades. In order to improve our understanding of the response of the marshes in the turbid zone of the Yangtze Estuary to these changing environmental conditions, we measured sediment transport in and out of a tidal basin and calculated the deposition rate over eight tidal cycles covering different tidal ranges during the summer and winter seasons. The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during the flood phase of the tidal cycle (average = 0.395 kg/m3) was markedly higher than that during the ebb (average = 0.164 kg/m3), although water transport during the flood tide was almost equivalent to that during the ebb. As a result, ~40% of the sediment inflow during the flood phase was retained within the marsh. This reason is mainly attributable to the dense marsh vegetation, which attenuates waves and currents and to which the sediments adhere. The annual deposition rate in the marsh was approximately 6.7 mm/a. These findings indicate that under the combined influence of sea level rise and river sediment supply reduction, the sediment transport through the turbidity maximum zone of the Yangtze River estuary could maintain the relative stability of the marsh area to a certain extent.</jats:p>"

Five kinds of pipe materials (SP: steel plastic composite pipe, SS: stainless steel pipe, DI: ductile iron pipe, CI: cast iron pipe, GS: galvanized steel pipe) were chosen, and the soaking experiment was carried out with bench-scale devices. To further investigate the performance of pipe materials over a long term, a pilot-scale simulated drinking water distribution system was constructed, and the water quality parameters were monitored for six months. The pipe materials were ranked as SP, DI, and CI by the order of increasing turbidity, CODMn, and NH3-N. Furthermore, the biofilm samples were analyzed via pyrosequencing and COG functional categories. The DI biofilm possessed the highest bacterial diversity with a Shannon index of 3.56, followed by SP (3.14) and CI (0.77). The presence of nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB), iron-oxidizing bacteria (IOB), iron-reducing bacteria (IRB), and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)was identified, and NRB composed the largest share in all pipe materials (13.0%–17.2%), with other redox bacteria making up a minor proportion (0.02%–1.52%). NRB and IRB inhibited the corrosion process while IOB and SRB enhanced it. Most dominant genera present in samples were derived firstly from soil or active sludge, indicating a turbidity problem due to soil contamination in the distribution network.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimising fertilisation is an important part of maximising vegetable yield and quality whilst minimising environmental hazards. An accurate and efficient scheme of irrigation and fertiliser based on plants’ nutrient requirements at different growth stages is essential for the effective intensive production of greenhouse pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). In this study, the effects of reducing fertilisation rate by 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% from the day 6 to day 0 before harvest for each layer of peppers on growth, yield, quality and nutrient utilisation were evaluated. The results showed that the morphological indicators (plant height and stem diameter) and biomass of plants decreased gradually with the increase in fertiliser reduction rate. Compared with control (CK) plants, the 20–40% reduction in fertiliser application rate did not cause a significant decrease in biomass and stem diameter but significantly increased the accumulation of N (13.52–15.73%), P (23.09% in 20% reducted-treatment) and K (13.22–14.21%) elements in plants. The 20–80% reduction in fertiliser application before harvest had no significant effects on the nutrient agronomic efficiency of N, P and K elements. However, it decreased the physiological nutrient efficiency and significantly improved the nutrient harvest index of N, P and K. Appropriate reduction in fertiliser application significantly increased the nutrient recovery efficiency (20–40% reduction) and nutrient partial-factor productivity (40% reduction) of N (3.35–6.00% and 12.87%), P (2.47–2.92% and 14.01%) and K (7.49–15.68% and 14.01%), respectively. Furthermore, reducing the fertilisation rate by 20–40% before each harvest had a certain positive effect on the C and N metabolism of pepper leaves and fruits. In particular, the activities of N metabolism-related enzymes (nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamine synthase, glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase) and C metabolism-related enzymes (sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthetase, acid invertase and neutral invertase) in leaves and fruits did not significantly different or significantly increased compared with those in CK plants. The results of the representative aromatic substance contents in the fruit screened by the random forest model showed that compared with the CK plants, reducing the fertiliser application by 20–40% before harvest significantly increased the content of capsaicin and main flavour substances in the fruit on the basis of stable yield. In summary, in the process of pepper substrate cultivation, reducing the application of nutrients by 40% from the day 6 to day 0 before each harvest could result in stable yield and quality improvement of the pepper. These results have important implications for institutional precision fertilisation programs and the improvement of the agroecological environment.</jats:p>"

A total of 90 gilts (67.7 ± 6.2 kg) were distributed in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement (two ambient temperatures and three diets). Ambient temperatures (AT) were thermoneutral (TN, 22 °C for 24 h) and cyclic heat stress (CHS, 12 h to 35 °C and 12 h to 22 °C). The evaluated diets (D) were high crude protein (HP); low CP-free AA-supplemented diets (LPAAs); low CP-free AA-supplemented diets and digestible Lys level (+20%), and Lys:AA ratios above recommendations (LPAA+). The experimental period lasted 48 d (two experimental phases: days 0–27 and days 28–48, respectively). CHS pigs had higher skin temperature (P &amp;lt; 0.05) than TN pigs. Pigs in CHS had higher rectal temperature (P &amp;lt; 0.05) than TN pigs until day 38 but similar (P &amp;gt; 0.10) to TN pigs from 38 to 45 d. For the entire experiment, CHS pigs had lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) final BW, average daily gain and daily feed intake, net energy intake, body lipid, bone mineral, lipid deposition, energy retention, Lys and CP intake, and nitrogen excretion than TN pigs. The level of CP intake impacted nitrogen excretion, nitrogen retention efficiency, and urea as pigs fed HP had the highest values, and pigs fed LPAA had the lowest values (P &amp;lt; 0.05). On day 27, CHS pigs had lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) free triiodothyronine than TN pigs. LPAA+ pigs had lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) insulin than LPAA. On day 48, CHS pigs had lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) thyroxine, albumin, and lactate than TN pigs. On day 27, pigs fed LPAA+ had higher (P &amp;lt; 0.05) lactate than pigs fed HP or LPAA. Both AT and D were enough to stimulate the immune system as CHS pigs had lower (P &amp;lt; 0.05) transferrin and 23-kDa protein levels than TN pigs, and HP pigs had higher haptoglobin than LPAA on day 27. These results confirm the deleterious effects of high AT on performance, body composition, metabolism, and immune system stimulation in finishing pigs. These data also show that a diet with low levels of CP can be provided to pigs in CHS without affecting performance and body composition while reducing nitrogen excretion. However, the use of a diet with an AA level above the requirements obtained by increasing intact protein and free AA did not attenuate the impact of CHS on performance and body composition of pigs.</jats:p>",

[Objective]: As a result of the trends observed in GRACE for the Magdalena-Cauca basin in Colombia, this study investigates the water availability of the aquifer-wetland systems. [Methodology]: For this purpose, a map overlay analysis was performed using GRACE data to estimate ground- water recharge and discharge for different basins and aquifer-wetland systems. [Results]: Considering the trends in groundwater storage (GWS), we obtained water volumes and translated these into recharge and discharge esti- mates of the aquifer-wetland systems identified in the Magdalena-Cauca basin. These values show a total recharge between 2002 and 2010 of 284.65 mm, followed by a loss of 490.68 mm between 2011 and 2017. Furthermore, good correspondence was observed between the ENSO and GWS events, especially during the strong 2010-2011 La Niña and 2015-2016 El Niño events, which caused severe impacts in the country and that were particularly evi- dent in the Mojana wetland area located in the north of the basin. [Conclusions]: Although these results have yet to be validated with continuous monitoring data, the results presented in this study raise questions on the formulation of better policies and management of water resources that promote future water security.</jats:p>"

An empirical analysis on a sample consisting of 6,962 public traded U.S. corporations was conducted and the \"isolation\" consequences of board characteristics such as independence, financial expertise, and tenure on a company's earnings quality were examined. Furthermore, it was investigated whether and to what extent the tenure of outside directors influences the \"isolation\" effects of financial expertise and independence on earnings quality. The Modified Jones model was used to generate discretionary accruals, which were subsequently used to generate accrual-based earnings management. Firms with a more independent board and a higher proportion of outside directors with financial experience are found to have no effect on the degree of accrual-based earnings management. Outside directors' average tenure, on the other hand, has a negative and significant impact on earnings management. The study demonstrates that the average tenure of outside directors affects their independence as well as their financial expertise. Both have a statistically significant positive influence on accrual-based earnings management. This indicates that, even if outside directors are independent and there is at least one outside member with financial expertise on the board, the effectiveness of their monitoring decreases over time. In this study, the quality of earnings is examined using accrual-based earnings management models. The influence of these board qualities on real earnings management, however, has not been studied. As the usage of real earnings management has expanded in the post-SOX era, the utilization of these models is intriguing for future study pertaining to the effect of these characteristics. Furthermore, this study utilized and analyzed only a sample of large public U.S. enterprises, which are larger companies. Due to the SOX requirements to which these larger organizations are subject, this might contribute to a lack of diversity in the board makeup of these companies. This may have an effect on the regression findings by displaying low or non-significant effects. Future research may find it interesting to determine if there are differences between the effects of these governance qualities on earnings management for smaller and larger companies. Based on the findings, it is possible to conclude that when evaluating a firm's profits quality, it is critical to evaluate both the structure and makeup of the board, as well as the individual features of the outside members, such as their tenure. This study adds to the expanding corpus of research on the impact of board characteristics on corporate performance. It focuses on corporations situated in the United States, where corporate governance is a hotly debated topic, particularly after the enactment of SOX. It not only looks at the effect of these characteristics on earnings quality in \"isolation\", but it also responds to recent calls for researchers to look at the interaction of various board traits. It examines whether and to what extent outside directors' tenure influences the \"isolation\" consequences of financial expertise and independence on earnings management.</jats:p>"

Data from 478 elderly Korean subjects grouped as cognitively unimpaired β-amyloid-negative (NC), cognitively unimpaired β-amyloid-positive (aAD), mild cognitively impaired β-amyloid-positive (pAD), mild cognitively impaired—specific variations not due to dementia β-amyloid-negative (CIND), severe cognitive impairment β-amyloid-positive (ADD+) and severe cognitive impairment β-amyloid-negative (ADD-) were used. NC and aAD groups did not show significant volume differences in any subfields. The CIND did not show significant volume differences when compared with either the NC or the aAD (except L-HATA). However, pAD showed significant volume differences in Sub, PrS, ML, Tail, GCMLDG, CA1, CA4, HATA, and CA3 when compared with the NC and aAD. The pAD group also showed significant differences in the hippocampal tail, CA1, CA4, molecular layer, granule cells/molecular layer/dentate gyrus, and CA3 when compared with the CIND group. The ADD- group had significantly larger volumes than the ADD+ group in the bilateral tail, SUB, PrS, and left ML. The results suggest that early amyloid depositions in cognitive normal stages are not accompanied by significant bilateral subfield volume atrophy. There might be intense and accelerated subfield volume atrophy in the later stages associated with the cognitive impairment in the pAD stage, which subsequently could drive the progression to AD dementia. Early subfield volume atrophy associated with the β-amyloid burden may be characterized by more symmetrical atrophy in CA regions than in other subfields.

Morphological differences and adverse factors increased significantly with extension of stress time, but sugar beet seedlings displayed a variety of physical responses to different N concentrations to adapt to N abnormal. At 14 d, the chlorophyll content, leaf and root surface area, total dry weight and nitrogen content of seedlings treated with N0.5 decreased 15.83%, 53.65%, 73.94%, 78.08% and 24.88% respectively, compared with N12; however, the root shoot ratio increased significantly as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), glutamine synthetase (GS) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline content, especially in root. The expression of <jats:italic>BvAMT1</jats:italic>.<jats:italic>2</jats:italic> was also regulated in an N concentration-dependent manner, and was mainly involved in the tolerance of beet leaves to N stress, which significantly positively correlated to GS activity on the basis of its high affinity to N.

Sugar beet was relatively resilient to N0.5 stress according to the mean affiliation function analysis. These results provide a theoretical basis for the extensive cultivation of sugar beet in N-stressed soil.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Concerns have been raised about the significant biofouling and environmental problems caused by the large numbers of Limnoperna fortunei clinging to water intake facilities. This review first provides a summary of the occurrence of L. fortunei in typical regions including China, South America, and Japan. Furthermore, this article provides a comprehensive overview of the biological traits, risks, and control of L. fortunei. Importantly, the planktonic larval stage is a critical period for the expansion of L. fortunei. Its biofouling process mainly relies on the adhesion of byssus to substrates. Various physical and chemical methods have been proposed and used to control L. fortunei. Among these methods, sodium hypochlorite has been shown to be effective in preventing the adhesion of L. fortunei by dissolving its byssus at much lower concentrations. Overall, effective and environmental-friendly antifouling strategies are still rare, particularly in drinking water treatment systems, and are encouraged to develop in future studies. This review not only provides a comprehensive understanding of L. fortunei but also helps to guide the prevention and control of L. fortunei.</jats:p>",

In the north-central area of Shaanxi Province, 25 villages were chosen for field study in order to get a comprehensive grasp of the population and land-use conditions. The size and population of the area needing sewage and drainage infrastructure are estimated by the projection of rural population decline and the projection of rural building land scale and land-use adjustment. On this basis, sewage and drainage facilities are subsequently planned, including the contents of a three-compartment septic tank, sedimentation tank, sewage network, and ecological treatment tank. This type of water infrastructure design may not only enhance the living environment of the region but also efficiently address the issues of water collection and agricultural irrigation in the desert tablelands, enabling the efficient use of resources and sustainable growth of the community.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The range of copper sources and the nature of metal supply networks used by the El Argar culture of south-east Spain have been the subject of a long-running debate. On one side of this debate we have a model that envisages supply for much of the El Argar culture coming from a closely circumscribed region and controlled centrally by a political élite, while on the other side we have a model of a more decentralised supply network drawing on a wider, geographically more dispersed range of ore sources that is lacking the same level of political control. The available archaeometallurgical data are not entirely conclusive in this respect. While results from the existing, comparatively small body of lead isotope analyses have been taken to support, at least to some extent, the idea of a single main source region supplying most if not all of the El Argar culture area with copper, results from the much larger but not easily interpreted body of minor-element analyses would appear to lend support to the notion of a more decentralised supply. In this contribution we present new analytical data from the Lower Segura Valley, both from local copper ores and from local El Argar artefacts, which provide new insights relevant to this debate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Information related to the quality of ceftriaxone (CF) sold in northern Nigeria is limited. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the quality of different brands of CF sodium injections marketed in Kano State of Nigeria. Thirteen different brands of CF sodium for injection (three samples per brand) were obtained from patent medicines vendors (PMVs), pharmacies and a government drug store in Kano State of Nigeria. The quality of these brands was assessed using physicochemical quality-control tests (colour, appearance, labelling, pH, weight uniformity and percentage of content). The results obtained from these tests were checked for compliance with the standards specified in British Pharmacopoeia 2009 (BP 2009) and the United States Pharmacopeia 2016 (USP 2016). All 13 (100%) brands were registered with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). The samples were brands imported from other countries and passed tests for colour and pH. However, 1 of the 13 samples did not pass the labelling inspection and only 4 (30.8%) brands were found to fulfil the requirements for physical appearance. Twelve (92.3%) of the 13 evaluated brands were found to have an acceptable percentage of content within a range of 95%–105% based on BP 2009 standards. The tested brands of CF sodium injection being marketed in Kano State of Nigeria were found to have variable compliance regarding the BP 2009 and USP 2016 specifications. Therefore, there is a need for relevant regulatory agencies to embark on more post-marketing surveillance to ensure the quality of medicines in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

The traditional retail industry cannot integrate all the relevant data due to data security and privacy protection concerns so that it is unable to adjust sales strategies in an accurate and timely manner. New retail has sounded the clarion call for the retail revolution. The supply chain demand forecasting is an important problem for the supply chain management. In this research, we propose a new retail supply chain commodity demand forecasting framework based on vertical federal learning, which solves the problems of data security and privacy faced by new retail theoretically and empirically. In experiments, we use datasets from different platforms (such as social platforms, e-commerce platforms, and retailers) in the same region for federated learning. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</jats:p>",
