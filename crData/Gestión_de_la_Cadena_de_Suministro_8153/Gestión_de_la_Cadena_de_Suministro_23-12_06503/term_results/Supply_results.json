The research presented in this article is aimed at improving the efficiency of hybrid solar collectors without a transparent coating for building heating systems. One of the key challenges in the field of solar energy is the development of new technologies to ensure high collection of solar energy and to integrate it into traditional heating and hot water systems. The study shows that hybrid solar collectors with the placement of heat carrier circulation circuit tubes above the heat absorber can increase the thermal efficiency factor with a certain change in the angle of inclination and the density of solar radiation. A nomogram was also developed that determines the dependence of this coefficient on the angles of arrival of solar radiation and its density.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study includes the supply chain management practices and challenges of the three EOTC worship requirement supplies i,e Myrrh, Frankincense, and grape. Myrrh is a gum resin extracted from some small, thorny tree species of the genus Commiphora. Frankincense also known as olibanum is an aromatic resin used in incense and perfumes, obtained from trees of the genus Boswellia. A grape is a berry or typically green, purple, or black growing in clusters on a grapevine, eaten as a fruit and used in making wine. Therefore, the purpose of this study was investigating the challenges and practices of the Myrrh, Frankincense, and Grape supply chain system.  The study used methods of assessing the most relevant literatures written from the Web of Science, Scopus, and google scholar including Ethiopian reports to the world unions. The KJV version of the holy bible mentions frankincense more than 100 times, myrrh 18 times, and grapes 7-25 times. These resources are to be used prudently and according to Leviticus' instructions. The findings indicated that three elements of worship are taking place under various, negative circumstances. All three species are widely known around the world and in Ethiopia in particular, but little is being done about them because EOTC only spends 33,075,050,000birr annually. Even key users are not heavily involved in the import-export chain. Values: The chain's stakeholders are paying a high price and losing benefits as a result of this reasons. According to church teaching, it is also necessary to use isolated Frankincense, pure grape, and pure and tested myrrh. Standardization of the supply chain and frameworked stracture should asuured by stakeholder.  As far as the government concerned, and the EOTC, which accounts for the largest portion of those three consumes, it recommend to learn from the past in order to ensure future demand and supply balances.</jats:p>"

This necessitates the creation, maintenance and management of an efficient network of people and processes for production and timely delivery of the product in demand – a robust supply chain. The article is a comprehensive approach towards modern supply chain management. The purpose of this article is to illustrate the complexities faced by commercial organization in managing their supply chains, especially the ones that are spread across the globe. This article explains how the commercial world can learn from the military the ways to handle their supply chains effectively even in disruptive situations such as diseases and natural disasters in order to ensure non disruption of operations. Supply chains being lifeline of any business it pays to learn from those who are the best in managing supply chains under dire circumstances. Though blindly copying and trying to replicate supply chain management (SCM) practices adopted by the military may prove futile, a modified version to suit company-specific needs will make important differences in the efficiency of commercial operation of enterprises. We scrutinized an assortment of secondary sources including peer reviewed journal, magazines, online publications, books and newspapers to arrive at this conclusion.</jats:p>"

Viewed through the lens of agency theory, such failures are potentially caused by hidden actions of the supplier under information asymmetry and goal incongruence in the buyer–supplier relationship (as principal–agent). However, by reversing the direction of information asymmetry, an alternative cause arises: hidden expectations, where the supplier has good intentions but incomplete information regarding the buyer's true preferences and specifications. Further, following a failure, the buyer forms a causal attribution and takes subsequent action. Yet these attributions suffer from cognitive biases potentially causing buyers to misattribute supply failures, leading to costly conflict and even relationship termination. Combining agency and attribution theories, this article develops a theoretical framework to explain antecedents to a buyer's attribution process under conditions of two‐sided asymmetric information. It discusses the harmful relationship effects of misattribution. The framework can assist in identifying and minimizing cognitive biases causing misattribution, hence avoiding the unintentional deterioration of relationships that often follow a supply failure. A research agenda to examine hidden expectations and misattribution is also provided.</jats:p>",

The main elements of the interaction of the material flow on the path of its movement have been studied. The relevance and necessity of using new information technologies in logistics and, in particular, in supply chain management is determined. Digital technologies are the basis of modernity, it is one of the promising areas of development of the world economy. The use of these technologies in logistics processes in the conditions of Industry 4.0 led to the emergence of the concept of \"smart logistics\". Thanks to smart technologies, the time of many processes in both marketing and logistics is reduced. You can reduce the speed of product delivery and its quality. The development of the digital economy in Ukraine is aimed at creating motivation, forming needs for the use of digital technologies to increase production volumes, increase competitiveness and national development in accordance with the \"Concept of the Development of the Digital Economy and Society of Ukraine for 2018-2020\" [1]. This concept notes the growing demand for the use of digital processes in various industries. The concept of \"smart logistics\" is equated with \"intelligent logistics\" or \"intelligent logistics\", which involves the optimization of information logistics flows that contribute to the automation of processes. That is, with the help of smart-logistics tools (information systems), efficiency increases in those processes where they are used. The movement of material flow in logistics chains requires the storage of certain stocks in warehouses. Accordingly, warehousing also needs to improve the efficiency of its activities, as well as the transportation system. The purpose of this article is to define the concept of smart logistics, its meaning and key elements. Key information technologies used in supply chain management are analyzed in the work, and the stages of their application are highlighted. The introduction of smart technologies in logistics determines clearer processes and priorities for the use of digital innovations in the company's activities.</jats:p>"

In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, whose worldwide emergence was not foreseen, has become a major threat to supply-chain resilience and has caused the disruption of global network connections. The purpose of this study is to examine in depth the impact of uncertainty on supply-chain resilience and to determine whether information sharing has a moderating effect on this interaction. The relationships proposed in the research model are tested through empirical analyses in SEM applied to 244 survey data points from internationally operating manufacturing firms in Turkey. The findings reveal several key insights. First, it is concluded that all dimensions of uncertainty, except technological uncertainty, negatively affect supply-chain resilience. Second, although no direct effect of technological uncertainty on supply-chain resilience is found, technological uncertainty has a negative effect on resilience when the moderating role of internal and supplier information sharing is taken into account. Low-level information sharing, as opposed to high-level, creates variation in the severity of supply-chain resilience at different levels of technological uncertainty. In addition, it is worth noting that a high level of information sharing with suppliers under high-uncertainty conditions negatively affects supply-chain resilience. The results of this study, conducted within the framework of the Contingent Resource-Based Theory, demonstrate compatibility with the theory. Based on all the findings, this study suggests that managers should adopt proactive strategies to maintain high supply-chain resilience, considering today’s highly uncertain conditions.</jats:p>"

While nations across the globe are pushing for rapid adoption, they have to first address the challenges of grid overload and shutdown and intermittency of electricity supply from renewable sources. V2G technology provides a respite but is not without drawbacks. The electric school buses (ESBs), that remain idle for most part of the day, have emerged as the preferred choice in implementing V2G with obvious health, environmental and economic advantages. ESBs may appear initially as the new solution to public transportation, but it will affect our lives in many aspects besides being the environmental solution to public transportation. These EVs can be used for multifaceted functionalities than just being restricted to be a charging tool, a load balancer for the Grid or just as a means of transportation. In our digitized world the need for uninterrupted energy has attained a lot of importance. Innumerable solutions and diversified usage of EVs can be innovated from EVs existing energy sources (the batteries) to its in-built technological systems. The V2G concept, combined with smart grid technologies, offers an optimal system for the realization of the benefits offered to users, utilities, economics and the environment by electric vehicles. Electric school buses (ESB) can be used effectively to build a cleaner supply chain. This article delves into the benefits that ESBs confer upon school children, upon the communities and the economy. The health, environmental and economic benefits outweigh the initial costs involved with acquisition and usage of ESB fleet. The sustainability of using the V2G technology using school buses in supply chain management, especially where the supply chain is spread across remains a concern and warrants further research. Nevertheless, beyond a doubt, electric school buses will play a significant role so far as improving the health of the children and communities and reducing emission of pollutants is concerned.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water resources are the basic component of sustainable development of the country. Water resources are unevenly distributed across the territory of Ukraine, most settlements and enterprises located in the northern, eastern and southern regions use surface water for water supply. The armed conflict on the territory of Ukraine directly and indirectly affects the state of water bodies, as well as the provision of basic human needs - clean drinking water. With the beginning of conflict on the territory of Ukraine in 2014, water resources regularly suffer from russian terrorist actions. The aggressor uses water resources as natural obstacles, uses the destructive effect of water to kill Ukrainians and cause maximum damage to Ukrainian economy. Also, the destruction of the water treatment and water supply system is used by russian troops as a means of pressure creating water scarcity and terrible sanitary conditions in populated areas. The impact on water resources during armed conflicts in different parts of the world have common features and significant features depending on the level of the conflict and the technology of the water supply system itself. First of all, the impact of armed conflicts on water resources is direct and indirect. The direct impact on water resources as water sources is the direct destruction of water reservoirs, water intake structures and water pipes, contamination of water bodies with the remains of sunken military equipment, mines and chemicals released into the water during the decomposition of weapons. Indirect impact on water sources is in some cases more threatening than direct. The destruction of containers with oil products, chemical substances, fertilizers, which with rainwater or directly fall into water bodies, has much greater damage than the direct impact of sunk military equipment. Forest and meadows fires and other surface cover damages lead to the reduction of the lag time to the river on the catchment area, floods increasing, flooding of larger areas, increasing amount of litter, chemical pollution, and plastics in the rivers. In most of the military conflicts described in the literature, a significant deterioration of water quality in rivers is noted, associated with the discharge of both domestic and industrial wastewater. There is the destruction of wastewater treatment plants, the inability to deliver chemicals for treatment, the inability to control unauthorized discharges of wastewater leads to the contamination of the surface water sources. The report analyses the results of surface water quality researches which officially published by the Water Resources Agency of Ukraine and other governmental and scientific organizations. Monitoring of the surface water quality is carried out on the controlled part of the Ukraine, it is not yet possible to assess the consequences of armed conflict and russian activities on the captured territories.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study is based on primary and secondary data which unlocks a sequential supply chain disruption that occurred due to the pandemic and subsequent occurrences, including geopolitical tensions involving Ukraine and Russia, as well as Palestine and Israel. The geopolitical landscape is contingent upon the comprehensive strategic choices made by global leaders representing the United States, Russia, Turkey, India, the European Union, and Middle Eastern countries.   There are several attempts made by researchers and industry practitioners to appropriately synchronize the demand and supply during this disruption. Substantial research has been conducted and literature is available in the field of supply chain collaboration. However, collaboration can’t be ensured unless the end-to-end SCM is synchronized through the Sales &amp; Operations (S&amp;OP) planning.   Achieving smooth collaboration poses a formidable challenge, particularly amid disruptions and volatile conditions as seen today. This research undertakes a comprehensive examination by conducting a systematic literature review on various facets of sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP), coupled with a survey utilizing a self-administered questionnaire across 24 manufacturing industries in Bangladesh. The primary aim of this paper is to assess S&amp;OP best practices by evaluating different aspects applied in the industry, to ensure seamless connectivity, collaboration, and establishing criteria for measuring performance in the S&amp;OP process. The authors underscore the significance of integrating S&amp;OP and ultimately propose an innovative approach that integrates 10 attributes of supply chain performance measurement (SCPM) to fortify the S&amp;OP process, enhancing its overall performance and effectiveness. This study not only paves the way for researchers and academia to investigate deeper into collaboration and risk management within supply chain management (SCM) operations during disruptions but also recommends industry practitioners novel concepts to enhance overall efficiency and provide substantial visibility into business operations.</jats:p>"

SMEs are common in the nation and have significantly increased Pakistan’s GDP. To achieve and guarantee these SMEs’ effective performance, they must improve the quality of their services. For this reason, the current study has looked into the significance of Supply Chain Integration (SCI). The present research has adopted a “quantitative research design” to conduct the study. Concerning the research framework, the independent variable is supplying chain logistic issues that impact SME service quality through the mediation of supply chain integration. There are two methods adopted for the data analysis. Firstly, the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) is employed for the demographic outcomes. Secondly, regression, reliability and validity analysis are carried through the Structural Equation Model (SEM). The results of the study indicated the six linkages. Firstly, the association of High Cost of Information Technology (HCI) positively impacts Coordination and collaboration. Secondly, Quality Logistic Personnel (QLP) is positively and significantly associated with Commitment and competence. Thirdly, HCI indicated a positive link with Coordination and collaboration. Fourthly, QLP expresses a positive and significant relationship with Coordination and collaboration. Fifthly, QLP demonstrated a positive and significant association with Creativeness and customisation. Finally, QLP showed insignificant negative results with Coordination and collaboration. The present study holds greater significance in this regard. The study provides valuable insights to the employees or workforce of SME businesses to supervise or rationally monitor their supply chain performance. The service quality of SMEs has been measured through commitment and competence, creativity and customization, and coordination &amp; collaboration of sales logistic personnel.</jats:p>"

Today, the geo-information systems implemented at many Ukrainian water utilities should be used to model adverse scenarios, conduct hydraulic calculations for them, and then determine the optimal ways to improve the situation. There was also a need to conduct hydraulic calculations when developing a response program to chemical, biological, radiation, nuclear (CBRN) water pollution. The analysis of the situation presented in the article allows us to draw a conclusion about the expediency of using Epanet software for this purpose, since specialized software complexes usually do not have the necessary functions. Moreover, for systems that do not have an appropriate hydraulic model, the first stage should be its development, which will include the digitization of the original cartographic information, on-site refinement of distribution networks, determination of network loads, calibration of the model at control points.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Global supply chain management has been a critical aspect of the international business community for decades. With the rapid growth of globalization, companies have been expanding their businesses to different parts of the world, establishing cross-border partnerships and operations, and relying on global trade for their success. In recent years, the environment in which these supply chains operate has undergone significant changes. The COVID-19 pandemic, changes in government policies, and fluctuations in global trade and investment have created a more complex and challenging landscape for companies to manage their supply chains effectively. This has resulted in a need for companies to rethink their supply chain strategies, especially in developing countries such as Bangladesh. The study employs qualitative research methodology to develop an integrated freight transportation system in Bangladesh just after the changing environment of supply chain management due to COVID-19, geopolitics, and other negative impacts that brought supply chain risks/disruptions in the global freight movement from/to Bangladesh through Bangladeshi seaports. The findings of the research brought the transportation disruptions that lead to problems like operation shutdown, lost sales, late deliveries, and reputation loss remarkably. River transport emerges as the overwhelmingly preferred mode, presenting a substantial 60% of the respondents' choices whereas rail mode is only 30% but rail offers advantages in terms of efficiency and cost-effectiveness to make it a strong candidate for transporting goods Furthermore, 41.58% of respondents expressed the view that COVID-19 has significantly disrupted various activities, including the global supply chain and shipping trade. The purpose of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state of global supply chain management in Bangladesh and to identify ways to enhance the country's integrated freight transportation system. This research will examine the existing infrastructure, policies, and practices, and suggest mechanisms for improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the supply chain in Bangladesh.</jats:p>"

The primary aim is to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of how digitalization influences networks of supply chain performance. Moreover, we delve into the moderating impact of supply chain dynamism on shaping this association. Through a simple random sampling technique, survey data were collected from 293 Turkish manufacturing firms via an online survey and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings underscore that digitalization significantly enhances supply chain integration and efficiency, thereby contributing to improved supply chain performance. Notably, supply chain integration and efficiency were identified as key mediators in the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance. Furthermore, we investigate the moderating effect of supply chain dynamism, revealing its positive influence on the association between digitalization and supply chain integration. Rooted in key theories such as the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities, this study provides valuable insights by unraveling the intricate processes through which digitalization’s impact is channeled in the post-COVID-19 era. The research extends the current literature by considering the contextual role of supply chain dynamism, shedding light on the complex dynamics between digitalization and supply chain outcomes.</jats:p>"

Assessing performance is pivotal in gauging a company's managerial capacities. At PT Otsuka Indonesia, research was undertaken during an internship, involving observations and interviews. Subsequently, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were formulated, covering aspects such as accuracy in raw material usage, precision in production level planning, frequency of production plan changes, source cycle time, finished product quality, make cycle time, delivery cycle time, precision in avoiding delays in finished goods delivery, and return of finished goods. Snorm de Boer normalization was applied to calculate the KPIs, generating performance results for each indicator. Determining the ultimate performance involved weighting via the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, assigning significance levels to each KPI. Post data processing, it was evident that the finished product quality indicator had the lowest value. Consequently, improvement proposals were designed using the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method. These proposals culminated in the development of warning sticker designs for machine cleaning, comprehensive Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) usage, and scales rechecking.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In contrast to its traditional form, in which large, powerful companies were solely and exclusively responsible for supplies, manufacturing, and distribution, the supply chain has undergone substantial change over the past half-century. Today, nearly all supply chain processes are outsourced, thanks to the efforts of innovative, modern companies. The degree of risk associated with contemporary supply chains is greater than the majority of supply chain managers acknowledge, according to an accumulation of studies, analysts, and news outlets. Vulnerabilities within the supply chain remain a significant challenge for numerous organizations. Inadequate management of these risks—which include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber assaults, the credit crisis, pandemic scenarios, and war—could lead to significant declines in profitability, productivity, revenue, competitive advantage, and other metrics. Concerns regarding the risk assessment of the supply chain remain unresolved. The objective of this article is to present a risk evaluation framework that can be effectively implemented in the assessment of supply chain risks. This study makes a fundamental contribution to the body of knowledge by providing supply chain managers with a practical instrument for assessing their processes, irrespective of the mathematical underpinnings or the diverse variables employed in risk assessment. A case study from an automotive EMS production is used to compare the outcomes of multiple aggregation methods; the conclusions are then validated by risk and FMEA specialists from the same factory.</jats:p>"

This chapter provides a high-level summary of SWT to help better understand this technology's impact on broader enterprise information architectures. In many cases, it also reuses familiar concepts with a new twist. For example, \"ontologies\" for \"data dictionaries\" and \"semantic model\" for \"data model.\" This chapter presents the usefulness of a proposed architecture by applying theory to integrating data from multiple heterogeneous sources, which entails dealing with semantic mapping between source schema and Resource Description Framework (RDF) ontology, which are described declaratively using a specific query language (i.e., SPARQL) queries. Finally, the semantics of query rewriting are further discussed, and a query rewriting algorithm is presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The urgency for a shift towards cleaner and more efficient energy alternatives for power generation is underscored by the escalating demand for energy and the detrimental environmental impacts of conventional fossil fuels. In the case of automotive power, electric vehicles are being adopted in many applications, however, challenges remain such as extended charging periods and limited ranges between charges. Therefore, this research study conducts a techno-economic analysis of renewable energy technologies (including solar modules, wind turbines and piezoelectric materials) to augment the efficiency and sustainability of electric buses. The study examines the scope for these technologies to be adopted on double-decker electric buses in London in the United Kingdom. The solar modules are placed on the rooftop and sides of the bus generating 15.9 kWh/day and the wind turbine in the front bumper of the bus generates 8.3 kWh/day. However, the piezoelectric material generated only 22.6 Wh/day, rendering it an impractical inclusion in further analysis. Therefore, both the solar modules and wind turbines combined generate 24.2 kWh/day, which can increase the driving range by 16.3 km per day and this results in savings of 19.36 minutes for charging at the stations. Investing in such projects would have a positive return as the internal rate of return (IRR) and net present value (NPV) are 2.8% and &amp;pound;11,175 respectively. The annual revenue would be &amp;pound;6,712, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction would be two metric tons annually. Electricity exported to the grid, the electricity export rate, and the initial investment are identified as key factors influencing power outage in a sensitivity analysis. In conclusion, this numerical modelling study paves the way for experimental validation towards implementation of renewable energy technologies on electric bus fleets.</jats:p>"

The research aims to avoid blackouts caused by a drop in the power source voltage and to produce technological products that can be developed for other lighting applications. The constant-voltage feedback system ensures that the current flowing to the LED remains stable despite changes in load or other conditions. When there is a voltage drop from the power source, this topology can maintain the voltage and current stable and in accordance with the working voltage specifications of the LEDs. According to test results, the LED driver's output voltage ranges from 18.03 to 18.06 volts with an average message error value of 0.3%. In this system, switching occurs at frequencies ranging from 18.041 Hz to 38.230 Hz.

Based on these barriers, the authors propose an interconnected framework to explain technologically-driven T&amp;T and guide on barrier removal from AFSCs. The authors conclude that by applying technology (i.e. blockchain) the authors can resolve the tension of supporting T&amp;T in AFSCs. This can enable the efficient and transparent tracking of goods, reduction of food waste and loss, as well as promotion of the use of recyclable packaging and further sustainable practices and materials, all of which are aligned with a range of UN Sustainable Development Goals (2, 8, 10 and 12). Moreover, the authors see that some factors are interrelated. Based on these factors, the authors build an interconnected framework to guide on barrier removal from AFSCs. Managers in AFSC would find the findings especially relevant.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Drawing on industrial network theory and signalling theory, the authors propose an interconnected framework for explaining barriers (challenges) and potential solutions (opportunities) to T&amp;T in AFSCs. This framework is developed by examining the interconnections of barriers at micro, meso and macro levels and applying signalling theory to explain how solutions address these barriers. The specific contributions of this study are: the list of barriers that impede the implementation of technological solutions for T&amp;T in AFSCs; and a three-stage framework that explains how to remove the barriers for T&amp;T. The study is limited by the focus on blockchain, which calls for future research once the next decentralised technology becomes available.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

The objective of the study was to determine the effect of supply chain disruptions on market performance of selected oil and gas marketing companies in Lagos State, Nigeria.&#x0D;\nMaterials and Methods: The study adopted a survey research design. The total population of the study was 1,044 full-time employees of five selected oil and gas marketing companies in the downstream sector of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. The study sampled three hundred and sixty-two (362) respondents, who participated in the study. Stratified random sampling method was adopted, because it ensures less homogeneity, and a true representative of the sample, thereby the accuracy of statistical results can be higher than that of simple random sampling. Structured questionnaire was used to collect the primary data from the sample size. The research targeted 362 respondents in the survey, while 322 copies of the questionnaire administered were filled and returned. Therefore, the response rate was 91.7%.&#x0D;\nFindings: The three independent variables that were studied, explained 4.8% of the market performance as represented by adjusted R-square. This, therefore, meant that other variables not studied in this research contributed 95.2% of the market performance.&#x0D;\nImplications to Theory, Practice and Policy: The study recommended that oil and gas marketing companies should increase their commitment to adopting scenario planning and supply chain mapping strategies, in order to mitigate risks threatening their supply chains, in order to accomplish better performance.</jats:p>"

Tremendous opportunities to substantially move freight on waterways are present in the UK; however, several challenges have been appropriately addressed, including infrastructural gaps and various institutional support programs. The paper addresses the UK’s current situation of inland navigation and the key challenges affecting the sectors as a viable alternative transport solution. The article explores and summarises the geographic opportunities, commercial feasibility, and the current condition of the UK’S inland navigation sector. From the practical scenario of the UK’s experience, an attempt was made by the authors to find the critical challenges and issues faced by the industry. The emerging themes from the analysis of this paper indicated governance and leadership issues, cooperation, and coordination mechanism between establishments with various functions and responsibilities, merged with infrastructural investment, are strategic elements for expansion in the UK. Conclusively, the authors presented recommendations for improvement and sustainable development.</jats:p>",

This research aims to identify the components of tourism green classes, analyze their social, economic, and environmental impacts, and assess the potential implementation of green class tourism. The methodology incorporates descriptive analysis, the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), Likert scale, and a literature review. The study reveals an alignment between supply and demand for implementing edutourism green classes, showcasing visitor Willingness to Pay (WTP) lower than the Willingness to Accept (WTA) of the manager. Prospective trial tourists exhibit a higher WTP compared to prospective non-trial tourists. The economic, social, and environmental impacts of edutourism green classes indicate positive outcomes, including income generation from tourism, waste reduction, and potential sustainability impacts on green activities. In essence, the edutourism green class shows significant potential for implementation in Cibanteng Village.</jats:p>"

Specifically, drawing on literature streams in Supply Chain Operations Reference Model and Information Processing Theory, this study conceptualizes the notion of business analytics capability in supply chain network, develops its structure as a reflective model, and tests the constructs and operational measures in the model. And then this study investigates the relationship between analytics capabilities in the plan, source, make and deliver area of the supply chain network and its performance using business process orientation and information system support as moderators that form the basis of our theory. Conducting an empirical study of 170 Korean manufacturing firms, this study, through the successive stages of measurement model analysis, provides empirical evidence for modeling reflective indicator and construct of business analytics capability in supply chain network. As a result, the construct of business analytics capability is posited to reflect a combination through analytics capabilities in the plan, source, make and deliver area of the supply chain network. And the findings suggest the existence of a statistically significant relationship between business analytics capabilities and supply chain performance. The moderation effect of information systems support is considerably stronger than the effect of business process orientation. These findings provide a better understanding of the areas in supply chain network where the impact of business analytics may be the strongest.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the past ten years, consumer brands have heavily relied on traditional Business Intelligence (BI) solutions to enhance the growth and profitability across the organization. As the organization expands the need for enhanced, comprehensive, integrated, and intuitive BI solutions is increasing. To meet the need for such solutions organizations started exploring solutions for solutions. The Traditional BI tools usually cannot see the big picture because of their siloed nature, limiting the capacity of strategic decision making. This is where the Cross-functional BI solutions come into the picture offering critical benefits by bringing the capabilities of integrating data from multiple sources and giving a consolidated perspective on the organization’s performance. In this white paper, we present the costs and the benefits of implementing cross functional business intelligence solutions for brands that have a global presence. These solutions will enable decision makers and leaders to view holistic, data- backed insights across the organization. Recent Gartner studies emphasizes the importance and demand to shift towards data supported cross performing BI tools and dashboards. This paper also addresses the challenges in implementing these solutions. The most common problems are data integration issues, cultural resistance, and the need for strong data governance principles and structure. For each challenge there are solutions, especially in data-rich world with enhanced solutions, we will also discuss proven methodologies to overcome challenges, some of these methodologies involve organizational readiness assessment, se- lecting appropriate BI tools, and implementing effective change management strategies.</jats:p>"

Seasonal impact, locational disadvantages, and spoilage of the Rasagola due to its perishable nature are coming as the major deterrents at the retailers’ level where as consumers also worry about poor shelf-life of the Rasagola and quality issues in their consumption centric behavior.

We simulate various reform scenarios based on structural estimation of the labour supply and using the European tax-benefit microsimulation model EUROMOD. The results show that the labour supply response to the introduction of an EMU-UI differs substantially across countries and depends on the design of the EMU-UI. We find that a flat EMU-UI scheme implies a strong work disincentive but reduces poverty. On the contrary, a fully contribution-related EMU-UI system limits much more the distortions on the labour market in most countries but has limited effects on poverty and inequality. An EMU-UI with a common replacement rate, articulated with floor and ceiling amounts, would allow for upward convergence as it would strongly reduce poverty and inequality in several countries while not inducing substantial labour supply reduction.</p>"

The possibility of using mathematical modeling is related to the existence of stable trends that characterize many economic processes. The importance of modeling as a research method is determined by the fact that the model is a conceptual tool focused on the analysis of the researched processes and their forecasting. The need to master mathematical modeling of economic processes as a method of analysis is not limited to purely practical needs: mastering this method contributes to the formation of non-linear thinking. Thus, in addition to solving purely practical problems, the use of this method has a great ideological significance. The paper examines two models of supply and demand: linear and nonlinear. For each model, goals and mathematical formulations of the models are formulated. Methods for analyzing the coefficients of two models are proposed.</jats:p>"

Current projections suggest the supply chain crunch could impact various industries through 2022 and 2023.</jats:p> <jats:p>While there are many ramifications of this shortage, one is certainly the impact on cost. Pricing for packages built with more mature technologies, such as wire bond and flip chip, has changed dramatically. Both of these mature technologies have typically been seen as lower cost options than newer technologies, such as fan-out wafer level packaging (FOWLP). Due to the recent shortages, the cost comparison is no longer as straight-forward as it was before.</jats:p> <jats:p>This paper will analyze the cost of building various packages using flip chip, wire bond, and FOWLP technologies. Factory overhead, indirect costs, and profit margins will be taken into account to turn this into a price comparison, rather than just a comparison of direct costs. The analyses will include the price of a package built using FOWLP technology, the price of flip chip and wire bond packages built before recent supply chain disruptions, and the new expected prices of flip chip and wire bond packages.</jats:p> <jats:p>Activity based cost modeling will be used for this analysis.

This study investigates trainee reactions to employee training programs, emphasizing the dimensions of Perceived Training Efficiency (PTE), Perceived Trainer Performance (PTP), and Perceived Usefulness of Training (PUT). The research employs a quantitative approach, surveys 381 employees using stratified random sampling from eight private commercial banks in Bangladesh, and uses a structured questionnaire with a Likert scale. The study utilizes descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings reveal positive perceptions in terms of training efficiency and trainer performance. However, the perceived usefulness of training shows room for improvement. The statistical significance of the results confirms their applicability to a broader population. The study's implications suggest a need for adaptive strategies in organizational training initiatives. Continuous feedback mechanisms are advocated to refine training programs in real time, emphasizing the personalized training approaches that align with diverse learning needs and career aspirations. This study acknowledges its limitations and calls for multiple evaluation methods and comparative analysis for the assessment of training programs</jats:p>"

The concept of risk management is proposed in this study to identify significant risk factors in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis and data envelopment analysis were used to evaluate the risks of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Based on a case study on the Malaysian pharmaceutical supply chain, it reveals that the pharmacy node is the riskiest link. The unavailability of medicine due to unexpected demand, as well as the scarcity of specialty or substitute drugs, pose the most significant risk factors. These risks could be mitigated by digital technology. We propose an appropriate digital technology platform consisting of big data analytics and blockchain technologies to undertake these challenges of supply shortage. By addressing risk factors through the implementation of a digitalized supply chain, organizations can fortify their supply networks, fostering resilience and efficiency, and thereby playing a pivotal role in advancing the Pharma 4.0 era.</jats:p>"

Aba being one of the biggest cities known for commercial activities in southern part of Nigeria, couple the weight of weight and area of a water tank, has made the supply mechanism of the product costly.  This study delves into the complexities of supply chain management, aiming to identify risk assessment models, vulnerabilities, propose optimal scenarios, and recommend enhanced risk management strategies. Risk factors identification, route time estimation, critical path analysis, cost-related risk assessment, comparison of logistic choices, and decision tree and mitigation were used to instigate and determine the best path for the supply flow of the system and save cost.  From the results obtained, the analysis reveals that PATH 6 is the most time-efficient route, with the critical path identified as 62 hours, furthermore, two transportation/logistic choices were compared, with the second choice considered more cost-effective (N6.6m) than the first (N6.9m), the developed decision tree model, explores vulnerabilities in the supply chain and proposes mitigation strategies. This research has suggested some applicable guides to optimize supply chain managements, which includes partnering with distributors, leasing warehouses, or collaborating with retailers, with each decision weighed against various factors and costs to align with the company's best interests. The study underscores the importance of considering every component of the supply chain during decision-making to effectively mitigate risks.</p>"

The Weaponized Interdependence (WI) scholarship emphasizes that states centrally located in global economic networks have access to new sources of coercion. In this paper, we look at how their positions across multiple networks interact with each other to create new opportunities and vulnerabilities. We use network analysis to map the semiconductor supply chain and show that it can be viewed as four interrelated networks: (1) design, (2) raw material, (3) manufacturing equipment, and (4) assembled chips. We then highlight how states’ centrality varies across these networks and how it shapes their respective opportunities for coercion. Looking specifically at the United States, we emphasize how its centrality in the design network enables it to weaponize chokepoints in the trade network of assembled chips. In so doing the paper makes three contributions. First, it highlights how interactions among multiple economic networks provide new opportunities for states to weaponize interdependence. Second, it contributes to recent attempts using network analysis to analyze structural power on the global stage. Last, it demonstrates how network methodology can help detect potential (ab)uses of WI and how the potential for weaponization evolves over time.</jats:p>",

It provides a decentralized and secure platform for product tracking and tracing, transaction verification, and information recording among different stakeholders in a supply chain network. A blockchain is a distributed and decentralized digital ledger that keeps track of transactions across several computers or nodes. Constructing a chain of blocks holding transactional data, assures transparency, immutability, and security.The coordination and administration of numerous activities, processes, and resources involved in the production, distribution, and delivery of goods or services from suppliers to end customers is referred to as supply chain management. The capacity to follow and trace the movement of goods and information across the supply chain clearly and transparently is referred to as transparency. It guarantees that stakeholders have access to up-to-date and correct data. In supply chain management, efficiency refers to optimizing procedures, minimizing waste, increasing productivity, and simplifying operations to achieve cost-effectiveness and quicker delivery times.Blockchain technology provides real-time insight throughout the whole supply chain, allowing stakeholders to track and trace things from their point of origin to their final destination. This openness lowers the possibility of fraud, counterfeiting, and unethical behaviors, increasing customer trust. Each transaction and movement of products may be recorded and validated using a blockchain-based system, establishing an immutable audit trail. This characteristic aids in determining the origin, quality, and authenticity of items, particularly in the food, pharmaceutical, and luxury goods industries.</jats:p>"

With the given current waveform preliminary estimations of the relation of electromagnetic forces and torques of geometrically similar motors are obtained.\r\nIt is shown that even insignificant distortions in the supply current waveform may bear negative effect on increase in vibrations due to some additional torques and forces. These forces are conditioned by interaction of the main field and linear load waves from the current first and higher time harmonics. In relative units they are comparable with forces of interaction of the field tooth harmonics. Increase in the current harmonics leads to proportional increase in electromagnetic forces. At significant current harmonics some additional rise of the total level and enrichment of the spectrum of forces due to interaction of the field higher time harmonics between themselves takes place.\r\nThe computation results are compared with the experimental data for an induction motor power supplied from a pulse-width frequency converter.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the potential impact of school closures on in-person learning and parents’ labor supply in terms of paid employment and hours of work. Using a probit model, it finds that regardless of educational attainment, women with school-age children face a lower probability of being on paid employment, but the same cannot be observed among men with school-age children. The Heckman model was applied to estimate the log of hours of work. Conditional on employment, it was observed that school closures do not significantly determine the log of hours of work for both men and women with school-age children. However, further disaggregating the estimates by education reveals that female college graduates—and, to some extent, male college graduates—with school-age children tend to work more hours during school closures. In contrast, school closures do not affect the work hours of less educated men and women with children. Overall, the results suggest that school closures have a negative effect on employment at the extensive margin for women, but there is no evidence of reduced labor supply at the intensive margins. Policies aimed at preserving employment and mitigating human capital deterioration can thus address the cost of school closures on women’s labor supply.</jats:p>"

The greatest decrease in the COD index was observed in the processes of coagulation and settling of wastewater of a pharmaceutical enterprise. The effects of purification according to the COD indicator in the case of using ferrous sulfate III were 76.0% and 72.2% for the initial values of COD of untreated wastewater, respectively, 90 and 120 mg/dm3. For biological purification, microorganisms immobilized on VIA carriers were used in oxygen conditions created in model bioreactors - anaerobic, anoxic, aerobic. To increase the biomass, we used nylon textured thread according to TU 6-06-S116-87 with a fiber diameter of 1.5-2.5 mm and a microfiber diameter of 100 μm. The specific surface area was 4000-5000 m2/m3. The average concentration of biomass in bioreactors by dry matter, g/dm3, was: in anaerobic I – 30; in anaerobic II – 24; in anoxic I - 16.8; in anoxic II - 5.4; in aerobic - 3.2. Biological treatment of industrial wastewater using immobilized microorganisms made it possible to obtain high pollutant removal effects. The indicators of purified wastewater were: COD - 50-80 mg/dm3; BODfull - 15-20 mg/dm3; suspended substances - up to 15 mg/dm3; compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus - within the norm for discharge into natural water bodies. The developed technologies were implemented at industrial enterprises, the savings in energy costs amounted to 40-45%, the high quality of purified water was ensured in accordance with the current standards for discharge into the city drainage system and into natural reservoirs.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes an innovative methodology that harnesses the power of machine learning in supply chain risk assessment to enhance the ability of organizations to identify, predict, and mitigate various risks that can impact their efficiency, effectiveness, and resilience. This study addresses the inherent subjectivity in human assessment which presents a significant challenges and potential biases in the evaluation process. Auditors, who play a crucial role in identifying and assessing risks within an organization's operations, often rely on subjective judgments influenced by their experiences, expertise, and personal biases. To mitigate this issue, we employ a deconstruction approach, breaking down risk factors into sub-factors, and leverage an Artificial Neural Network model as a predictive tool for accurate risk level predictions and enhanced assessment objectivity. Real-world data from a global automotive company specializing in wiring harnesses are utilized to train the Neural Network model, on a dataset of 2100 samples, exhibits good performance of risk prediction as evaluated by appropriate metrics such as Determination Coefficients and Mean Square Error. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of risk management practices addressing the challenges of subjectivity in human assessment, to more objective by providing a reliable and data-driven framework that supports managers in strategic decision-making and fortifies supply chain operations through an early risk alarm, empowering organizations to proactively manage risks and achieve autonomy in effective risk management.</jats:p>"

Based on a case study and resource orchestration theory, this article focuses on configurations of different antecedents regarding supply chain integration and big data analytics capability to develop proactive and reactive SCR. Using survey data from 277 Chinese manufacturing firms, we consider three dimensions of supply chain integration, information integration, operational integration and relational integration, and three dimensions of big data analytics capability, technical skills, managerial skills and data driven‐decision culture, and conduct fuzzy‐set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore antecedent configurations generating high proactive and reactive SCR. We find that multiple antecedent configurations can achieve high SCR and configurations for high proactive and reactive SCR are not identical, which may involve alternative effects across different antecedents. We further implement propensity score matching analysis and reveal that firms following these configurations for high SCR also have better economic and operational performance. Moreover, we check the robustness of findings by using secondary data and attributes analysis with machine learning. This article complements and extends existing SCR literature from the configurational perspective and provides practical insights for managers to build SCR.</jats:p>",

In particular, the performance in terms of production capability, raw material capability, import-export, quality, financial, demand-supply, and job creation potentials of textile industries in the Ethiopia scenario were studied. Regionally, because of weak and infant supply chain integrations, there were problems in resource utilization, poor production processes, poor information flow, infant technological capability, problems in infrastructure, problems in warehouse systems, and infant logistics infrastructure. As a result of this, the performance and competitiveness of local textile and apparel industries were poor and weak at national, regional, and global levels. The study also reveals important findings about the substantial and highest positive relationships between firm performance and internal, supplier, and customer integrations, from the highest to the lowest level, respectively. Based on our findings, the highest internal, better supplier, and good customer and fair government support integrations have a positive impact on the performance and global competitiveness of the textile and apparel manufacturing industries. Field observations, questionnaires, interviews with company representatives, company reports, and data were gathered from 33 Ethiopian textile and apparel industries, with 175 respondents included in the study. The primary and secondary data were analyzed using a descriptive analysis, the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS), and FAHP tools. Finally, the implications for policy on the supply chain integration capability of supply chain strategies were shown, and the future research agenda was presented.</jats:p>"

Nutrients may thus alter the outcome of pathogen priority effects for the host, but this possibility has received little experimental investigation. To disentangle the relationship between nutrient availability and coinfection dynamics, we factorially manipulated nutrient availability and order of arrival of two foliar fungal pathogens (<jats:italic>Rhizoctonia solani</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>Colletotrichum cereale</jats:italic>) on the host grass tall fescue (<jats:italic>Festuca arundinacea</jats:italic>) and tracked disease outcomes.

This report mainly uses simple OLS regression method and fixed effects OLS to study the impact of EPU on commercial credit supply. The results indicate that an increase in EPU will significantly reduce the commercial transaction credit provided by companies. After eliminating the impact of time and industry, EPU has a more significant impact on the credit supply of commercial transactions. Thus, for policy makers, it is necessary to maintain the stability of economic policies as much as possible and, if necessary, supplement corresponding supporting measures to alleviate the adverse effects of EPU.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cybersecurity is paramount in today’s rapidly evolving healthcare industry, particularly as supply chain management and logistics undergo digital transformation. This study examines the substantial threat posed by cybercrime to patient safety, data security, and operational efficiency within healthcare logistics and supply chain management. These risks can significantly impact an organization’s reputation and financial stability, necessitating vigilant detection and mitigation efforts by healthcare companies. As the primary defence against online threats, cybersecurity plays a pivotal role in preventing data breaches, cyberattacks, and other malicious activities that could have devastating consequences for the healthcare sector. Its core objective is to ensure the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of data, systems, and resources within the realm of healthcare supply chain management and logistics. Patient data protection stands out as a critical aspect of cybersecurity in this context. Healthcare logistics and supply chain management systems frequently handle sensitive patient data, encompassing billing details and medical histories. The compromise of such data places patient trust and the organization’s regulatory compliance at risk, potentially leading to identity theft, fraudulent claims, and privacy breaches. Furthermore, safeguarding the security of medical equipment is of paramount importance. With the increasing connectivity of these devices through the Internet of Things (IoT), they become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Apart from jeopardizing patient safety, a breach in medical device security raises questions about the authenticity and reliability of healthcare products and services. Another pressing issue that healthcare institutions must address is unauthorised access to their systems. Cybercriminals persistently seek entry points into these systems to exploit vulnerabilities for illicit or profitable purposes. Robust cybersecurity measures are essential to thwarting unauthorised access and ensuring that only authorised individuals can access and modify sensitive medical data. Maintaining the accuracy of patient records is crucial for efficient supply chain management and healthcare logistics. Cyberattacks that manipulate or corrupt patient records can lead to medical errors, endangering patient safety. Consequently, cybersecurity measures must include safeguards to preserve the integrity and accuracy of these records. Beyond these immediate concerns, cybersecurity is instrumental in preventing disruptions to healthcare operations and services. Downtime resulting from cyberattacks can be catastrophic, impeding patient care and undermining the overall effectiveness of supply chain management and healthcare logistics. Cybersecurity safeguards continuous healthcare services by guaranteeing the security and accessibility of data and systems. Furthermore, cybersecurity plays a pivotal role in protecting the integrity, trust, and reputation of healthcare organizations. A cyberattack or data breach can tarnish an organization’s reputation and erode patient confidence. Such damage can have enduring repercussions, affecting an organization’s ability to attract clients, partners, and investors.</jats:p>",

The growing demand for efficient supply chain management, combined with the need to reduce costs and improve services, has led to the adoption of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has become a key catalyst in the transformation of logistics, giving way to what is known as Logistics 4.0. This paper explores the most recent trends of AI in international logistics and its integration into education, with a specific focus on the San Mateo University Foundation.Methods: This mixed study, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, begins with quantitative data collection and analysis, followed by a qualitative phase. The qualitative approach focuses on students' perceptions of logistics training, while the quantitative approach describes how they perceive AI tools. The research included students and companies in Bogota, analyzing their familiarity with AI and its implementation in practice.Results: The findings indicate that AI is increasingly relevant in logistics, especially in process automation and data-driven decision making. Most companies surveyed have a good understanding of AI, but less than half implement it in their operations. Students recognize the importance of AI in logistics and its positive impact on education. There is consensus on the role of AI in improving educational quality, highlighting its usefulness in optimizing processes and personalizing learning.Conclusions: The research highlights the crucial role of AI in modern logistics and its ability to improve operational efficiency. The integration of AI in international business education is critical to enrich students' learning experience and prepare them for the challenges of the labor market. The blended methodology used is effective in gaining a holistic view of AI integration in logistics and its educational impact. The conclusions provide guidelines for curriculum development in international business with a focus on international logistics, aligning curricula with emerging trends in logistics and AI.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">A vast web of organizations, companies, and teams involved in creating, researching, and producing drugs and associated products makes up the pharmaceutical sector. In this context, the term “supply chain” refers to the network of individuals, processes, information, and resources that transform raw materials and parts into finished goods and services before being supplied to customers. The pharmaceutical supply chain system, then, offers customers medications in the right amount, at the right time, with acceptable quality, and for the lowest feasible cost. Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly contracting out their supply chain activities due to the severe push to keep R&amp;amp;D expenses under control. Instead of being a cost-cutting measure, global supply chain outsourcing can be seen as a strategic competitive weapon that can improve positional advantage, offer production flexibility, and meet the ever-increasing expectations of final consumers. Global supply chain outsourcing is crucial for pharmaceutical firms to enhance performance and profit margins by leveraging core skills and resources beyond other strategies which can lower risk, increase flexibility, improve returns on capital, and improve a company’s ability to respond to the needs of its shareholders and consumers. Even while there is widespread recognition of the alluring advantages of global outsourcing, many of the related concerns are frequently disregarded. In addition to briefly discussing risk assessment methods, the goal of this work is to offer manufacturer-focused insight into supply chain-related outsourcing concerns within the pharmaceutical industry.</jats:p>"

Smart tools help the real-time data-exchange, the better information-flow. The supply chains are counting many members nowadays, that is the reason why this smart tools could help the supply chain members. But this growth also includes the problem of coordination; to manage the increased number of chain members is getting to be more difficult but at least so important in the case of efficiency. To decrease the replenishment times and the delivery period, to choose the cost-saving shipping methods are just one of the most important factors to get profit across satisfying all of the customers. Supply chain coordination recommends the contracts to coordinate the relationship of chain members. There are many contract types to use, but it is a very important thing to choose the one which fits the best to the specific relationship. It means if a wrong one is chosen it will not coordinate the chain and neither the partners’ relationship. So the choice has strategic importance. The paper analyzes two companies; their attitudes – what do they prefer in the construction of contracts (prices, quantities, discounts, etc.), the different level of dominance – so in short the factors which influence the choice of the companies. A numerical example for the case study is also included to compare the contracts.</jats:p>"

However, due to the constraints of bounded rationality within firms, the issue of dynamic pricing may rise. In light of this context, this paper employs a dual-channel framework to investigate the manufacturer’s green product development and pricing problem over a continuous timeframe. In this framework, the manufacturer markets traditional products through offline retailers while simultaneously launching green products via an online platform. In recognition of the practicality of multi-period operations, we also take online delay time lag, price adjustment speed, green input level, and consumer channel loyalty into account and explore their impacts on the equilibrium price of the dual-channel supply chain of green products. Utilizing the eigenvalue method, we delve into the dynamic pricing game and ascertain the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium point. Our research establishes critical thresholds for delay time lags and green inputs. Beyond these thresholds, equilibrium destabilizes, resulting in price unpredictability. Furthermore, we identify a crucial maximum for the rate at which manufacturers modify prices for green products in online markets. If this adjustment rate falls below the threshold, the system maintains stability. Additionally, both the extent of green inputs and the customer channel loyalty of manufacturers significantly impact both equilibrium stability and the resulting price within the system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There has been a paradigm shift in the functioning of global supply chains, particularly in thepost-pandemic era. This shift is characterized by the convergence of technology. deployment, geopolitical dynamics, and an increased awareness of environmental and social responsibilities. These transformative changes compel businesses to navigate a complex. web of challenges while simultaneously creating many opportunities for global supply chains. This includes delegating responsibilities to the supplier side, empowering suppliers, and promoting digital supply chain networks. \nOngoing trade tensions between major economies, such as the United States and China, have resulted in fluctuations in global logistics patterns. Alterations in tariffs and trade agreements impact shipping routes, transportation costs, and the overall flow of goods. Consequently, supply chains must focus on end-to-end supply chains originating from low-cost sources to withstand unforeseen events like black swan occurrences and geopolitical and trade wars. \nThe pandemic has underscored the critical importance of building resilient supply chains. Many firms reevaluate their supply chain strategies, emphasizing diversification to mitigate risk. This involves reassessing suppliers, exploring alternative sourcing options, and increasing safety stock levels. Geopolitical uncertainties and disruptions have prompted reconsidering global sourcing strategies, with reshoring and nearshoring gaining prominence. Companies seek to mitigate risks associated with distant and complex supply chains by bringing production closer to target markets, enhancing responsiveness, reducing lead times, and fortifying supply chain resilience amid uncertain business conditions. \nFrom the traditional supply chain model, there is a continuous effort to integrate information technology to transform value streams and increase processes' transparency. Blockchain is playing a significant role, from tracking the provenance of raw materials to reducing transaction fraud. This technology fosters a new level of trust among supply chain partners, safeguarding against potential disruptions and reinforcing the integrity of the entire supply chain ecosystem. These rapid transformations amid uncertain conditions have prompted a reevaluation of supply chain resiliency with a greater focus on risk mitigation strategies. \nIn global logistics, owning ships and manufacturing/leasing containers for extended periods have become the guiding principles. The recent Brexit has also impacted global transport's European and UK legs. The European industry is grappling with significant shortages of resources, including drivers and trained supply chain manpower, affecting last-mile delivery and land transportation in numerous geographies. The growth of e-commerce has significantly influenced supply chains, leading to innovations in last-mile delivery solutions. Companies are investing in warehouse automation, drone deliveries, and other technologies to meet the demands of the rapidly expanding e-commerce market. x \n\nFurthermore, a seismic shift toward sustainability reshapes the global supply chain landscape. Businesses recognize the imperative to address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. Initiatives to reduce carbon footprints, optimize transportation routes, and embrace ethical sourcing practices are becoming integral components of supply chain strategies. Sustainability is no longer merely a corporate buzzword but a critical factor in ensuring long-term viability and meeting the expectations of socially conscious consumers. \nOverall, global supply chains are undergoing significant transformation driven by technological innovation, environmental consciousness, and a commitment to building resilient networks. Businesses that embrace these trends are not only adapting to the challenges of today but are also positioning themselves to thrive in the dynamic landscape of tomorrow. The key to success is navigating change, leveraging technology, and building sustainable businesses.</jats:p>",

A growing recognition of the complexity and intricacy of contemporary supply chain networks has sparked interest in novel methodologies such as DBNs that can model temporal and spatial dependencies effectively. DBNs emerge as a powerful analytical tool enabling probabilistic inference under prevailing uncertainties, capturing both the inherent and external risks. The paper demonstrates how these networks, bestowed with both temporal and causal mathematical frameworks, offer superior analytical traction over traditional methods in understanding the interconnected risk elements. We discuss their ability to appraise the ever-changing vulnerabilities in a supply chain setting, dynamically adapting to modifications brought by stakeholder actions or market changes. As supply chains burgeon in complexity, the role of DBNs in enabling a robust, comprehensive understanding of risk factors becomes increasingly paramount. Thus, the paper advocates for the DBNs' application as a transformative approach to risk assessment, providing significant foresight and adaptability in an unpredictable supply chain landscape.</jats:p>"

However, the transformation resistance is relatively high due to the traditional ship-owner and cargo-owner transaction model. In response, some dry bulk shipping companies have started exploring the potential of e-commerce platform applications. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current situation and analyze the prospects of e-commerce platform integration in the dry bulk shipping industry from a supply chain perspective. The study will examine the benefits and challenges of e-commerce platform adoption in dry bulk shipping, the impact of platform integration on supply chain efficiency, and the potential implications for future industry development.</jats:p>"

While extensive research exists on the strategic location of warehouses in network optimization, there is a notable dearth of research on how to relocate a warehouse from one site to another, particularly while minimizing associated risks. This study sheds light on a low-risk approach undertaken by a multi-level marketing (MLM) company in Malaysia during the relocation of their warehouse. The study primarily addresses several key constraints: (i) Completion of the warehouse relocation exercise in 4.5 months; (ii) Termination of their warehouse staff services during the relocation; (iii) Elimination of disruption in the order fulfillment service level; (iv) Management of temperature-sensitive goods during the transfer and storage; (v) Seamless linkage between the third-party logistics (3PL) warehouse management system (WMS) and the company's systems. The primary objective of this study is to propose a resilient strategy for the relocation of their warehouse, taking into account these key constraints faced by the company.</jats:p>"

In the New Keynesian model, price markup shocks need to be several orders of magnitude bigger than other shocks in order to fit the data, leading to unreasonable assessments of the magnitude of the increase in costs during inflationary episodes. To account for the facts, we propose a strategic microfoundation of shock-dependent price stickiness: prices are sticky with respect to demand shocks but flexible with respect to supply shocks. This friction is demand-intrinsic, in line with narrative accounts for the imperfect adjustment of prices. Firms can credibly justify a price increase due to a rise in costs, whereas it is harder to do so when demand increases. Inflation from supply shocks is efficient and does not justify a monetary policy response.</jats:p>"

Therefore, it is necessary to innovate the supply chain collaborative logistics mode based on information technology. Jigsaw method attaches great importance to the students’ cooperative learning and the teacher’s effective guidance in class. The introduction of jigsaw method into listening class is a new attempt for listening course. Therefore, the paper centers on the teaching procedure in a jigsaw classroom and the beneficial effects it produces.

European countries began to increase LNG imports from the United States and other sources. They also began developing alternative types of energy, such as nuclear energy and renewable sources. However, these measures required a lot of investment and time, and also had a number of drawbacks.The sanctions war against Russia led to a sharp reduction in demand for Russian oil, as well as to a collapse in its prices on the world market at the initial stage. In addition, Russia lost its traditional markets in Europe and was forced to look for new consumers, primarily in Asia.The author describes the features and history of OPEC development and assesses the relationship between the organization and Russia.

Furthermore, supplier integration was positively related to both product innovation capability and operational performance. Likewise, the link between product innovation capability and operational performance is positive. The study uniquely evaluates that product innovation capability positively mediates the impacts of internal and external integration on operational performance. The outcomes of this study will help managers of manufacturing firms boost their firms’ product innovation capability and operational performance by focusing on supply chain integration.

The use of sustainable materials has drawn a lot of attention recently as a crucial step in accomplishing these goals. Choosing the material that is most suited for a product can be difficult, despite the fact that there are many sustainable materials available. This study uses machine learning – a random forest algorithm and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to optimise the use of sustainable materials in supply-chain operations. The study uses machine learning algorithms to analyse data on different sustainable materials, their characteristics and their effects on the environment. The study also investigates how an optimised material selection affects the whole supply chain, including the production, packing and shipping operations. The research offers a complete strategy for reducing the environmental effect of industrial processes by combining approaches from material engineering, supply chain management and machine learning. The novelty of this work resides in its integration of material engineering and machine learning strategies to enhance the supply chain choice of sustainable materials. As a notable example, the study highlights the potential of mycelium as a sustainable material for air conditioner components. Mycelium’s unique properties, such as its biodegradability, lightweight nature and adaptability position it as a promising candidate, enhancing the environmental profile of air conditioners. By incorporating mycelium-based components, manufacturers can significantly reduce carbon emissions, resource consumption and waste generation throughout a product’s lifecycle. This investigation underscores both the viability of mycelium and the broader significance of innovative material choices in reshaping industries towards a more sustainable future. Through such advances, this research not only contributes to the air conditioning sector but also establishes a paradigm for sustainable material adoption with far-reaching positive implications.</jats:p>"

The flow of financial resources in supply chains is most important and has become the focus of study. As a result, the integration of finance and supply chain management has opened new business areas for banks as well as financial and logistics service providers. Supply Chain Finance solution can create a 'win-win' situation for both buyer and supplier. So this research article focuses on the study of supply chain finance (SCF) in SMEs.&#x0D;\nDespite the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in India account for over 62 million jobs and approximately 30 percent of the country's GDP, the great majority of them lack access to affordable loans from traditional banks. They are so often left with little choice but to resort to informal lenders, who charge usurious interest rates in order to meet their borrowing demands. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of the credit gap, which include but are not limited to higher costs, lower profits, slower growth, and a lack of resilience in the face of economic volatility (Iyer, 2021). Here, supply chain financing (SCF) could be helpful in bridging the trust gap by equipping lenders with more resources to manage credit risk and broadening the scope of financing to include vast pools of poorly understood MSMEs. SCF provides buyers and sellers with risk mitigation solutions based on technological advancements in order to reduce financing costs and increase company efficiency. Since SCF is still in its infancy, there is a pressing need to make this facility accessible to the vast majority of MSMEs so that they, in turn, can benefit from the positive effect it has on the performance of currently-adapted firms.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The challenges posed by such emergencies underscore the critical need for robust contingency plans, efficient risk management strategies, and agile supply chain frameworks. The interdependencies and vulnerabilities within the supply chain make it particularly susceptible to disturbances caused by these unforeseen events. The outbreak of COVID-19 has made supply chains worldwide face huge impact and interference, so the interruption of the supply chain has once again become the focus of global attention. Scholars have researched supply chain risk identification, risk assessment and risk response strategies under public emergencies. This paper will sort out the research results of scholars on the coping strategies of agricultural supply chain interruption in the background of public emergencies in China, summarize and put forward the prospect of the future research direction, and provide a reference for the coping strategies of agricultural supply chain interruption in the background of public emergencies.</jats:p>"

Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as a hydrological model was applied to simulate the natural inflow of the lake's ecosystem in the simulated period. Moreover, a hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate the salinity distribution of the lake in the same simulated period. Based on the results of the models and monthly analysis of the environmental flows, both models are robust for simulations. The Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of both hydrological and hydrodynamic models average more than 0.5, which means that they are reliable for simulating the natural inflow and salinity distribution respectively. Furthermore, outputs indicated that using the hydraulic rating method considering the base flow for assessing the environmental flow of rivers is not able to provide environmental requirements in the lake's ecosystem of the case study.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the aim of our work is to investigate the age-related morpho-functional changes in the hemomicrocirculatory bed (HMB) of the myocardium in rats with experimental streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (SDM) under conditions of chronic immobilization stress (CIS). The study used heart fragments and blood from 56 2-month-old and 6-month-old male white rats, which were divided into 3 groups: 1 group with comorbid pathology, including modeled SDM and CIS, 2 group with SDM, and 3 – control group. The material was collected 14th and 56th days from the start of the experiment. According to our findings, hyperglycemia, and stress on the 14th day of the experiment lead to spasm of the arterioles of the HMB and a significant deterioration in their permeability, as evidenced by a likely increase in the Vongenwort index in the arterioles. On the 56th days, in the experimental groups of 6-month-old rats, vacuolar dystrophy and coagulation necrosis of endotheliocytes and myocytes, focal destruction of capillary walls, thickening, and proliferation of their basement membrane, pronounced micro- and macroclasmatic changes, and capillarosclerosis are observed. In contrast, 2-month-old rats alongside destructive changes in HMB vessels show phenomena of neovascularization. Thus, SCD leads to the development of diabetic microangiopathy in the vessels of the myocardium of rats of different age groups. In animals with comorbid pathology, damage of HMB vessels are more pronounced on the 56th day of observation and is manifested by: destruction of capillary walls, capillarosclerosis. In 2-month-old rats, alongside destructively changed capillaries, we found to former new vessels with a characteristic ultrastructure.\n\nKeywords: heart, heart failure, diabetic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, hemomicrocirculatory bed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The regions with the best economy have a greater capacity to develop low-income or social impact housing, thus contributing to the reduction of poverty, and therefore, to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals. This is observed in fewer people living in extreme poverty and with fewer unmet basic needs. The present article analyzes the correlation between development by the main economic sectors in the different regions (departments) of Colombia, and the offer of low-income housing. The valid relationship found is between the economic condition of the regions (GDP) and non-social housing (more expensive commercial value) (Spearman´s Rho: 0.9). That means that there is an imbalance between regional economic capacity and the low-income housing offer because their economic potential allows them to have less of a demanding population, that is, living in poverty. This correlation is higher with activities that are mostly developed in an urban environment, such as manufacturing, construction, real estate, and finance and insurance. On the contrary, the correlation is lower with industries such as mining and agriculture, which mostly operate in rural areas. The analysis for low-income housing and economic sectors GDP yields low correlations, but are especially dismissible for more rural industries, such as mining and agriculture. The analysis shows the change of trend in the correlations for the year 2021, the beginning of the post-pandemic economic recovery.</jats:p>"

Considering market segmentation of consumer types in organic agricultural products (OPs) and conventional agricultural products (CPs), this study builds a game-theoretical model to explore how participants decide between blockchain traceability platforms and organic subsidy strategies. Results show that the producer should introduce the blockchain when the fraction of blockchain technology’s total cost shared by the producer is smaller and the fixed cost of implementing blockchain is higher or when the fraction of blockchain technology’s total cost shared by the producer is higher and the fixed cost of implementing blockchain is lower. The retailer is inclined to an organic subsidy, and the smaller the market proportion of undifferentiated-conscious consumers (UCCs), the more inclined the retailer is to the organic subsidy strategy. In addition, the market share of UCCs positively promotes the sales quantities and supply chain profits of CPs but is not conducive to the sales quantities of OPs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural productivity is expected to decrease under changing climate conditions that correspond to the stability of West African food systems. Although numerous studies evaluated food production gaps or impacts of climate variability on crop yields, many uncertainties are associated with climate extremes, but also rapid population growth and the corresponding dietary lifestyle determine farming activities. Here, we present a food supply and demand analysis based on the relationship between climate change, crop production, as well as population growth in three experimental sites from southwestern Burkina Faso to southwestern Ghana. The method consists of a tiered approach that encompassed a statistical analysis of historical climate as well as agricultural time series using boxplots and a trend test by Mann-Kendall. Food balance sheets were calculated by estimating the demand using a population growth model linked to food supply with local consumption patterns. Results of the boxplot analysis revealed for the majority of climate time series light to strong right-skewed distributions with either a few heavy rainfall or hot temperature events. We found almost insignificant rainfall and temperature trends for both sites in the Sudano-Guinean savannah. The rainfall regime of southwestern Ghana indicated an insignificant upward or downward trend while the temperature significantly increased over time. Crop yield boxplots demonstrated mainly right-skewed distributions for cereals, legumes and tubers as well as cash crops such as cotton. Backed by the Mann-Kendall test, maize and sorghum significantly enhanced in both study areas of the Sudano-Guinean savannah. Southwestern Ghana depicted a different crop pattern where cassava and plantain showed a strong upward trend at a confidence level of 1%. The grouped food balances sheets across the regions illustrated a surplus for the Sudano-Guinean savannah ranging from 221.2 megatons (Mt) to 4,846.77 Mt while southwestern Ghana exhibited a deficit between -193.33 Mt and -16,188.82 Mt. Despite a growing yield of various crops, food demand outpaces the regional production. Hence, it is recommended to focus on a larger array of commodities, imports and marketing of farm products.</jats:p>"

Data were collected from organisations in Egypt through a questionnaire survey and were analysed using structural equation modelling. Based on 811 responses, a multi-mediation model analysis using Smart-PLS recognises that geographical concentration, networked collaboration and supporting services systems are critical supply chain cluster design characteristics that offer a pool of resources and collective knowledge that help organisations build absorptive capacity and resilience, which, in turn, help in protecting, reconfiguring and developing the shared resources to achieve high levels of environmental, social and economic sustainability. The findings affirm that supply chain clusters can be used as a tool to maintain desired sustainability levels in a dynamic business environment as it will allow organisations to cope with sudden changes in the market quickly and efficiently. This will allow organisations to improve sustainability performance by developing their dynamic capabilities with enhanced supporting services and network collaboration, thereby adequately exploiting external knowledge and opportunities, as well as effectively mitigating business vulnerability. This will also help in extending the three theoretical lenses through contextualising their abstract ideas in a supply chain cluster context and analyse data from a developing market. This is particularly important as further investigation is needed regarding supply chain clusters and the relationship between dynamic capabilities and sustainability in different contexts, especially since previous studies focused on developed economies and did not use the combination of these variables.</jats:p>"

The market is free to determine the means of production and prices, and there should be no interference that results in the destruction of the market balance.

One of them is the practice of hoarding or what is often referred to as monopolistic practices carried out by producers or sellers so that the availability of basic necessities is getting thinner and scarcer so that they can play prices in the market. Seeing this, this article aims to see whether hoarding practices are a form of market engineering in supply (ikhtikar) and to explain the views of Islamic Economics regarding hoarding practices (monopoly). This article is a library research and uses a qualitative method with a normative approach. The data source used is secondary data derived from books, journals and articles related to the practice of ikhtikar, hoarding, and monopoly as well as how Islamic economics views. The results of this study found that price fluctuations also occur due to fraudulent actions in the market such as hoarding by speculators. The act of hoarding in question is market engineering in supply (ikhtikar). The practice of ikhtikar is strictly prohibited in Islamic Economics because it can disrupt the market mechanism. For this reason, the role of the government as a policy maker is needed to regulate in order to create a fair price.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chinese enterprises have indeed recognized the importance of sustainable practices in their global supply chains, with one key practice being the enhancement of supply chain transparency. These enterprises are implementing measures to trace and track raw materials and components, ensuring compliance with sustainability standards and ethical sourcing practices. This transparency is crucial in identifying and mitigating environmental and social risks within the supply chain. However, it is important to note that there is still a lack of extensive research in the context of China regarding sustainable practices in global supply chains. While some studies and initiatives have been conducted, there is a need for more comprehensive research to understand the specific challenges and opportunities faced by Chinese enterprises in adopting and implementing sustainable practices throughout their supply chains. The objective of this study is investigating the research progress on issue related Sustainable Practices in Global Supply Chains of Chinese Enterprises. In doing so, systematic literature research was implemented on the supply chains of Chinese enterprises' foreign direct investment (FDI) to provides insights into the penetration and significance of sustainable concepts in this topic. This paper utilizes advanced data visualization techniques and an in-depth literature review to comprehensively summarize and review previous research extracted from the Web of Science database.  The study included 518 articles and analyzed them through RStudio and VOSviewer software. Research analysis reveals that most of the past research articles on this topic primarily come from China, followed by large economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom. However, when ranked by influence, the order is Canada, the UK, and the US. Around 2020, collaborations between countries mainly occurred in Asian nations. China, enterprises, and FDI are currently the most popular keywords. The importance of sustainability in the research on FDI in Chinese enterprises has been verified through data analysis and theoretical review. Key terms related to sustainability, such as \"carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, and energy consumption\", are expected to play a vital role in future research. Current theoretical studies confirm that integrating environmental, social, and economic goals (ESG) into supply chain operations can implement a sustainable philosophy for the entire product lifecycle in Chinese OFDI enterprises. Disseminating sustainable management principles in supply chains among Chinese OFDI companies can contribute to ESG sustainability goals, while also enhancing the long-term profitability of the companies themselves.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Internet era, business model is innovating constantly. The emergence of O2O combines the consumer behavior that should have occurred offline with the Internet, making various e-commerce platforms a bridge between consumers and sellers. Under the influence of factors such as the epidemic, a large number of the O2O agricultural products supply chains have emerged. Besides, carbon emission is one of the most important and hottest issues around the world now. Many Countries have clearly put forward the goals and strategies for the greenization planning on all enterprises. To implement the theory of greening development, carbon emission reduction in supply chain processing is an essential way. However, due to supply chain information asymmetry and other issues, it is difficult to verify and supervise the supply chain carbon emission reduction process. As an emerging technology, blockchain has the functions of information traceability and anti-tampering. Blockchain can effectively promote carbon emission reduction in supply chain processing. In the meantime, enterprises can use blockchain to monitor and control fresh agricultural products' quality and promote industrial transformation. This article systematically reviews the relevant literature about the above factors to provide a reference for future research on this topic.</jats:p>"

Yet, manufacturers’ perceptions govern their actions and are likely to determine the relative investments in each flexibility dimension. The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate supply chain flexibility from the manufacturer’s perceptive to see which flexibilities will increase the level of customer satisfaction when all flexibility dimensions are taken into account at the same time. We gathered survey data from managers in Dutch manufacturing companies. Results from structural equation modelling imply that in the eyes of the manufacturer, only logistics and spanning flexibility are perceived to have a significant positive impact on customer satisfaction. Using Bayesian model selection, we find that manufacturing managers prioritize spanning, then logistics, then manufacturing and then product development flexibility. Hence, the importance of product development flexibility and manufacturing flexibility, though highly valued by customers, are currently less acknowledged by manufacturers. With our study, we create awareness for the manufacturer’s perspective on supply chain flexibility, which tend to focus on the service to the customer. Our study identifies the directions in which a further improvement of customer satisfaction can be achieved.</jats:p>"

This research study aimed to investigate and illustrate the application of BDA within the existing decision-making process. BDT allowed for the extraction and processing of SC data. BDA aided further understanding of SC inefficiencies and delivered valuable, actionable insights by validating the existence of the SC bullwhip phenomenon and its contributing factors. Furthermore, BDA enabled the pragmatic evaluation of linear and nonlinear regression SC relationships by applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multivariable regression analysis. Moreover, applying more sophisticated BDA time series and forecasting techniques such as Sarimax, Tbats, and neural networks improved forecasting accuracy. Ultimately, the improved demand planning and forecast accuracy will reduce SC uncertainty and the effects of the observed SC bullwhip phenomenon, thus creating a competitive advantage for all the members within the SC value chain.</jats:p>"

Nitrogen supply has been hypothesized to be the primary factor controlling these responses, as nitrogen availability limits net primary productivity globally. Recent work using evo-evolutionary optimality theory suggests that leaf photosynthetic responses to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>are independent of nitrogen supply and are instead driven by leaf nitrogen demand to build and maintain photosynthetic enzymes, which optimizes resource allocation to photosynthetic capacity and maximizes allocation to growth.

After seven weeks, elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>increased net photosynthesis rates despite reduced leaf nitrogen content and maximum rates of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation and electron transport for RuBP regeneration. Effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>on net photosynthesis and indices of photosynthetic capacity were independent of nitrogen fertilization and inoculation. However, increasing nitrogen fertilization enhanced positive effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>on total leaf area and total biomass due to increased nitrogen uptake and reduced carbon costs to acquire nitrogen. Whole-plant responses to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>were not modified by inoculation across the nitrogen fertilization gradient, as plant investment toward symbiotic nitrogen fixation was similar between CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>treatments. These results indicate that leaf nitrogen demand to build and maintain photosynthetic enzymes drives leaf photosynthetic responses to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, while nitrogen supply regulates whole-plant responses. Our findings build on previous work suggesting that terrestrial biosphere models may improve simulations of photosynthetic processes under future novel environments by adopting optimality principles.</jats:p>"

Henceforth, this research aims at reducing plastic waste volume while simultaneously generating clean energy. Hydrogen energy is a promising fuel source that holds great value for humanity. However, achieving clean hydrogen energy poses challenges, including high costs and complex production processes, especially on a national scale. This research focuses on Iran as a country capable of producing this energy, examining the production process along with related challenges and the general supply chain. These challenges encompass selecting appropriate raw materials based on chosen technologies, factory capacities, storage methods, and transportation flow among different provinces of the country. To deal with these challenges, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the hydrogen supply chain and make optimal decisions about the mentioned problems. The supply chain model estimates an average cost—IRR 4 million (approximately USD 8)—per kilogram of hydrogen energy that is available in syngas during the initial period; however, subsequent periods may see costs decrease to IRR 1 million (approximately USD 2), factoring in return-on-investment rates.</jats:p>"

In this study, we take stock of recent scholarship on the dynamic relationship between rebels and civilians to theoretically explore the supply side of rebel governance and develop a new demand-side typology that captures the key factors influencing civilian preferences regarding the nature of rebel rule. Specifically, we argue that demand for rebel governance is mainly shaped by the interaction between civilians’ perceptions of the state and civilian–rebel compatibility, which we define as civilians’ perceptions of the compatibility of the rebel group with their own values, ideology, identity, and preferred modes of socio-political organization. To illustrate our main theoretical points, we draw upon insights gleaned from multiple insurgencies. Our study significantly enhances our understanding of how rebel–civilian interactions mold the fabric of political order in civil war environments.</jats:p>",

The body of literature dedicated to SCR has significantly expanded since the early 2000s, with numerous scholars delving into the construction of SCR frameworks based on empirical studies and literature reviews. Despite the usefulness of these frameworks, there has been a notable absence of a generic framework that transcends industry and national boundaries, particularly in light of the disruptive events triggered by the COVID-19 crisis. This study employs the narrative literature review method to intricately integrate itself into the existing SCR literature, conducting a comprehensive analysis, identifying theoretical foundations and empirical discoveries, and synthesizing this knowledge into a cohesive and all-encompassing structure to formulate a conceptual framework for SCR. This generic framework is designed to accommodate the unique characteristics of various supply chains. While the empirical validation of this innovative framework remains pending, it presents a valuable opportunity for scholars to engage in scientific investigations on SCR, building upon the collective insights of their predecessors. Moreover, practitioners can leverage this framework to scrutinize and construct resilient supply chains capable of withstanding future disruptions.</jats:p>"

Under this concept, the structure of the optimal water supply allocation model is included in the form of two main objective functions. Therefore, the first objective function is to minimize water allocation and the second objective function is to maximize the total income from the cultivation pattern compared to its costs. The latest data related to the cultivation pattern and economic information such as product sales price and production costs in the planting and harvesting stages were collected for 1 year of study. The daily data of river flow, rainfall and climatic data of Hulunbuir district in Inner Mongolia province were converted into 10-day periods. It shows the optimal irrigation planning results of winter barley in three different scenarios. In ten periods of growth, the rainfall is enough to provide most of the plants’ water needs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. In the conditions of a full-scale war, ensuring the stable functioning of the national economy is one of the strategic tasks. The functioning of the industrial complex, the availability of jobs and the payment of taxes to the state budget are, among other things, part of ensuring the country's defense capability. One of the main branches of Ukraine's economy is the metallurgical industry, so it needs the implementation of measures to ensure reliable and stable work even in conditions of military aggression, constant risks of air strikes and infrastructure damage. In accordance with this, the purpose of the study is to analyze and determine the structure of cargo flows of technological routes of transport service of metallurgical production (on the example of PJSC «Zaporizhstal»). The dynamics of iron ore (iron ore concentrate) and coking coal (coke) transportation volumes by means of transport were studied. Irregularity was investigated and descriptive statistics of daily volumes of transportation of iron ore (iron ore concentrate) and coking coal (coke) for metallurgical production were performed (on the example of PJSC «Zaporizhstal»). Methods. An analysis of the unevenness of the daily volume of goods received for the needs of a metallurgical enterprise (on the example of PJSC «Zaporizhstal») by technological routes of railway transport was carried out. Methods of mathematical statistics, probability theory, theory of transport processes and systems were used. As a result of the analysis of cargo flows arriving at the enterprise, it was established that the distribution of the daily volume of iron ore arriving at the Zaporizhzhia Live station is subject to symmetrical distribution laws with a relatively low variation of 18.4%. The distribution of the random value of the daily volume of coke intake also indicates a certain symmetry with a fairly high probability (59%), and is approximated by a normal distribution. Scientific novelty. As a result of the conducted research, it was established that the approximate density of the distribution of volumes of iron ore (salt-ore concentrate) and coking coal (coke) for metallurgical production (on the example of PJSC «Zaporizhstal» for 2022). Practical significance. The mathematical expectation and the level of correlation of the volumes of iron ore (iron ore concentrate) and coking coal (coke) supply to metallurgical production are established (on the example of PJSC «Zaporizhstal» for 2022). In the future, the obtained results are planned to be used as input data for a simulation model of the functioning of the transport support system of an industrial enterprise.</jats:p>"

Impactful logistics solutions were reasonably developed and, in 2023, began to make a difference on the market, but true success stories of market upscale with high beneficial impacts and satisfactory profit margins can only be found for limited logistics operations, such as electric vans and locker boxes for last mile logistics, and few supply chains such as sustainable forestry or biodegradable plastics. The global picture of all supply chains of all products and services lacks good examples in most domains, and some sectors and branches such as maritime freight are at a too early stage, or did not start at all. This paper describes how the authors wanted to identify the most promising sustainable solutions, and test how important and valuable their contributions are in business contexts. The paper describes how the authors reassessed the effects and results of 12 European research projects and over 200 business innovations in light of the most recent knowledge, using our thoroughly tested evaluation criteria on beneficial impacts for emission reduction, efficiency gains, technical feasibility, supply chain cooperation and others, while exploiting intersubjective reported evidence. The authors identified several key solutions, showing how solutions were established, how they could be further scaled up and how barriers to their market uptake could be overcome. The paper concludes by showing that most sustainable solutions examples were used in the past as practical models for the next investment in innovative businesses.</jats:p>"

However, considering manufacturing, supply chain, and aircraft criteria in the early design phase increases the size of the solutions’ trade space and, thus, the complexity of performing the decision-making process. This paper demonstrates how to leverage value-model theory to simplify the decision-making process when multiple criteria related to multiple systems are considered at the same time. The proposed concurrent approach is formalized from a systems-engineering perspective, considering the interactions between the lifecycle stages of the System of Interest, i.e., the aircraft, and Enabling Systems like the supply chain and manufacturing. A value-based interactive dashboard, called VALORISE, is developed to automatize the process, support decision-makers in modeling their expectations, analyze real-time strategic scenarios, and easily explore the value-driven trade space for best-solution identification. An aeronautical application case highlights the advantages of leveraging the proposed concurrent approach to overcome the limits of traditional approaches, in which decisions about supply chain and manufacturing are addressed once the aircraft configuration is decided.</jats:p>"

These indices are useful to assess water resource availability but each using different methodology and thus giving different insights to the basin water resource condition. We consider Klang River basin in Malaysia, a highly-regulated and urbanized basin with escalating water demand and competition between sectorial users. The indicator/ indices are derived from water allocation modelling based on historical data between year 2016 to 2018. Results show that consideration of basin storage (WRI) and water abstraction (WSI) offers more realistic representation of the basin water availability. The WRI offers further advantage in terms of temporal resolution over the course of the calendar year.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With numerous case studies and a great number of experimental research conducted in the field of behavioral operations management, it is now well-established that under supply chain scenarios, human decision-makers do not make the decisions that are predicted by theoretical solutions. The randomness of the customer demand, strategic interaction with other decision-makers, cognitive abilities and personality traits of the decision-makers are among the reasons of this deviation from the optimal.\r\nIn this chapter, we compare supply chain contracting decisions made by human decision-makers with randomized decisions using simple supply chain scenarios. We analyze under which contract type and contract price human decision-makers perform better in terms of supply chain efficiency and earn higher profit than the randomized decisions. This analysis is based on data from three experiments conducted with human decision-makers. The first and second experimental studies are based on a single-player setting where decision-makers are making decisions against the computer. The third study, on the other hand, is based on a human-human two player setting where strategic interaction between the decision-makers is also at play. In all settings we consider a single-supplier-single retailer setting where the retailer is faced with a newsvendor problem of which the parameters are determined by the supplier.\r\nIn the first study, decision-makers undertake the role of a retailer and make stock quantity decisions under a predetermined wholesale price contract. In the second and third studies wholesale price contract, buyback and revenue sharing contracts are considered. The second study consists of retailer and supplier treatments. The retailer treatments of this study are similar to the first study except for the additional contract types. In the supplier treatments the decision-makers take the role of the supplier and determine contract prices against a computerized retailer who places the newsvendor optimal order. Finally, in the third study half of the decision makers undertake the role of the supplier and the other half take the role of the retailer and make decisions against each other.\r\nFor the randomized decisions we simulate 10000 random data points for each experimental study. We then compare the performance of the human decision-makers with the randomized system. Our analyses reveal that, surprisingly, the random system does not necessarily perform worse than the humans. On the contrary, when there is high involvement of personal conflicts and biases, the random system has higher contract efficiency. However, when the profit margin small, when there is high inventory risk or when the other firm is making rational decisions, the random system underperforms. These findings suggest that when the profit margin is high, when the inventory risk is reduced via a high buyback price under the buyback contract or a low wholesale price under the revenue sharing contract supply chain contracting decisions can be automated.\r\nThe comparison reveals that This study, albeit in a highly constrained context, represents an important step in understanding when human intervention in supply chain decisions is beneficial, under what conditions automation can be considered in supply chain decisions, and the values of factors such as contract type, price, and strategic interaction that affect the performance of human decision-makers.</jats:p>"

China's automobile industry, now at a pivotal moment, is making strides on the global stage, spurred by its transition towards new energy. While the world's car market has been historically dominated by German and Japanese brands, Chinese automakers were often labeled as mere imitators producing inferior quality vehicles. But this narrative is changing. Now equipped with advanced battery technologies and innovative designs, Chinese carmakers are poised to redefine the global automotive landscape. Their progress challenges the deep-seated dominance of traditional automotive powerhouses. However, this ascent is not without hurdles. External pressures, such as ongoing trade tensions, weigh on the industry. Moreover, there's an internal challenge to grapple with: the critical semiconductor sector, particularly the micro-control chips essential for modern vehicles, has yet to achieve self-sufficiency. Production constraints persist, and the desired levels of self-reliance remain elusive. This paper delves deep into the automotive microcontrol chip industry, with an emphasis on the upstream and midstream sectors of the supply chain. By shedding light on the current situation and drawing from global best practices, we aim to propose actionable recommendations. These suggestions will be aimed at enhancing production capacities, improving quality, and ultimately driving China's automobile industry towards a more self-reliant and globally competitive future.</jats:p>"

Characteristic problems are widely known and considered in the scientific and educational literature: the location of agricultural objects on a large territory, their remoteness from central substations, remoteness from the road network, which makes it difficult for emergency teams to access in case of accidents, a high degree of operation of substation equipment and air lines At the same time, the re-equipment of the park of technological equipment of agricultural enterprises makes it necessary to look at the quality of energy supply in a new way - the microprocessor technology used in modern agricultural production makes high demands on the reliability of energy supply. Also, the issue related to emergency modes in the energy supply system, which lead to millions of losses due to product spoilage due to the termination of the technological process, does not lose its relevance. As you know, the energy supply system should be a model of high reliability, but upon inspection, the situation looks a little different: due to various reasons (including both the power deficit and the wear and tear of the equipment in use), the energy supply does not always meet the expectations of consumers in terms of the quality of the services provided. In the case of interruptions in the energy supply of enterprises (including agricultural ones), interruptions in the energy supply cause much more serious consequences, related to spoilage and underproduction of products and millions of losses.</jats:p>",

These indices primarily emphasized countries' standings, rankings, and improvement areas. Clustering countries based on a single index does not always yield the desired results. Using cluster analysis may help get critical information when many indicators are evaluated. The supply chain-connected indicators were chosen to be included in the research initially. In this study, three global indices were selected. We chose the Logistics Performance Index(LPI) to evaluate the logistics industry, which is essential in supply chain management. Logistics is one of the critical areas that affect and have also been affected by many fundamental indicators used to evaluate a country's performance. One critical indicator that globally measures the processes is the Logistics Performance Index. We included  Environmental Performance Index(EPI) in the study to evaluate environmental policies that impact supply chain operations. The final index used in the study is the Global Competitiveness Index(GCI), which examines the competitiveness of countries with a heavy dependence on supply chain management performance. It is one of the crucial indications in evaluating a country's productivity. We used clustering analysis based on supply chain management-related indicators in the following phase. K-Means clustering algorithm was applied to the extracted data set. Python code is written to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm. In the final part of the study, differences between clusters and submitted research proposals ideas were discussed. This research proposes a three-step methodological framework for mining supply chain indicators derived from the LPI, GCI, and EPI indicators. The research aims to conclude from the analyses of the change in centers based on indicators, the variation based on datasets between clusters, and the grouping of countries based on any combination of the LPI, GCI, and EPI indicators\t.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Natural ventilation plays an important role in ensuring comfortable living conditions. Wind catchers are part of this process and can provide the required ventilation rate for buildings. The performance of wind catchers depends on the relevant parameters, such as height, configuration, cross-sectional shape, number of inlets, speed of movement and variability of air movement direction. HVAC equipment is not only responsible for the largest portion of the total energy consumption within a building, but also for most indoor air quality problems. Vents, air ducts, and dirty filters are a suitable place for the growth of fungi and molds produced by organic dust, which contaminate the circulating air and cause significant pollution problems. This could be more critical given that we spend almost 90% of our time indoors during our lives and work. Improvements in ventilation and air conditioning systems therefore play an important role in increasing energy efficiency in buildings, providing a better indoor climate for occupants and, as a result, reducing the likelihood of health problems. The cooling process plays an important role in creating comfortable conditions for humans. One of the most well-known elements of a passive cooling system for buildings with no or minimal energy consumption is a wind catcher. The effective-ness of wind catchers is influenced by wind force and buoyancy, and knowledge of the size, shape, and position of the outlet will help to understand new ideas and technologies for their application in modern architecture. A well-known example of natural ventilation that improves indoor quality by reducing pollution and humidity by replacing stale air with fresh outside air is a wind catcher (or wind tower). Nowadays, wind catchers are widely used in the world, having advantages in densely populated urban areas and in areas with low wind speeds, significantly affecting the reduction of cooling loads and providing the required ventilation rate of buildings. At present, there are many types of wind traps that can be classified according to the number of inlets, cross-sectional shape, and number of levels. The number of internal partitions, as well as the size and location of the openings of the wind collector, significantly affect its ventilation characteristics, efficiency, air flow velocity and turbulence, and also divide the cross-section of the wind collector into smaller channels, increasing the strength of its structure and reducing sensitivity to different wind directions</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prior to COVID-19, densely occupied areas were already suspected of making employees sick. Post-COVID-19, there is an urgent need to improve air quality and ventilation standards shall change. However, any changes to ventilation must consider other negative consequences including energy and health and well-being impacts from thermal discomfort and exposure to pollutants. The need for moving away from traditional energy sources and to find alternate energy sources is undoubtedly one of the primary objectives for a sustainable progress to humankind. The design and construction of buildings in hot-humid climates requires high energy consumption typically for air conditioning due to higher thermal loads. A further increase in ventilation rates will have intensive impact in energy consumption and infrastructure loads. This chapter presents the performance of an innovative fully integrated smart ventilation system with low energy consumption. It is all in one ventilating and air conditioning system that provides efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable cooled fresh air for open or enclosed spaces whilst achieving thermal comfort. Based on the application, it consists of multistages that can dehumidify and cool the air to the required comfort level. The system has shown 50–60% reduction in energy consumption compared with conventional systems.</jats:p>"

This topic is extremely important, and urgent actions are required so that the attention of the scientific community is mainly focused on emission reduction. In this context, carbon supply chains have an important role because they can help in carbon dioxide mitigation. In fact, in these systems, carbon dioxide is captured to be stored or used to produce valuable products. However, carbon supply chains involve many energy consumptions during the operation (causing carbon dioxide emissions and resource depletion), and an analysis of the environmental impact of the system is required. Different green metrics exist but the most effective is the life cycle assessment. The methodology of the life cycle assessment is presented in this work, with particular considerations for its application to carbon supply chains. An overview of the research presented in the literature is also considered here, with suggestions for future analyses.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It was believed that the construction of large dams in the upper tributary basin of the Chao Phraya River (CPR) has caused sediment load reduction in the CPR system by 75–85%. Based on historical and observed river flow and sediment data measured during 1922–2019, we investigated the effects of three large dams, the Sirikit, Naresuan, and Khwae Noi dams, on river runoff and sediment loads supplied to the CPR using Mann-Kendall (MK) test and the double mass curve (DMC). Results from this study revealed that the Nan River contributed approximately 40% and 57% of the runoff and total sediment load (TSL) to the CPR, respectively. The water regulation by the Naresuan diversion dam has mainly caused the reduction on annual runoff and TSL downstream of each dam. The results from this study also reveal that the sediment load observed at the headwater (C.2) of the CPR still increased after the construction of the Sirikit dam due to the expansion of irrigation areas downstream of the dam and the channel improvement in the lower reach of Nan River. After the three major dams were operated, the sediment load at C.2 reduced by 31% compared that discharging during the pre-construction period.</jats:p>"

It adopted methods such as ordering tribute and attacking vanguard to obtain food, which not only disappointed the farmers who had high hopes for it, but also caused serious opposition among landlords and gentry. Even the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom’s army had several incidents of fire and union to compete for food.

In increasingly competitive conditions, companies can act more strongly in market share with improvements in cost and efficiency factors. With the proposed Permutation Based Genetic Algorithm (PBGA) approach, the problem of optimizing the production and distribution line in the supply chain is addressed. The algorithm uses the processes of selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the population in a permuted manner, taking into account multiple iterations, i.e. generation states. The results from the case studies also showed that resource utilization was realized efficiently with cost reductions and improvements in lead times. In this study, cost savings were achieved by applying the PBGA method, especially in information flow and process optimization between distribution and production. This can provide an advantage in a competitive environment.</jats:p>",

In the paper, the strategic choice of enterprises using bank credit financing is analyzed, the Nash equilibrium point of the bank and the enterprise is modeled by calculus, and the game evolution model of enterprise use of credit financing advantage is constructed to explore the equilibrium distribution of bank credit financing. On this basis, the regression model of bank credit financing and enterprise reputation is established, and it is combined with relevant data for empirical analysis. The results show that under the initial conditions, there are two evolutionary stable strategies of (0,0,0) and (1,1,1) in the enterprise bank credit financing game system, which verifies the analysis for the stability of equilibrium point under the dual mechanism of supply chain finance and industrial policy. The regression coefficient of bank credit financing of enterprises with greater corporate reputation is 1.26, and when the explanatory variable is the indicator of short-term lending and long-term investment, the coefficient of long-term borrowing ratio is -0.003, with a significance level of 1%, and the increase of long-term borrowing ratio can significantly reduce the behavior of short-term lending and long-term investment of enterprises.</jats:p>",

However, the industry faces a series of challenges during this booming phase. With the vigorous development of the community fresh fruit industry, the traditional fresh fruit supplier X Fresh Fruit is also seeking transformation opportunities. By analyzing the X Fresh Fruit supply chain company case, this paper reveals the problems of opaque supply chain structure, inefficient supply chain management and production, and high supply chain costs. Measures are needed to address these issues, including optimizing the supply chain structure, improving production and management methods, and controlling procurement, transportation, and storage costs. These measures are expected to improve supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure the quality and freshness of fresh fruits, thus creating greater value and competitiveness for enterprises. The research in this paper helps X fresh fruit companies solve their current problems and provides useful suggestions for the sustainable development of the fresh fruit supply chain industry.</jats:p>"

Interest in incorporating lean and agile into the supply chain has grown in recent years, as shown by the growing number of scientific publications on this topic. This topic has garnered significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines; however, a comprehensive study of the literature in this field has not yet been conducted. Therefore, the present study aims to provide a state-of-the-art summary of leagile supply chain issues that concern researchers. To do so, we use a bibliometric method, combined with citation context analysis, to evaluate data extracted from Scopus peer-reviewed articles published between 1999 and March 2023. Data analytic techniques, including citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-word (co-occurrence) analysis, are used. Using rigorous bibliometric and visualization tools, the results show the current status of the research problem, its impact, and suggestions for future work to address research gaps, such as a problem in an area of research that has been answered incompletely or insufficiently. The findings suggest that researchers in unexplored research areas in the ASEAN region include green supply chain strategies, supply chain risk management influenced by lean and agile strategies, and comparative analyses among ASEAN countries. These areas offer promising avenues for future research, contributing to regional competitiveness and performance enhancement.</jats:p>"

This article examines the proactiveness and feasibility of companies adopting ESG development and how to improve their supply chains. The research employs methods such as data regression analysis and correlation analysis, and it also investigates the case of JD.com. The study reveals that while the ESG concept may seem contradictory to a company's short-term business goals or performance, it exhibits a certain degree of positive correlation and can even bring about favorable impacts in both the short and long term.

Some sectors, such as the Iron and Steel Industry (ISI), have served the development of humanity for centuries and have enabled humanity to create new tools and build solid structures. ISI is a main material provider for different industries such as household appliances, car production, building, and medical devices. The importance of iron and steel for humanity is obvious and the sector serves humanity for being an advanced civilization. On the other hand, iron and steel production requires complex production methods, high energy consumption, and toxic materials. An industry that is so important for the development of civilization harms the planet that we all live in and threatens all living creatures when it doesn’t have environmental consciousness. The iron and steel sector should make its production model more environmentally friendly. In this context, this study aims to explore the effects of Green Supply Chain Management practices on 3 performance aspects (environmental, operational, and economic) of Turkish ISI. Findings indicate that every single GSCM practices have a different level of positive impact on environmental and operational performance. However, the findings suggest that the effects of GSCM practices on economic performance are not enough to declare a positive relationship because it is not obvious and highly clear as environmental performance and operational performance.</jats:p>"

One of the companies in Indonesia engaged in asset monitoring and ship navigation systems, has a production division that produces power supply products. Based on the analysis that has been carried out at the company that there are problems such as a damaged PCB connector that makes the product categorized as a manufacturing defect. This research aims to be able to find alternative improvements to production processes that have a high defect rate. The Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) framework is used as a method to shape the mindset of management and employees to be able to solve these problems. Based on this framework, three causes of the problem were found, namely human factors, materials, and inappropriate methods during the production process. Therefore, appropriate corrective actions are taken, and a control process is carried out by comparing control charts, Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO) and sigma levels to determine the impact of changes from the improvements made. Quantitatively, there was an increase in the DPMO value of 39.47% and an increase in the sigma level of 8.64%. This shows that the DMAIC framework can provide the right solutions and preventing the same quality problems from happening again.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, the absence of social interest has truly impacted the work possibilities of college graduates. Moreover, the world economy has still not fully recovered from the impact of the epidemic. Chinas unemployment rate remains at a high level, and the hole among metropolitan and rustic regions in China is clearly as well. This paper analyzes the fact of the low employment rate among Chinese college graduates, focusing on the argument that it is not solely due to individual factors such as psychlogical reasons or city preferences for future employment. Behind this, there exists an imbalance in the supply and demand relationship within the current labor market in China. Finally, the paper puts forward suggestions to ensure Chinas labour supply from the aspects of career planning of college students, corresponding government policy reform, industrial structure adjustment, and active assistance of enterprises.</jats:p>"

I model the study on Charteris-Black’s critical metaphor analysis and Sack’s membership categorisation analysis, as frameworks. The findings indicate that Najib Razak and his government enacted a role as a ship captain, where the Malaysian people were positioned as passengers, sailing in a sea of world economy, and heading towards a status as a high-income developed nation. Through these metaphors, the people were reminded that, without the government as helm of the ship, it is not to reach the intended destination. Therefore, the use of metaphors in the Supply Bills serves predicative, empathetic, ideological, and mythical purposes, to legitimize both the government and its purposes as agents of governmentality.</jats:p>",

While theory has emphasized how changes in demand conditions affect redeployment, we argue that optimal internal resource allocation involves consideration of both demand and each unit's resource supply. We formalize this argument, showing how redeployment arises from “supply‐side inducements”—return advantages in new over existing resource uses resulting from changes in resource supply. Empirical tests using manager deaths as an exogenous, supply‐side shock to firms' resource stocks support our arguments, showing that firms frequently redeploy resources away from better‐endowed and toward negatively affected units. Incorporating supply‐side inducements into redeployment theory implies additional value‐creation opportunities from redeployment and carries novel predictions for the direction of intra‐firm resource flows.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Managerial Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Firms continuously decide how to allocate valuable resources—such as their most productive workers, unique inputs, or machinery—among different units. We argue that to optimally allocate such resources, managers must respond to changes in both the demand environment and in the resource stock of different units. When some units successfully accumulate resources while others suffer adverse shocks, opportunity exists to improve efficiency by internally redeploying resources. Counterintuitively, optimal redeployment frequently involves shifting resources away from successful, well‐endowed units. New business units, being resource‐poor, are often the most important recipients of resources. Empirical analyses studying how firms allocate managers in a large sample of Brazilian firms offer support for these arguments.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This study focuses on the optimization of the rice biomass supply chain in the Perlis region, aiming to enhance the resource utilization and minimize environmental impact. The abundance of rice residues generated after harvesting presents an opportunity to create a sustainable energy source while managing agricultural waste. This research encompasses a comprehensive analysis of the entire rice biomass supply chain, from residue collection at farms to the final biomass conversion process. Geographic information systems are employed to assess rice cultivation patterns and estimate potential biomass yield. Mathematical models are utilized to design an integrated supply chain network that considers collection, transportation, storage, and biomass conversion. Key factors influencing the supply chain are identified, including transportation costs, storage infrastructure, seasonal variations in biomass availability, and technological feasibility of conversion processes. Environmental implications are also evaluated, considering emissions reduction through the displacement of fossil fuels. The outcomes of this study contribute to the establishment of an efficient and sustainable rice biomass supply chain in the Perlis region. The developed optimization framework can serve as a blueprint for similar agricultural biomass utilization initiatives in other regions. The research not only addresses the technical aspects of biomass supply chain management but also considers the broader economic, social, and environmental implications, paving the way for a more resilient and resource-efficient agricultural sector.</jats:p>"

One of the pioneers of impact sourcing is Sama, a training-data company that focuses on annotating data for artificial intelligence (AI) systems and claims to support an ethical AI supply chain through its business operations. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken at three of Sama’s East African delivery centres in Kenya and Uganda and follow-up online interviews, this article interrogates Sama’s claims regarding the benefits of its impact sourcing model. Our analysis reveals alarming accounts of low wages, insecure work, a tightly disciplined labour management process, gender-based exploitation and harassment and a system designed to extract value from low-paid workers to produce profits for investors. We argue that competitive market-based dynamics generate a powerful force that pushes such companies towards limiting the actual social impact of their business model in favour of ensuring higher profit margins. This force can be resisted, but only through countervailing measures such as pressure from organised workers, civil society, or regulation. These findings have broad implications related to working conditions for low-wage data annotators across the sector and cast doubt on the ethical nature of AI products that rely on this form of AI data work.</jats:p>"

Accurate estimation of evaporation and transpiration helps in planning to meet the actual needs of the plant. In general, daily evapotranspiration depends on temperature, climate, soil moisture, plant, growth period, root length, and the texture of the root zone porous media. In this study, the moisture balance of the soil surface is simulated daily and the components of deep percolation, evaporation, irrigation, and transpiration are calculated. The obtained results have been compared with the output of the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) algorithm to determine the energy balance on the earth's surface and to estimate evapotranspiration. Normalized objective function (NOF), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index, and mean absolute error were incorporated into the problem for evaluating the predicted values. The energy balance of the soil surface and the moisture balance of the root zone each have a different process in estimating the actual evaporation and transpiration, but the correlation between them was acceptable. The interval between the calculated values can be used as input data to determine the irrigation requirement.</jats:p>",

One glaring distortion is the wastage of close to a third of global food production, in the face of widespread food insecurity. With population explosion and climate change as additional pressure points, reducing food waste has emerged as an urgent imperative for achieving food security for all. In this paper, we develop a research framework and agenda for the use of Artificial Intelligence and robotics in reducing food loss and waste. The Cognitive Automation for Food (COGAF) has been developed as a theoretical framework for guiding future research. This framework delineates the research landscape into five distinct research streams: sensory enhancement, cognitive automation, physical automation, sensory-motor fusion, and collaborative automation. In order to develop a systematic research agenda, propositions have been developed in each of these research streams. In conjunction with the COGAF framework, this research agenda attempts to provide a road map for future research and knowledge creation pertaining to the use of AI and robotics to reduce food loss and waste.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although observations of the negative impact of surface runoff on water quality in water bodies have a long history, the development of national regulations governing surface water quality took place only in 2022. Accordingly, the Law of Ukraine \"On Water Drainage and Wastewater Treatment\" was adopted, which entered into force in August 2023 and is part of the process of adapting Ukrainian legislation in the field of water drainage in accordance with Council of Europe Directive 91/271/EEC \"On Urban Wastewater Treatment\". The paper analyzes the problem of determining the volume of annual surface runoff to be cleaned at treatment facilities. Using the data of the hydrometeorological service on the maximum daily amount of precipitation of various types for the city of Kyiv, the dependences of the distribution of the probability of daily layers of precipitation, in the form of the total depth of precipitation and the total duration of precipitation, were obtained. The conclusion that the predominant volume of runoff is determined by microrains that have a high frequency of recurrence is confirmed. The problem of finding the ratio of precipitation and runoff in the regulatory documents of Ukraine is covered very primitively, which is why there is a need to determine the depth of runoff on a more advanced basis, taking into account infiltration, which is determined by the parameters of the filtration properties of soils. The effect of imperviousness on the drain layer is determined through simulations using the SWMM distributed model. The F/P parameter is proposed, which characterizes the volume of losses from the total amount of precipitation depending on the properties of the surface, namely waterproofness and filtration coefficient. The modeling made it possible to obtain the dependence of the F/P parameter on the filtration coefficient and the imperviousness of the catchment area. Calculations confirmed that the runoff in most cases is formed as a result of precipitation, the value of which exceeds 2.5 mm. For the city of Kyiv, the volume of surface wastewater runoff for the warm period of the year from an area of 1 ha was calculated depending on the soil filtration coefficient at 60% imperviousness. As a result of these studies, it is recommended that sewage treatment plants capture and treat rainwater with a probability of 70 to 90% of the total depth of precipitation that falls on the catchment area. At the same time, the value of the flow volume of surface wastewater must be confirmed by calculation.</jats:p>"

The RBI monitors the funding for the RIDF program through NABARD, which has a corpus of Rs. 2,000 crores from commercial and regional banks, among other sources. The program funds the social sector, small to medium irrigation, rural connectivity, and agricultural and related activities. The study evaluated the performance of the RIDF in the State critically. It also observed that several projects remained incomplete even after taking loans from the RIDF. Many states might be unable to take on this financial load due to most governments’ dire financial circumstances. Despite this, there have been some physical advancements in rural irrigation, roads, and bridges. The nation’s states and regions, however, do not all share the same achievement levels, therefore suggesting necessary steps to ensure proper fund utilization and decrease rural poverty and intra-regional disparity in Karnataka.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management holds a pivotal role in determining the success of businesses, and its effectiveness can significantly influence an organization's performance. Nevertheless, it is vulnerable to a wide array of risks that have the potential to disrupt operations, result in financial losses, and tarnish a company's reputation. This summary offers an insight into the crucial components of evaluating and managing risks within supply chain management. In this context, risk evaluation encompasses the identification and assessment of various risk categories that could impact the supply chain. These risks may include natural disasters, geopolitical challenges, fluctuations in demand, delays in transportation, and issues related to suppliers. A comprehensive risk assessment involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis to gauge the likelihood and potential consequences of these risks on the supply chain. Effective risk management strategies are indispensable for mitigating the adverse effects of these identified risks. Risk management in supply chain management encompasses several actions, such as risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk reduction, and risk acceptance. Developing a resilient supply chain capable of adapting to unforeseen circumstances is also a critical element of risk management. Furthermore, this summary underscores the significance of technological tools and data analytics in the field of risk management. Advanced technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and artificial intelligence enable real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, which can improve the visibility of risks and provide early warning signals. The success of a supply chain heavily relies on a proactive approach to risk assessment and management. By identifying potential risks, evaluating their impact, and implementing robust risk management strategies, organizations can bolster the resilience of their supply chains and ensure uninterrupted operations even in challenging environments. This abstract emphasizes the significance of understanding, evaluating, and effectively managing risks in supply chain management, as it contributes to an organization's long-term sustainability and competitive advantage.</jats:p>"

Facing the challenge of managing a high volume of daily sales transactions, the shop often encounters difficulties in tracking which products are frequently purchased together. This lack of insight leads to a critical issue: popular products running out of stock unexpectedly. To address this, the research focuses on developing a product stock supply analysis system, utilizing the FP Growth Algorithm. The FP Growth Algorithm, a powerful tool in Data Mining, is employed to analyze sales transaction data and identify consumer purchasing trends, particularly products bought simultaneously. This approach is designed to provide insights into optimal stocking strategies, ensuring the availability of in-demand products. The research methodology involves applying the FP Growth Algorithm to model the product stock supply system, using specific sales data attributes. The results of this study are significant. By setting parameters such as a minimum support value of 30%, a confidence value of 70%, and targeting the highest lift ratio value of 3.67, the research successfully derives several key association rules from the FP Growth algorithm. These rules are instrumental in optimizing the product stock supply analysis system.</jats:p>"

Findings revealed that the major ion types in atmospheric waters are calcic and magnesium bicarbonate, whereas hydrothermal springs predominantly indicated chloride–sodic composition, showing an evolving pattern resulting from hydrothermal and atmospheric waters mixing. Investigating the ionic ratios and the saturation index to determine the origin of ions suggests that the presence of ions in the waters can be attributed to the weathering of silicates and plagioclase-bearing minerals in the volcanic units, and in some cases, ionic exchange also plays a role. The recession curve analysis revealed a predominant conduit flow with α = 0.144 in the system feeding the representative hydrothermal spring. Two micro-regimes with α1 = 0 = 0.46 and α2 = 2.68 were detected on the hydrograph of the atmospheric representative spring, indicating the development of systems with two types of flow regimes. Estimating the Qmax/Qmin ratio for selected hydrothermal and atmospheric springs as 2.3 and 36.8, respectively, and calculating the electrical conductivity coefficient as 11% and 18% respectively, confirmed the recession curve analysis result.</jats:p>",

On one front, policy-makers impose increasingly stringent emission reduction targets for supply chains, while on another front, consumers express a heightened preference for products and services with reduced carbon footprints. This study addresses the challenge of determining an optimal carbon pricing strategy by integrating the imperatives of a green supply chain with carbon taxation policies. To this end, we introduce a bi-level mixed-integer linear programming model for supply chain network planning, encompassing considerations of carbon taxation policies and the responsiveness of demand to the final product’s price and associated carbon emissions. Findings from a case study underscore that an escalation in carbon pricing prompts the supply chain to prioritize emissions reduction through the utilization of environmentally conscious approaches. The results reveal the need for a USD 0.9/kg carbon price to achieve a 10% emission reduction, resulting in an 80% profit decline. Notably, a 10% reduction has profound impacts, which leads to the suggestion of a gradual approach. Furthermore, as carbon prices reach higher levels, the supply chain tends toward curtailing production, thereby fostering an environment conducive to emission abatement. Consequently, policy formulators must judiciously calibrate a fitting carbon pricing mechanism to strike a harmonious equilibrium between emission reduction targets and the financial outlays of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Денервация молочной железы вызывает расширение кровеносных сосудов и усиление кровоснабжения молочной железы. Пролактин, окситоцин, соматотропин, инсулин и ацетилхолин усиливают кровоснабжение вымени, а норадреналин и его агонисты оказывают сосудосуживающее действие. Во время доения повышается интенсивность кровоснабжения вымени, что является следствием нескольких факторов: а) снижение внутривыменного давления при освобождении альвеол от молока и расширении молочных протоков; б) снижение тонуса симпатической нервной системы в период доения; в) сосудорасширяющий эффект окситоцина; г) воздействие ацетилхолина на сосуды. В связи с этим, регистрацию динамики кровоснабжения вымени можно использовать для контроля интенсивности выведения и степент опорожнения вымени при машинном доении.</jats:p>\n                                                                                                            <jats:p>From a biophysical point of view, the movement of blood through the blood vessels of the mammary gland is subject to the laws of hydraulics and hydrodynamics, and adaptive changes in blood flow in the udder are regulated by nervous, humoral, chemical factors and local mechanisms. Main sections of the review: basic elements of the theory of hemodynamics in the blood vessels of the mammary gland; nervous regulation and influence of hormonal factors; local mechanisms of action of chemical factors; regulation of blood supply to the udder during milking; on the methodology for identifying key factors and relationships in the processes of blood supply, milk formation and milk secretion in ruminants. The motor function of the mammary gland is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system by influencing the α- and β-adrenergic receptors of the smooth muscle elements of the mammary ducts, udder and teat cisterns, as well as blood vessels. Irritation of the efferent nerves of the mammary gland leads to a narrowing of the blood vessels and a decrease in the speed of blood flow through the mammary gland. Efferent innervation has a constant tonic effect on the blood vessels of the udder. Denervation of the mammary gland causes dilation of blood vessels and increased blood supply to the mammary gland. Prolactin, oxytocin, somatotropin, insulin and acetylcholine increase blood supply to the udder, and norepinephrine and its agonists have a vasoconstrictor effect. During milking, the intensity of blood supply to the udder increases, which is a consequence of several factors: a) a decrease in intraudder pressure when the alveoli are released from milk and the milk ducts expand; b) decreased tone of the sympathetic nervous system during milking; c) vasodilatory effect of oxytocin; d) the effect of acetylcholine on blood vessels. In this regard, recording the dynamics of blood supply to the udder can be used to control the intensity of excretion and the degree of emptying of the udder during machine milking.</jats:p>",

Thanks to autonomy and resiliency in fuel procurement, organizations with decentralized energy plants may be able to quickly adapt to the changing needs of society. The main aim of this study was to increase the sustainability of these CHP plants’ wood procurement by modeling it and determining the company’s profitable wood procurement region while keeping the forests renewable. The environmental sustainability of wood procurement was assessed by considering the additional costs caused through the EEAP mechanism if the carbon sink of the forest worsened due to wood procurement in the area. The supply chains were compared so that the CHP plant managers could adopt the best energy wood value chains. The results showed that updating the procurement strategy would be necessary. The CHP plant managers should purchase energy wood from a larger procurement area than the current one and focus on roadside purchases of wood. The Techno-Economic Wood Payment Ability Model was a useful part of the DSS in guiding wood buyers toward sustainable wood procurement by increasing the share of renewable forests.</jats:p>"

There is a noticeable upsurge in the academia regarding carbon accounting, which engenders complexity due to the heterogeneity of practices that fall under the purview of carbon accounting. Such plurality has given rise to a situation where diverse interpretations of carbon accounting coexist, often bereft of uniformity in definition and application. Consequently, organisations need a standardised, comprehensive, and sequentially delineated carbon accounting framework amenable to seamless integration into end-to-end manufacturing systems. This research commences with the progressive evolution of the conceptual definition of carbon accounting. Then, it delves into the current state of carbon accounting in manufacturing systems and supply chains, revealing gaps and implementation issues warranting future scholarly exploration.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, however, it did not make use of the opportunity to take on a pioneering role in the broader comparative context. The authors conduct a critical analysis of the sustainability concept of the Act, as well as its provisions on scope and enforcement. In both aspects, the Act falls short of expectations; it does not introduce a comprehensive concept of sustainability, small and medium-sized enterprises are excluded from the scope of application, and comprehensive due diligence along the supply chain is not achieved. On the enforcement level, the main weakness of the LkSG lies in its exclusion of civil liability.</jats:p>"

However, the advent of disruptive events, exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic, poses formidable challenges to their sustainable development. Adequate cost management and supply chain management are crucial for these SMEs to sustain themselves through disruptive scenarios. This study aims at exploring, understanding, and analyzing various factors that would impact the reduced vulnerability of SMEs and enhance the sustainability of the Thai economy. The methodology adopted for this research is the qualitative method. The data has been collected through semi-structured interviews and in-depth interviews, and secondary data has been collected through online and printed sources. The data analysis involves content analysis of the themes that are deduced from the extensive literature review. Furthermore, the data has been analyzed with Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threats (SWOT) to analyze the impacts of internal and external factors on the sustainability of the SMEs. The study's findings divulge a spectrum of challenges spanning cost management intricacies, socio-cultural influences, and economic nuances that collectively impede SME progress. The absence of effective governmental policies, regulations, and actual need assessments of society and the economy results in enhanced vulnerabilities for SMEs. Similarly, the risk perceptions of the SMEs were found to be inaccurate, which led to ineffective cost management strategies and supply chain management during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings cover the existing literature gap. The research paves the way for further micro-level research into the amalgamated impact of cost management and adequate supply chain management, especially during disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2023-07-06-018 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

The paper presents a study of the energy-efficient design of the facade of a residential building, which uses insulating materials that are suitable for internal thermal insulation of historical buildings. The analysis of domestic and European literary sources regarding the improvement of the level of thermal protection of buildings shows that the improvement of energy efficiency is important for ensuring a sustainable, affordable and safe energy system. The paper presents the results of a study aimed at increasing energy efficiency in residential buildings, as well as an analysis of the humidity state and the possibility of condensation when using internal insulation. Numerical simulations were performed to confirm the results. The obtained results indicate that the use of mineral insulation \"BETOL®\" and aluminium foil as a vapour barrier, applied from the inside, contributes to the improvement of thermal insulation of the walls and reduces the risks of condensation. Computer simulations have shown that under the considered conditions, condensation does not occur. The relative humidity in the structure does not reach 90%. The same structure without the vapour barrier causes condensation because the relative humidity exceeds 100 % in whole thickness of the brickwork, which will cause destruction of the historical structure. This research makes an important contribution to the development of energy-efficient solutions for the construction industry, as it will ensure the minimum permissible value of the heat transfer resistance of the enclosing structures and extend the service life of them and buildings as a whole.</jats:p>"

Although appeal for increasing trade in Southern Africa region may seem plausible, there are strictly speaking no well-grounded economic reasons why perishable agricultural products trade should be an obsession. Broad-based inclusive RVCs through blockchaining perishable agricultural products could enable far more effective responses to region’s sustainable developmental challenges as it does in developed and emerging economies.

Despite being a crucial crop in China, the southwestern terrain's complexity, an aging population, and labor scarcity pose challenges to large-scale potato cultivation mechanization. While some regions have introduced mechanization, the mechanization rate remains low. Labor shortages disrupt product and information flows, from planting to harvesting, resulting in reduced yields, diminished production efficiency, and compromised product quality. Proposed solutions involve optimizing cultivation practices, investing in machinery tailored for mountainous areas, streamlining processes, and establishing a stable labor force. However, challenges like high agricultural machinery costs and labor quality persist. The study concludes by urging further research covering technical innovations and supply chain analysis to provide specific solutions for potato production labor shortages, promoting agricultural modernization and sustainable development. In summary, this study offers valuable insights into labor challenges in potato production, facilitating future research and practical implementation.</jats:p>"

This study critically reviews the literature and makes three contributions. First, it outlines the different ways supply chain adaptability has been understood and describes the epistemological basis of this knowledge. Second, it synthesizes the findings into a theoretical model linking supply chain adaptability to its antecedents and outcomes. Third, despite its origins in a practitioner‐focused journal, supply chain adaptability has largely been explored like a black box, with few insights into its workings or actionable recommendations for its creation. To this end, the study outlines an agenda for future research to deepen our understanding along the extant lines of inquiry and to broaden our investigation to cover new empirical foci to open the black box of supply chain adaptability.</jats:p>",

We document that heat at supplier locations reduces the operating income of suppliers and their customers. Further, customers respond to perceived changes in suppliers’ exposure: when suppliers’ realized exposure exceeds ex ante expectations, customers are 7% more likely to terminate supplier relationships. Consistent with experience-based learning, this effect increases with signal strength and repetition and decreases with country-level climate adaptation. Subsequent replacement suppliers show a lower expected and realized but similar projected heat exposure. We find similar results for suppliers’ exposure to floods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transforming Small-Scale LNG Business, Enhancing Efficiency and Resilience in an Evolving Supply Chain In various industries, innovative systems have proven their value due to their efficiency and adaptability. A prime example of this lies in the rapid growth of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. LNG, a fuel derived from natural gas, has gained significant traction in recent years. In light of this, we aim to explore optimal strategies for small-scale LNG businesses, with a focus on revolutionizing their supply chain to ensure adaptability and sustainability. Our objective is to enhance efficiency and sturdiness in this evolving sector. By devising innovative methods and implementing cutting-edge technologies, we aim to revolutionize the small-scale LNG market, paving the way for a more optimized and resilient supply chain. Through this transformation, we strive to create a sustainable and adaptable framework that will drive the growth and success of a small-scale LNG businesses.LNG' ability to be transported and stored more cost-effectively in its reduced volume compared to natural gas in its original state is a significant advantage. The distribution network for LNG starts at numerous supply terminals and extends to a diverse range of consumption centers, each with varying tank capacities. In the broader economic context, the establishment of efficient routes for LNG Truck tank plays a critical role.To tackle the challenge of selecting a pickup location and determining optimal destinations with specific unloading volumes for liquefied natural gas (LNG), this research presents an innovative solution utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The proposed approach combines the power of reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, online learning, and graph theory. By leveraging these cutting-edge techniques, we aim to develop an intelligent system that can effectively determine the most efficient pickup location and sequence of destinations for LNG delivery. This system will take into account various factors such as transportation costs tank capacity, and demand fluctuations. Through the integration of reinforcement learning, the system will continuously learn and improve its decision-making process in real-time. The recurrent neural networks will allow for the analysis of historical aim to model and optimize the complex network of pickup and delivery routes, considering factors such as distance, capacity constraints, and operational efficiencies. With this innovative approach, we strive to revolutionize the selection and planning process for LNG pickup and delivery, ultimately enhancing efficiency and reducing cost within the LNG supply chain.Improving the distribution network offers several financial benefits, including cost reduction, faster delivery times, more affordable distribution, and enhanced efficiency in the utilization of tanker trucks for LNG transportation. By optimizing the distribution network, transit costs associated with LNG transportation can be significantly lowered. This can be achieved through intelligent route planning, taking into account factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and fuel consumption. Minimizing transit costs contributes to overall savings for businesses operating in the LNG market. Faster delivery times are another advantage of an enhanced distribution network. By designing efficient routes and eliminating unnecessary detours or delays, the time taken for LNG to reach its intended destinations can be reduced. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also allows for more frequent deliveries and better coordination of supply and demand. Cheaper distribution is a direct outcome of an optimized distribution network. By strategically planning pickup locations, destinations, and intermediate stops, the costs associated with transferring LNG between terminals and consumption centres can be minimized. This leads to savings in transportation expenses, ultimately benefiting both businesses and end-users. Efficient utilization of tanker trucks is crucial for maximizing profitability in the LNG industry. An improved distribution network enables better allocation of resources, ensuring that tanker trucks are utilized optimally. This includes reducing empty or underutilized trips, maximizing load capacities, and minimizing idle time. Such efficiency improvements translate to cost savings and increased revenue for businesses involved in LNG transportation. Overall, the financial gains from improving the distribution network are substantial. Lower transit costs, faster delivery times, cheaper distribution, and more efficient use of tanker trucks contribute to increased profitability, competitiveness, and sustainability in the LNG market.</jats:p>"

The economic effects of the pandemic, the modern trade war and Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine are considered key factors in changing this geography. When examining the importance of these factors, the matrix of three components of global supply chains is adopted: production centres, transport corridors and consumption centres. The reasoning allowed for rejecting both the scenario of maintaining the so-called hyper-globalisation and forming a bilateral system of two isolated and hostile economic systems. The presented arguments lead to the expectation of a mixed solution in the form of the simultaneous existence of a system of high globalisation and concentrated regional systems. The primary objective of this study is to identify and assess emerging trends in the configuration of international supply chains. On this basis, it is also intended to identify the most likely scenario for the future formation of the geography of international supply chains. The research used the literature study methodology and deductive inference of the consequences of the identified processes taken as premises for reasoning. The above-presented arguments lead to the assumption that the so-called hyper-globalisation is probably unsustainable. Various economic, political, technological and social factors make it impossible to sustain, let alone further develop, the current logic of shaping the global economic system. A world economy system with a hybrid structure is expected to emerge. The model of full globalisation will coexist with the model of a multilateral structure with a regional character centred around the main consumption and production centres. The factors determining the evolution of economic globalisation have been systematised. Their potential impact is described, and a likely scenario for change is presented. The achieved results can contribute to the design of economic policy at the level of individual countries and their groupings.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, pipe failures that occurred in the PSA were recorded for 2 years. Recorded pipe failures were integrated into the existing geographical information systems of the PSA and then visualized. Then, the logistic regression model that calculates failure probability with unbalanced and small- and medium-sized data was performed to analyze pipe failures. Pipe material, age, diameter, burst pressure, and average water pressure are the factors used in the study. The developed model achieved a success rate of 70.1%, suggesting that it can predict a considerable portion of pipe failures with a relatively satisfactory performance. Findings show that the failure probability of pipes with an age greater than 20 years is 1.675 times higher than that of pipes with an age less than 20 years. Moreover, polyvinyl chloride pipes are 5.265 times and high-density polyethylene pipes are 9.027 times more likely to fail than ductile pipes. Further research should delve into the impacts of the number of service connections, pipe lengths, and traffic load on pipe failures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When solar panels reach end-of-life, the disposal of solar panel waste is an issue of concern because it creates environmental pollution if it is improperly disposed of. It is expected that such waste will probably be increasing as the widespread use of renewable energy is adopted by taking measures associated with carbon neutrality. Thus, accurate prediction of solar panel waste with future demands for renewable energy is urgently needed for sustainable waste management. This study examined the amounts of solar panels to be retried by 2050 under three scenarios (S1-BAU, S2, S3). The amounts of solar panels to be retired are estimated by using the PBM (population balance model) with the Weibull distribution. According to the carbon neutral scenario (S3), the total amounts of solar panels to be retired are anticipated to be around 172 kt in 2030, 932 kt in 2040, and 3146 kt in 2050. The total volume of retired solar panels was projected to be 168 kt in 2030, 820 kt in 2040, and 2331 kt in 2050 under the government-led scenario (S2). The average recovery of end-of-life solar panels produced by the three scenarios in 2050 is 1531 kt, 337 kt, 535 kt, and 22 kt for glass, aluminum, silicon, and copper, respectively. Economic benefits by resource recovery of retired solar panels in 2050 range from $25.6 million in S1 to $519.1 million in S3. Based on the sensitivity analysis with the weight of solar panel (5% and 10% reduction), the results indicated that the annual volumes of retired solar panels mostly fell within the range of 4.9% to 10.0% in 2050. To confirm the predicted volumes of retired solar panels in this study, a further study is warranted because they can be influenced by other factors (e.g., weight, technology development, early loss rate, or reuse and recycling options).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental responsibility and economic benefits have promoted the development of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), and shortages and channels are considered to be two important issues in CLSC. This paper explores ordering and channel decisions in CLSC with new and differentiated remanufactured products, and considers the price and sales effort-dependent demands, as well as the proportion of emergency orders determined by emergency order costs and backorder losses, and establishes an integrated and decentralized CLSC game models. We introduce a stochastic sales effort, which affects two types of products. Numerical results show that sales effort and the order quantity of new and remanufactured products exhibit concave and convex functions, respectively. Wherein, the upper limit of sales effort has a greater impact on supply chain decisions. High sales efforts can serve as a means of coordinating dispersed supply chains. Moreover, in different cases, decisions of integrated channel are better than those of decentralized channel. Finally, whether the supply chain adopts an emergency order strategy depends on the relative cost of emergency orders and out of stock costs. According to the research in this article, some management insights are also provided.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transforming Small-Scale LNG Business, Enhancing Efficiency and Resilience in an Evolving Supply Chain In various industries, innovative systems have proven their value due to their efficiency and adaptability. A prime example of this lies in the rapid growth of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. LNG, a fuel derived from natural gas, has gained significant traction in recent years. In light of this, we aim to explore optimal strategies for small-scale LNG businesses, with a focus on revolutionizing their supply chain to ensure adaptability and sustainability. Our objective is to enhance efficiency and sturdiness in this evolving sector. By devising innovative methods and implementing cutting-edge technologies, we aim to revolutionize the small-scale LNG market, paving the way for a more optimized and resilient supply chain. Through this transformation, we strive to create a sustainable and adaptable framework that will drive the growth and success of a small-scale LNG businesses.LNG' ability to be transported and stored more cost-effectively in its reduced volume compared to natural gas in its original state is a significant advantage. The distribution network for LNG starts at numerous supply terminals and extends to a diverse range of consumption centers, each with varying tank capacities. In the broader economic context, the establishment of efficient routes for LNG Truck tank plays a critical role.To tackle the challenge of selecting a pickup location and determining optimal destinations with specific unloading volumes for liquefied natural gas (LNG), this research presents an innovative solution utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The proposed approach combines the power of reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, online learning, and graph theory. By leveraging these cutting-edge techniques, we aim to develop an intelligent system that can effectively determine the most efficient pickup location and sequence of destinations for LNG delivery. This system will take into account various factors such as transportation costs tank capacity, and demand fluctuations. Through the integration of reinforcement learning, the system will continuously learn and improve its decision-making process in real-time. The recurrent neural networks will allow for the analysis of historical aim to model and optimize the complex network of pickup and delivery routes, considering factors such as distance, capacity constraints, and operational efficiencies. With this innovative approach, we strive to revolutionize the selection and planning process for LNG pickup and delivery, ultimately enhancing efficiency and reducing cost within the LNG supply chain.Improving the distribution network offers several financial benefits, including cost reduction, faster delivery times, more affordable distribution, and enhanced efficiency in the utilization of tanker trucks for LNG transportation. By optimizing the distribution network, transit costs associated with LNG transportation can be significantly lowered. This can be achieved through intelligent route planning, taking into account factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and fuel consumption. Minimizing transit costs contributes to overall savings for businesses operating in the LNG market. Faster delivery times are another advantage of an enhanced distribution network. By designing efficient routes and eliminating unnecessary detours or delays, the time taken for LNG to reach its intended destinations can be reduced. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also allows for more frequent deliveries and better coordination of supply and demand. Cheaper distribution is a direct outcome of an optimized distribution network. By strategically planning pickup locations, destinations, and intermediate stops, the costs associated with transferring LNG between terminals and consumption centres can be minimized. This leads to savings in transportation expenses, ultimately benefiting both businesses and end-users. Efficient utilization of tanker trucks is crucial for maximizing profitability in the LNG industry. An improved distribution network enables better allocation of resources, ensuring that tanker trucks are utilized optimally. This includes reducing empty or underutilized trips, maximizing load capacities, and minimizing idle time. Such efficiency improvements translate to cost savings and increased revenue for businesses involved in LNG transportation. Overall, the financial gains from improving the distribution network are substantial. Lower transit costs, faster delivery times, cheaper distribution, and more efficient use of tanker trucks contribute to increased profitability, competitiveness, and sustainability in the LNG market.</jats:p>"

The prerequisites for obtaining large arrays of telemetry data based on the introduction of \"smart\" housing and communal services technology have been identified.  Typical purposes of water consumption data analysis are listed. It is noted that the use of artificial intelligence methods for analyzing housing and communal services data has a point character. The research is based on the principle of expediency of data analysis. The factors influencing the mode of water consumption in apartment buildings are considered. Methods of analyzing water consumption telemetry data are considered. The data of hourly automatic accounting of hot and cold water consumption in an apartment building is discussed as factual material for analysis. The data is a time series of water consumption accounting. Possible methods of statistical and intelligent analysis of telemetry data are discussed. It is concluded that the analysis of water consumption data should be carried out not only for the purpose of accrual and payment of payments, but also for the purpose of clarifying engineering calculations, adjusting regulatory indicators and making recommendations on resource conservation. Modern trends in the use of telemetry data are formulated: wider use of telemetry systems in apartment buildings, expansion of the purposes of using telemetry data analysis, the use of intelligent data analysis methods, the creation of a methodology for analyzing and evaluating telemetry data of water supply systems.</jats:p>",

The research objective of this study was to investigate the extent to which these restrictions impacted changes in marketing margins at the provincial level in Indonesia. The approach taken was through the examination of trade and freight margin statistical data before the pandemic (2019) and after the pandemic (2020) across a number of different commodity markets: rice, shallots, red chilli pepper, beef, chicken meat and eggs, sugar, and cooking oil. The evidence indicates that the pandemic brought a rapid rise in Indonesian domestic prices as a result of purchasing panic at its start. But after the imposition of transportation restrictions, there were wide variations: some durable food options experienced increased marketing margins, whereas non-durables tended to experience decreased marketing margins in some regions, as fresh products such as red chillies and shallots were discarded as a result of declining consumer purchasing power. The conclusion for policymakers is that any future restrictions should take into account this likely difference in response, in order to minimise economic disruption by calibrating support along the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The study will examine how these variables may influence different features of collective performance. This study employs a multi-step methodology, including a thorough review of existing literature, an empirical survey of 223 participant organizations, and an arithmetical examination to test the proposed conceptual structure to inform the two prospective and matter-of-fact outlooks. The studies have three phases. First, complete written work is reviewed to gain a deeper understanding of the topic. Next, a survey is conducted with responses from 223 participant organizations, and the data is collected. Finally, multiple retrogression analysis is used to evaluate the effects of firm age, possession, and firm size of an environmental management system certification on four elements of associated execution. The study's findings indicate a constructive correlation between fit size and these elements of corporate execution: social, environmental, and economic presentation. So, no connection was found between firm size and functional efficiency. Additionally, the study found that controlling an ecological management organization certification within Pakistani firms had a good effect on all staging elements when firm age did not correlate significantly with any of the four execution results. This study gives practical guides to supply chain executives in Pakistan and other nearby markets to understand better the correlation between these control variables and the execution on collective outcomes.</jats:p>",

A method of calculating the coefficient of thermal conductivity of a pipe wall with a complex structure of reinforcement has been developed. The fiberglass pipe is made by the continuous method of oblique-layer longitudinal-transverse winding on a self-feeding frame of reinforcing pseudo-tape moistened with a binder in the form of a rarefied mesh. With each rotation of the mandrel, it shifts by the amount of hardening of the obtained two-component material under the influence of temperature. A comparison of calculated and experimental data was made. When comparing various known calculated dependencies and experimental values, the accepted physical model and the real structure of the material are determined. The known dependences obtained for a medium with infinite long parallel cylindrical inclusions for unidirectional and orthogonally reinforced materials and therefore for materials with a complex structure and scheme of reinforcements give errors and deviations. The work assumes that fiberglass consists of two components - a reinforcing filler and a binder with pores, the reinforcing fibers are endless and have a circular cross-section, the reinforcing fibers are evenly distributed in the matrix of the binder, there is an ideal thermal contact at the boundaries of the distribution between the reinforcement and the binder. Experimental data on determining the transverse thermal conductivity of unidirectional fiberglass rods with reinforcement based on aluminoborosilicate or magnesium-aluminosilicate glass and epoxy binders showed the smallest error in comparison with the calculated ones (8-10%). They investigated the fact that the coefficient of thermal conductivity of a fiberglass pipe is 100 times lower than that of a steel pipe. It was determined that it is possible to replace a steel pipe with a diameter of 219 mm with a fiberglass pipe with a diameter of 146 mm.</jats:p>"

Research on the medications supply chain during major epidemic events is a major focus of people's attention and an important part of emergency management work, which is related to the vital interests of people and production enterprises. The supply of medications is an important foundation for the smooth implementation of emergency management work. Based on this, this article conducts empirical research on the multi-product two-level medication supply chain of a pharmaceutical company in Shanghai through optimization models. The medication supply chain consists of three warehouses, each equipped with two types of medications, A and B, which need to be transported to seven disaster-stricken medication demand points. Establish a relevant linear programming model to minimize transportation costs, and then use Lingo software to solve the model. The obtained data results are analyzed, the optimal solution is given, and the model is verified to be the optimal result. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis was conducted on the costs of the supply chain optimization strategy and non-optimization strategy. The research results indicate that the optimal solution not only minimizes transportation costs but also has the shortest transportation path, which can transport medications to various affected areas at the fastest speed, avoiding secondary damage caused by medications shortages in affected areas and ensuring smooth emergency management work.</jats:p>"

The presented calculation using the logical-probabilistic method by constructing a fault tree is advisable to use to estimate the frequency of power loss of DCp and DPp, as well as individual connections. For the studied circuits, graphical dependences of the probability of failure-free operation of electrical equipment and the occurrence of a failure over time have been constructed.</jats:p>",

One of the directions is strengthening the local actors and short food supply chains. Simultaneously, changes in farming systems are needed, and organic agriculture is one of the ways to make food systems more environmentally sustainable. Despite the abundance of research on the environmental consciousness of consumers in short food supply chains, the question is raised whether local food chain farmers are also committed to environmental sustainability. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the importance of environmental sustainability to organic short food supply chain actors. More specifically, the research depicts the views of organic farmers and consumers and their relation to the actual environmental sustainability of short food supply chains. During the research, a specific short food supply chain – a direct purchasing network – was explored. A qualitative approach was applied to reach the aim. Thus, in-depth interviews and observations were used as a research method. The research results demonstrated the views of farmers and consumers of the specific network regarding environmental sustainability aspects in the network. In the research, such environmental aspects as the circularity of resources, biodiversity, chemicals in the environment, seasonality and locality of diets, and the distance (food miles) were admitted as crucial ones by the specific short food supply chain actors. The differences in opinions of consumers and farmers emerged when thinking about the scale of their views.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The recent global disruptions that affected the industrial dynamics, from trade wars to the COVID-19 pandemic, from geopolitical tensions to the steep increase in energy cost and disruptions in the raw material sourcing and logistic dynamics, placed an unprecedented challenge on organisational supply chains, which had to reinvent themselves to maintain competitiveness, flexibility and reliability in an extremely volatile environment. Historically, supply chains relied on industry-standard planning models, such as sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) or integrated business planning (IBP), as a foundation of their planning process through a cooperative connection between demand and supply planning, and through an established process to collect all the key data and information in a consistent form to support all the critical decision-making processes. Nonetheless, in most cases, poorly or partially implemented S&amp;OP/IBP models have failed to keep their promises, as companies struggled to achieve a full integration of processes, functions or key performance indicators (KPIs), while a robust integrated business process is able to guarantee a holistic and comprehensive planning and performance management system supporting the decisionmaking process and ultimately delivering a positive impact to the organisation’s profit and loss (P&amp;L). A mature planning model should therefore embrace both a tactical and a strategic time frame, thus ensuring a strategic alignment, a ‘vertical link’, between the short to mid-term operational plans and the organisation’s long-term strategic objectives. The whole process consequently must be designed as a robust operating model allowing the organisation to monitor, update, execute and eventually deliver its strategic goals. This paper focuses on the best practices adopted by AkzoNobel to implement a mature IBP model across the whole organisation, and to achieve a full integration with the pre-existing financial planning processes in its journey that started in 2018 and is still ongoing today.</jats:p>"

Over the last decade, the commercial production of RJF has piqued the interest of airlines and governments around the world. However, RJF production can be challenging due to its dispersed supply resources. Furthermore, the production of RJF is more costly compared to producing conventional jet fuel. In this study, using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP), we design a corn-stover-based RJF supply chain network in which we obtain an optimized configuration of the supply chain and determine operational decisions required to meet RJF demand at airports. To accelerate the commercialization of RJF production, we examined four incentive programs designed to cover the supply chain’s costs, with agricultural statistics districts serving as the designated supply regions. This study is validated by employing the model to design the supply chain in the Midwestern United States. The results from this study are promising as they show the supply chain can achieve commercialization with partial financial coverage from the incentive programs. Based on the findings of this study, policymakers can devise policies to commercialize RJF production and accelerate its adoption by the industry.</jats:p>"

The output has been mainly used for local consumption of fresh nuts, coconut-based industries within the country, and coconut exports. The instability of coconut supply seriously affects local as well as export market potentials. Identification of various factors and the extent to which those affected the current coconut supply have not been examined in the recent empirical work. This study examines the supply response of coconut in Sri Lanka, using Nerlovian Partial Adjustment model. The study used time series data of total coconut production, output price, rainfall, fertilizer amount, land extent, technology, and the presence of fertilizer subsidy for a period of 30 years (1985-2015) for the analysis. Among the different types of functional forms tested, the log-linear model was selected as the best fit model (R2=0.894). The model was tested for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity using the Durbin-Watson statistic and the Breusch-pagan test, respectively. The results revealed that the variables, i.e.two years lagged price, one year lagged rainfall, and two years lagged fertilizer amount affect the coconut production significantly (p&lt;0.05). The short-run and long-run price elasticities were estimated for two years lagged output price.The output price is the most influential factor in short run with the elasticity of 0.33 (two year lagged price variables were considered) while rainfall is the most important determinant of coconut production in Sri Lanka. The study concludes that coconut production in the country tends to change as a response to the changes in coconut price both in the short-run and long-run. Further, rainfall and amount of fertilizer applied are the two main factors that determine the coconut supply in Sri Lanka.</jats:p>"

This study addresses the critical barriers hindering the adoption of blockchain technology (BT) in the Chinese FSC, recognizing the unique challenges posed by its intricacies. Through a comprehensive literature review, fourteen Critical Barrier Factors (CBFs) were identified, and a grey Delphi method was employed to distill this set. Five pivotal CBFs emerged, including \"Regulatory Compliance,\" \"Cost of Implementation,\" and \"Complex Supply Chain Network.\" A subsequent grey Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) analysis revealed the causal relationships among these factors, categorizing them into influencing and influenced groups. \"Regulatory Compliance,\" \"Cost of Implementation,\" and \"Complex Supply Chain Network\" were identified as primary influencing factors demanding attention for effective BT integration in the FSC. The findings serve as a valuable resource for FSC stakeholders, assisting in prioritizing efforts to address these barriers. The discerned causal relationships provide guidance for managers in optimizing resource allocation. Ultimately, this research advocates for the adoption of blockchain technology in the FSC supply chain to enhance overall performance and operational efficiency.</p>"

Jember Regency is one of the regencies in East Java Province where the cultivation of large red chilies is quite high. The results of preliminary observations in the field indicate that several problems have occurred, such as an imbalance in the distribution of risk among supply chain actors. Farmers as the main actors in the supply chain have the highest risk of crop failure due to seasonal uncertainty. Supply chain analysis and evaluation will provide information about the problems contained in the supply chain, which will then identify the risks causing the supply chain to be less than optimal and determine the direction of continuous, effective, and efficient improvement in the supply chain of large red chilies. This study aims to minimize or eliminate the impact of risks that occur during large red chili supply chain activities in the Ambulu District. This research was conducted by applying the SCOR model for supply chain activity mapping and the House Of Risk (HOR) model for supply chain risk management. The identification results show that large red chili supply chain activities in Ambulu District have four activity patterns, then there are 28 risk events and 24 risk agents that occur in large red chili supply chain activities. Based on the calculation results, the results are in the form of seven risk management strategies in the large red chili supply chain which consist of conducting routine evaluations, choosing the right pesticides, collaborating with the local government, conducting routine treatment on plants, training workers, farming management, and counseling on the selection of the right seeds to farmers.</jats:p>"

Judgmental and snowball sampling methods were applied in all stages. In the first stage, based on theoretical saturation, 15 people and in other stages, 12 experts participated. In the first phase, financing drivers were identified through interviews and thematic analysis. In the second phase, using the researcher-made questionnaire and Micmac 6.1.2 software, the main drivers were extracted. In the third phase, the uncertainty of each of the key drivers was determined by an interactive management approach, and finally, in the fourth phase, compatible scenarios were determined using a researcher-made questionnaire and its analysis with the Scenariowizard 4.3.1 software.\r\nResults: In this research, 14 factors influencing the government funding of the healthcare sector were identified. Moreover, 5 compatible scenarios for financing were obtained. In the \"wealthy government\" scenario, the financing conditions were favorable by the government, but in the scenarios of \"calm inefficient\", \"inefficient without a plan\", \"inefficient unstable\" and \"bankrupt government\", the government had many problems and the health sector should focus on other financing methods.\r\nConclusion: Due to the lack of favorability of most scenarios, it is necessary for healthcare managers to reduce dependence on the government budget and promote financing from other methods. Methods such as financing through the provision of services, charitable donations and insurances, and the stock market should be given serious consideration.\r\n </jats:p>"

The problem of water supply in rural settlements is particularly acute, since more than 38% of rural water pipes, from which samples were taken for laboratory research, did not meet the requirements of the quality standard in terms of sanitary-chemical and microbiological indicators. At the same time, only a quarter of Ukrainian villages are provided with centralized water supply, and the rest of rural consumers still use water from individual water intakes, which in many cases are in an unsatisfactory sanitary and technical condition.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper offers an empirical study to explore the relationship between transportation modalities and environmental concerns, promoting the adoption of synchromodality as a strategic pathway to achieving sustainable freight transport. The study uses a synchromodal freight transportation platform to analyze the impact of carbon tax policy on modal shift and environmental sustainability. The synchromodal platform is based on an optimization model using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), incorporating carbon tax as a surrogate measure for environmental costs. A sensitivity analysis is conducted across four distinct scenarios in a case study in the Great Lakes region, focusing on the Canada-US transborder trade. The results of this study illustrate the considerable potential for increasing the utilization of more environmentally sustainable transportation modes in this region. While the addition of carbon tax entails increased total transportation costs for each unit of cargo, the synchromodal-enabled modal shift promises to mitigate transportation’s negative externalities, including congestion, environmental impacts, and noise pollution. The results also highlight the role of synchromodality as a catalyst for sustainable freight transport decisions in the context of a carbon-conscious world.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  \tIn recent years, variable renewable energy such as solar power and wind power spreads rapidly. At the same time, taking measures against output fluctuations and utilization of surplus electricity become important issues. Conversion of electricity to hydrogen is considered as one of the utilizations of surplus electricity [1]. The hydrogen is stored and can be supplied to the fuel cell vehicles according to demand, regardless of weather or time. However, the disadvantage of hydrogen is its low energy density. Although several methods have been investigated for high-density storage of hydrogen, there are still issues about safety, energy loss, cost, and durability [2].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this study, we propose a new energy storage and hydrogen supply method using lithium (Figure 1). The surplus electricity can be converted by the following reaction, and the energy is stored as the lithium.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> + e<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> → Li (-3.04 V vs. SHE) (1)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>4LiOH → 4Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> + O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> + 2H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O + 4e<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> (0.41 V vs. SHE) (2)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The lithium can be stored at room temperature and pressure, and its volumetric energy is higher than that of conventional hydrogen storage methods. When hydrogen is needed, the system can be discharged to produce hydrogen by the following reaction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Li → Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> + e<jats:sup>-</jats:sup> (-3.04 V vs. SHE) (3)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>2Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> + 2H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O + 2e<jats:sup>-</jats:sup>→ 2LiOH + H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (-0.82 V vs. SHE) (4)</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since the lithium is highly reactive, discharge reaction with water occurs, and hydrogen can be produced without energy input from the outside. As shown in Equation (2) and Equation (4), charge and discharge reactions at the cathode are different, and this system combines the characteristics of lithium-air cell [3] and lithium-water cell [4]. This system has a potential to utilize the surplus electricity; but it has not been fully evaluated from the viewpoint of hydrogen production [5]. Therefore, present study investigated the characteristics of the discharge reaction and hydrogen production behavior.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 2 shows experimental cell. The composite anode was water-stable and had a multilayer structure [6]. LATP (Li<jats:sub>1+x+y</jats:sub>Al<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Ti<jats:sub>2-x</jats:sub>Si<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>P<jats:sub>3-y</jats:sub>, Ohara Co., Kanagawa, Japan), which is a water-stable lithium-ion-conducting glass ceramic, was used, along with PEO<jats:sub>18</jats:sub>LiTFSI as the organic electrolyte. The lithium foil and polyethylene oxide (PEO) membrane were sealed inside the cell to prevent direct contact with water vapor and oxygen. Since the cell resistance depends on the temperature, the composite anode was kept at 70°C. For the cathode, glassy carbon rod was used.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 3 shows current-voltage (I-V) characteristics. The cathode potential at low-current discharge is higher than theoretical value (-0.82 V). It was caused by reaction with dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte. As the current value is increased, the cathode potential drops sharply, and many bubbles were observed on the cathode end face. It is thought that oxygen concentration overvoltage increased significantly and the discharge reaction with water (hydrogen production as shown in Equation (4)) was occurred.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The volume of the produced bubble was measured with using a sealed cathode and adding a liquid level gauge (not shown in Figure 2). As a result, the measured volume showed good agreement with the theoretical hydrogen volume produced by the reaction of Equation (4). It is considered that the reaction shifts to hydrogen production and the effect of dissolved oxygen can be negligible at sufficiently low cathode potential (i.e. high current discharge).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The efficiency of this system was estimated by using the obtained experimental results. Generated electricity and enthalpy of produced hydrogen was calculated. When a 20 μA discharge test was conducted by using experimental cell, the discharge efficiency and conversion rate to hydrogen were 30% and 39%, respectively. For comparison, the experimental cell was converted to the lithium-air battery mode and discharged at 20 μA. The discharge efficiency was 56%. Considering the conversion ratio of lithium to electricity and hydrogen, the proposed hydrogen supply system using the lithium can utilize the variable renewable energy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p/>\n               <jats:p>\n                  <jats:bold>References:</jats:bold>\n               </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] Y.

The current study examined the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and agriculture to optimize food supply chain from farm to consumer business model. The study examined how AI-driven solutions may boost efficiency, reduce waste, and promote environmental responsibility with an emphasis on sustainability. The food supply system faces resource depletion, climate change, and growing global food consumption. AI technologies, such as automation, data analytics, and machine learning may solve these issues. AI systems use real-time data, predictive analytics, and intelligent logistics to improve production, distribution, and consumption. This reduces food production and transportation of carbon emissions along with improving resource allocation. AI-powered precision agriculture helps the farmers to increase crop yields while lowering fertilizer and pesticide use along with supporting sustainable farming as well. IoT devices and sensor networks are helpful to improve livestock management and crop monitoring, enabling data-driven agriculture. The current study highlighted how AI ensures food quality and safety across supply chain. By identifying impurities, monitoring storage conditions, and forecasting shelf life, AI-powered quality control systems may decrease food wastage and ensure safe, high-quality goods. In conclusion, AI-agriculture integration is an innovative way to increase farm-to-consumer food supply chain efficiency and sustainability. AI technology may help the supply chain stakeholders to create resource-efficient, environmentally friendly food production that meets the needs of a growing population.

A simple random sampling was used to select 766 respondents from the southwest geo-political zone of Nigeria. Data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. Results show a high level of awareness of water pollution and conservation strategies. However, people's attitude towards preventing water pollution and conservation was poor. Age does not significantly (at p &amp;lt; 0.05) affect awareness and attitude towards water pollution prevention and conservation. However, the level of education significantly (at p &amp;lt; 0.05) influences the level of awareness and attitude of people towards water pollution prevention and conservation. EE increases awareness and attitude towards water pollution prevention and conservation. Therefore, the Federal Ministries of Water Resources and Education should endeavour to make EE a compulsory programme in the school curriculum across all levels of education.</jats:p>",

Currently, the European Union is striving to shorten supply chains in agriculture, as short supply chains are ecologically, economically and socially more sustainable. The main objective of the paper is to examine the role of primary producers in the agri-food supply chains. The basic technique applied for data collection was questionnaire survey, which we carried out on family farms in Slovakia. Obtained data were statistically examined applying the statistical analysis using the Chi-square test. Based on the estimations, we could conclude that the choice of the main distribution channel depends on the size of the given company and also on the main type of production. Businesses with fewer than 10 employees prefer direct distribution channels that allow them to sell their products to final consumers. The identification of factors affecting the choice of the main distribution channel as well as a detailed analysis of the nature of dependence make it possible to formulate recommendations on what steps to take in order to increase the number of agricultural enterprises selling through short supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Many of today’s most successful supply chains are ones that have executed a digitisation of information processes. Digital information unlocks game-changing experiences that we have recently grown accustomed to, such as two-day online delivery and order visibility. Digital transformation has quickly become a popular buzzword in supply chain management, a term that everyone understands as important for the future. Unfortunately, many struggle to get started with this concept, facing an immense resistance to change and a lack of leadership support. This paper compares and contrasts companies that are data-driven and those that are not, introduces the six stages of digital transformation and helps the reader to identify where their company currently is. It also provides a set of practical steps to get started in your organisation and discusses some roadblocks that you are likely to encounter. The paper will be especially impactful for those looking to drive digital change in their organisations by leading the effort to analyse, simplify and digitise legacy processes.</jats:p>"

This raises problems, especially those related to guaranteeing continuity of coffee quality, limited supply availability, and timeliness of sales. Therefore, this study aims to identify the structure of the Robusta coffee supply chain and analyze the efficiency of the Robusta coffee supply chain performance in Kubu Raya Regency. The method used to identify the structure of the supply chain is descriptive analysis, while the DEA method is used to analyze the efficiency of the members performance of the supply chain. The results indicate that the structure of the supply chain consists of farmers, collectors, wholesalers, and retailers. Overall, the results of the performance efficiency measurement show that the performance of the Robusta coffee supply chain is efficient. However, there are still 4 farmers and 1 trader with inefficient performance, namely DMU1,2,6, and 7 at the farmer level, while at the trader level it is in DMU 5. Therefore, improvements are needed to improve the performance of the supply chain actors by reducing the variable input and increasing the output variable</jats:p>"

It is based on the previously obtained solutions of the system of differential equations describing the liquid movement with variable flow rate in distribution pressure drainage pipelines that operate at the horizontal level of the groundwater surface. The analysis is presented in dimensionless form. The influence of the groundwater level slope on the calculation results is estimated using the value of the relative flow variation in the initial section of the distribution pipeline and the generalized parameter of the distribution drain A, which takes into account its design and filtration characteristics. The obtained calculation formulas are quite simple and easy to use. The proposed method allows to determine the limits within which simplified dependencies for the calculation of drainage pipelines can be used, which are recommended for use at the horizontal groundwater level on the land reclamation site. At the same time, the error introduced into the calculations as a result of the adopted simplification is immediately determined. Corresponding graphs are presented in the paper to illustrate the obtained dependencies.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

It was motivated by challenges in Indonesia that led to foodwaste due to lengthy supply chain, particularly evident in the horticulture category, such as vegetables. The inefficiencies along the chain resulted in substantial annual losses, ranging from IDR 213 to 551 trillion, equivalent to 4% - 5% of Indonesian GDP. Using associative investigation with three variables and 446 samples selected through simple random sampling, the research aimed to evaluate and enhance E-SCM performance in supply chain. The effective applicationof E-SCM offered benefits, including time and cost efficiency, work flexibility, and other conveniences. Not only this did benefit the company but also enhanced service quality and customer satisfaction. SEM-PLS was used with a reflective method, and data processing was facilitated by SMART-PLS 4 software. The results show a significant influence ofE-SCM application on service quality and customer satisfaction. Furthermore, service quality has a significant and direct impact on customer satisfaction. E-SCM influences customer satisfaction through both direct and indirect pathways, which are mediated by service quality variables. </jats:p>"

A variable load profile reduces the operating efficiency  of electric power plants and leads to an overestimation of the power of transformer substations and the wire size of supply lines. Thus residential buildings power equipment remains underloaded for a significant part of the time. The decrease of power-frequency characteristic is becoming increasingly noticeable. This situation is not a problem yet, but in the future it may complicate the task of frequency stabilization. Finding solutions to existing and predicted problems is an important topic of research. To solve the problems posed, the work proposes the concept of a reversible energy converter, that is an electrotechnical complex with a flywheel energy storage and a two-section frequency converter based on two reversible voltage converters (active front end). The planning area of application of a reversible energy converter is transformer substations of residential and public buildings of urban power supply systems. The reversible energy converter is designed to solve such problems as load leveling, reactive power compensation (power factor correction), balancing voltages and power-frequency characteristic control. The work presents a connection scheme a reversible energy converter to the supply system and provides an expression for the phase load voltage.</jats:p>",

A continuous regimen of scheduled equipment upgrades has\n  been maintained across all subsystems to ensure ongoing improvement\n  and the preservation of an optimal research facility\n  environment. The central focus of this study revolves around the\n  design and realization of a TPS correction magnet power supply\n  employing Linear Power Operational Amplifiers (LPOA) in conjunction\n  with a pre-regulated voltage controller. The power source\n  predominantly features APEX Corporation's PA05 LPOA, characterized\n  by bipolar output, high internal power dissipation, and wide\n  bandwidth. Additionally, a DC Current Transducer (DCCT) was employed\n  as the current feedback element, integrated with the pre-regulator\n  voltage controller to form a closed-loop current modulation circuit,\n  providing the variable voltage required by the LPOA. Through these\n  measures, we have successfully developed an LPOA power supply unit\n  equipped with a pre-regulated voltage controller for TPS correction\n  magnets. The prototype device boasts a maximum output current of\n  ±10 A, operating at 24 V. Validation through control loop\n  design has led to rapid and stable output current performance. The\n  output current ripple is maintained within 100 μA, with a\n  rise time of 75 μs during step response.

Long-term\n  output current stability is sustained within ten ppm. Finally, a\n  hardware prototype circuit has been constructed in the power supply\n  laboratory, featuring a ±24 V input voltage and ±10 A\n  output current, achieving a maximum rated power of 240 W.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Big data analytics (BDA) in supply chain management (SCM) is growing in attention. This is because BDA has a wide range of applications in SCM, including customer behavior analysis, trend analysis, and demand prediction. In this survey, we investigate the predictive BDA applications in supply chain demand forecasting to\r\npropose a classification of these applications, identify the gaps, and provide insights for future research. We classify these algorithms and their applications in supply chain management into time-series forecasting, clustering, K-nearest-neighbors, neural networks, regression analysis, support vector machines, and support vector regression. This survey also points to the fact that the literature is particularly lacking on the applications of BDA for demand forecasting in the case of closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) and highlights avenues for future research. Big data analytics is a combination of tools, processing systems, and algorithms that can interpret insights from data. Traditionally, SCM relied on ERP and other disparate storage systems for data. Big Data assists in reconfiguring the numerous flexible sections of the supply chain, optimizing available resources (space, tools, materials, human resources, and so on), and maximizing productivity throughout implementation. Through our research, we want to know the scope of Big Data in Supply Chain.</jats:p>"

This study employs water scarcity indices to assess water resources in the agricultural sector of Iran's Jazmourian watershed. Overall, we find that the watershed is experiencing a “very high stress” water situation. This is primarily due to intensive water usage for diverse crops, which has resulted in a negative net virtual water balance and contributed to a rise in water stress and poverty levels. The water stress index is 0.88, and the agricultural water stress is 1.25. The agricultural water footprint is 2,018.53 million cubic meters (MCM), with the share of blue, green and gray water footprints being 80.21, 6.08, and 13.72%, respectively. The region possesses 3,210 MCM of available water for crops, with 17.1% sourced from green waters and 82.9% from blue waters. Despite low annual rainfall and limited water resources, the region excessively exploits water for diverse crops. The net virtual water balance is negative, indicating high virtual water export (1,112–1,605 MCM) compared to imports (58–265 MCM). With declining water availability and increasing crop production, the region experiences rising water stress. The spatial analysis of sub-watersheds reveals diverse patterns of water stress and poverty, as detailed in the study.</jats:p>",

The study explored the nature of recent digitization and remote monitoring through sensors, food development, and supply chain remodelling to assess post-pandemic acceleration toward modern production and marketing channels. An extensive review of the studies revealed that the emergence of organized micro-delivery channels had created a vast market scope to modernize distribution supply chains, where real-time production chains provided seamless transmission of information among all the stakeholders. The study revealed that the Government should encourage agri-tech startups, which can play a crucial role in propagating organized and hybrid supply chains. Further, livestock value-added product development through large-scale food fortification (LSFF) can help to reduce nutritional deficiency. Therefore, the study concluded that redesigning supply chains and value-added product development in the livestock sector are crucial to inclusive and sustainable agricultural development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the transition to sustainable public transportation with zero-emission buses, hydrogen fuel cell electric buses have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional diesel buses. However, assessing their economic viability is crucial for widespread adoption. This study carries out a comprehensive examination, encompassing both sensitivity and probabilistic analyses, to assess the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the bus fleet and its corresponding infrastructure. It considers various hydrogen supply options, encompassing on-site electrolysis, on-site steam methane reforming, and off-site hydrogen procurement with both gaseous and liquid delivery methods. The analysis covers critical cost elements, encompassing bus acquisition costs, infrastructure capital expenses, and operational and maintenance costs for both buses and infrastructure. This paper conducted two distinct case studies: one involving a current small bus fleet of five buses and another focusing on a larger fleet set to launch in 2028. For the current small fleet, the off-site gray hydrogen purchase with a gaseous delivery option is the most cost-effective among hydrogen alternatives, but it still incurs a 26.97% higher TCO compared to diesel buses. However, in the case of the expanded 2028 fleet, the steam methane-reforming method without carbon capture emerges as the most likely option to attain the lowest TCO, with a high probability of 99.5%. Additionally, carbon emission costs were incorporated in response to the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability. The findings indicate that although diesel buses currently represent the most economical option in terms of TCO for the existing small fleet, steam methane reforming with carbon capture presents a 69.2% likelihood of being the most cost-effective solution, suggesting it is a strong candidate for cost efficiency for the expanded 2028 fleet. Notably, substantial investments are required to increase renewable energy integration in the power grid and to enhance electrolyzer efficiency. These improvements are essential to make the electrolyzer a more competitive alternative to steam methane reforming. Overall, the findings in this paper underscore the substantial impact of the hydrogen supply chain and carbon emission costs on the TCO of zero-emission buses.</jats:p>"

These factors alter the structure and functionality of ecosystems and their capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services to society. The study of LULC changes is important for understanding the dynamics of relationships between environmental, social and economic components and for analyzing the factors affecting natural capital. Including ecosystem services (ES) in spatial planning tools and sectoral policies is useful for improving governance. In this paper, the impact of LULC changes on ES provision has been estimated. To this end, we carried out a literature review (Step 1) to select the biophysical and economic coefficients of ES supply by land cover classes and collect them in a database (Step 2). We subsequently aggregated the economic and biophysical coefficients by macro classes (Step 3) and, using the benefit transfer approach, we estimated the change in the supply of ESs concerning permanence and transition phenomena in Italy from 1990 to 2018 (Step 4). The transition phenomena analysis also allowed us to evaluate the consequences of urbanization and urban green space governance on ES supply. Indeed, these urban green spaces can help reduce risks to people’s health and safety and mitigate the effects induced by climate change. In total, approximately 800 coefficients (biophysical and economic) of ESs supplied by Corine Land Cover classes were acquired. The results show a reduction in the annual supply of ecosystem services of EUR 927 million (2022) caused by LULC changes between 1990 and 2018. This research proposes a methodology to improve knowledge of ESs concerning anthropogenic impacts and to support land-use planning policies regarding Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The results of the conducted research made it possible to establish that in EU countries chlorine dioxide (CD) is more often used for secondary or final disinfection of drinking water. By-products of this process are chlorites and chlorates, which are subject to control in the drinking water of all EU countries. Aldehydes and carboxylic acids can also be formed in drinking water, which leads to a decrease in the microbiological stability of tap water. Ozonation and filtration using a carbon filter are used in the final stage of drinking water purification, which contributes to a significant reduction in the dose of CD and water contamination with toxic chlorites. In the case of pre-oxidation of water with sodium hypochlorite, the largest amount of chlorites and chlorates is formed, while in the case of using potassium permanganate for the same purpose, the need for CD and the amount of chlorites and chlorates in drinking water reduced. Chlorination of natural water that has undergone CD pre-oxidation leads to complete oxidation of the chlorites that have formed, increases the effectiveness of disinfection, and provides a bacteriostatic effect in the distribution network. During 2021-2022, when using CD for the treatment of drinking water at the Dniprovska WTP in Kyiv it was established that the process of treating natural water with CD is accompanied by the formation of its by-products, mainly toxic chlorites, the levels of which depend on the applied doses of CD and are the lowest in winter, while the largest ones are observed in summer and do not always reach regulatory values (0,2 mg/l) and range up to 0,7 mg/l, which corresponds to the WHO recommended standard for this substance in drinking water. Italian scientists focus their attention on the fact that during the first years of using CD at each water supply station, optimal conditions must be ensured for the safe and effective use of this reagent. Therefore, CD is becoming widespread in the EU countries and Ukraine for the treatment of tap drinking water; it is an alternative method of water effective disinfection at water supply stations with traditional surface water purification technology. Using such a method for treating surface water requires a preliminary pilot experiment and should be carried out along with an analysis of the feasibility of using the methods for preliminary and/or final purification of drinking water from organic substances and additional disinfection. Today, based on experimental and natural studies, it is relevant to expand knowledge about the properties of CD in the case of its use in drinking water supply for the treatment of surface water with a high content of organic substances.</jats:p>"

Scaling the supply\nvoltage is a useful technique for cutting the energy needed by digital circuitry. Based\non Shannon's channel capacity theorem, the fundamental limit for supply voltage for\nplanar CMOS circuits has been determined to be 36 mV. FinFET devices fit ultra-low\nvoltage applications better than planar devices because of their nearly excellent sub-threshold properties. For the first time, the fundamental supply voltage limit for logic\ncircuits using FinFETs has been defined in this work.

On this\nfundamental limit, the impact of temperature variations and device design\ncharacteristics is also investigated. Other logic gates, such as the NAND gate, are\nincluded in the analysis. To determine this fundamental limit for a FinFET device, a\nnovel physics-based, semi-empirical current equation valid for supply voltage below\n100 mV has been proposed. This is because the operation of a FinFET device in the\nultra-low voltage domain differs significantly from that of its planar counterpart. A\ncircuit designer values a current model like this because it makes calculations for back\nof the envelope calculations simple.

Drawing on quality-adjusted housing price data at the district level, we show that regional fundamentals explain up to two-thirds of between-region and 77 to 87 percent of within-region variation in price growth. Price increases were driven mainly by co-movements in local demand fundamentals, notably population density and skill level. However, we further reveal systematic variation unrelated to fundamentals: overvaluation of top 7 cities, path dependency, and spatial spillovers. We infer that speculation, investor preference for liquid markets, and bounded rationality contributed substantially to the recent housing price boom in Germany.</jats:p>",

A survey by the UN development program says that in just three months, 71 million people have reached the poverty line, which shows a much faster increase than during the pandemic. It is evident that the fuel prices, which have been increasing more and more, have influenced the increase in the prices of food and maintenance products. The ever-increasing growth of oil consumption and the economic crisis as a consequence of the war in Ukraine have pushed the price of Brent oil above $100/barrel, a record price recorded in recent years. We understand the challenges governments around the world now face to make quick decisions while ensuring those decisions position their countries' economies for a better future. Experts in the field say that the world must find solutions in the use of renewable sources to replace fossil fuels. This implies fair access for everyone to renewable energy technology, but without implemented policies that encourage domestic and foreign investments in renewable energy, of course and with subsidies from the state, we will not be able to achieve the desired goal.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to map the profile of Italian wine companies through the analysis of multiple case studies. The study focuses specifically on companies in the Marche region, investigating their features and supply chain, with a specific focus on product and system certification adopted, marketing policies implemented, and the businesses’ relationship with institutions. A total of 18 companies participated in the study. The primary data for the research was collected through semi-structured interviews lasting 1 h, based on an interview protocol. The results show that the supply chain for the wine sector is configured to be short, even when cooperatives act as an aggregator. The small size and limited financial resources make it particularly difficult to promote the wine outside its reference context, and there is a lack of a network strategy at the local level. Many companies consider organic certification a disadvantage since it tends to homologate production to the large wine industries, making the product’s naturalness, typicality, and craftsmanship disappear.</jats:p>"

This followed the emergence of pluralistic forms of governance, which call for greater democracy and emphasises transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and engagement as credentials for sustainable resource management. Nigeria has embraced these pluralistic forms of governance in its water sector as part of efforts to promote sustainable water resource management. However, to successfully engage and involve core stakeholders in the face of myriad urban water supply challenges and achieve optimal outcomes remain a challenge as it is unclear who the core stakeholders are. This study examines Nigerian’s urban water supply system and the extent of the interests of the stakeholders to identify the core stakeholders as an input towards facilitating sustainable water resources management in the country based on a survey of urban water supply experts in the country. The study finds 15 core or primary stakeholders out of 25 stakeholders and note that their core stakeholder status is linked to their direct involvement or connection with the water supply system and its successful running, which is rooted in them being customers or investors or regulators and enforcers of regulation, funders, supervisors, and the need to respect community and social interests. The study concludes that whilst the engagement of all stakeholders is good for sustainable water resources management in Nigeria, engagement, and involvement of the 15 core stakeholders is paramount to the sustainable and successful operations of the country’s urban water supply system.</jats:p>",

As a physical model, this three-phase flow is represented as the compatible movement of the pulp (a mixture of liquid and solid particles) and compressed air in the form of shells. It is assumed that the lifting of solid material is carried out by liquid plugs that move in the intervals between the air shells. The purpose of the work is to determine the actual concentrations and velocities of the phases as one of the important hydrodynamic characteristics of the flow. The method of statistical averaging of these characteristics is used, similar to the theoretical-probabilistic method of averaging in the theory of turbulence, the basis of which is the transition from consideration of a single flow to consideration of a statistical set of similar flows carried out under almost identical conditions. The actual phase concentrations in any given live current section are considered in terms of the unconditional probability of one or another phase passing through the section. To determine the true velocities of the phases, hydraulic continuity equations are used, containing probability-averaged hydrodynamic quantities and describing each phase individually as some continuum in the statistical sense. In this case, the true velocity of a phase in any given live section is defined as the statistical average of the velocity, provided that this phase clearly intersects the section. The expressions obtained for the real concentrations and velocities of the phases form the theoretical basis for the construction of a hydraulic mathematical model of the three-phase flow with respect to the problem of airlift calculation.</jats:p>"

It facilitates direct transactions between parties, ensuring greater transparency than traditional financial institutions. This transparency extends to supply chain operations, where participants gain trust through identical ledgers, enhancing overall business transactions. Blockchain's utilization helps eliminate inaccuracies in payments, shipment delays, and financial ledger entries, thereby improving accuracy and efficiency. This paper aims to provide a concise overview of Blockchain's potential long-term effects, outlining fundamental differences between supply chains with and without Blockchain. The methodology adopted in this paper is to carry out a systematic literature review that covers contemporary supply chain management knowledge, Blockchain applications, and the technology's foundations, contributing to a holistic understanding of its transformative potential in the supply chain landscape. Moreover, in this study, we apply the theoretical base framework analysis approach to fill the gap regarding the knowledge of blockchain technology integration in supply chain management in the organization. This study will contribute to covering theoretically based blockchain supply chain management by thoroughly analyzing the state of the industry today, highlighting important issues, and putting up creative solutions. Policymakers, business professionals, and researchers attempting to negotiate the challenges of integrating and maximizing Blockchain technology inside the supply chain ecosystem will also find great value in the insights obtained from this study. In addition to adding to the body of knowledge in academia, the results offered here will provide useful advice for creating and implementing reliable, transparent, and effective supply chain systems that make use of Blockchain technology. As we explore deeper into this developing landscape, the conclusions of this research will surely play a crucial part in influencing the path of future studies and breakthroughs in Blockchain-based Supply Chain Management Systems.</jats:p>"

Cool season precipitation and snowpack have historically been robust predictors of seasonal runoff in western Colorado. Forecasts made with this information allow water managers to plan for the season ahead. Antecedent hydrological conditions, such as root zone soil moisture and groundwater storage, and weather conditions following peak snowpack also impact seasonal runoff. The roles of such factors were scrutinized in 2020 and 2021: seasonal runoff was much lower than expectations based on snowpack values alone. We investigate the relative importance of meteorological and hydrological conditions occurring before and after the snowpack season in predicting seasonal runoff in western Colorado. This question is critical because the most effective investment strategy for improving forecasts depends on if errors arise before or after the snowpack season. This study is conducted using observations from the Snow Telemetry Network, root zone soil moisture and groundwater data from the Western Land Data Assimilation Systems, and a random forest–based statistical forecasting framework. We find that on average, antecedent root zone soil moisture and groundwater storage values do not add significant skill to seasonal water supply forecasts in western Colorado. In contrast, using precipitation and temperature data after the time of peak snowpack improves water supply forecasts significantly. The 2020 and 2021 runoffs were hampered by dry conditions both before and after the snowpack season. Both antecedent soil moisture and spring/summer precipitation data improved water supply forecast accuracy in these years.</jats:p>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Significance Statement</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Seasonal water supply forecasts in western Colorado are highly valuable because spring and summer runoff from this region helps support the water supply of 40 million people.

Heavy investments have been made in improving our ability to monitor antecedent hydrological conditions in western Colorado, such as root zone soil moisture and groundwater. However, results from this study indicate that the largest source of uncertainty in western Colorado runoff forecasts is future weather. Therefore, improved subseasonal-to-seasonal weather forecasts for western Colorado are what is most needed to improve regional water supply forecasts, and the ability to properly manage western Colorado water.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Since the beginning of the second industrial revolution, one urgent question has been the formation of supply chains for raw materials and the optimal calculation of production volumes for each individual day. This article examines a forestry enterprise that does not have its own sources of wood, which daily solves the problem of ensuring the supply of raw materials and optimal production load. A commodity exchange is considered as a source of raw materials where lots randomly appear every day in different raw material regions. In the scientific literature, there are many approaches to calculating the optimal profit value over the entire planning horizon, but they do not consider many features that are important for a timber processing enterprise. This paper presents a mathematical model which is a mechanism for making daily decisions over the entire planning horizon and differs in that it allows one to take into account the share of useful volume and the delivery time of raw materials under conditions of uncertainty. The result of the model is the optimal profit trajectory, considering the volume of raw materials, the delivery time of lots, the volume of profit and the production volume of goods. The model was tested on data from the Russian Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange and one of the Primorsky Territory enterprises. Analysis of the results showed that there are difficulties in planning supply chains and production volumes. An assessment of the optimality of raw material regions was carried out. The advantages and disadvantages of the mathematical model are formulated.</jats:p>",

Traditional MPPT control methods such as\n                    perturbation and observation and incremental conductance have poor adaptability\n                    to external environmental changes, the intelligent algorithm has the\n                    characteristics of fast rate of convergence and global search, etc. Therefore,\n                    on the basis of sliding mode control, this article introduces genetic algorithm\n                    for multi-objective function parameter tuning of sliding mode control law,\n                    forming an intelligent sliding mode MPPT control method based on genetic\n                    algorithm, which has good adaptability; Finally, three control strategies for\n                    photovoltaic power supply MPPT control of solar powered UAV are simulated and\n                    analyzed in the MATLAB environment, the simulation results show that all three\n                    control strategies can achieve good tracking performance when external\n                    environmental conditions change, Among them, intelligent sliding mode control\n                    has obvious anti-interference ability, achieving the fastest steady-state\n                    response speed, the smallest steady-state oscillation amplitude, and the\n                    shortest steady-state oscillation time. Overall, its tracking effect is the\n                    best, and it can effectively achieve MPPT control of solar powered UAV\n                    photovoltaic power supply.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</jats:p>"

The design of distributed power supply topology plays a vitally important role in the distributed power supply system. The paper presents an engineering design method of distributed power supply for the distributed control system in a certain aero-engine. The distributed power supply topology is developed. Based on this topology, the bus voltage level and the current of the distributed intelligent nodes are designed. The optimal selection method of transmission cable types between intelligent nodes is also provided based on the equivalent circuit of a distributed power supply system. The results show that the cable transmission loss and voltage drop meet the design specifications of electrical cable. The proposed distributed power scheme for the distributed engine control system results in minimal modifications, smaller transmission current, and lighter cables.</jats:p>",

The unfolding of nonparametric penalized spline and the introduction of Bayesian in stratified quantile are utilized to construct regression models applicable to accounting robustness, respectively. In the empirical study, the economic policy uncertainty index, accounting robustness and commercial credit supply are measured respectively. The annual data of China’s Shenzhen and Shanghai A-share listed companies during the period from 2012 to 2021 were selected as the research basis, and Bayesian quantile regression was made on the basis of correlation analysis. The coefficient of commercial credit supply is found to be -0.0821, and the variable RD1 is negatively correlated with economic policy uncertainty. This regression result confirms hypothesis H1 of this paper, suggesting that private firms invest less in innovation when economic policy uncertainty is higher. In the test of economic policy uncertainty by type, the regression coefficients of RD2, EPU, and SIZE are negative, respectively -0.0368, −0.2124, and -0.1458, which indicates that fiscal policy, monetary policy, and exchange rate and capital account policy uncertainty are negatively correlated with the supply of business credit to enterprises. Based on this correlation, this study provides guidance for the development of business credit for enterprises.</jats:p>",

The village’s maximum power demand is 50kvA, consisting of demands of twenty (20) households. The first converter in the proposed multiport system is a high frequency isolated DC-DC converter fed with HVDC link yielding an output voltage of 700vDC. The isolated DC-DC converter uses a medium frequency transformer with primary and secondary side converters in input-series output-parallel (ISOP) configuration. Also, the output of first converter is connected to a solar PV and battery system through a buck-boost converter. The second converter in the system is solar PV fed three phase modular inverter designed to have output AC line voltage of 0.415 kV. The three phase inverter is based on modular multilevel converter (MMC) with interleaved modulation techniques. A silicon carbide power MOSFETs, with model numbers CPM3-10000-0270(CREE) and SD11703 (Solitron) are used as a building blocks for isolated DC-DC converter. On the other hand, SiC -MOSFET with part number SCT3017AL (RHOM) is used as basic building block for modular inverter. A solar PV module with open circuit voltage of 85V and maximum power rating of 415W is used to feed the inverter. Different scenarios such as changes in load and changes in solar irradiance are used for critically evaluating the performances of the system under question. The output voltage THD, current distortions, changes in the converter output voltage, current magnitude and converter efficiency are used for performance evaluation of the system under consideration. Simulink/ PLECS (Piecewise Linear Electrical Circuit Simulation) combo simulation platform is used to model and simulate the system in question. Simulation results showed that the proposed multiport converter system can be a viable alternative to low frequency distribution transformer.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Multiport converter, MMC, DC-DC converter, Hybrid power Supply, Solar PV.</jats:p>"

As globalization and advancements in technology continue to reshape the logistics landscape, it becomes imperative for India to adapt to these changes. One key aspect is the need to enhance skills within the logistics workforce to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving industry. This research paper explores the emerging trends in logistics in India and highlights the significance of education in developing skilled professionals to drive the industry forward. This study outlines future growth potential in India's logistics sector. A mismatch between a skilled individual and the needs of the industry leads to inefficient corporate operations. To address this pressing issue, the government of India devised a solution known as Industry-Academia partnership, which involved taking a novel step in the Indian education system by introducing an apprenticeship undergraduate programme. Previously, education and employment were separated, but today it will be all around development of young generation students as well as the nation's economy.</jats:p>"

The model is specifically designed to meet the requirements related to modular shipments and PI-hubs, and in particular, determines the allocation of modular shipments to each transport mode in an intermodal setting. In doing so, parallel direct connection via road, the delivery times and the transportation costs are minimized. The model is applied to a numerical case study, to test its effectiveness to enhance freight transport efficiency within the PI framework, by exploiting, in particular, all the capacities of the available vehicles. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on some model parameters, to test its reaction to changes in the supply system and in the objective priorities. Results show that all the shipments are effectively transported between the origin and the destination terminals, they are divided into modules when necessary, and the selected transport modes, allocation strategy, and delivery times vary accordingly to the objective priorities.</jats:p>"

This is an important condition for the formation of partnerships between business and the state. Another important condition is that business cannot develop effectively without the help and assistance of the state. This is due to a number of reasons. The effectiveness of demand satisfaction is directly related to the rational use of economic resources and a flexible response to changes in the structure of demand. Efficient use of resources by each individual producer ultimately ensures the efficiency of the entire economic system. Business, performing its direct functions, ensuring the preservation and expanded reproduction of their property through the increase of private capital, simultaneously performs social functions related to the increase of social capital and the product capable of ensuring effective demand in the market of goods and services. The article substantiates the need to use the mechanism of public-private partnership as an effective tool for implementing the innovation policy of regions, and also identifies the possibilities of public-private partnership in projects for commercialization of intellectual property as a form of interaction between the state, research institutions and business.</jats:p>"

The results show that IT advancement and IT consistency have significant positive effects on new product performance; Joint problem solving and information sharing in supply chain collaboration play a partial mediating role in the relationship between IT advancement and new product performance. At the same time, IT also plays a part of mediating role in the relationship between IT consistency and new product performance. Relationship risk positively moderates the relationship between information sharing and new product performance. The research conclusions not only enrich the existing theories, but also have important reference significance for the digitization and information construction and innovation development in the context of enterprise supply chain collaboration.</jats:p>"

In order to reach the research goal, this study gives a thorough and comparative environmental analysis based on a real-world test conducted under the EnerNETMob project financed by the InterregMed programme, in contrast to other studies that primarily relied on general parameters and simulations. This study illustrated that using an electric vehicle (EV), like the Nissan e-NV200, for short-distance transportation of agri-food products is not an environmentally sustainable solution instead of using a petrol-powered vehicle. However, as the distance travelled increases, the environmental impact of electric vehicles diminishes, surpassing that of internal combustion vehicles. This study holds significant theoretical, practical and policy implications that are worth considering.</jats:p>"

Emissions from business production processes are central to low-carbon planning. This paper explores three closed-loop supply chain recycling models - manufacturer, retailer, and third-party -considering carbon trading and emission reduction technology investment. Respective Stackelberg game models are developed incorporating carbon emission reduction costs, recycling costs, carbon trading price, emission intensity, and recycling price. The influence of these variables on carbon emission reduction and profit is examined through numerical analysis. Results indicate the government’s free carbon quota does not impact per-unit carbon reduction or manufacturer profit, nor optimal recycling mode selection. Under specific remanufacturing emission intensity and production cost saving conditions, carbon quota trading can substantially incentivise manufacturers to invest in emission reduction and recycling. With carbon trading and emission reduction technology investment, manufacturer recycling optimises economic and environmental benefits when remanufactured products provide high production cost savings. This fosters sustainable development supporting low-carbon planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The principal link between technology and competitive advantage is innovation. The quest for sustainable competitive advantage has caused firms to invest in innovation, consequently, innovation is responsible for new industries coming into being, and it is innovation, which allows some firms to dominate in that space. Thus, this study aimed to examine the critical supply chain (SC) innovation indicators that enhance business performance. This research study centred on the operational activities of the Weir Minerals Africa (WMA) Isando facility in Johannesburg, South Africa, including all elements associated with the supply chain activities of the plant. The study sample of 230 respondents was considered representative of the population. The philosophical worldview in this research is positivism. Positivism hinges on computable observations that lead to statistical interpretations. The study was quantitative, adopted the deductive research approach, and a set of hypotheses were formulated for the research to confirm or reject a theory. For this population, the researcher applied a census-based sampling approach. The results showed that there is a significant number of indicators that enhance business performance and these include a clear culture of continuous improvement, focusing on new markets both locally and globally, product portfolio changes, constant connection and engagement with customers and cost structures. In light of these findings, the study provided a set of recommendations. Weir Minerals has a significant number of supply chain innovation hubs and metrics that include improvement and innovation culture across the entire organisation, an aggressive drive to create new markets and a clear posture to enforce standards and consistent value to its customers. However, it has not made a significant and noticeable effort to connect regularly with its customers. It has to improve on its customer relationship management frontier. The study findings underscored the relevance of a holistic overview of the supply chain problems at Weir Minerals Isando (WMI) that may inform the supply chain management decisions and expand academic knowledge.\n\nKeywords: Supply Chain Innovation, Supply Chain Management, Sustainable Business Performance</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growth of e-commerce and omnichannel retailing has led to significant changes in urban logistics deliveries. In addition to the traditional delivery channels, new solutions have been introduced, such as click-and-collect, parcel locker delivery, crowdshipping, and on-site delivery. However, such solutions require seamless connections between different layers of the city logistics system. These connections form, in the Physical Internet terminology, a “hyperconnected city”. In this context, how do consumers make decisions about logistics services, either as prospective users or as suppliers of last mile logistics services? We argue that a thorough understanding of consumers’ decision-making about last mile services is a prerequisite for the effective exploration of future demand for these services and the design of transport policies. While there is abundant literature on new approaches of last mile logistics, a review of research on consumers’ decision-making and participation in such services is absent. This paper aims to provide such a review and, based on this, provides directions for future research. Based on the existing literature, we propose a conceptual framework that categorises decisions and system attributes affecting consumers’ decision-making. Highlights for future research include interaction between consumers’ demand and supply decisions, changes in consumer preferences, the importance of social networks, and the city-level impacts of hyperconnected last mile delivery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Auto‐delivery is a subscription model widely employed in supply chains, whereby a supplier delivers products to a buyer (or multiple buyers) according to the buyer's choice of a constant shipping quantity to be delivered at prescheduled dates. The buyer enjoys a discount for the auto‐delivery orders and other benefits, including free subscription and cancellation. Because these benefits seem to all accrue to the buyer at the supplier's expense, the rationale for the supplier's decision to offer auto‐delivery and its impact on the profitability of both parties is an intriguing concern. We first develop a model that consists of a supplier and a single buyer, whereby the supplier offers a discount for the auto‐delivery orders and the buyer chooses the auto‐delivery quantity with the flexibility of cancelling the subscription. We derive the two parties' operating characteristics of their inventory systems and examine their optimal decisions. Our analysis shows that buyers benefit from the auto‐delivery discount; the supplier benefits from the demand‐expansion effect and the inventory‐reduction effect, a potential discount on the cost of the auto‐delivery units; and the supply chain benefits from reducing the bullwhip effect. We also find that channel coordination requires the supplier to pass the inventory‐related savings to the buyer through the auto‐delivery discount, which depends on the ratio of the two parties' holding cost rates. Moreover, we examine a model extension whereby the supplier announces a discount that is available for multiple buyers, we show that the supplier's optimal auto‐delivery discount under exponential demand can be determined based on the aggregate‐level demand information from all buyers. Finally, we discuss another model extension whereby the lead time of the supplier's recurring orders for auto‐delivery is longer than that of the regular orders and present a full analysis of the case when the lead time differential is one time period. </jats:p>",

This is important for low‐ and middle‐income country (LMIC) markets where ability to pay is lower and demand risks are greater. Development finance institutions and philanthropies are beginning to utilize new instruments to incentivize manufacturers to build production/distribution capacity for LMIC markets. The goal of this paper is to understand the effectiveness of such mechanisms in different settings. We examine four instruments: (1) subsidy proportional to unit sales (sales subsidy), (2) subsidy proportional to unit capacity (variable‐capacity subsidy), (3) subsidy proportional to total capacity investment (total‐capacity subsidy), and (4) a minimum volume guarantee. We analyze incentivized capacity as a function of the social‐investor budget for each instrument. We show how our framework can be used to identify a social investor's preferred instrument given relevant parameter estimates, and we provide insight into the type of settings where a particular instrument dominates. A sales subsidy dominates when ability to pay is very low; a total‐capacity subsidy dominates when ability to pay is low. Outside of these settings, instrument preference is nuanced, though a sales subsidy is dominated by at least one other instrument. When ability to pay is moderate, a variable‐capacity subsidy tends to be preferred under high variable‐capacity cost and high budget, a volume guarantee tends to be preferred under low variable‐capacity cost and high budget, and a total‐capacity subsidy tends to be preferred under low budget. </jats:p>",

It offers the advantages of reducing shipping time, lowering transportation costs, expanding trade opportunities, and diversifying supply chain routes. This article collected data from websites such as the Clarksons and the Shanghai Shipping Exchange to investigate the current number of voyages along the Arctic route and various factors that impact the cost of navigation. By comparing the navigation costs between the Arctic route and the traditional Suez Canal route, it was found that the Arctic region has higher voyage transportation costs compared to the Suez route, indicating that the Suez route still holds an economic advantage. However, choosing the Arctic route can shorten the delivery lead time and reduce certain supply chain costs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It has been established that the needs of mankind in fuel are growing every day. The full energy balance of the countries of the European Union is analyzed and the place and share of alternative energy sources are determined. It is determined that trends in the development of society require the adoption of new, non-traditional solutions that can quickly increase the efficiency of using alternative energy sources, solve the problem of insufficient energy capacity, reduce the harmful impact on the environment and carry out modernization in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost. The main reasons for this are the expected depletion of fossil fuel reserves, the rapid rise in prices for it, incomplete use and low efficiency, as well as the harmful impact on the environment. The problems of the energy sector of economy are determined. The use of alternative energy sources by EU countries is evaluated, which saves billions of euros on gas purchases. It is proved that despite the rapid changes in demand and oil prices, the tendency to increase the consumption of fuel and energy resources will continue, although the distribution of consumption by industries and countries may change somewhat. A review of theoretical approaches to defining the essence of the concept of «alternative energy» is made and the author's definition of this economic category is provided. Each type of alternative energy sources is characterized, their advantages and disadvantages, which positively or negatively affect the energy sector of the economy and the economy as a whole, are outlined. The problematic issues of using alternative energy sources in modern conditions of management are outlined. It is noted that in recent years, the cost of building small hydropower plants has been significantly simplified by simplifying their design and operation, standardizing design solutions, unifying equipment and full automation of HPP operation, as well as through the use of new materials and finished products. It is proposed to use new unconventional energy technologies that we have explored and can lead the world towards a sustainable energy supply.</jats:p>",

To check the impact of the proposed method of feeding newborns, the life indicators of 59 full-term children, who were randomly divided into two groups, were studied. The first group (n = 30) received standard nutrition with mother’s milk or formula, the second group (n = 29) received a food product fortified with a protein supplement and a subsidy of L-carnitine during hospital stay.\nResults. Infants of both groups had statistically equivalent anthropometric characteristics at the beginning of the study. The proportions of infants of both sexes were within the 50 % percentile. Starting from the third week, caloric intake for the standard diet group (SG) and the enrichment group (FG), respectively, was 111.83 ± 7.19 kcal/kg/day, against 113.44 ± 5.61 kcal/kg/day, p = 0.0667. Per 1 g of protein, children in the FG group had amount of non-protein calories as 28.68 (27.50; 29.80) kcal/kg/day, compared to the indicator in the SG group of 42.37 (41.60; 38.00) kcal/kg/day, with U = 28.0000; p = 0.0001. Carnitine supplementation in the FG group led to an increase in the level of free carnitine in the last blood plasma samples, before the children were discharged home.\nIn general, the proposed nutrition strategy was accompanied by better indicators of the physical development of children, and a statistically probable faster recovery of body weight in the fortification group. Thus, the generalized indicator of body weight of children of the SG group was 3966.90 ± 439.08 g, compared to the FG group of 3554.62 ± 452.28 g, with p = 0.0033. In general, children who consumed more protein were transferred from the intensive care unit earlier – 12.00 (11.00; 16.00) days, against 10.00 (8.00; 12.00) days, with U = 235,00; p = 0.0024; previously discharged from the hospital – 26.50 (22.00; 31.00) days, against 21.00 (19.00; 27.00) days, with U = 267.00, p = 0.0109.\nThis strategy proved to be safe, as confirmed by normal levels of phenylalanine and urea at all stages of the examination of children.\nConclusions. Short-term increased protein consumption against the background of carnitine supplementation improves the results of physical development of newborns and indicators of hospitalization and intensive care unit stay. Larger studies and catamnestic observation of children are needed.</jats:p>"

The method used for analysis is a hierarchical regression with the use of SPSS AMOS 24 and slope analysis. SPSS 23 was used to test the assumptions for parametric analysis. Survey data was collected from a sample of 54 owners and managers of SMEs in the Fako Division of Cameroon. Findings revealed significant positive relationships between electricity supply reliability and SME sustainability and an insignificant positive relationship between weather conditions and SME sustainability. Furthermore, the results indicated that weather conditions moderate the relationship between electricity supply reliability and SME Sustainability in the Fako Division of Cameroon. The study found that the electricity utility company of Cameroon has the daunting task of ensuring a robust electricity supply network capable of withstanding harsh weather conditions to ensure regular electricity. The implications of the findings of the study are that prevailing weather has an influence on the reliability of electricity supply, which affects the operations of businesses. Furthermore, when the business operations of SMEs are affected, the economy of the country suffers significantly. The study recommends the involvement of the government and policymakers to institute measures to ensure the obligation of the electricity utility company to maintain minimal interruptions of electricity supply. This study’s contribution to the body of knowledge is embedded in developing a theoretical model that explains electricity supply reliability in Cameroon from a weather perspective.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Plants absorb nutrients and water through their roots, and modulate soil biogeochemical cycles. The mechanisms of water and nutrient uptake by plants depend on climatic and edaphic conditions, as well as the plant root system. Soil solution is the medium in which abiotic and biotic processes exchange nutrients, and nutrient concentrations vary with the abundance of reactive minerals and fluid residence times. High-altitude ecosystems of the tropical Andes are particularly interesting to study the association between vegetation patterns, soil hydrology and soil nutrient availability. The páramo landscape forms a vegetation mosaic of bunch-grasses, cushion-forming plants and forests. In the nutrient-depleted nonallophanic Andosols, the plant rooting depth varies with drainage and soil moisture conditions. Vegetation composition is a relevant indicator of rock-derived nutrient availability in soil solutions. The soil solute chemistry revealed patterns in plant available nutrients that were not mimicking the distribution of total rock-derived nutrients nor the exchangeable nutrient pool, but clearly resulted from strong biocycling of cations and removal of nutrients from the soil by plant uptake or deep leaching. Our findings have important implications for future management of Andean páramo ecosystems where vegetation type distributions are dynamically changing as a result of warming temperatures and anthropogenic disturbances. Such alterations may not only lead to changes in soil hydrology and solute geochemistry but also to complex changes in weathering rates and solute export downstream with effects on nutrient availability in Andean rivers and high-mountain lakes.\n                        </jats:p>"

The importance of container transport cannot be overemphasized in international trade especially in Nigeria. Hence, it becomes expedients to assess the elements of container terminal capacity, analyse the trend of cargo throughput and as well determine the relationship between handling equipment and cargo dwell time in Western ports in Nigeria. The study adopts multistage sampling. Also, both primary and secondary data were collected from the staff of the container terminal operators in Tincan Island Port Complex and Apapa Port Complex and 347 respondents were chosen using Yamene formular. Furthermore, Descriptive statistics such as frequency table, line graph, bar charts were used to examine the elements of container terminal capacity, analyse the trend of cargo throughput. The inferential statistics such as regression analysis was used examines the relationship between thandling equipment and cargo dwell time. The result showed a decline in cargo throughput from 2019 to 2020, a trend that can be directly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, it was shown that the coefficient of handling equipment is 0.725, indicating that for every unit increase in the handling equipment score, the cargo dwell time increases by 0.725 units. The t-value of 21.558 and a significance level of 0.000 signify that the handling equipment is a significant predictor of cargo dwell time. Based on the findings of the study, it was concluded that terminal space, handling equipment, daily stock and port labour were significant factors or elements of container terminal capacity. It was recommended that Nigerian Ports Authority should invest more on sustainable infrastructure and terminal operators and stevedoring company should train and retrain their staff on modern handling equipment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Containerization plays a crucial role in international trade. It promotes the oceanic business, generally pertinent to container terminals. Despite the various benefits of the container terminal to maritime trade and the economic development of nations with seaports, Nigerian ports are suffering from a progressive decline compared to other thriving ports in other parts of the globe. Hence, this study evaluates the technical efficiency of container terminal operations in southwestern seaport in Nigeria. Survey research design was adopted for this study in which Multi-stage sampling technique was used. Both primary and secondary data were collected from the annual report and questionnaire respectively from staff of the container terminal operators in Tincan Island Port Complex and Apapa Port Complex. The result from the findings showed that four factors influenced container terminal capacity and port performance. These include port charges, stevedoring operations, unserviceable cranes and ship calls. Also, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) findings showed that AP Moller Terminal, PCHS, and PTML have a crste, vrste, and scale efficiency of 1, indicating they are fully technically efficient under both constant and variable returns to scale. It was concluded that AP Moller Terminal, PCHS and PTML are the most efficient terminal in South-Western Ports in Nigeria. It was recommended that periodic training and retraining of staff handling modern equipment should be prioritized and also, increase in port charges by the terminal operators should be addressed to encourage freight forwarders to clear their cargo on time at the port.</jats:p>",

Distributed photovoltaic has the characteristics of high construction cost and long cost recovery cycle, which are unfavorable factors restricting large-scale promotion. and has been relying on national financial subsidies for a long time in the early stage of development. Under the incentive of high subsidies, the scale of China􀆳s distributed photovoltaic industry has expanded rapidly and maintained a high-speed development trend for many years. However, the large-scale development is accompanied by a surge in government subsidy funds. The high subsidy funds are difficult to be sustained, and the distributed photovoltaic industry is facing the overall trend of subsidy decline. This paper takes Shunyi District of Beijing, the first batch of pilot areas for rooftop distributed photovoltaic development in the whole county (city, district) in China, as an example. Through questionnaire survey, field interview and model analysis, this paper reveals the difficulties faced by household photovoltaic development in this area, identifies the main constraints and problems of photovoltaic development in this area, and quantitatively analyzes the influence degree of various factors. On this basis, based on the theoretical perspective of ‘cooperative governance’, this paper attempts to construct a G-P-M-S incentive system for household distributed photovoltaic development, which covers the government, public, market and society, and condenses the policy orientation of coordinating ‘cross-level’, ‘ cross-department’, ‘cross-subject’ and ‘policy tool integration’, and puts forward specific policy suggestions in light of the actual situation of Shunyi District, so as to provide support for Shunyi District to promote the development of photovoltaic industry and realize green and low-carbon transformation.</jats:p>",

Active research in this area is being conducted in China, Japan, and the USA. Currently, in China and Japan, speeds of 450-500 km/h have been achieved for commercial transportation, and promising programs have been adopted for the construction of high-speed maglev tracks and the creation of rolling stock. At such speeds, one of the pressing problems is the problem of contactless energy transfer for on-board consumers located on the carriage, because it is very difficult to ensure reliable contact current collection at speeds of 450-500 km/h and above. Aim: development of the design, calculation and analysis of the characteristics of a linear generator of electrical energy for contactless power transfer to the moving crew of high-speed magnetically levitated transport. Materials and methods: to calculate the external magnetic field of the linear generator inductor and the EMF induced in the receiving coil of the crew, methods of electromagnetic field theory and electrical circuit theory were used; calculation algorithms are implemented in the Visual Basic for Applications software environment. Results: a design was proposed and the calculation of the external magnetic field of an inductor with transposition of conductors was performed; to increase the EMF induced in the receiving coil of the crew, it is proposed to give the receiving coil a double 8-shape; the most rational inter-circuit distance of the linear generator inductor has been established; the nature of the change in the magnetic flux penetrating the receiving coil when the vehicle moves, and the magnitude of the emf induced in the receiving coil are determined. Conclusion: the results can be used in the development of rolling stock for promising high-speed maglev transport systems.</jats:p>"

These risks include supply disruptions, supply delays, demand fluctuations, price fluctuations, and exchange rate fluctuations. Risks that arise and cannot be mitigated properly in the supply chain can disrupt the company's business processes in various sectors. Companies in the construction sector when working on construction projects face many risks during the project cycle, especially risks in the supply chain process. Partial risk management, namely only on construction projects and not specifically on the supply chain process, causes potential risks in the supply chain process not to be identified in detail, and mitigation strategies cannot be determined effectively for risks in the supply chain. This research was conducted to identify risks and determine appropriate mitigation strategies using the house of risk as a framework and a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process weighting method to select the best mitigation strategy. The research results showed that there were 26 risk events and 21 risk agents identified, and the 5 best mitigation strategies were chosen from the 10 formulated strategies for a mitigation monitoring system. Based on research results, the best risk mitigation strategy can be used as a reference for risk mitigation actions in the company's supply chain as outlined in the form of a dashboard monitoring system.</jats:p>"

The results highlight sharp contrast in the size of supply and demand conditions over time and across sectors. While the Great Recession was characterized by weak demand, COVID‐19 caused sizable disruptions to both demand and supply, with varying relative importance across major sectors.

The country’s primary energy supply includes 29 million tons of natural gas, which accounts for 30.2 % of the country's total energy balance. Part of the biomass, combustion and output increased from 2.3 % to 11.5 %. On the other hand, the majority of gas distribution systems were put into operation thirty to fifty years ago and met the regulatory requirements in force at the time. Now, gas flows and loads in these networks have changed, and the standard service life has expired. The state of gas networks has been significantly affected by military operations. The requirements of regulatory documents in the field of gas supply have been significantly expanded in order to harmonise with the current European legislation. Calculations were introduced based on the volume of natural gas in energy units, which is determined by the higher calorific value. There are some conflicts in the national normative base, which causes the problems for gas supply design. It is proposed to use the higher heating value of gas when determining the diameter of gas networks. The use of the higher calorific value of 38.3 MJ/m3 in the hydraulic calculation of gas pipelines will allow for a more rational selection of diameters in the sections. The use of gas consumption in energy units will reduce the actual diameters of gas pipelines, their material consumption, and thus the overall cost of the system. The influence of the gas component composition on its physical and chemical properties and, as a result, on the system capacity is considered. In addition, as a result of the implementation of thermal modernisation measures in buildings, the amount of gas consumed is reduced and there is a need to optimise the values of the coefficients of simultaneous operation of gas. For today, old values are used, which are defined in 1987, when the norms of gas supply and living conditions were different. Thus, the coefficients should be adapted to the modern life and norms</jats:p>"

To aid in this process, the suggested technique utilizes multiple regression analysis and adaptive extreme learning machine models to determine the relative importance of each indicator in the supply chain logistics decision-making process. Firms may be able to save expenses and boost economic value by employing enhanced genetic algorithms and mathematical modeling to develop a logistics distribution model for urban supply chains based on reconstructive genetic algorithms. It is possible that the paper's study of the issues plaguing the current distribution of logistics in metropolitan areas would prove valuable to organizations that are seeking to improve their own supply chain logistics procedures. This paper appears to take a thorough strategy that might assist assure the accuracy of the forecasting method by preprocessing macroeconomic indicators using imputation, classification, and other approaches to generate a time series consistency model. Some novel ways that may shed light on logistics in the supply chain include using a two-dimensional discrete mesh structure built on wireless sensors to depict the national economic development scenario and using a coding matrix to convey the extent of economic growth. A thorough and all-encompassing way that might aid organizations in making better judgments about their supply chain logistics strategies is to employ multiple regression analysis, an adaptive extreme learning machine model, and other approaches to examine the effect degree of each key indicator. Experiments demonstrating excellent and steady prediction accuracy of the algorithm model are encouraging and point to the possible usefulness of the suggested forecasting approach. The paper's contributions, including its analysis of supply chain logistics cost accounting, determination of the basic path optimization, improvement of the genetic algorithm, and design of the mathematical model of supply chain logistics distribution path decision, all look promising in terms of their potential to help businesses cut costs and boost economic value.

As it is predicted that climate change will increase water stress worldwide, an increasing number of countries are using desalination plants to generate fresh water. In most such cases, residual concentrates must be disposed of, and the disposal cost is increasing as countries are becoming more environmentally conscious. Selective salt recovery can help to alleviate this issue as it reduces the need for concentrate disposal and generates additional revenue. To gain some insights into the costs and benefits of coproduction plants, we have collected data on current desalination practices and salt imports in the United States along with the manufacturing costs and energy requirements for coproduction plants. We have used this data to build an optimization model to determine an optimal number and location of coproduction plants in the United States and their potential markets for the sale of coproduced salt. In our analysis, we consider a different total number of coproduction facilities, and for each configuration, we evaluate the resulting net water cost and carbon emissions impact. Our results indicate that there exists the potential for building several coproduction plants in the United States that would be both financially competitive with existing desalination plants and lead to a reduction in carbon emissions. This information might be of use to both governments and businesses when they make decisions about the type of desalination facilities built and the implemented “polluter pays” policies. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was This paper was accepted by Beril Toktay, Special Section of Management Science on Business and Climate Change. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: Data are available at https://doi.org/10.1278/mnsc.2021.4109 . </jats:p>",

Based on this, considering the participation of new energy sources, the influence of load participation demand response on the distribution system is analyzed, the load demand response model is established, and the corresponding unit capacity compensation cost model is proposed. Considering the recovery income, operation cost, demand response compensation cost, and risk, a bi-level optimization model is established to solve the maximum recovery net income of the system. The upper layer aims at maximizing the expected net recovery income of the entire distribution system and proposes a distribution system partition scheme that takes into account the participation of new energy sources and mobile sources. The lower layer aims at maximizing the net recovery income of each partition and solves the recovery time and recovery amount of the load in each partition or the response time and response amount of the load participating in demand response under the condition of limited resources. Finally, the effectiveness of the power supply recovery optimization strategy of the distribution system proposed in this paper is verified by an example.</jats:p>",

However, it is necessary to consider the relationship of this supply chain with the environment in order to reduce/mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) supports improving the relationship between production systems and the environment, increasing process efficiency, and reducing costs. The main objective of this research was to identify the extent to which the sugarcane supply chain impacts environmental and human health aspects as well as the use of resources through LCA. This analysis focused on a supply chain in Brazil’s Midwest region, considering the stages of cultivation, transportation, and production. The results indicated that using fertilizers and pesticides and burning crops during harvest severely threaten the sustainability of this supply chain. Also, using crude oil, natural gas, coal, and other chemical products in ethanol production is a critical threat to the sustainability of the sugarcane supply chain. The obtained results cooperate with the decarbonization goals assumed by Brazil at the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2015 (COP 21). A multidimensional approach is necessary to assess the sugarcane production chain results, and the LCA method is appropriate for performing this analysis.</jats:p>"

Ensuring an uninterrupted and stable electricity supply to all these forms is an extremely important problem for Ukraine as the country faced a large number of challenges regarding energy independence due to numerous missile strikes. The purpose of the study was to analyze the energy system and the level of damage to Ukraine after the Russian missile attacks, the impact on the state of energy supply of individual facilities and consumers of military camps, examine the possibilities of using emergency and backup energy sources and alternative energy, in particular, solar and wind. The study analyses the destruction of the energy system of Ukraine as a result of missile attacks and the possibilities of using emergency and backup energy sources and alternative energy, in particular, solar and wind, and the investigation of the potential and opportunities to attract investment in the field of alternative energy. Special attention is paid to small business facilities, including military camps. In the course of the study, it was determined that Ukraine has a geographical location that provides space for the installation of various alternative energy systems and the possibility of combining them to diversify and improve the stability and reliability of the Ukrainian energy system. The practical importance of the study lies in the ability to make more informed decisions regarding the implementation of programs aimed at switching to alternative and decentralized energy sources. This will make the country’s energy infrastructure more stable and allow better meeting the energy needs of small forms of management, individual farms, military units, formations, and infrastructure facilities.</jats:p>"

In order to verify the feasibility of the model, the data of CM company from 2015 to 2022 are selected for simulation experiments. The calculated benefit evaluation score is consistent with the actual situation of the company's operation. Therefore, the model can effectively evaluate the benefits of applying digital enterprise resource planning system in supply chain management and provide strong support for enterprise management to plan ERP implementation and follow-up maintenance decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The primary aim of this study was to assess the suitability of blockchain technology for improving the efficiency of supply chain operations in the public sector in Tanzania. Blockchain technology (BT) is a contemporary and rapidly growing technology that has gained widespread popularity globally due to its capacity to connect several stakeholders (blocks) worldwide with the aim of enhancing efficiency in business transactions. With this perspective in mind, the researcher was driven to evaluate the capabilities of blockchain technology in the field of supply chain in Tanzania. This evaluation concentrated on three distinct areas: the degree of public awareness of blockchain technology, the strategies used by public bodies to use blockchain technology, and the significant issues that obstruct the implementation of blockchain technology. The study utilized network theory as a framework to analyze the findings. It employed a descriptive survey approach, with a sample size of 192 respondents who were engaged as registered procurement experts in public institutions. In collecting data from respondents, structured questionnaires were prepared using Google Forms and submitted to respondents through their e-mails. A total of 154 questionnaires were properly filled out and submitted, for a response rate of 80.2%. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. The results show that 74.7% of the respondents are unaware of the application of blockchain technology in supply chain operations. In terms of practice, the majority of public entities (67%) use e-payment as the main application of blockchain technology. Additionally, 64% of the respondents identified technical issues and a lack of understanding as the main challenges affecting the application of blockchain technology. Moreover, the study demonstrates a robust correlation between the utilization of blockchain technology and the enhancement of efficiency in supply chain operations. Ultimately, the study suggests implementing an extensive awareness campaign targeted at practitioners in order to enhance the rate of adoption and fully use the capabilities of blockchain technology in Tanzania.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, the existing literature suggests that the PDDWS suffers from inherent structural technological deficiencies, and various internal and external factors hinder its reliability, which raise concerns about the scientific and rational basis of the PDDWS. To address these issues, a new-type terminal differentiated water system (TDWS) is proposed to establish an efficient and health-oriented household water supply system. A water purifier is directly installed at the user’s terminal, and, due to its diversion process, differentiated water is provided, including direct drinking water, clean water and flushing water. Direct drinking water can be produced on demand, without secondary contamination. Clean water is also not stored, thus preventing microbial growth and ensuring superior water quality compared to tap water, suitable for kitchen usage. Flushing water is mixed with tap water for laundry, bathing and toilet flushing. Engineering verification has demonstrated that the quality of the direct drinking water and the clean water exceeds national standards. With the diversion process, the TDWS exhibits benefits related to health, the economy, applicability and environmental friendliness, and it can serve as a supplement and innovation for the PDDWS.</jats:p>"

Currently, there is a positive trend in the field of air transportation, and the role of aviation on a global scale cannot be overestimated. Today our state is in a state of war, but we can claim that Ukraine has significant potential for the development of the aviation market. Before the war, the passenger air transportation market had the highest growth rates among all modes of transport in Ukraine. Such prospects are due, first of all, to significant unmet demand for air transportation, as well as a favorable geographical location for the development of transit transportation. At the same time, the development of instruments for regulating the industry at the national level is of particular importance. This article is devoted to finding ways to improve the legislative and regulatory framework of air transport.</jats:p>"

The research aimed to examine the impact of blockchain capabilities on supply chain resilience and company performance using quantitative and cross-sectional survey methods. Logistics service providers (LSP) were selected as the units of analysis, and individuals such as logisticians in Indonesia and Switzerland served as units of observation. Data were collected through an electronic questionnaire (Google Forms) using a quota sampling technique and analyzed using Smart-PLS software. The sample size included 60 respondents, comprising 45 and 15 from Indonesia and Switzerland based on the 10-times rule. The results show that supply chain resilience partially and fully mediated the impact of blockchain capabilities (supply chain alignment and agility) on LSPPerformance. LSP could also enhance performance and resilience by implementing blockchain technology to enhance supply chain alignment and agility. In theoretical terms, the results have implications contributing to dynamic capability theory. In practical applications, the research serves as valuable insights for government authorities and IT consultants when formulating effective plans and strategies to analyze the adoption of blockchain technology among LSP. Additionally, directors and owners of these companies are persuaded that blockchain has the potential to create and enhance supply chain capabilities, as well as increasing competitive advantage. </jats:p>"

Nowadays, consumers place a higher emphasis on product quality and origin. The challenge is to ensure effective supervision of the entire food production process, from farm to consumers' tables, and to address traceability and accountability issues when food safety problems arise. The emergence of blockchain technology offers a promising solution. Blockchain's decentralization and traceability capabilities can effectively monitor food status information. However, given the cost of implementing blockchain technology and the varying degrees of sensitivity consumers have to product quality and price, the question arises: should supply chains have strong incentives to adopt blockchain technology? This paper focuses on the fresh agricultural product supply chain, encompassing both online and offline retailers, and employs the Stackberg game model to examine the impact of blockchain technology adoption under a government subsidy scenario. The research findings of this article indicate that the decision to introduce blockchain technology by online suppliers is influenced by the cost associated with each unit of fresh products. Furthermore, government subsidies prove advantageous primarily for online retailers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force in agriculture, offering significant potential to enhance supply chain transparency and traceability. This paper explores the application of blockchain in agricultural supply chains, emphasizing its role in addressing key challenges such as fraud, inefficiency, and lack of trust among stakeholders. By providing a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain ensures that every transaction within the agricultural supply chain is securely recorded, from farm to fork. This transparency helps combat issues like food fraud by verifying the authenticity and origin of products, thereby increasing consumer confidence and safeguarding brand reputation. Furthermore, blockchain enhances traceability, allowing for real-time tracking of agricultural products throughout the supply chain. This capability is particularly valuable in ensuring food safety, as it enables rapid identification and response to contamination incidents, thus reducing the scope of foodborne illness outbreaks. The technology also facilitates more efficient supply chain management by streamlining processes, reducing the need for intermediaries, and minimizing paperwork, leading to cost savings and faster transaction times. Despite its potential, the adoption of blockchain in agriculture faces challenges, including the need for technological infrastructure, the cost of implementation, and the necessity of widespread stakeholder collaboration. Additionally, the integration of blockchain with other technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence, is critical to maximizing its benefits and ensuring seamless data flow within the supply chain. In conclusion, blockchain technology holds the promise of revolutionizing agricultural supply chains by enhancing transparency, traceability, and efficiency. As the industry continues to evolve, the adoption of blockchain could lead to more sustainable and trustworthy food systems, benefiting producers, consumers, and the environment. However, overcoming implementation barriers and fostering collaboration across the supply chain are essential for realizing the full potential of blockchain in agriculture.\r\nKeywords:  Blockchain Technology, Agriculture, supply Chain, Transparency, Traceability.</jats:p>"

Iran has many tourist attractions. It is difficult to supply energy to welfare places in some of these areas due to the long distance from the city or the vulnerable environment, so their energy supply system is designed independently of the grid. Using a diesel generator to supply electricity can be considered the first solution for a hotel’s off-grid system, but this scenario has high costs and causes pollution. The second way is to use renewable energies such as wind and solar, but these energies are not stable due to weather conditions. One suggestion to overcome the periodicity of renewable energy sources such as the sun and wind is to develop a hybrid energy system in which excess electrical energy can be converted and stored. These resources, together with energy storage, can provide a system with better reliability that is suitable for off-grid applications. In the third case, the diesel generator can be combined with renewable energy. In this article, the electricity supply is for a small hotel with an area of 3995 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; located in the Varzaneh desert of Isfahan province. The average electrical load required is 1530 kWh/day, and the peak load is 118.76 kW. The simulation of the system has been done with HOMER software, and the results have been categorized based on the three scenarios mentioned as well as the total net present cost of the system. With the obtained results, it is clear that the most optimal system is one with a combined supplier of a diesel generator, a photovoltaic panel, a wind turbine, and battery storage. The NPC value of this system is $1,995,016; the renewable rate is 87.1%; and its emissions are 84% lower than in the case where only the diesel generator supplier has them.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Así, los proveedores, generalmente pequeñas y medianas empresas, son meros seguidores de reglas, lo cual podría hacerlos vulnerables. Aquí se postula que es posible superar esto mediante actividades de base, es decir, la negociación de cláusulas contractuales sostenibles que incluyan la participación de pequeñas y medianas empresas, y compromisos por parte de la empresa matriz en el desarrollo de capacidades para ellas. Esto implica una reorientación del contrato, para colocar en el centro a las pequeñas y medianas empresas y hacerlas conscientes de su poder y corresponsables en la difusión de la sostenibilidad. Los compradores deberían ser receptivos a este cambio, ya que permitiría la producción de acuerdo a sus valores, abriéndoles posibilidades en nuevos mercados y, además, les permitiría cumplir con la ley, cada día más estricta en materia de sostenibilidad. Este razonamiento se complementa en el artículo con el examen de un caso real y la consideración de la anatomía de una cláusula contractual sostenible, conforme a las ideas ofrecidas.</jats:p>"

The legal aid system in Chinese colleges and universities has limitations in its functioning due to its positioning, and the legal clinic course is not suitable for the existing curriculum system. Under the framework of legal practice education, the legal aid system in colleges and universities and legal clinic education are homologous and isomorphic, which makes it possible for the two to be closely integrated in the knowledge supply level of legal practice education. How the university legal aid system and legal clinic education should promote each other requires, on the one hand, the expansion of the scope of university legal aid and, on the other hand, the development of diversified funding channels.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>AbstractAreca nut is a commodity that has high economic value. The areca nut produced by Jambi Province in 2020 is 320,260 tons per year. West Tanjung Jabung Regency produces ± 12,266 tons of areca nut per year. There are obstacles in the distribution of dried betel nuts to the factories, namely in terms of inadequate transportation facilities such as roads from the plantations to the factories which are damaged and some of the land has to pass through the river. Delivery is made to factories that have collaborated with farmer groups, so farmer groups must fulfill requests in accordance with factory requests. Due to the varying number of requests from factories and varying amounts of inventory, farmer groups must choose the optimal delivery route for the transportation costs that will be incurred. The transportation method is a method for solving distribution problems optimally so that the distribution costs incurred can be minimized. This research will use a transportation method, namely the Vogel Approximation Method (VAM) to optimize the cost of shipping areca nut to the factory. Furthermore, it is optimized again using the Stepping Stone method. Transportation costs for sending betel nut from the location of the farmer group to the factory have been optimal at a cost of IDR 4,558,000 per month, with the shipping route from Teluk Perupuk Hamlet sending 8 tons of areca nut to PT Bintang Selatan. Kayu Aro Village sent 7 tonnesof areca nuts to PT Ruby Privatindo. Sungai Rambai Village sent 2 tons to PT Ruby Privatindo, 1 ton to PT Bintang Selatan, and 2 tons of areca nut to PT Asnap Group.AbstrakBuah pinang merupakan salah satu komoditi yang memiliki nilai ekonomi yang tinggi. Buah pinang yang dihasilkan daerah Provinsi Jambi di tahun 2020 sebanyak 320.260 ton pertahun. Kabupaten Tanjung Jabung Barat menghasilkan buah pinang ± 12.266 ton per tahunnya. Ada kendala dalam pendistribusian buah pinang kering ke pabrik, yaitu dari segi fasilitas transportasi yang belum memadai seperti jalan dari kebun menuju pabrik yang rusak dan sebagian lahan harus melewati sungai. Pengiriman dilakukan ke pabrik-pabrik yang telah kerjasama dengan kelompok tani, sehingga kelompok tani harus memenuhi permintaan sesuai dengan permintaan pabrik. Dengan adanya jumlah permintaan yang beragam dari pabrik dan jumlah persediaan yang beragam pula menyebabkan kelompok tani harus memilih rute pengiriman yang optimal terhadap biaya transportasi yang akan dikeluarkan. Metode transportasi adalah suatu metode untuk memecahkan masalah pendistribusian secara optimal sehingga biaya distribusi yang dikeluarkan dapat diminimalkan. Dalam penelitian ini akan menggunakan metode transportasi yaitu Vogel Approximation Method (VAM) untuk mengoptimalkan biaya pengiriman buah pinang ke pabrik. Selanjutnya di optimalkan lagi dengan menggunakan metode Stepping Stone. Biaya transportasi pengiriman buah pinang dari lokasi kelompok tani menuju ke pabrik telah optimal dengan biaya sebesar Rp 4.558.000 per bulan, dengan rute pengiriman dari Dusun teluk perupuk mengirim ke PT bintang selatan sebanyak 8 Ton pinang. Desa Kayu Aro mengirim ke PT Ruby Privatindo sebanyak 7 Ton pinang. Desa sungai rambai mengirim ke PT Ruby Privatindo sebanyak 2 Ton,mengirim ke PT Bintang Selatan sebanyak 1 Ton, dan mengirim ke PT Asnap Group sebanyak 2 Ton pinang</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: Utilizing blockchain technology helps to address issues that the supply chain faces, including the intricate connections between chain network members, regulation of the distribution network, and inventory management.&#x0D;\nObjective: To adopt blockchain technology in the drug supply chain, this study aims to offer a multi-stage optimization strategy based on Swara and QFD approaches and a zero-one nonlinear optimization problem employing a fuzzy approach.&#x0D;\nMethods: First, field and library research was conducted to identify the barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology in the drug supply chain and the ways to overcome these barriers. The relevance of the barriers is ascertained using the fuzzy Swara approach following their refinement employing the Friedman test. The output is entered as an input in the house of quality (HOQ) rows, while the barrier-reducing techniques are presented in the columns. These approaches to reducing barriers are arranged in rows in the second phase of the house of quality.&#x0D;\nResults: Among the criteria of the barrier-reduction approach, the Performance Expectancy criterion with a score of 0.0521 has the greatest score, and the criterion of Focusing on the Major Points has the minimum score, as determined by the findings of the fuzzy Swara model. The criterion of Enhancing Transparency with a score of 0.5374 and Reducing Risk with a score of 0.4045 have the maximum, and Sustainability Performance with a score of 0.07 has the minimum score, according to the findings concerning the objectives of blockchain technology adoption in the drug supply chain. The criterion of lack of customers' awareness and attitude about sustainability and blockchain technology has the greatest score among the barriers to adoption, scoring 0.521, and the criterion of difficulty in altering organizational culture, scoring 0.033, has the minimum value.&#x0D;\nConclusion: Based on the results of the fuzzy house of quality, we concluded that, for the adoption of blockchain technology in the drug supply chain, the eighth (long-term perspective), first (performance expectation), and tenth (focused on the primary strengths) strategies are more beneficial. In addition, it was demonstrated that the second (Effort Expectation), ninth (information sharing), and sixth (Trust) strategies have poor rankings.</jats:p>"

The authors designed Sela's first photogrammetric model from aerial photographs provided by the \"Aerial Photographic Archive for Archaeology in the Middle East (APAAME)\" project. This modelling has enabled the research team to locate new hydraulic structures, settlement remains, marks on vertical facing, and elevated or levelling platforms hitherto unidentified by a pedestrian survey; it was also possible to obtain more detailed direct and indirect relationships between these features. The 3D model has provided a reference for locating the various elements and correlating their surface with the topographic coordinates recorded by the total station during fieldwork. Additionally, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was derived from the 3D model to depict the flow direction of run-off. Through our analysis, we identified spaces for accessing, managing, and utilising available water resources, including settlement density and flooding zones. The hydrological analysis revealed potential run-off and flood-prone areas, guiding the location of hydraulic structures to prevent water contamination. This study highlights the importance of Sela's water supply systems and the technical expertise of ancient communities in their construction and management. The applicability and feasibility of the applied methodology emphasise its use as a powerful and indispensable tool to obtain a complete overview of the site. The results yield a comprehensive site mapping with a broader scope than previous research and provide a basis for further research, as well as for understanding the site's water supply and settlement patterns. Thus, this study enhances the hydro-technological investigation of Sela's water management and culture and contributes to its holistic analysis. Future studies can use the data to propose effective water management strategies and shed light on the social structures involved in water supply practices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The widespread consumption of milk for its nutritional value and health benefits brings the risk of milk-borne diseases due to the presence of various microorganisms, including antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This has led to an increased focus on ensuring the safety of milk products across the supply chain by dairy industries. The study aimed to evaluate microbiological parameters and detect multi-antibiotic-resistant pathogens at three specific supply points and to explore the association between the presence of residual antibiotics and the resistant isolates in milk samples. About 50 milk samples, including raw, soon-after-processed, packaged marketed pasteurized, and UHT milk, were subjected to microbiological analysis. This involved assessing the total bacterial count (TBC) and total coliform count (TCC), conducting antibiotic susceptibility tests through disk and well diffusion assays, detecting virulence genes in multi-antibiotic resistant isolates using gene-specific PCR, and analyzing residual antibiotics by HPLC. The study revealed that the quality of raw milk samples was unacceptable (TBC &gt;4.5x107 CFU/mL and TCC &gt;5.6x104 CFU/mL), while pasteurized samples from processing plants had lower counts than those from retail stores (TBC &gt;5x105 CFU/mL and TCC &gt;1.6x104 CFU/mL) indicating post-pasteurization contamination. About 70.37% of the isolates were Gram-negative, with Escherichia coli (21.4%) and Vibrio (18.8%) being the most prevalent. Resistance to antibiotics was substantial, particularly against ampicillin (86.3%), tetracycline (76%), and ciprofloxacin (58.9%). Gene-specific PCR analysis detected uidA, oprL, and oprI virulence genes in multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas sp. respectively. The study also revealed a direct association between the presence of residual antibiotics and the resistant isolates, emphasizing the need for dairy industry improvements. As high bacterial counts in milk can pose health risks by fostering antibiotic-resistant pathogens, it is essential to mitigate microbiological contamination in the milk supply chain through the implementation of various precautionary measures.&#x0D;\nBioresearch Commu. 10(1): 1462-1473, 2024 (January)</jats:p>"

This article aims to assess the traction properties of aerospace lubricants under low-temperature micro-oil droplet (hereinafter referred to as ‘micro-oil’) supply conditions, and provide a lubrication theoretical basis for studying the motion characteristics of aerospace bearings in a low-temperature environment. An experimental study on the low-temperature micro-oil traction properties of high-speed bearing lubricants was conducted on a specially designed aerospace bearing lubricant traction characteristic tester. A modified Herschel–Bulkley model (modified H–B model) was presented based on test data analysis, and the fitting results were compared with the Tevaarwerk–Johnson model (T–J model). The findings demonstrated that the traction coefficient of this lubricant decreased at a higher load and entrainment velocity, and decreased with a decreasing inlet oil temperature from 0 °C to −50 °C. The modified H–B model accurately fitted the test data and was suitable for the engineering traction coefficient calculation of lubricants and high viscosities at low temperatures. This paper can provide fundamental information for analyzing aerospace bearing friction torque variation.</jats:p>"

However, the supply chain of cross-border trade of agricultural products involves many links and has a wide range of chain coverage, showing relatively complex characteristics. In order to realize the sustainable development of cross-border agricultural products trade, an empirical study on the management model and performance evaluation of Guangxi-ASEAN cross-border agricultural products supply chain was carried out. On the basis of defining the concept of Guangxi-ASEAN cross-border agricultural product supply chain, this study first analyzed the management mode of Guangxi-ASEAN cross-border agricultural product supply chain, designed the performance evaluation model of Guangxi-ASEAN cross-border agricultural product supply chain according to the importance of cross-border logistics and demand of agricultural products, and then set evaluation indicators on the basis of target level and criterion level through the selection rules of evaluation indicators. Principal component analysis was used to evaluate the scores of each index, so as to obtain the evaluation level of Guangxi-ASEAN cross-border agricultural supply chain performance, and complete the empirical analysis of performance evaluation. The empirical analysis results are as follows: The logistics system of Guangxi-ASEAN cross-border trade is gradually improved, the delivery timeliness and accuracy of cross-border trade are constantly increasing, the quality of cross-border agricultural products is gradually enhanced, and the information exchange of cross-border trade is becoming more transparent. This improves the satisfaction of consumers, increases the profits of enterprises, reduces the customs clearance time and finished products of agricultural trade, and strengthens the close trade cooperation between Guangxi and ASEAN countries.</jats:p>"

This research is tailored at determining the best torque value and speed to attain a stable state under input voltage variation and minimum time response to realize low percentage harmonic distortions. The effect of constant power quality disturbance harms the performance and behavior of asynchronous motors based on harmonic contents and other energy source integrations. The multilevel inverter has shown good performance in motor drives. This paper deals with the effect of input voltage variations on a single-phase multilevel capacitor-clamped inverter for asynchronous induction motor drives. A five-level capacitor-clamped inverter with an in-phase disposition pulse width modulation technique is adopted. Four high-frequency triangular carrier signals are generated and compared with a reference sinusoidal signal. As a result of this approach, the inverter switches firing signals are generated. The open-loop model is designed and simulated utilizing MATLAB/Simulink and results based on different values of supply voltage are presented. The current and voltage total harmonic distortions (THDs) obtained are 4.97% and 4.46% respectively at the best operating voltage of 400 V and at maximum torque of 47 Nm.</jats:p>"

We use the Cournot–Stackelberg game, the Market–Stackelberg game, and the Market–Nash game to simulate the situation where the upstream seller’s market dominance power gradually decreases while the downstream buyer’s market power increases. The equilibrium decision and supply chain performance under the three models are compared and analyzed, as well as their responses to external market changes such as demand fluctuation and market competition intensity. The research shows that (1) in a seller-dominated supply chain, the increase in buyer power reduces market equilibrium production and wholesale price; (2) in the face of strong demand fluctuations, equivalent power between upstream and downstream can contribute to the stabilization of production and wholesale prices; (3) when market demand fluctuation is small, market power brings a higher profit level, and supply chain participants would like to actively compete for market power. However, when the demand fluctuates greatly, the profit advantage brought by market dominance is no longer significant, and there is no need to spend much to fight for market dominance; (4) the fierce competition of upstream suppliers will induce upstream to give up the competition for market dominance, and make the market power less attractive to downstream retailers. While the fierce horizontal competition downstream will stimulate both suppliers and retailers to actively compete for market power, (5) sufficient market competition will improve total supply chain profit, so encouraging competition is conducive to the overall economic development of society.</jats:p>"

At the maximum values of the temperature systems, the average daily efficiency of the system was 52% with the difference between the collector temperature and the ambient temperature. While on other days, the average daily performance of the system is about 50%. The initial temperature in the tank has an impressive effect on the daily return of the system. An increase in the temperature difference between the water temperature and the collector temperature will lead to an increase in the thermal power of the collectors.

The Prophet algorithm under deep learning is utilized to construct the Prophet agricultural product price prediction model for trend, cycle, and holiday terms. Over the introduction of RNN algorithms and LSEM algorithms to optimize the prediction performance of the model, as well as the gradient explosion. On this basis, GRU neural networks are proposed as an improved model of RNN-LSTM. Prediction comparison experiments are designed to empirically analyze agricultural export price prediction and supply chain logistics risk control, and the results of the empirical analysis show that the vegetable export price predicted by using Prophet algorithm during the period of date 2013/4-2013/9 is 2.975, which differs from the actual price by 0.009 yuan, and the margin of error is in the interval of [-0.091,0.014], which is the smallest variation among the three algorithms, which shows that Prophet model has the best performance. After optimizing the FAPSC risk control coefficient, the risk value of supply chain logistics and transportation was successfully reduced from 0.364 to 0.296, and FAPSC effectively minimized the risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A shipyard is an industry engaged in the construction or repair of ships. A shipyard's ability to complete its production depends on the supply chain. Its suppliers supply all the equipment and materials needed for shipbuilding and maintenance. The shipbuilding sector's supply chain's performance level must be measured to determine how well the existing process flow works. The research was conducted at the PT Dock and a shipyard company in Maluku, Indonesia. The measurement integrates the SCOR and AHP models to determine the existing supply chain performance. The data are collected through questionnaires and from the company archives. The study's findings demonstrate how simple it is to integrate the SCOR model with AHP to assess the shipbuilding sector's supply chain performance. The research proposes 21 KPIs. Those KPIs are constructed from literature studies and interviews with shipyard management. One of the AHP findings in this study states that the most important phase in the shipbuilding industry's supply chain is planning.</jats:p>"

This study aims to evaluate different configurations of PCM enclosures, and different PCMs (paraffin and salt hydrate), by changing the speed of inlet air to achieve heat reduction of inlet air. The study includes experimental and simulation investigations. Every configuration simulates the hot-season atmospheric conditions of the UAE. A duct containing enclosures of paraffin RT-31 and salt hydrate (calcium chloride hexahydrate) was used for the simulation study using ANSYS/Fluent. A conjugate heat transfer model employing an enthalpy-based formulation is developed to predict the optimized PCM number of series and optimum airflow rate. Four designs of the AC duct were modelled and evaluated that contained one to four series of PCM containers subjected to different levels of supplied air velocities ranging from 1 m/s–4 m/s. The simulation study revealed that employing four series (Design 4) of PCM enclosures at a low air velocity of 1 m/s enhanced the pre-cooling performance and reduced the outlet air temperature to 33 °C, yielding a temperature drop up to 13 °C. The performance of salt hydrate (calcium chloride hexahydrate) was observed to be better than paraffin (RT-31) in terms of the cooling effect. Characterization of paraffin wax (RT-31) and salt hydrate was performed to establish the thermophysical properties. The experimental setup based on a duct with integrated PCM enclosures was studied. The experiment was repeated for three days as the repeatability test incorporating RT-31 as the PCM and a 3 °C maximum temperature drop was observed. The drop in the outlet air temperature of the duct system quantifies the cooling effect. Net heat reduction was around 16%.</jats:p>"

The comprehensive exploration of this issue, utilizing Dagestan as a case study, remains incomplete and necessitates further investigation. A thorough analysis of these matters through the lens of labor supply departments enables a more comprehensive understanding of the wartime supply situation for the able-bodied segment of the population. Employing a comparative historical method, this study discusses the intertwined issues of rationed provision, the functioning of the stamp system, and the activities of the Departments of Workers’ Supply (ORS). This approach facilitates an assessment of the effectiveness of the ORS system by comparing quantitative and qualitative indicators of food supply in the republic before and during the war. The principle of historicism enables the tracing of the adaptation process of the working population to the rationed supply system. Utilizing retrospective analysis and synthesizing newly introduced archival documents, this research offers a more exhaustive examination of the various stages in resolving support-related challenges. Special attention is given to the economic situation in Dagestan after the Nazi Germany invasion, emphasizing the food problem and the imperative to transition to a rationed system for supplying food and industrial goods to the population. The ORS system emerges as a key factor in ameliorating the food supply situation for workers, enhancing their nutrition, particularly during night shifts, and aligning the organization of supply with the demands of production.</jats:p>"

The aim is to implement consolidation in multi-product and multi-echelon distribution systems, in order to optimize product placement and distribution efficiently. The method adopted is the Linear Programming model, which considers key variables such as the number of goods to be sent, delivery route, resource allocation, fleet capacity and delivery time limit. The research results show that shipment consolidation, by scheduling shipments that are delayed until the second or third day, allows combining orders into one large shipment, thereby increasing load and route efficiency, reducing trip frequency, and achieving significant transportation cost savings. This strategy successfully increased load and route efficiency, reduced the number of trips required, and resulted in substantial transportation cost savings. Using this method, the total shipping and storage costs are 1,328,834. This consolidation strategy has proven crucial in optimizing delivery types, in addition to facilitating more effective route planning, reducing travel distances and times, and resulting in significant operational cost savings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This research presents a quantifiable value modeling approach for tracking and optimizing value addition at different stages of the product development process (PDP) and supply chain management (SCM). While there is a vast abundance of papers in the literature harping on the need to maximize the value, especially in lean thinking context, in PDP and SCM, there is a dearth of propositions on how to quantitatively measure and optimize value at each stage of product development and supply chain. This paper presents a multi-dimensional value modeling approach that incorporates parameters and variables from different stages of PDP and SCM by mathematically mapping them on to two macroscopic metrics, namely Product Information Evolution and Risk Reduction. These two metrics are in turn modeled by incorporating value attribute variables such as performance, risk, schedule, cost, form, fit, function and timeliness from different stages of PDP-SCM such as customer needs ideation, product functions, inventory management, logistics management and product delivery. The efficacy of the proposed model was tested by utilizing it to measure value additions at different stages of PDP-SCM as well as the total value addition for an ordinance disposal (OD) robot product family, once developed and supplied using traditional production method and once using lean production method, with the underlying axiom being the lean method will result in higher value. To ensure a fair and accurate comparison, both production methods used the proposed mathematical value model and worked toward maximizing total value using nonlinear programming. The results showed that lean PDP-SCM method added higher value at each of the stages as well as total value when compared to the traditional PDP-SCM method thus establishing the proposed value model as a viable mathematical way to measure value. While the proposed value model passed test of efficacy against the lean axiom, further research is needed to test it against other established axioms to establish it as a robust mathematical way to measure value in PDP-SCM. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to the increase in the number of tourists coming from abroad, tourism camps have become interested in offering distinctive experiences, such as being close to nature and eco-friendly. Therefore, utilizing a hybrid renewable energy system for power supply becomes an attractive, nature-friendly, and reliable option for users located in remote areas disconnected from the central network. This article evaluates the electricity demand and associated costs for tourist camps using three different types of hybrid systems consisting of solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, diesel generators, battery storage, and converters. PV/wind systems will cost twice as much as PV/wind/battery systems. Additionally, they are not environmentally suitable due to the large number of batteries. PV/wind/battery systems, comprising a 3 kW capacity PV, a 5 kW capacity wind turbine, and batteries, could offer greater flexibility for tourist camps. This system is estimated to generate 19,303 kWh/year of electricity while not emitting greenhouse gases, despite being more expensive than a PV/wind/diesel hybrid system. The HOMER Pro software is used in this paper for optimization and techno-economic analysis.</jats:p>"

Problems that occur in the process of loading and unloading fish in UKM Camar Laut South Jakarta are still a lot of waste, including the uncertainty of product delivery time, the number of excess transportation activities and the existence of defects in the product. These problems can be solved using a lean supply chain approach with Waste Assessment Model tools. The purpose is to identify the highest type of waste, determine the value added (VA); non value added (NVA); necessary non value added (NNVA) by using VALSAT tools selected and provide improvement suggestions. The highest type of waste that occurs is a defect of 20,278%. Based on the selected VALSAT tools namely process activity mapping tools, VA is 63.888%; NVA is 25,606%; NNVA is 10.512%. Proposed improvements in the process of loading and unloading fish are unnecessary process removals, warehouse integration, improvements to UKM management. Based on the creation of future state value stream mapping, there was an increase in the percentage value of value added by 8.078%, a decrease in the percentage of non value added value of 9.222% and an increase in the percentage of the value of necessary non value added of 1.143%.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to identify and analyze the effect of endogenous variables of business analytics, if any, on supply chain performance. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) in four sequential stages, that is, collecting existing literature from relevant databases, finding endogenous variable(s) in this context, classifying papers based on how the endogenous variable(s) under consideration affect the impact of business analytics on supply chain performance and, finally, segmenting the literature depending on different types of supply chain performance. The study considers research papers published during the period 2008–2023. Based on the analysis of the literature, it is found that ‘market competition’ is an important endogenous variable in this context. This variable can impact the relationship between business analytics and supply chain performance in different ways. It can serve as a moderating variable, mediating variable or main variable. In this study, we have shown how directional relationships among business analytics, market competition and supply chain performance have changed over time. The future scope of the proposed study could be to identify other endogenous variables at the time of verifying the influence of business analytics on supply chain performance. </jats:p>",

Then grouping indicators to provide recommendations for improvement using the Traffic Light System (TLS). It was found that the company's performance assessment was 76.68 out of 13 company supply chain performance indicators. The value of supply chain performance is in good condition, but there are 10 performance indicators that still have not reached the maximum target.

Without hot pressing the gas diffusion layers, a membrane electrode assembly with an electrode area of 1 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> was set in a housing in which the compression pressure could be adjusted [2]. Impedance spectra were measured at 0.7 A/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> under various oxygen partial pressure conditions. Figure 1 shows that polarization resistance decreases with increasing compression pressure under low compression pressure conditions, and conversely increases under high compression pressure conditions. The change in polarization resistance is more pronounced under low oxygen partial pressure conditions. In this contribution, the effect of cell compression on the different polarization processes will be discussed, considering the impact of compression pressure on catalyst layer thickness and porosity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>References</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1] N.

Moreover, the metrological approach was used for the calculation of method uncertainty. The application of the developed method to real samples evidenced the presence of some non‐ionophores coccidiostats in the meat and liver of chicken and rabbit species.

In this paper, based on a systematic search, we provide a comprehensive literature review of the research dealing with the use of ML in supply chain management. We present the major contributions to the literature by classifying them into five classes using the five processes of the supply chain operations reference framework. We demonstrate that the applications of ML in supply chain management have significantly increased in both trend and diversity over recent years, with substantial expansion since 2019. The review also reveals that demand forecasting has attracted most of the applications followed by inventory management and transportation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Restrictions on the planet's carbon footprint are becoming a motivating measure to limit the use of fossil fuels in the European Union. One of the measures to decarbonize the economy is to reduce the use of hydrocarbon fuels (oil, gas, coal). Increasing the potential for hydrogen use in energy is a key point in the conversion of fuels into energy. How the concentration of hydrogen is reflected in the gas supply is an analysis that the energy sector must consider to determine the safe operation and quality of operation of the appliances. Increasing the concentration of hydrogen in gas mixtures by up to 5% does not change the key parameters that determine the interchangeability of used gases in the gas industry. At hydrogen concentrations above 15 % in the gas mixtures, the gasdynamic properties of the gas also change, which also affects the design parameters of the gas supply systems. The article has described the possibilities for transport of the hydrogen in gas networks mixed with natural gas. Options for hydrogen production using alternative energies to meet the Green Deal criteria are described. The specifics of the transport and distributed gas pipelines in Bulgaria have been examined. According to their technical parameters, with the aim of high safety, a scheme of mixing hydrogen with natural gas is proposed. Based on the materials of the pipelines and the technical means of management and maintenance, the permissible concentrations of hydrogen are given. To achieve the possibility of a simplified assessment of the influence of hydrogen. </jats:p>",

Compared to single‐supplier disruptions, supply‐base disruptions create a more uncertain situation for a purchasing manager, yet they can also reveal improvement opportunities. Hence, it is theoretically and practically valuable to understand why a purchasing manager might not be willing to explore these opportunities. Adopting a sensemaking perspective, we investigate how two dimensions of supply‐base disruption severity, breadth and depth, influence managers' perception of disruption severity and post‐recovery action (i.e., suggesting supply‐base restructuring ideas). We conducted multiple scenario‐based experiments with practitioners and triangulated the experimental results with interviews, finding that both breadth and depth have diminishing, positive effects on perceived severity. Interestingly, depth is less influential than breadth. These findings reveal the circumstances under which the severity of a complex, disruptive situation could be misestimated. Our results also show that supply‐base structural complexity (a cue of the task environment) amplifies the positive effect of perceived severity on a manager's inclination to walk into the unknown to propose supply‐base restructuring ideas. These findings provide an explanation for management nonresponse after a supply‐base disruption.</jats:p>",

The influence of logistics on these areas of activity has been studied, logistics has been identified as a driver for the introduction of “green” technologies. The transformation of supply chains into a closed form is considered. In most cases, the sustainability of the supply chain is associated solely with reducing the environmental burden, which is why other factors affecting the supply chain remain outside the scope of research. It is concluded that there is a need for an integrated approach to the definition of sustainable supply chains and the study of all factors that have a disturbing effect. Modern economic conditions require a change in the level of assessment of sustainability criteria with a shift in focus to logistics operations. The features of the Sberbank's methodology are considered. The company was created on the basis of international standards. A study of communication barriers in supply chains has been conducted. Barriers at the level of organizational and interpersonal communications are identified. One of the reasons for the emergence of communication barriers has been identified. The stages of the communication process are listed, and another specific conditional stage is highlighted – noise, which is difficult to control and fix. It is noted that communication barriers cause loss and distortion of information in the form of dispersion and substitution. Conclusions are drawn about the need to create a unified information space where an effective communication system within the supply chain will be one of the factors of chain stability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sustainable supply chain practices are essential in reducing the carbon footprint of the oil and gas industry, which remains one of the largest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. The integration of sustainability into supply chain management can significantly mitigate environmental impacts while maintaining operational efficiency. This paper explores various strategies that oil and gas companies can adopt to achieve more sustainable supply chains. Key practices include the adoption of renewable energy sources, optimizing logistics and transportation, reducing waste through recycling and reuse, and implementing energy-efficient technologies. Moreover, the paper discusses the role of supply chain transparency, where companies disclose carbon emissions and track their progress toward sustainability targets. Technology also plays a pivotal role in enhancing sustainability, with innovations such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and blockchain providing real-time data for better decision-making and tracking emissions across the supply chain. Collaboration with suppliers and stakeholders is another critical aspect of reducing the carbon footprint. By working closely with suppliers to ensure they adhere to environmental standards, companies can create a more sustainable ecosystem. Green procurement, which focuses on sourcing products and materials with lower environmental impact, also contributes to reducing the overall carbon footprint. Furthermore, this paper examines the importance of regulatory frameworks and policy incentives that encourage sustainable practices in the supply chain, such as carbon pricing and emission reduction targets. Ultimately, adopting sustainable supply chain practices in the oil and gas industry not only contributes to global environmental goals but also enhances corporate reputation and operational cost efficiency. As the industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental footprint, these practices provide a roadmap for achieving long-term sustainability and minimizing climate change impacts. This study emphasizes the need for continuous innovation and the adoption of best practices to ensure the oil and gas sector transitions toward a more sustainable and low-carbon future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global transition towards renewable energy is accompanied by an increasing need to enhance the resilience of supply chains in the sector. Developing a framework for supply chain resilience in renewable energy operations is essential for mitigating risks such as resource shortages, geopolitical uncertainties, and environmental challenges. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework designed to strengthen the supply chain resilience in renewable energy operations, ensuring operational continuity and minimizing disruptions. The framework integrates key concepts from risk management, sustainability, and supply chain optimization, addressing both upstream and downstream activities. The framework focuses on several key components: risk assessment, diversification of supply sources, collaboration across the value chain, and the adoption of technology and innovation. Risk assessment techniques are used to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chain, enabling proactive strategies for risk mitigation. Diversification of suppliers and sourcing regions is a critical strategy to reduce reliance on single sources and prevent bottlenecks in the supply chain. Collaborative partnerships between manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers foster agility and flexibility, enabling the rapid adaptation to unforeseen events. Furthermore, the integration of advanced technologies, such as blockchain for transparency, IoT for real-time monitoring, and AI for predictive analytics, is incorporated into the framework to enhance decision-making and improve responsiveness. The paper also highlights the importance of sustainability and circular economy principles in making supply chains more robust and adaptable in the long term. Lastly, the framework includes performance metrics and continuous improvement processes to evaluate and enhance the resilience of supply chains over time. The proposed framework provides a holistic approach to building supply chain resilience in renewable energy operations, ensuring the continuity of critical supply flows while promoting sustainability, innovation, and risk management. The insights and strategies offered can be applied to various renewable energy sectors, including solar, wind, and bioenergy, to support the long-term growth and stability of the industry.</jats:p>"

However, present studies seldom discuss the effect of natural gas supply reliability on power system operation. In this manner, a stochastic unit commitment model is presented with the consideration of long-term gas supply risk in NGPN. Firstly, with the combination of the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) technique and the maximum-flow algorithm, the failure scenario set corresponding to gas supply risk can be obtained. Then, a two-stage model for unit commitment is established considering gas supply uncertainty based on the stochastic optimization model. Finally, case studies have shown that the power operation reliability has been improved with the increased reliability indices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the ever-evolving landscape of global agricultural supply chains, ensuring traceability, transparency, and sustainability is paramount to guaranteeing food safety, combating fraud, and meeting consumer demands. The Philippine onion industry, a vital component of the nation's horticultural sector, grapples with challenges related to traceability and transparency that impact customer trust and economic sustainability. While the adoption of smart contract platforms has revolutionized traceability and transparency in various agricultural sectors worldwide, their potential in the Philippine onion market remains underutilized. This study employs a comprehensive meta-analysis approach to evaluate the existing traceability and transparency mechanisms within the Philippine onion industry, drawing insights from a diverse set of studies. The meta-analysis reveals a consistently positive impact of these mechanisms on traceability and transparency. The findings, supported by a range of studies, underscore the value of these mechanisms in improving product quality, supply chain efficiency, and transparency. The study further investigates the potential impact of smart contract platforms in enhancing traceability and transparency throughout the onion industry's supply chain. Meta-analysis results suggest that the adoption of smart contract platforms holds promise in furthering these objectives. Through automated record-keeping and real-time data sharing, smart contracts have the potential to address existing challenges related to data fragmentation and limited technological integration. Identifying barriers to smart contract platform adoption in the context of traceability and transparency, the study proposes a set of strategic initiatives and recommendations. These recommendations cater to various stakeholders, including government bodies, academic institutions, local authorities, onion farmers, and industry players, aiming to promote the widespread adoption of smart contract platforms. This study extends beyond the confines of the Philippine onion industry, offering valuable insights into the role of smart contract platforms in enhancing traceability, transparency, and sustainability within agricultural supply chains. As the world works towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, this research contributes to the realization of \"Zero Hunger\" and \"Responsible Consumption and Production\" by promoting transparent and sustainable supply chains. By bridging the gap in understanding the potential of smart contract platforms in enhancing traceability and transparency, this study paves the way for innovative solutions, inspiring trust, and fostering sustainable farming practices within the onion industry and, potentially, in similar sectors worldwide.</jats:p>"

Quite often with this pathology there are find references to damage to the organ of vision. With CMPD changes in the composition of peripheral blood are observed, leading to changes in the rheology of blood and contributing to the deterioration of microcirculation of eye tissues. In addition, abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic cells and prolonged specific therapy weaken the body’s immune system, contributing to the development of systemic inflammation. These processes can lead to deterioration of blood supply to eye tissues, in particular in the macular region. <jats:bold>Purpose</jats:bold>. To evaluate vessel density (VD) in the superficial and deep vascular plexuses of retina and the area of foveolar avascular zone (FAZ) using optical coherence tomography with angiography function (OCTA) in patients with CMPD. <jats:bold>Patients and methods</jats:bold>. The study included 25 patients with CMPD (50 eyes) and 20 volunteers (40 eyes), comparable in gender and age, without a history of hemoblastosis. All the examined patients underwent comprehensive ophthalmological diagnostics, including OCTA. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. According to the results, patients with CMPD revealed a significant decrease in VD in all sectors (except the foveolar zone) in both studied vascular plexuses, as well as a significant increase in area of FAZ compared to the control group. <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>. A decrease in VD in the vascular plexuses of the retina, as well as an increase in area of FAZ, are signs of deterioration of retinal blood supply and retinal ischemia. It is possible that these changes may lead to violations of blood rheology, as well as chronic systemic inflammation observed in patients with CMPD. Deterioration of blood flow and prolonged retinal hypoxia can contribute to serious visual impairment of patients. In this regard, patients with CMPD require more detailed monitoring, possibly with correction of the main treatment.</jats:p>"

Hence, a great need arises for digital promotion to keep up with recent technological advancements. Such an aim could be achieved by SMEs in the supply chain by optimizing the results of their websites in search engines and utilizing the digital content (DC) of their web pages. This research is focused on the optimization of supply chain SMEs’ search engine results from the efficient management of their DC. The authors collected big data from the DC of five supply chain SMEs’ websites and performed statistical analysis (correlation and linear regression analysis), followed by six fuzzy cognitive mapping simulation scenarios. Supply chain SMEs’ customers enter their website and are found capable of producing DC metrics, originating from their interaction with the webpage, which is valuable for supply chain SMEs since they impact the performance of their search engine results. The outcomes of this study indicate that specific DC metrics, related to website customers’ activity, can accurately simulate and predict the course of supply chain SMEs’ digital marketing performance KPIs (global rank, organic, and paid traffic). It has been discerned that supply chain SMEs could enhance their search engine results, by increasing traffic originating from social sources, organic keywords, and the costs required for paid advertising campaigns. Accordingly, the increased number of pages opened by website visitors also indicates enhanced search engine results.\n \nReceived: 22 September 2023 | Revised: 22 November 2023 | Accepted: 29 November 2023\n \nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest to this work.\n \nData Availability Statement\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n \nAuthor Contribution Statement\nDamianos P.

Therefore, it is crucial to forecast the growth trend of building area and number of households. A validated time series model is used to predict the new building area in Jilin Province from 2023 to 2030. The new building area in Jilin Province is expected to exhibit two trends of growth in the future: rapid growth (S1) and slow growth (S2). By 2030, under the S1 growth trend, the residential construction area and public building construction area in Jilin Province are expected to be 30.26 Mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> (million square meters) and 7.23 Mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, respectively. If the future floor area grows slowly under the S2 trend, the new floor area of different types will be 8.26 Mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 1.33 Mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> by 2030, respectively. The population growth shows a downward trend. Therefore, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of new buildings with different growth trends of floor areas and the number of households can be predicted. The energy consumption of new buildings shows an increasing trend from 0.32 Mtce in 2023 to 0.55 Mtce in 2030 under the S1 trend and a slight downward trend under the S2 trend. The carbon footprint is expected to be reduced by 0.017–0.311 million tons of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> when using heat pumps to supply 10–50% of the heat and wind and solar to supply 10–50% of the electricity. For every 10% increase in the use of ultra-low energy buildings, the energy consumption of civil buildings decreases in the range of 0.0063–0.028 Mtce. If the use of heat pumps and renewable energy increases by 10%, the energy consumption of civil buildings decreases in the range of 0.0054–0.0249 Mtce.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Considering that batik is one of the most popular products in Indonesia, it is important to analyse the supply chain system for batik products. In reality, the supply chain system for batik products enables orders between buyers to receive products more rapidly, allowing them to anticipate stock outs and obtain lower ordering costs than when ordering from vendors. It is referred to as reactive lateral transshipment. This paper discusses the development of a simulation-based stochastic optimisation model for a batik product supply chain system with multiproducts and single vendor-multi buyers. The utilised solution searching algorithm is a modified Genetic Algorithms (GA) executed in-loop with the developed simulation-based stochastic model. The results demonstrate that the proposed modified GA is able to provide a global optimum solution, allowing the proposed simulation-based stochastic model to reduce the joint total cost (JTC) of the investigated supply chain system by up to 19% when compared to the local optimisation model in each supply chain party.</jats:p>"

This can encourage business people to carry out a sales strategy using two channels (offline and online) or commonly called Dual-Channel Supply Chain (DCSC). In its application, it is hoped that business people will create an environmentally friendly company to reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, business people create companies that implement the Green Dual-Channel Supply Chain (GDCSC) model. GDCSC in online channels has one drawback, namely that consumers cannot evaluate products accurately. This allows consumers to obtain defective products resulting in product returns. Returned defective products can be reprocessed through the remanufacturing process. To provide solutions to these conditions, centralization scenario is used to determine the optimal solution so that maximum profit is obtained. Based on the analysis, it shows that changes in price elasticity and product returns cause system profits to get smaller, while changes in price elasticity and energy efficiency levels cause system profits to get bigger.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

The purpose of the paper is to supply the separately excited dc motor by using different chopper circuits. A very sustainable solution is to replace the resistors from classic theory with dc choppers for better efficiency. The armature voltage can be controlled by using IGBT chopper and the PWM signal received from controller is done with a dedicated block created by MATLAB environment. The advantages of developing this technique are that the speed changes proportionally with armature voltage and inversely with field voltage by keeping field and armature voltage constant respectively. The chopper designed with IGBT and Diode modules offers good control at any frequency value and the speed, the armature current and electromagnetic torque of DC motor can be control. In this paper, different choppers had been simulating were working in four quadrants for supply an excited dc motor by using Matlab program.</jats:p>",

This study demonstrates that simultaneous supply of downstream environmental flow of reservoir as well as water demand is challenging in the semi-arid area especially in dry years. In this study, water supply and environmental flow supply were 40% and 30% in the droughts, respectively. Moreover, mean errors of supplying water demand as well as environmental flow in dry years were 6 and 9 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s, respectively. Hence, these results highlight that ecological stresses of the downstream aquatic habitats as well as water supply loss are considerably escalated in dry years, which implies even using environmental optimal operation is not able to protect downstream aquatic habitats properly in the severe droughts. Moreover, available storage in reservoir will be remarkably reduced (averagely more than 30×10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> compared with optimal storage equal to 70×10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), which implies strategic storage of reservoir might be threatened. Among used evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was selected as the best algorithm for solving the novel proposed objective function. The significance of this study is to propose a novel objective function to optimize reservoir operation in which environmental flow supply is directly addressed and integrated with drought analysis. This novel form of optimization system can overcome uncertainties of the conventional objective function due to considering environmental flow in the objective function as well as drought analysis in the context of reservoir operation especially applicable in semi-arid areas. The results indicate that using either other water resources for water supply or reducing water demand is the only solution for managing downstream ecological impacts of the river ecosystem. In other words, the results highlighted that replanning of water resources in the study area is necessary. Replacing the conventional optimization system for reservoir operation in the semi-arid area with proposed optimization system is recommendable to minimize the negotiations between stakeholders and environmental managers.</jats:p>",

Five daily irrigation treatments were established to simulate varying annual rainfall levels: 250, 750, 1250, 1750 mm and 2250 mm. In each treatment, we used 16 seedlings of J. curcas MAP-08. The seedlings were sown in pots containing loam soil substrate mixed with vermicompost (19: 1 weight to weight). After 60 weeks of cultivation, plants receiving irrigation of 2250 mm per year exhibited growth rates 1.28, 1.51, 1.95 and 1.95 times higher, with respective increases in stem diameter of 15.6, 22.2, 41.9% and 47.7%, as well as 1.2, 1.4, 1.8, and 1.8 more leaves compared to those receiving 1750, 1250, 750, and 250 mm. There was no statistical difference in the number of branches (3.86 branches per plant) between the plants of the treatment with irrigation of 2250, 1750 mm and 1250 mm per year or between the plants belonging to the 750 and 250 mm per year (2.90 branches per plant) treatments. The plants of treatments 1750 and 2250 were the only ones that produced flowers. Although J. curcas typically functions as a succulent deciduous bush, with its stem serving to regulate leaf water potential and acting as a shock absorber against soil water potentials, its morphological and reproductive characteristics were recorded to be negatively affected when subjected to reductions of 22, 44, 67% and 89% in water availability compared to the maximum annual level recorded in the work area (2250 mm).</jats:p>"

The study of the dynamics of labor supply is based on a generalization of materials from the population census 2010 Russian Census and 2020 Russian Census, as well as official statistics. The analysis is based primarily on the quantification of labor supply. The results of the study showed insufficient attention to the study of the labor market of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) at the municipal level. Calculations of the level of labor force participation as an indicator characterizing labor supply revealed a significant decrease during the period between the last two censuses in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) at the municipal level. The factors that have the greatest impact on this situation were selected, which also require a more detailed study. Among the factors we can note decreased production volumes, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, an aging population, and the increasing influence of intraregional migration. Indirectly, the decrease in the labor force participation rate confirms the fall in median per capita income and modal average per capita income for 2015-2021 in comparable prices by 2010, which more accurately demonstrate the low standard of living of the majority of the region’s population, in contrast to average per capita cash income. At the same time, the reduction in the labor force imbalance was undoubtedly influenced by the decrease in the unemployment rate. In the future, it is necessary to focus on a more detailed description of the labor reserve, as well as on the formation of high-quality labor costs at the municipal level. In addition, the study of imbalances in the labor market is impossible without the demand for the labor force, its other component.</jats:p>"

This paper shows the implementation of a computer calculation of one of the branched network options using numerical methods in the CAS MAXIMA computer algebra system, its graphic subsystem of symbolic mathematics, and the use of the author's online calculation program with a client-server implementation - https://www.k123.org.ua/jgIHjob1.html .&#x0D;\nThe implementation of elements of computer calculations in the educational process allows the generation of an unlimited number of individual variants of initial data. The implementation of computer calculation requires the availability of automatic online generation of answers for each stage of iterative calculations. The task of generating online answers is the basis of the program development.&#x0D;\nAn educational online platform is offered for researching the optimality of numerical, graphic and audio formats for setting the problem. The formats of the web form for entering output data have been studied. Online calculations reduce the time spent on typical monotonous operations. Additional possibilities of instant online calculations and visual graphic visualization of calculation results expand the possibilities of modeling individual elements of a branched network.&#x0D;\nThe online program allows you to use computer calculations, expand the culture of using applied mathematical methods for engineering calculations, introduce algorithms and data structures, and solve the main task of training future engineers - to ensure a modern level of education and readiness to solve new problems.</jats:p>"

As the main raw material for Indonesian salted-boiled fish (Pindang) processing, the quality of frozen Scad mackerel (Decapterus spp.) plays an important role that will affect product quality and customer acceptance. Low-temperature storage treatment still has the potential for deterioration of fish quality. This research is a descriptive study conducted in Pekalongan Regency and City during May 2023 to identify the supply chain structure and the quality and safety of frozen mackerel (Decapterus spp.) as raw material for pindang production. The results showed that the parties that play a role in the supply chain of fish raw materials in the pindang processing business in Pekalongan Regency are fishermen, Pekalongan Municipal Fish Auction Center, Fish Middlemen, retailers and pindang processors. At the level of Fish Middlemen up to the pindang fish processing unit, no documentation can describe the handling and origin of the fish. The quality and safety testing of frozen scad mackerel (Decapterus spp.) includes the Sensory Test, TVB-N Test, Total Plate Count (TPC) Test and Escherichia coli Test. The sensory test results showed that all samples were above 7, the average value of TVB-N test results was 17.84 mgN/100mg, the average value of TPC test results was 5x103 colonies/g, and the average value of Escherichia coli test results was &lt;3 MPN/g. Tests of frozen Scad mackerel samples showed that the fish was of good quality and free from harmful preservatives (formalin), making it safe to use as raw material in the pindang processing.</jats:p>"

The survey method was applied to a sample of 255 employees. We tested the importance of certain indicators for the implementation of the digitalization process, such as the application of Blockchain Technology (BT), the use of modern IT solutions for traceability, the implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT), the introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI), development of a system for electronic food placement, implementation of standards, measures, and procedures for regulating the digitalization process, continuous training of employees and economic and financial measures and incentives. A special segment of research deals with the impact of the implemented digitalization process on the sustainability of food placement. The research was conducted among employees of SMEs, large-scale business entities, and retail chains. The research results showed significant deviations from the mentioned incentives to the digitalization process depending on the size of the FSC participants. The work has practical implications because the obtained results show the FSC management, trade policy makers, and competent institutions (ministries, chambers of commerce, professional associations) what measures to apply in order to improve a more efficient implementation of the digitalization process of food placement and lay the foundation for the sustainability of the FSC.

The research was conducted on light-chestnut soil of \"Agrofirma Chokh\" of Gunibsky district on the lands of distant cattle breeding in Kizilyurtovsky district of the Republic of Dagestan. Humus in arable layer contains 2.77%, P2O5 – 2.21, K2O – 32.8 mg /100g of soil, density of arable layer of soil 1.24 g/cm3, the lowest water holding capacity of soil layer 0-0.6 m – 29.2%. During the research we determined the content of N, P2O5, K2O in crop and root residues of corn and sunflower, carried out phenological observations, records and analyses, determined the structure of corn yield, statistical processing of research results. The area of the accounting plot – 100 , 4-fold repetition. Corn was sown with seeds of hybrid ROSS-299, sunflower – variety VNIIMK-8883 with seeding rate of 72 thousand seeds/ha. Fertilizers for sunflower were applied at the rate of N40P24K74 under plowing, N16P16K16 – when sowing with seeds, N34in top dressing in the phase of 5-6 leaves when cutting furrows; for corn – N40 P24– under plowing, N16P16K16 – when sowing with seeds, N30– in top dressing in the phase of 3-5 leaves. Corn and sunflower were sown at the beginning of the third decade of May. Placement of corn after sunflower and plowing with plow with skimmers contributed to accumulation in the arable layer 2.5 times more plant residues than in case of its re-sowing on the same field (3.07 t/ha), which contained 6,70 t/ha N; 2,31 t P2O5and 7.37 t/ha K2O. Supply of such amount of nutrients in the soil contributed to the corresponding increase of nutrients in the arable layer, which contributed to an increase in maize grain yield compared to re-sowing it on the same field using plowing without skimmers by 1,87 t/ha (27.2%).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The issue of dewatering and disposal of sewage sludge is one of the most urgent due to the acute shortage of land resources, the negative ecological burden on water resources, soils and the atmosphere of these sludges in case of their accumulation without proper treatment. Anaerobic stabilization of food production wastewater sludge is one of the most widespread methods of processing this type of sludge due to the possibility of obtaining an important energy resource – biogas. The sludge obtained after anaerobic stabilization in methane tanks is called digestate, and it also needs treatment and further disposal. Digestate can be used as a fertilizer if sanitary and hygienic requirements are met. The development of a technological scheme for processing wastewater digestate is a complex issue that does not have one correct solution. A hybrid technological process for processing wastewater digestate of the food industry is proposed on the basis of experimental studies. Experimental studies include dewatering anaerobically stabilized sludge on a multi-disc dehydrator using dilution of the sludge itself due to its significant viscosity, addition of coagulant and flocculant. Cake with a moisture content of about 65–80% can be transported and used as fertilizer for agriculture. The separated filtrate from the digestate according to the technological scheme is proposed to be purified on two stages of membranes. The efficiency of cleaning the liquid fraction of the digestate on a two-stage membrane installation according to two variants showed the following results: variant 1 (VSEP + RO) – 95%, variant 2 (ZI + RO1 + RO2) – 94%. The VSEP system uses a hermetic RO membrane, so a two-pass membrane process (VSEP+RO) is suitable to achieve the end goal (permeate obtained can be reused), while a ZI membrane requires a three-pass membrane process to achieve the same goal. The achieved parameters make it possible to use the obtained permeate for the production needs of the enterprise or in the technological scheme of the digestate processing itself for dilution of the sediment or for the preparation of reagent solutions. The resulting products (cake and concentrates after membranes) can be used as fertilizers.</jats:p>"

The magnetosorption method, based on the treatment of a liquid with particles of a ferromagnetic material with the aim of sorption on their surface of substances to be extracted, has proven itself well not only in the purification of wastewater from impurities of heavy metals, but also from petroleum products, surfactants, radioisotopes, and suspended substances. The efficiency of water purification processes depends on the properties of the sorbent particles, such as dispersion, sorption capacity and magnetic properties of the particles. The paper presents the results on the dispersion of particles. Changes in the dispersion of synthetic magnetite particles obtained under various conditions, such as storage time, temperature, pH, K=[Fe2+]:[Fe3+] ratio, salt content, and nature of the precipitant, were studied. It is shown that with an increase in storage time, the number of small particles less than 10 μm decreases, and the number of large particles increases due to recrystallization processes. It has been determined that at 20 ℃ without the influence of a magnetic field, a suspension with a maximum content of particles with a diameter of 10 μm is formed, at a temperature of 40 –  70 ℃ particles with a size of 8 –  10 μm prevail in the suspension, and with an increase in the pH of the solution, the number of small particles in the suspension increases. Conversely, with an increase in salt content, the particle size increases with a decrease in the fraction of small particles by almost half. It is noted that at K = 0.8; 2.0, the largest number of particles (about 60 %) with a size of 10 μm are formed in the solution. It is shown that the maximum number of particles larger than 20 μm is formed using NaOH.</jats:p>"

These economies are undergoing a phase of recovery from the pandemic devastations now, requiring investigation into the recovery challenges (RCs) and propositions for effective recovery strategies (RSs) to address RCs. Given this backdrop, this study aims to explore the COVID-19-related RCs in the Bangladeshi leather industry and build an integrated decision-making model to formulate RSs to counteract the RCs while the industry seeks to recover. This study used Pareto analysis to deduce lists of the nine most critical RCs and nine vital RSs for the Bangladeshi leather industry. This study also applied the best worst method (BWM) to identify a long-term liquidity crisis and an increasing bankruptcy of business stakeholders as the most urgent RCs, highlighting financial sustainability as a significant matter of concern for the sector. With regard to the RSs, the application of the fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) indicated a need to solve the existing problems of central effluent treatment plant (CETP) and provisioning of solid waste management facilities for long run business as priorities to make the leather industry SC more financially and operationally sustainable. The RSs formulated in this study have managerial implications for decision-makers in reducing the adversities caused by the pandemic and hence improving the SC performance of the leather industry. Although not totally, these valuable insights into the RCs and RSs for the leather industry during and following COVID-19 periods can be generalized across other industries in Bangladesh and EE regions affected by the pandemic.</jats:p>"

The Chinese government has successively introduced multiple policies and regulations to strongly support its rapid development. Compared to the booming trend of CBEC, the development of its supply chain is slightly lacking in momentum, which has formed a certain obstacle to the overall development of CBEC. The supply chain is the foundation of successful CBEC transactions, and the foundation of the supply chain is logistics. The primary task to improve the backwardness of supply chain development is to solve logistics problems. Therefore, while enjoying the dividends brought by the rapid development of CBEC, international logistics enterprises should continuously improve their logistics service capabilities, effectively evaluate their service quality, and then identify problems based on the evaluation results, analyze and improve them. The service quality evaluation of international logistics enterprises from the perspective of CBEC supply chain is a classical multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM). The Spherical fuzzy sets (SFSs) provide more free space for DMs to portray uncertain information during the service quality evaluation of international logistics enterprises from the perspective of CBEC supply chain. Therefore, this paper expands the partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (PPMSM) operator and IOWA operator to SFSs based on the power average (PA) technique and construct induced spherical fuzzy weighted power partitioned MSM (I-SFWPPMSM) technique. Subsequently, a novel MAGDM method is constructed based on I-SFWPPMSM technique and SFNWG technique under SFSs. Finally, a numerical example for service quality evaluation of international logistics enterprises from the perspective of CBEC supply chain is employed to verify the constructed method, and comparative analysis with some existing techniques to testy the validity and superiority of the I-SFWPPMSM technique.</jats:p>",

The study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on local blood supply management in the Davao Region, Philippines from 2019 to 2021 through the analysis of trends in blood supply in Davao Region, Philippines.\nMethodology. Secondary data from two blood centers in the Davao Region for the years 2019 to 2021 were used to determine the trends on blood donation supply. To evaluate trends, the overall number of blood donors and the quantities of various types of blood components in whole blood, packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) and platelet concentrate have been compared between pre-pandemic, pandemic periods and as restrictions eased.\nResults. A substantial decrease of 51.6% in the number of blood donors was seen during 2021 in comparison with 2019. The trend in collection by blood components also showed a significant trend from 2019 to 2021, whole blood (200.8%), packed RBCs (37.1%), fresh frozen plasma (113.6%). While the platelet concentrate supply declined by 34.9% from 2019 to 2020, an increase of 10.7% was noted onwards to 2021.\nConclusion. The results demonstrate that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a major reduction in donation and supply of blood. The challenges faced by blood banks in ensuring a stable and sufficient blood supply are highlighted by the decrease in the number of donors and by the different trends in the supply of blood components. The targeted efforts to promote blood donation and enhance the resilience of the blood supply during and after the pandemic is important.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The potential for utilizing flue gas as a carbon source in microalgal cultivation holds great promise. Incorporating flue gas as a carbon source into microalgae culture processes can accelerate the growth rate of microalgae, consequently enhancing the overall economic viability of the integrated process. There are two key sources of flue gas to consider: flue gas from coal-fired power plants, characterized by a CO2 concentration of 12–15 w/w%, and flue gas from coal chemical processes, boasting a CO2 concentration of 90–99 w/w%. Additionally, the choice between an open or sealed microalgae culture system can also influence economic efficiency. Thus, there are four distinct microalgal cultivation routes to assess: in-situ open systems, off-situ open systems, in-situ sealed systems, and off-situ sealed systems. The incorporation of flue gas as a carbon source in microalgae cultivation demonstrates significant potential for reducing both environmental impact and costs, rendering it a highly promising and sustainable approach for economically efficient microalgae cultivation. In this review, the in-situ open route is recommended for the situation with high flue gas CO2 concentration and the target products of low-margin commodities, while the off-situ sealed route is suitable for the situation with low flue gas CO2 concentration and the target products of high value-added products.</jats:p>"

Climate change creates significant uncertainty in the potential adaptability of grape plants, as well as in the prospects for viticulture development in general.&#x0D;\nThe study and generalization of territorial distribution of climatic factors that characterize a particular region, as well as their effect on the quality characteristics of raw materials and finished products, are attractive from the point of better understanding and forecasting the potential impact on agricultural systems.

The objects of the study were grapes of white and red cultivars, different in agroecological aspect, and growing in micro regions of Crimea. To identify the effect of factors characterizing the moisture supply of the territory on the quality indicators of raw materials for winemaking products, the amount of precipitation from the beginning of growing season to the harvesting, the amount of precipitation for the last month before harvest, and hydrothermal coefficient of Selyaninov were selected. The assessment of grapes was carried out according to the indicators of carbohydrate-acid complex (mass concentration of sugars, titratable acids, pH value, profile of organic acids), as well as the glucoacidimetric indicator revealing the degree of grape ripeness.&#x0D;\nResults and conclusion. Climatic factors characterizing the moisture supply of viticultural and winemaking regions of Crimea were assessed. The studies carried out made it possible to reveal variations in the concentration of carbohydrate-acid complex components depending on the changing ability of environmental factors. A significant precipitation deficiency was observed on the Peninsula. According to the value of hydrothermal coefficient of Selyaninov (did not exceed 1), most of the territory was classified as an arid or very arid zone. A correlation between the hydrothermal coefficient and mass concentration of grape sugars (r=-0.63) was established for red grapevine cultivars. The data obtained indicate that an increase in the amount of precipitation during growing season contributes to a moderation of sugar accumulation in grapes. Similar pattern was not established for white grapevine cultivars. There was a direct correlation of the mass concentration of malic acid on the amount of precipitation in the last month before harvest (r=0.78).</jats:p>"

Geographical conditions make border crossers more comfortable using sea and river transportation. This paper aims to provide an overview of how smooth border transportation can support the supply chain. The challenge is that the supply chain from the capital or the nearest area is often insufficient due to geographical conditions, and product delivery cannot always be guaranteed. As a result, the price of these goods is higher than the price of goods from the neighbouring country because the shipping costs are lower as the location is closer to the other province that can supply them. This anthropological qualitative descriptive study discovers many transnational socio-cultural characteristics in their cross-border economic activities. This economic activity is bound by the two countries' borders, regulations, and policies. In the case study of Sebatik Island, building a border transportation system is one of the strategic solutions to support the supply chain of border communities. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, government policies prioritise sea transportation. The results show that when local transportation is smooth, the border area will remain in touch with the provincial government, and the availability of primary products for the Sebatik community does not always depend on neighbouring countries. A smooth supply chain encourages food self-sufficiency at the border.</jats:p>"

Digital traceability technology amalgamates information and resources from stakeholders in the supply chain, facilitating knowledge sharing and product tracking throughout the entire process to purify the supply chain environment. Augmenting communication and trust among supply chains paves the way for green innovation, thereby yielding value-added benefits. Consequently, this paper formulates a simulation model for manufacturers, retailers, and consumers—three pivotal stakeholders in the traceability process of livestock products—from a value co-creation standpoint. It also incorporates a contract penalty mechanism to probe the collaborative green innovation process among various entities involved in the livestock product supply chain. System simulation is employed to emulate the evolution path of collaborative green innovation in the livestock product supply chain under the value co-creation perspective. Subsequently, a stepwise penalty mechanism, green incentive mechanism, and fair distribution mechanism are proposed for stakeholders to actualize collaborative green innovation and value creation. The findings reveal that: (1) the collaborative green behavior between suppliers, retailers, and consumers is influenced by factors such as value co-creation excess returns, innovative technology costs like traceability, cost sharing among stakeholders, and a certain threshold of government penalties. (2) A balanced distribution of excess returns and cost-sharing among stakeholders fosters the evolution of a green collaborative state in the supply chain, thereby achieving sustainable development with value chain enhancement and ecological optimization.</jats:p>"

The continuous increase in grain production lays a solid groundwork for upholding the country&amp;rsquo;s food security. Grounded in five dimensions&amp;mdash;social, economic, technological, resource, and environmental&amp;mdash;this article establishes a security evaluation system for the grain supply capacity of Sichuan Province, incorporating 14 specific indicators, and utilizes a PLS structural equation model to investigate the diverse factors influencing the security of Sichuan Province&amp;rsquo;s grain supply capacity. Findings reveal that social and technological advancements directly negatively affect the security of the grain supply capacity, while economic growth, environmental progress, and resource enhancement directly positively influence grain supply capacity security. It also corroborates that a sustainable grain supply capacity necessitates the harmonious development of these five facets, each being essential. As a result, strategies to safeguard the security of Sichuan Province&amp;rsquo;s grain supply capacity are put forward, aiming to offer decision-making references for strengthening and elevating Sichuan&amp;rsquo;s grain supply capability and constructing an advanced &amp;ldquo;Heavenly Granary&amp;rdquo;.</jats:p>"

The equilibrium shows that when bank credit finance is viable, the retailer decides whether to share information is neutral. When trade credit financing or guarantor credit financing is viable, the retailer shares information with the supplier. Blockchain technology provides capacity for the retailer to convey the downstream information to the supplier. The result also shows that when the guarantee ratio is relatively large, commercial bank tends to lower interest rate while the supplier is unwilling to provide GCF to the retailer. Finally, we also study the financing mode decision and demonstrate that a lower production cost promotes the supplier to provide TCF under information sharing. When there is no information sharing, the retailer’s optimal financing choice depends on the supplier’s estimation of market demand.</jats:p>",

However, depending on the type of production (i.e., conventional, organic, and regenerative), they might not be applied. Adequate types and uses of pesticides should not cause any damage to any non-target species or environments due to the exposure to it, especially if all farming operations have been done properly. Reversely, when pesticides are applied in inappropriate time, amount or technique, they may cause several impacts, among which is water contamination. Brazil stands out worldwide for its agricultural potential, but it is exposed to risks concerning the water supply security to its population. The current study is a comparison of the Maximum Permissible Concentrations (MPC) for pesticides in potable water supply in Brazil with the values set in the United States, Canada, European Union countries, Japan, and the guidelines issued by the World Health Organization. The regulations of each country were used, as well as the trading, consumption and agricultural production data. The Brazilian regulation is the one accounting for the largest number of pesticides. However, their MPC is 5,000 times more permissible than that from the European Union for the herbicide known as glyphosate, 300 times than that for 2,4-d and 20 times than that for atrazine. Finally, it was possible to observe the relevance of revising the regulation and public policies in place to minimize the indiscriminate use of pesticides in Brazil and adapt these compounds to the standards in a global level.</jats:p>",

The effect of different nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) supply levels and their combinations was examined in different rainfall supply periods (wet, normal, dry) on a grass sward in a field experiment. Dry and fresh aboveground biomass production were primarily increased by the N–rainfall supply interaction, from 0.739 to 6.51 and from 1.84 to 21.8 t ha−1, respectively, but the P–rainfall supply and N–P interactions and K treatment all had significant effects. Dry matter content was primarily influenced by the N–rainfall supply interaction, increasing in response to N in dry periods and declining in wet periods. Water use efficiency (WUE) was increased by the N–rainfall supply interaction from 28.3 to 127 kg ha−1 mm−1, but the N–P interaction had a similarly strong effect, and K treatment increased it in the dry period. The N, P and K contents of the aboveground biomass were increased by treatment with the corresponding element, but were also influenced by rainfall supply. The increase in biomass, mainly due to N treatment, caused the dilution of the P and K contents in grass in treatments poorly supplied with P and K. Biomass production and WUE were significantly improved up to a dose of 200 kg ha−1 year−1 of N, up to a supply level of 153 mg kg−1 of P2O5, and 279 mg kg−1 of K2O measured in the soil. Treating grass with the N, P and K macroelements may effectively increase biomass production and water use efficiency, but above a certain level their application is unnecessary.</jats:p>"

This need is justified by the fact, that the calculation of the necessary parameters of the symmetry-compensating device was previously based on the Nelder – Mead search optimization method. Search optimization performing is computationally expensive, takes long computation times, and may calculate anomalous values. The article develops the idea of using technology for predicting the parameters of a symmetry-compensating device, based on neural network modeling using Bayesian regularization. For a given set of initial data, the best selected configuration turned out to be a neural network of two layers, implemented in the MATLAB package using the machine learning tool Neural Network Toolbox. The network input parameters are a set of tuples, consisting of load values in each of the three phases of the power supply system, which are resistive-inductive in nature. There are six input quantities in total (load resistance and inductance values in each of the three phases) and all their values are different, which causes current asymmetry in the network and reactive power. The target matrix is formed from tuples, consisting of three values, which are the parameters of the symmetrical compensating device, calculated by the optimization method, in such a way as to compensate reactive power and to balance currents in the network. The number of data tuples, required to train a neural network was determined empirically. During the experiments, the optimal number of neurons in the neural network was also revealed. The use of the generated neural network to calculate the parameters of the symmetry-compensating device determined approximate solutions is comparable in accuracy to the values, found by optimization methods. With the help of the generated neural system, adequate quasi-solutions for calculating the parameters of the symmetry-compensating device were determined, which, in case of calculation, using the optimization method, led to anomalous values, that didn’t optimize the energy coefficients of the power supply system to the required extent. Also, such neuropredictions protect the system from receiving excessive high parameters of symmetry compensating device, which can be obtained with an optimization approach.</jats:p>"

However, the commonly used chopper circuit topology of pulse power supplies is limited by the maximum switching frequency of the field-effect transistor. To address this problem, this paper proposes a nanosecond pulse electrochemical micromachining power supply based on a differential circuit. The power supply uses the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller as the control core to output high-performance rectangular waves through a DDS device. After differential, rectification, filtering, and power amplification processing, stable, frequency, amplitude, and pulse width adjustable spike pulse voltage signals are obtained. By establishing a system mathematical model and optimizing the time constant of the differential circuit, theoretically, the sub-nanosecond pulse width can be obtained. Prototype performance tests show that the power supply has a maximum frequency of 20 MHz, a minimum pulse width of 1.8 ns, and a maximum peak voltage of 10 V. By using this power supply for microhole electrochemical machining experiments, nanometer-level machining precision has been achieved.</jats:p>"

In order to address this issue, the study empirically examines the relationship between money supply, exchange rate, and Inflation in Pakistan. The study utilized annual time series data from 1990-2020 from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and World Development Indicators (WDI). To avoid spurious results, the Phillips-Perron unit root test and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were applied to check the data stationarity, which was integrated at different orders of integration. The exchange rate and inflation are stationary at the 1st difference I(1), while the money supply is stationary at the same level I(0). The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model analyzes the variables' short- and long-term relationships. The study confirms the presence of both short-run and long-run relationships among the variables. The results show that money supply and exchange rates significantly impact inflation positively. A negative and significant error correction term (ECT) indicates strong equilibrium convergence among variables. The upper and lower bounds values are below the F-statistics, indicating a significant long-term association between the statistically significant variables. The research contributes to current knowledge by presenting new awareness into the dynamic relations among money supply, exchange rate, and inflation. Furthermore, this study will help to design monetary policy to achieve specific targets to control inflation and volatility in exchange rates. It will help regulators and policymakers stabilize financial markets and the supply and demand of products, prevent pricing mechanisms and import exports, and increase the balance of payment accounts.</jats:p>"

These emissions are partially avoidable if ships and vessels docked at the port use electric energy to feed their power needs instead of using their internal combustion engines. In Europe, there is an ongoing discussion on including such emissions in the European Union Emissions Trading System, which will represent added costs for maritime operators. Onshore power supply systems can contribute to the ongoing energy transition by allowing the use of electric power to feed docked ships. As a first step to contribute to the development of onshore power supply solutions, it is necessary to evaluate the added power needs that these systems would represent for the port. This paper presents a methodology that allows port operators to verify, straightforwardly and transparently, their power needs for onshore power supply applications. The methodology is based on the historical data of docked ships at the port or quay level and provides an energy analysis of each type of vessel to determine the power to be installed at the port so that it is possible to supply energy to different types of ships and vessels simultaneously. Additionally, the implemented methodology provides economic and technical decision support factors by comparing the fuel costs with electric power costs, assessing the potential for this transition to onshore power supply. The methodology is validated using a real case study for the Port of Lisbon, and obtained results demonstrate the potential for the installation of an onshore power supply in medium- to large-dimension maritime ports.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a framework for AI-driven optimization of supply chains within the energy industry, focusing on the integration of AI technologies to address key challenges such as demand forecasting, resource allocation, and predictive maintenance. AI’s ability to process large volumes of data, uncover patterns, and enable real-time decision-making offers significant advantages over traditional supply chain management systems. By applying machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, energy companies can optimize their supply chain processes, improve operational visibility, and minimize downtime, leading to enhanced service delivery and cost savings. This framework explores how AI can be integrated into different stages of the energy supply chain, including sourcing, distribution, and consumption. AI-based demand forecasting models enable more accurate predictions of energy requirements, allowing for better resource planning and reduced waste. Additionally, AI tools can optimize logistics by analyzing transportation networks and providing real-time data on delays, route optimization, and fleet management. Predictive maintenance, driven by AI algorithms, can forecast equipment failures before they occur, reducing unplanned outages and enhancing asset longevity. Moreover, the paper highlights the role of AI in achieving sustainability goals by improving energy efficiency, supporting renewable energy integration, and reducing carbon footprints across the supply chain. It emphasizes the need for a strategic approach to AI implementation, including the development of data infrastructure, algorithm transparency, and collaboration among stakeholders. The paper concludes by proposing a comprehensive roadmap for energy companies to adopt AI-driven supply chain solutions, ensuring a transition towards smarter, more efficient, and sustainable operations. Challenges such as data quality, technological integration, and workforce adaptation are discussed, along with recommendations for overcoming these barriers to successful AI implementation in the energy sector.</jats:p>"

Anode baking as a Pt plated sintered Ti web (Bekaert), and anode flow filed was serpentine type. 10 mL min<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> of toluene or 10% toluene – methylcyclohexane was fed to cathode. 5.0 L min<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> (313 mL min<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>) of fully humidified air or liquid water was fed to cathode.

Cell voltages were almost same for all experiments in less than 0.3 Acm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> of current density region, while cell voltages of humidified air feed were higher than that of liquid water feed in higher current density region. Here, internal resistance of humidified air and liquid water feed were 0.29 and 0.21 Ω cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Therefore, membrane condition of the humidified air feed was drier than that of the liquid water feed.

In this case, the current efficiency of the liquid water feed was a little higher than that of the humidified air feed. The current efficiency of the humidified air feed was more than 95% up to 0.5 Acm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>, while the current efficiency of the liquid water feed decreased 95% around 0.2 Acm<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup>.

For the 100% toluene feed, toluene transportation would less affect and cathode potential would much affect to the current efficiency. Larger internal resistance of the humidified air feed would correspond to dry condition of cathode ionomer, and it would decrease the cathode potential. Therefore, the current efficiency of humidified air was slightly lower than liquid water feed. On the other hand, the current efficiency of 10% toluene feed would be controlled by toluene transportation in the cathode catalyst layer and is significantly affected by the water transportation through the membrane.

However, a longer-term crisis looms due to humanity's overstepping of planetary boundaries and its disruptive consequences. Growing awareness of the potential collapse of societies due to planetary boundary violations has prompted increased attention in the scientific literature. In the water sector, where infrastructure built today might persist during a future collapse, we must therefore ask ourselves how a (basic) level of water supply can be maintained in a collapsing society. This paper explores this question and proposes research directions to address it in the short to medium term. Despite the seeming remoteness of a societal collapse scenario, it is imperative to incorporate it urgently into water infrastructure research and planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Strategies to increase sustainability are of growing relevance for supply chains and especially for the management of production processes. In this paper, we build on existing literature in closed-loop supply chain management and consider a two-period game-theoretic model in which product returns are reused in the manufacturing process. In all scenarios, we assume that the return rate of used products is random and not known to the players at the beginning of the planning horizon, thus, they have to deal with uncertainty in period 1. In contrast to existing literature, we will also address the circumstance that the players’ level of information in period 2, after the returns have been realized, can be linked to the collection mode in the supply chain. In Scenario A, the retailer is involved in the collection of the used products and transfers them to the manufacturer, so that symmetric information is available. In Scenario B, on the other hand, the used products reach the manufacturer directly from the customer, so that the manufacturer has an information advantage over the retailer. By comparing these scenarios and a vertically integrated supply chain benchmark case, it becomes clear that, depending on the actual return rate, the presence of private information can be either beneficial or detrimental to the manufacturer. The retailer, on the other hand, can compensate for information disadvantages in most cases over the multi-period planning period due to its position as a Stackelberg leader. Regardless of the amount of a transfer payment offered to it by the manufacturer, it prefers the collection of the goods by the manufacturer itself. These findings contribute to literature on symmetric information, where, for example, a retailer-led collection is preferred (Savaskan et al. Manage Sci 50(2):239–252, 2004) or the decision depends on the amount of the transfer payment (Modak et al. J Clean Prod 171:512–528, 2018). However, we show that cooperation between the players leads to the best results not only economically but also from an ecological point of view.</jats:p>",

The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has attracted more attention due to its advantages such as good safety, long service life, and flexible design [1].</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the VRFB, the electrolyte flow characteristics are important for the concentration overpotential as it significantly affects the supply of vanadium ions [2]. Therefore, many studies are focusing on the influence of flow rates and electrolyte distribution on VRFB performance [3-4]. However, few studies have focused on the effects of fluctuations in electrolyte flow rates on battery polarization and overpotential, which often occurs in practical situations and affects the mass transfer of ions. In this study, we focused on the effect of fluctuations in electrolyte supply induced by the peristaltic pump on the polarization behavior of the VRFB.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The electrodes of the experimental VRFB are Sigracet<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> GDL 38AA, the membrane is Nafion<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> 211, and the vanadium ion concentration of the electrolyte is 1.7 mol/L.

At higher flow rates, the vanadium ion transport speed is faster, and the concentration gradient of the reaction surface is smaller, resulting in lower overpotential and polarization. Under fluctuating conditions, the changing electrolyte flow rates also lead to changes in vanadium ion supply speed, resulting in the voltage fluctuation periodically.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Acknowledgement</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21H04540.

Data were collected through a structured questionnaire from employees working in manufacturing firms in Pakistan. Random sampling was used to select the participants. The hypotheses were tested using partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The study revealed that GSCM practices significantly positively impacted manufacturing firms’ performance. It highlighted the mediating role of green innovation, suggesting that GSCM practices fostered innovation and improved firm performance. The study also uncovered the moderating role of information sharing and IT innovation, indicating that the effectiveness of GSCM practices in driving performance varied based on the extent of information sharing and IT innovation within the industry. The findings of this study had practical implications for industry practitioners and policymakers. Implementing effective GSCM practices and promoting green innovation could enhance firm performance in the manufacturing sector. Recognizing the importance of information sharing and IT innovation was crucial, as they significantly enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency of GSCM practices. This study contributed to the existing literature by examining the relationships among GSCM practices, green innovation, information sharing, IT innovation, and manufacturing firm performance. It provided insights into the mechanisms through which GSCM practices impacted firm performance, offering a comprehensive understanding of the role of green innovation and the moderating effects of information sharing and IT innovation.</jats:p>"

Objective: The objective of this paper was to ascertain the alternative hypotheses that IDEs, EDEs, and perceived attitudes (PAs) affect the AA of EAA for supply chain management (SCM) within small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/Methodology: The study used quantitative analysis chronicled in statistical package social science (SPSS) version 25 that encompassed diagnostic tests through Cronbach’s Alpha for reliability, and Double-Exponent Distribution for data validity. Data analysis is concerted through the model summary, graphical expression of MLR, regression analysis (algebra expression), along with Beta weight. Results/Findings: A stratified-random sampling of 310 data sets were used as SMEs’ owners and managers. The results were obtained from the main analysis of multiple regression that produced a model equation (Y) that determined the estimations of AA of EAA with 5xs; 19.49x6; 17.84x6; 18.23x6; 16.12x6; and 9.82x6; and response variable (Y); 25.8 x6: wherein Ԑi is residual error. Practical implications and conclusions: This exertion contributes to existing knowledge on AA of EAA for SCM by providing three main separable functions of multilinear regression (MLR). First, it broadens the understanding of the strength of relationships between Xs, PV and Y. Second, its expositions which predictors in the model are statistically significant and which are not. Third, it projects a confidence interval for each predicted regression coefficient.</jats:p>",

The life indicators of 59 full-term children, who were randomly divided into two groups, were studied. The first group (n = 30) received standard nutrition with mother's milk or formula, the second group (n = 29) received protein-fortified food and L-carnitine supplementation during the hospital stay.&#x0D;\nThe results. Babies of both groups had statistically equivalent characteristics at the beginning of the study. Against the background of higher consumption of proteins, the number of non-protein calories per 1 g of protein in the study group was 28.68 kcal/kg/day (27.50; 29.80), against the indicator of the standard diet group of 42.37 kcal/kg/day (41 .60; 38.00), with U = 28.0000; p = 0.000001. Carnitine supplementation in the GZ group led to an increase in the level of free carnitine in the last blood plasma samples of newborns. In general, the proposed nutrition strategy was accompanied by better indicators of physical development of children. Children who consumed more protein were transferred from the intensive care unit earlier – 10.00 (8.00; 12.00) days, against 12.00 (11.00; 16.00) days, with U = 235.00; p = 0.0024; previously discharged from the hospital -21.00 (19.00; 27.00) days, against 26.50 (22.00; 31.00) days at U = 267.00, p = 0.0109. This strategy proved to be safe, as confirmed by normal levels of phenylalanine and blood biochemical indicators at all stages of the examination of children, including urea nitrogen and creatinine.&#x0D;\nConclusions. Short-term increased consumption of protein against the background of carnitine supplementation improves the results of the physical development of newborns, does not lead to deviations in the biochemical profile, and is safe.</jats:p>"

This study applies a systematic literature review to conduct a comprehensive review from 2008-2023 to identify commonly used sustainability practices and methodological trends. After a comprehensive analysis, 31 articles were included in the final analysis. We observed that several sustainability practices in all three sustainability pillars had been implemented in the healthcare supply chain. This includes employee welfare and well-being, understanding and managing demand, and green practices. This review found that sustainable practices have great benefits, such as empowering employees and increasing the performance and efficiency of an organization. Also, this review observed that several methodologies are being used in the healthcare supply chain, whereby empirical studies are more than conceptual studies. In empirical studies, the in-depth interview is the most used methodology compared to other methods. This observation shows a clear methodological gap in the healthcare supply chain sustainability, as more of the existing research concentrates only on the in-depth interview. This study sheds light on policymakers growing awareness for the benefit of implementing sustainable practices for improved healthcare supply chain performance. From the researcher's perspective, this review sheds light on the areas that need further investigation, such as social sustainability, which is not well-researched in the healthcare supply chain.</jats:p>",

Tuti Hamlet has a population of 596 people spread across 5 (five) RT. Currently, meeting the need for clean water in Tuti Hamlet uses several drilled wells that are still functioning. In total there are 5 locations for drilled wells. However, currently only 2 drilled wells can operate and are unable to serve the amount of clean water needed in Tuti Hamlet. This is due to the absence of an adequate drinking water supply system network to distribute water originating from several drilled wells that are still operating. Therefore, it is necessary to plan the development of a drinking water supply system (SPAM) in Tuti Hamlet to overcome this problem. The aim of this research is to calculate the projected clean water needs in Tuti Hamlet for the next 15 years and plan the clean water piping network so that the clean water needs of the Tuti Hamlet community can be met. Population projections to determine the projected need for clean water using arithmetic methods. The population projection results show that the population in 2038 will be 920 people with an average need for clean water of 0.11 liters/second. The main distribution network system development plan in 2022-2038 uses 2 inch diameter PVC pipes for 450 m, 1.5 inch diameter PVC pipes for 3000 m and 0.5 inch diameter PVC pipes for 3600 m.</jats:p>"

El objetivo de la presente investigación consiste en analizar el comportamiento de la implementación de las estrategias del offshoring empresarial en la gestión de cadena de suministros, para luego establecer ciertas recomendaciones hacia aquellas empresas que no utilizan estas estrategias en especial en América Latina. El modelo de investigación es una revisión sistemática enfocado en los beneficios de las estrategias del offshoring implementadas por las empresas. Para tal efecto, se planteó una búsqueda en dos fuentes:  Scopus y Web of Science (WoS) y un análisis siguiendo el método PRISMA. Asimismo, se presenta como resultados 11 beneficios de las estrategias del offshoring que las organizaciones implementan para reestructurar su huella de producción a nivel global. Este estudio concluye con 7 razones principales de la implementación de las estrategias del offshoring en las empresas, de las cuales son: la reducción de costos de producción, el acceso al mercado del país extranjero, la implementación de precios de transferencia, el ahorro de menores costos laborales, el contrato de trabajadores altamente calificados, el acceso a nuevas tecnologías y conocimientos y la reducción o diversificación de riesgos que ayudaron a las organizaciones a optimizar sus costos y reestructurar los recursos estratégicos.  Por esta razón se recomienda a las empresas de dichos países de América Latina que utilicen estas estrategias que le ayudaran a generar una ventaja competitiva en la cadena de suministros haciéndolo más compleja, eficiente, ágil, productiva y competitiva en los mercados exteriores. \r\n </jats:p>"

The risk of such disruptions can be particularly consequential for firms in emerging industries that lack resources and for which dominant organizational and supply chain designs do not yet exist. Within local and regional food supply chains, food hubs are nascent enterprises coordinating these supply chains. Building off the existing supply chain risk management literature, this study identifies and assesses the perceived supply chain risks faced by U.S. food hubs. The study employs an exploratory sequential mixed methods research design and the Failure Mode and Effect Analysis methodology for this purpose. The results show risks related to imbalances in food supply and demand, logistical delays, human resources, and infrastructure capacity limitations were perceived to be the highest priority supply chain risks for the U.S. food hubs before the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Despite declining vaccination rates in 2020, there was a notable rebound in 2021, indicating the resilience of Tanzania's immunisation program. The analysis also highlighted regional differences in varying vaccination rates when standardised per 1000 population. Seasonal fluctuations were observed in the monthly vaccination rates, with BCG showing the most stable trend. Predictive modelling of BCG indicated stable and increasing vaccination coverage through 2023.\n<jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>\nThe findings underscore the robustness of Tanzania's childhood immunisation infrastructure in overcoming the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, marked by a strong recovery in vaccination rates post-2020. We provide valuable insights into the dynamics of vaccinations during a global health crisis and highlight the importance of sustained immunisation efforts in maintaining public health.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inventory is a resource owned by the company to be used in the production process to meet consumer demand. Companies must be able to control inventory appropriately in order to avoid excess or shortage of inventory by using inventory control. Inventory control is a necessary part of a company that requires an appropriate inventory policy to meet uncertain needs. Based on this background, this study discusses the single item inventory model in the form of photochromic glasses at Merry Optik to find the optimal total inventory cost. In meeting the uncertain needs of the company, the Additive Decomposition forecasting method is used in order to find out the forecast sales data pattern in the future. Uncertain demand causes the inventory system to be probabilistic, so it is necessary to carry out probabilistic inventory control. The P model of the case of back orders was chosen because the range of ordering periods is fixed and the company can buy inventory when it runs out before the time the inventory order is made so that buyers can wait until the inventory arrives. By using Model P for the case of back orders, the company can obtain the period between orders, the total cost of inventory, and the optimal level of service. Based on the results of this study, a pattern of sales forecast data is obtained which repeats every 12 months. Companies must order glasses within a period of 32 days between orders so that it is optimal and able to provide a reduction in the total inventory cost of IDR 21,828,771 with a service level of 95%. Companies can save on inventory costs if they use shorter periods between orders. The total cost of inventory can be more optimal if the company reduces the cost of storing inventory in the warehouse.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Catastrophe management strives to minimize or prevent possible losses from hazards, ensure appropriate and timely aid for disaster victims, and accomplish fast and efficient recovery. Both supply chain management and its use in disaster assistance have been well studied. Even with the implementation of lean, just-in-time, and zero-inventory practices, traditional supply chain management has been unable to adapt to these disturbances due to its limited focus on cost reduction for stable operations. The purpose of this literature review is to provide strategies for improving humanitarian supply chain support operations in the face of a wide range of disasters. The analysis shows that the humanitarian organization has several difficulties and constraints when it provides aid to the victims. Disasters like earthquakes, floods, and COVID-19 often have a greater impact because of inadequate living conditions and building regulations. Disaster assistance requires a wide range of resources, including rescue operations, medical aid, food, housing, and long-term relief initiatives. The effectiveness of any relief attempt is highly contingent on how quickly supplies can be supplied. When it comes to a disaster relief operation, the kind and scope of the demand, along with the timing and location of the event, are all unpredictable. Subsequently, the study examines the risk obstacles to supplying essential resources to the impacted area. The survey study also discusses the use of agile and lean technologies for humanitarian and logistical management in the areas of cost and product delivery. This develops superior operational performance techniques for pre- and post-disaster phases. According to the study’s findings, stakeholders should pay close attention to the logistical, operational, and material concerns in the management of the humanitarian supply chain.</jats:p>"

In addition, quantifying the social impact of a monetary unit, easily understood by decision‐makers, is an important step towards achieving global sustainable supply chain performance. This work intends to contribute to this challenge and develops a monetization approach for assessing supply chain's social performance, considering three main relevant social indicators: job creation, accidents and training.  These are then integrated into an optimization‐based decision tool that can be used to design and plan a supply chain based on an informed decision. This operation research–based tool considers the economic and the social pillars independently or simultaneously, allowing the development of different analyses to reflect on the different trade‐offs that could be considered when designing and planning sustainable supply chains. A case study is utilized to demonstrate the tool's applicability, and a number of conclusions and insights are provided on how to strengthen supply chain sustainability.</jats:p>",

Efficient energy consumption in buildings is one of the most affordable ways to reduce the negative impacts of climate change and health-related problems. The purpose of the study is to analyze the regulatory requirements of European countries for NZEB buildings and compare them with the current norms in Ukraine. Determining the cost of energy-efficient structural solutions with current regulatory values. Based on the calculations and research, the following scientific and practical results were obtained. Analysis of norms in European countries for NZEB buildings and compare them with current norms in Ukraine. The calculated design values for NZEB buildings in Ukraine were considered. The needs for insulation of the wall, roof, and basement floor coverings were calculated according to the current norms in Ukraine and the norms proposed by the NZEB. The economic feasibility of measures to insulate the proposed normative options of NZEB was calculated. As a result of obtaining scientific and practical results of increasing the energy efficiency of enclosing structures, it shows that in terms of indicators of enclosing structures, Ukrainian standards are not lagging behind European countries, although they require further improvement and additional changes. The results of the economic calculation of the increase in the thickness of the insulation show that the NZEB standards have a more economic and thermal insulation potential in the long term compared to the current standards in Ukraine.

Some NTM are known to cause pulmonary and skin diseases. As NTM are prevalent in water supply systems, the health burden of waterborne NTM is concerned. However, little is known about NTM in building plumbing. This study revealed the abundance and diversity of NTM in building plumbing by using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Moreover, the chlorine susceptibility of NTM isolates in tap water was evaluated. The increase in the abundance of Mycobacterium spp. was observed in some taps after 24 h of stagnation, indicating that NTM could have the potential to regrow in building plumbing. While Mycobacterium mucogenicum and Mycobacterium avium were detected by cultivation, amplicon sequencing of NTM-specific hsp65 genes revealed that Mycobacterium gordonae was dominant in most of the samples, which was not detected by cultivation. The chlorine susceptibility experiment demonstrated that NTM strains related to M. avium and M. mucogenicum were 119 and 426 times more tolerant to chlorine than Escherichia coli, respectively. As M. mucogenicum, M. avium, and M. gordonae are regarded as opportunistic pathogens, intensive monitoring of NTM in tap water in building plumbing is necessary.</jats:p>",

Thus, hydrological modeling becomes further challenging while accounting for data-scarce mountainous basins observing climate change impacts. In this study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to predict hydrological flow in the Sunkoshi River Basin (SRB) based on daily rainfall and temperature data spanning 36 years. The specific objectives of this study were: (i) to use the SWAT model to simulate the long-term hydrological response, (ii) to generate spatially distributed rainfall–runoff and subbasin-wise water balance components using well-established performance indicators. Calibration and validation at the outlet of the study area were successful, with the values of R2/Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) calculated as 0.91/0.82 for monthly data and 0.79/0.73 for daily data. In the validation phase, the values of R2/NSE were 0.91/0.84 for monthly data and 0.82/0.75 for daily data, respectively. This study predicted the average yearly flow and precipitation at the SRB outlet to be 279 m3/s and 368.25 mm, respectively. Approximately, 30% of water loss was attributed to evapotranspiration, 18% to runoff, and 30% to lateral flow. The findings of this study will contribute to water resource management.</jats:p>",

Hence, we explore how the SDGs are adopted in supply chain management (SCM) using institutional logic as a theoretical lens. Based on a case study, we analyse 10 interviews conducted with managers and suppliers of a multinational cosmetics company recognised for its sustainability engagement. Our findings show that while the strategic level embraces the SDG framework, supply management processes are exclusively evident at the operational level. This becomes even more salient in the analysis of sustainability and commercial coexisting logics. Although sustainability logic concerns compliance with sustainability‐related regulations and external pressures, commercial logic demonstrates the effective engagement of strategic decisions in favor of profitability. Our results reveal nuances in the existing gap between the SDGs and SCM, illustrated through a typology of coexisting logics at the strategic and operational levels, adding value to the SCM literature.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nitrogen (N) is one of the fundamental elements for plant development: it plays a very important role in biochemical processes, such as chlorophyll photosynthesis, the production of amino acids and proteins, but it is also the most critical element in fertilization. When nitrogen is administered to the soil, in its more complex forms, organic and ureic, it transforms into increasingly simple forms such as Ammonia (NH) and Nitric (NO3) and becomes assailable by plants. Due to its agronomic function, nitrogen represents an element that must be appropriately integrated into the crop cycle through careful fertilization and a careful balance between withdrawals, losses and contributions. The choice of the nitrogen fertilization strategy must obviously aim to guarantee the availability of the element to the crops in the phases in which they need it most, avoiding losses that can represent a threat to the environment or to the crop economic balance.  This article has the main purpose of highlighting the impact of the main fertilizations used in the regional agricultural context, in relation to the concentration of nitrogen in its various forms which remains in the soil, thus becoming part of a potential environmental impact both of the matrix itself and of the aquifers. Below, through the analysis of the main crop types. The conclusion is the impact of the main crop type and them fertilization on the soil in particular for the nitrogen compounds.</jats:p>"

The research Objective is to improve the supply chain activities using the Green Manufacturing approach. This study utilizes the Green Supply Chain Operations Reference (GreenSCOR) model with a focus on the production process. There are 8 Green Objectives with 15 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that will be weighted for each KPI using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Furthermore, data on the actual realization values of the KPIs are collected from 25 factories located in Kampung Tahu-Tempe Selili. The calculation is performed using the Snorm de Boer method to normalize the actual data, and the Traffic Light System (TLS) method is used to categorize the KPI performance. Based on the calculation of weights and normalization values, the performance score of Kampung Tahu-Tempe Selili is 69.85, KPIs MR-03 and MR-04 are problems faced by all factories and are categorized as red. Factory conditions that cannot treat liquid waste and waste in water use, so that steps that can be taken by the factory reuse residual water for needs that do not involve direct contact with food which can reduce water demand. Then work with the local government to build a waste end treatment plant which can later be processed into alternative biogas fuel.</jats:p>"

To achieve this purpose, a tightness control device was developed using the method of fixed volumes.        Methods. Using the molecular-kinetic theory of gases, the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics laws, the characteristics of an open thermodynamic system under excess pressure and with a degree of a capillary-type leakage are investigated. Pneumatic energy losses in the pneumatic supply pipeline are determined by the mass of compressed air leaked due to its poor tightness.        Findings. The peculiarities of the tightness control of hollow products by the method of fixed volumes have been summarized. The dependences of non-production losses of compressed air and the corresponding pressure drop on the geometric characteristics of the air supply pipeline, the leakage in supply pipeline, and the time of assessing the degree of leakage have been determined.        Originality. For the first time, the relationship between the parameters of compressed air in an open thermodynamic system under excess pressure during air leakage and its heat exchange with the environment has been revealed. The influence of compressed air leakage in air supply networks on the efficiency of using vibration-pneumatic machines with an annular ejector in backfill technologies has been determined.        Practical implications. The research results can be used to improve the existing or develop the new technological schemes of air supply equipment that use pneumatic energy at mining and metallurgical enterprises.

However, there is limited research on the temporal dynamics and climatic effects of urban landscape multifunctionality. This study aimed to address this gap by analyzing the features of multiple landscape functions triggered by seasonal climate change in different urban park types. In this study, we investigated five typical urban landscape functions (alleviating urban heat islands, vegetation growth, biodiversity promotion, alleviation of waterlogging, and provision of recreational activities) by establishing a set of indices: ecological supply capability (<jats:italic>S<jats:sub>P</jats:sub>\n                  </jats:italic>), proportion of ecological supply (<jats:italic>SP<jats:sub>P</jats:sub>\n                  </jats:italic>), capability of human benefits (<jats:italic>B<jats:sub>P</jats:sub>\n                  </jats:italic>), and human benefits efficiency (<jats:italic>BE<jats:sub>P</jats:sub>\n                  </jats:italic>) of urban parks.

Water treatment has emerged as a critical concern, with a long-standing acknowledgment of the importance of preserving and appreciating this precious resource. UV-C technology has proven to be an ideal solution that effectively addresses these twin needs. The core principle of UV bactericidal treatment revolves around generating ultraviolet rays within a treatment chamber filled with water. Consequently, ensuring a dependable power source for low-pressure mercury-argon discharge lamps has become imperative to guarantee the efficiency of UV-C disinfection.The primary goal of this study is to supply our discharge lamp with a current source that produces a sinusoidal current at its output, featuring a frequency of 50 kHz and an effective value of 0.65 A. Electronic ballasts enable lamps to enhance radiation quality by operating at high frequencies, and the selection of a power supply is a response to this specific challenge.The aim of this research centers on the utilization of a single-phase matrix converter. The bidirectional switching cells within this converter offer frequency-related advantages. To achieve the desired magnitude and frequency, we employed a PWM control strategy. Subsequently, we implemented a linear current adjustment approach using two controllers: a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller and a Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) in the RST polynomial form. This was done to ensure a high-quality current source with the desired waveform and low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).The research outcomes have led to environmental simulations conducted using Matlab/Simpower system and Matlab/Simulink.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to ascertain the remaining levels of toxins in urban drinking water networks and compute the water quality index.\r\nMaterials and Methods: To examine the residual concentration of diazinon, chlorpyrifos, and dichlorvos in urban drinking water distribution networks, 35 underground and surface water sources were sampled in Tiran-o-Korun in Isfahan province, Iran. GC-ECD device was used to analyze the samples.\r\nResults: Diazinon was not observed in any of the sampling seasons. The maximum concentration of chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos was 61 and 100 ppb, respectively. Although chlorpyrifos was seen more in the hot season and dichlorvos in the cold season, the mean concentration of these toxins in different seasons was lower than the guidelines of Iran and the World Health Organization (WHO). The mean concentration of nitrate, and hardness, in wet and dry seasons was 46.23 and 46.42, and 343.7 and 338.8 mg/l, respectively.\r\nConclusion: The mean and standard deviation of quality index of Iran's water resources (IRWQI) in wet and dry seasons were 52.16 ± 45.3 and 50.69 ± 15.8, respectively. The residual concentration of toxins in some water sources of this city exceeded the guidelines of Iran and the WHO in summer and spring.</jats:p>"

Recently, cluster-based synthetic data generation (CBSDG) has been proposed, which uses explainable and tractable techniques for privacy preservation. Although the algorithm demonstrated promising performance on simulated data, CBSDG has not yet been applied to real, personal data. In this work, a published blood-transfusion analysis is replicated with synthetic data to assess whether CBSDG can reproduce more complex and intricate variable relations than previously evaluated. Data from the Dutch national blood bank, consisting of 250,729 donation records, were used to predict donor hemoglobin (Hb) levels by means of support vector machines (SVMs). Precision scores were equal to the original data results for both male (0.997) and female (0.987) donors, recall was 0.007 higher for male and 0.003 lower for female donors (original estimates 0.739 and 0.637, respectively). The impact of the variables on Hb predictions was similar, as quantified and visualized with Shapley additive explanation values. Opportunities for attribute disclosure were decreased for all but two variables; only the binary variables Deferral Status and Sex could still be inferred. Such inference was also possible for donors who were not used as input for the generator and may result from correlations in the data as opposed to overfitting in the synthetic-data-generation process. The high predictive performance obtained with the synthetic data shows potential of CBSDG for practical implementation.</jats:p>"

However, with upward trajectory of financial globalization in macroeconomic policy, loans to the private sector can help businesses in a variety of ways, such as providing access to capital, financing new investment and job creation. However, preventing businesses from over-indebtedness is essential as it can make them more vulnerable to financial shocks. However, the upward trajectory of financial globalization in recent times has led to a significant expansion in the financial industry. This research investigates the interdependence of money supply, financial progress, and unemployment for the period 1990-2021 by evaluating panel information covering eight economies classified as upper middle income. According to the results of the long-term CCEMG/AMG for the effect of explanatory variables on unemployment, financial development decreases unemployment and money supply increases.

In accordance with this Resolution, the indicators of the quality of services System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) and System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) for the supply of electric energy were analysed using the example of the operator of the distribution system JSC “Kharkivoblenergo”. The SAIDI quality indicator is characterized by the duration of long interruptions in electricity supply in the distribution system of JSC “Kharkivoblenergo”. The SAIFI quality indicator provides information on the frequency of long interruptions in electricity supply in the distribution system of JSC “Kharkivoblenergo”. The analysis of SAIDI and SAIFI indicators was performed for the short-term period of operation of the operator of the distribution system JSC “Kharkivoblenergo”, namely for December 2021. Based on the results of the analysis of SAIDI and SAIFI indicators, it follows that the achievement of the target values of quality indicators allows adjusting the necessary rate of income for the operator of the distribution system JSC “Kharkivoblenergo”, and also creates a favourable investment climate, which ensures modernization, reconstruction and construction for the renewal of the energy infrastructure with the aim of improving the quality of providing services for the supply of electric energy to consumers. Also, the analysis of the indicated indicators made it possible to evaluate the work of JSC “Kharkivoblenergo” in terms of the implementation of established quality indicators, to identify problem areas in the Company's activities regarding the provision of guaranteed quality standards, to form and practically implement an investment program, to determine how quality indicators are reflected in tariff formation in the incentive regulation.</jats:p>"

In this study the type of descriptive research selected and its approach with a qualitative research approach. So that the research location and research site is the Mount Kelud Tourism Area, Kediri Regency. Through the results of interviews, observations, and surveys related to the focus of research to related parties, there were 5 informants as primary data sources which were determined by researchers with certain considerations, namely the Tourism and Culture Office of Kediri Regency, tourism managers, visitors, motorcycle taxi associations, and traders associations. The results show that Mount Kelud tourism has very good potential to be developed. The lack of coordination between the two parties, namely between the government and the manager to improve existing facilities, becomes a problem such as adding photo spots which are considered insufficient and also expanding the parking area which is a problem because it is considered not spacious enough to accommodate many vehicles when the holidays arrive. The products sold are also less varied, namely only pineapple products and their derivatives such as pineapple chips, pineapple juice, pineapple candy, and others. So that visitors are not satisfied with the products sold because the products are less varied.</jats:p>",

The paper examines the problems of building mathematical models for forecasting the operation of a critical infrastructure object in the conditions of a changing security environment, characterized by unpredictability, the presence of uncertainties of various types, the appearance of new threats, their combinations, changes in the form, duration, nature of their influence. In the work, the main attention is paid to the study of the functioning of critical infrastructure in the field of energy supply. Based on the study of the functioning of the energy company system, methods of dealing with uncertainties at the stage of data preparation for analysis and during the preliminary construction of models are presented, in particular, statistical and probabilistic approaches, modeling of the studied processes, alternative methods of estimating model parameters, etc. The complexity of preparing the input data set is related to the fact that it is necessary to ensure the representativeness and variability of the data sets, given that a significant number of factors must be included in the model according to the requirements of regulatory documents, which can lead to multicollinearity of the input variables. The paper proposes an analytical toolkit based on the use of mathematical models and their combinations, intended for use in specialized decision support systems. In the course of the research, a number of numerical experiments were conducted, in which the proposed methodology was worked out on the materials of the enterprise – the object of the critical infrastructure of the energy sector. SAS Energy Forecasting software was used to build the models. The best forecasting results are obtained using generalized linear models (GLM), in particular the GLM model in the form of ARIMAX (a moving average autoregressive model that includes an integrated trend component and external regressors). The proposals presented in the work will allow to increase the efficiency of the functioning of the energy sector, including the determination of the goals, tasks and benchmarks of its operation in regular mode for certain periods of time, as well as in the field of development of universal and special mechanisms for ensuring stability in the mode of response to threats and critical situations.</jats:p>"

With an analysis of regional archival materials, the author reveals the both the importance as well as the future potential of such fuel resources as peat and firewood located in the region, as well as the main ways of their procurement for the needs of the national economy. Special attention is paid to the working conditions of procurement officers as well as the radical changes in the age and gender composition of workers employed in peat extraction and firewood cutting across the War. It is shown that during the war years the role of women increased considerably, which was caused by the mass mobilization of able-bodied men. The consequence of this was a significant decline in labor productivity, especially from 1942 to 1943. The location of firewood and peat resources at a considerable distance from cities with enterprises and institutions made it difficult to deliver them in a timely manner. These logistical difficulties often led to shutdown of plants and factories, as well as public institutions. The author comes to the conclusion that it was not possible to fully solve the problem of supply until the end of the war, although according to the available data, there were still fuel resources in various places for procurement. The sources also show large number of complaints of the population about the lack of heating in for their homes and the failure to provide assistance with the delivery of firewood, as well as the broader difficulties with the food supply.</jats:p>"

The dataset covers the period between January 2017 and April 2023 and consists of 76 observations. The results show that the effect of delays on the supply chain is asymmetrical, while the increase in delays increases the pressure, the decrease in delays has no effect. This shows that the effects of delays on the supply chain are sticky and take a long time to clear from the system. In this direction, policies are recommended to minimize the effect of delays on international trade.</jats:p>"

Effective cooperation between transportation firms requires some form of joint planning, which is often challenging to implement from an IT perspective and difficult to sustain due to the reliance on advanced planning software. In this paper, we present a simple but effective policy for cooperative transportation that does not require a complex joint optimization of operations. In this share-first-plan-second policy, cooperating firms first develop a cyclic schedule for a fleet of shared transportation resources and then assign their shipments to the transportation resources in real time. The policy performs nearly as well as a jointly optimized planning of operations while not requiring advanced IT systems and planning software. Finally, the share-first-plan-second policy exhibits robustness against deviations from planned transport operations, enhancing its practical applicability.</jats:p>"

For thermal stability during the operation of the electromagnet, it is essential to lower the heat flux from outside the system. The heat from the surrounding environment to the HTS winding is limited by using an adequately sized cryogenic system and the proper design of the current leads. The HTS winding and current leads are cooled with a two-stage GM cryocooler. If the power supply conductor's conductive heat flux exceeds the cryocooler’s heat load, the temperature of the HTS winding will increase, and system instability may occur. The power supply conductors are of two types: copper conductors and mixed HTS conductors. This work analyzes HTS conductors and junctions of HTS tape with copper terminals and their contribution to the cryocooler’s total heat load. Using HTS conductors reduces Joule heat when current passes through them (approx. 300 A) and the conductive heat flux to the HTS windings. Resistance for various soldering alloys was experimentally evaluated to evaluate the Joule heat of the junctions between HTS conductors and copper terminals.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology enables these transactions to be tracked in a very secure and transparent manner. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a framework that utilizes blockchain and key Escrow encryption systems to optimize the security of supply chains to improve services for global business survivability.\r\nRESULTS: The comparative analysis with the existing benchmarking techniques with respect to the key size, key generation time, and key distribution time was carried out with the proposed model and found that proposed work provides better results.\r\nCONCLUSION: This proposed system can track the authenticity of the product and details about the manufacturer of that particular product. Thus, the paper concludes the proposed work enhances data’s integrity, traceability, and availability and single-point failure can be resolved or reduced using blockchain mechanism.</jats:p>"

The specific objectives are to identify and characterise the types of enterprises operating in automotive supply chains, to identify changes during the pandemic in automotive enterprises, depending on the type of activity, and to show disruptions in automotive supply chains and ways to counteract these disadvantages depending on the type of activity. Automotive enterprises operating in Poland were selected for the study purposefully. A random selection method was used to select 500 automotive companies for the study. The data sources were surveys conducted in June 2023 among 500 enterprises in the form of a direct telephone interview. The Pearson χ2 test of independence was used to check the existing relationships between the type of business activity and the results and responses obtained in the surveys. Automotive companies experienced supply chain disruptions, regardless of the type of business. Most often, these were caused by lockdowns and official closures, low stocks of materials and products, and problems with employees. The type of business conducted was not a factor determining the type of disruptions in the supply chain. All types of enterprises reported similar problems in the supply chain, such as longer order processing times, increased transport, storage, and labour costs, and decreased on-time delivery. Disruptions were most often short-lived, up to 1 year. Car producers indicated that disruptions were longer and even longer lasting compared to sales, maintenance, and repairs. Companies countered disruptions by using mostly operational measures, which were short-lived. Only a small percentage of operators made strategic decisions and countered disruptions over a longer period. The scale of these actions was greater among manufacturers than among dealers and car service companies. The theoretical contribution to science was the identification of disruptions and ways of responding to them in supply chains in the automotive industry, depending on the main types of activities conducted. A practical contribution may be the presentation of enterprises’ reactions to the uncertainty and the recommendation that enterprises have ready scenarios for responding to occurring disruptions.</jats:p>"

Harvesting solar energy for production and logistic activities in supply chains, including factories and distribution centers, has been promoted as an effective means to reduce GHG emissions. However, it is difficult to balance the supply and demand of solar energy, owing to its intermittent nature, i.e., the output depends on the daylight and season. Moreover, the use of large-capacity solar power generation systems and batteries incurs higher installation costs. In order to maintain low costs, demand-to-supply management of solar energy, based on appropriate seasonal analysis of power generation and consumption and the capacity planning for power generation and the storage battery, is necessary. In this study, the on-demand cumulative control method is applied to actual power consumption data and solar power generation data estimated at a distribution center. Moreover, the monthly, seasonal, and temporal characteristics of power generation and consumption at the distribution center are analyzed. Additionally, the total amount of power purchased is investigated for solar energy demand-to-supply management.</jats:p>"

Companies worldwide faced significant challenges as they dealt with the unexpected surge in demand for specific goods and services. This study delves into the importance of supply chain coordination (SCCO), supply chain resilience (SCRE), and supply chain robustness (SCRB), considering supply chain flexibility (SCFL) and Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics (IoT-BDA) integration. We explore how SCFL influences SCCO, SCRE, and SCRB, enhancing supply chain performance (SCFP). Using a cross sectional approach, we collected survey-based responses to ensure comprehensive representation from the supply chain domain. A total of 217 complete responses were collected and analyzed using AMOS 20. The findings suggest that SCCO, SCRE, and SCRB act as mediators between SCFL and IoT-BDA. However, statistical significance between SCCO and SCRB with SCRE was not established. The study emphasizes the robust predictive nature of SCFL, highlighting its pivotal role in fostering SCCO, SCRE, and SCBR through empirical evidence. Furthermore, it emphasizes the influence of SCFL on enhancing SCFP, particularly in the post-pandemic era.</jats:p>",

It has been established that for all studied modes of operation  of the power source, with an increase in the power consumption of the microwave generator system, an increase in the microwave power recorded in the central region of the plasma discharge is characteristic. The continuous generation mode is characterized by a decrease in the uneven distribution of electromagnetic energy along the axis of the discharge chamber.  It is shown that the transition from a pulsed to a continuous mode of microwave plasma discharge generation at the same level of power consumption by the generating system is characterized by a decrease in the value of the registered microwave power in the microwave discharge plasma volume and an increase in its local conductivity in particular areas of the reaction-discharge volume.</jats:p>"

Factories or industries whose raw materials require a large amount of money to move materials that are easily damaged will tend to choose their industrial locations around sources of raw materials. This shows that Indonesian people are aware of the nutritional contribution of consuming fish. The amount of production and consumption of this fish is also influenced by the season and weather so that the supply of caught fish is uncertain but the demand for fish is always increasing. Apart from that, other risks are inaccurate knowledge of fish handling, the distribution of caught fish that takes too long affects the decrease in the quality of fresh caught fish and the selling price of caught fish. Flying fish at Muncar Fishery Port is very dependent on the fishing season, so the availability of supplies fluctuates.

According to the warranty provider, this paper considers two possible warranty strategies: the manufacturer warranty and the retailer warranty. The optimal pricing and warranty periods are determined by considering the effect of the consumption subsidy policy through Stackelberg game models. Subsequently, this paper investigates the optimal warranty strategy by comparing the economic and integrated performance of the closed‐loop supply chain. The analytical results indicate that the retailer warranty enables the supply chain to obtain a higher economic performance than the manufacturer warranty. Nevertheless, the integrated performance that combines economic and environmental performance depends on the consumption subsidy level. In addition, this paper finds that the consumption subsidy policy enhances supply chain profitability and consumer surplus but may hurt the environment in certain scenarios. Therefore, this paper derives the optimal subsidy level by maximizing the total social welfare, which takes into account both economic and environmental performance.

We characterize how the behaviors of the entrant's optimism and consumer's inertia jointly affect the pricing (deterrence) strategy of the incumbent manufacturer, entry strategy of the entrant, and equilibrium decisions in the post‐entry game. Interestingly, our results show that: (i) in the post‐entry game, both behaviors could benefit the two manufacturers but are detrimental to the retailer; (ii) in the entry strategy, when consumers are moderately inertial or the entrant is highly optimistic, the entrant will suffer from an incorrect entry decision and then has an unprofitable entry; (iii) in the pricing strategy, the incumbent manufacturer will set the normal wholesale price to blockade the entry if consumers have high inertia or the entrant has a low optimism; otherwise, he will set a new price to accommodate the entry. Furthermore, we discuss two different cases, finding that (iv) the existence of the retailer weakens the deterrent power of the incumbent manufacturer; and (v) the retailer will induce the manufacturer to accommodate the entry when the entrant is moderately optimistic.</jats:p>"

Promoting territories’ spatial protection and governance by improving the supply of ecological products is very important. In this study, we established an ecological product supply capacity evaluation index system involving three types of ecological products, i.e., ecological environmental products, ecological material products, and ecological cultural products. For the case of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, we comprehensively used principal component analysis, the equivalent factor method, and the entropy method to evaluate the supply capacity of ecological products from 2011 to 2021. Then, we analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern, combining the natural breakpoint and quantile classification methods, and analyzed the obstacle factors using the obstacle degree model of ecological supply. The results show that the supply capacity of different ecological products in each city are closely related to their ecological resource endowment. The supply capacity of ecological products exhibited an upward trend, with the highest ecological environmental product supply being relatively smaller than the ecological material product supply, while the largest growth rate was for ecological cultural product supply. The supply capacity of different ecological products varied across cities over time and displayed noticeable spatial differentiation. The main obstacle factors included eco-land, eco-tourism, eco-leisure, park green space, and fishery products, although there were variations among cities. Finally, based on the level, spatial-temporal pattern, and obstacle factors of ecological product supply, we proposed strategies for territory spatial protection and governance from the perspectives of the integrated protection of elements, structural regulation, and systematic governance. The results reflected the ecological functional heterogeneity of the territory space, which can provide spatial planning guidance for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To estimate the level of fire hazard of hydrogen storage and supply systems, it is advisable to use reliability indicators, in particular, of their core element, which is a gas generator. Such indicators include indicators of amplitude and phase reliability of the gas generator, which are determined through the Laplace function. The arguments of this function are the relative errors of the parameters of the gas generator, which are determined by its transition function. Three options for determining the parameters of the gas generator have been developed, the feature of which is obtaining information about its parameters at two a priori given moments. The magnitudes of these moments do not exceed the time of the transient process. In the a priori specified moments, the values of the transient fraction are measured (option 1), and the values of its derivative (option 2) or the value of the integral of the transient function (option 3) are additionally measured. Algorithms for processing the received information have been developed for all options, the implementation of which ensures the determination of gas generator parameters. In terms of its structure, the second option for determining gas generator parameters is the simplest, which has 1.5 times fewer arithmetic operations compared to the first option. In addition, the second option for determining the parameters of the gas generator is invariant to the value of the time parameters that determine the measurement moments. The results of determining the parameters of the gas generator and their nominal values are used to determine the arguments of the Laplace functions. We have specified that when determining the parameters of the gas generator, the complexing method can be used, which involves the implementation of all three information processing algorithms. As an example of the second option of determining gas generator parameters, the structural diagram of the algorithm is presented. We have emphasised that the implementation of the developed algorithms for determining the parameters of the gas generator has no subjective factor associated with the use of expert judgments.\nKeywords: gas generator, fire hazard level, transition function.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Surface water is an important source for drinking water supply in Mahanadi Basin, Odisha. The research was done to evaluate the water quality, that serves as the source of domestic water supply to many cities. Samples of water were taken from nineteen important sampling areas for a period of 2010-2023 and twenty water quality parameters were examined to determine the WQI, followed by Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) evaluation. Employing the Weighted Arithmetic (WA) Water Quality Index (WQI) and Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) WQI, this study finds areas where cumulative variables, such as sewage discharge, a falling water table, dilution, and surface runoff, that tends to cause water quality variations in a water body, over a given monitoring period, have had the greatest impact. The WA WQI and SWARA WQI in the study area ranges from 23.78 to 96.09 and 14.6 to 1065.2, respectively. Also, the river water ranged from excellent to very poor, encompassing excellent for approximately 15.8%, good for 68.4%, poor for 10.5% and very poor for 5.3% in case of WA WQI. While the general water quality, as per SWARA-WQI, it varied from excellent to extremely poor, comprising 84.21% excellent, 10.53% poor and 5.26% for extremely poor category. The overall WQI in the study area indicates that the surface water is safe and potable except few localized pockets in SP-(8), (9) and (19) blocks. The cause could be attributed to anthropogenic sources such as domestic sewage and agricultural runoff altered a few parameters– e.g., TKN and TC. Based on geostatistical results, Gaussian model produce a more accurate assessment as per nugget/sill ratio, ASE and RMSE. To delineate the feasible regions for drinking practices, MCDM models such as Compromise Programming (CP), Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), and Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo), were adopted. Finally, the results demonstrated that WQI generated using both indexing strategies matched the outcomes of MCDM models. To sum up, it is advantageous and gives a clear image of water quality to combine physicochemical properties, WQIs, MCDM, and GIS technologies to evaluate surface water suitability for drinking and their controlling variables.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) heralds a transformative era characterized by the integration of advanced technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) into various sectors, notably supply chain management. This paper explores how AI optimizes supply chains, enhancing efficiency, responsiveness, and resilience from a business model perspective. Traditional supply chain models often face challenges such as demand variability, inventory management, and logistical inefficiencies. By harnessing AI technologies, businesses can address these challenges through improved data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation. AI-driven supply chain optimization involves the utilization of machine learning algorithms and big data analytics to forecast demand accurately, enabling businesses to adjust their operations proactively. This shift from reactive to proactive supply chain management fosters agility, allowing firms to respond to market fluctuations swiftly. Furthermore, AI enhances visibility across the supply chain, facilitating real-time tracking of inventory levels, order status, and supplier performance. This transparency enables organizations to identify potential bottlenecks and mitigate risks effectively. The research highlights several AI applications in supply chain optimization, including automated inventory management, predictive maintenance, and intelligent logistics. Automated systems reduce human error and operational costs, while predictive maintenance minimizes downtime by anticipating equipment failures. Intelligent logistics solutions, powered by AI, optimize route planning and delivery schedules, enhancing overall operational efficiency. However, the successful implementation of AI in supply chains also poses challenges, such as the need for significant investments in technology and infrastructure, data privacy concerns, and workforce adaptation to new technologies. This paper discusses these challenges and provides recommendations for businesses to navigate them effectively. In conclusion, AI presents substantial opportunities for optimizing supply chains in the context of 4IR. By adopting AI-driven approaches, businesses can create more resilient and efficient supply chains, ultimately driving competitive advantage and sustainability in a rapidly evolving market landscape.</jats:p>"

However, several sociocultural, economic, and psychographic factors influence the adaptation of new technologies, especially in developing countries such as Bangladesh. This study uses the composite index approach to determine the Index derived from the correlation between the factors and their impact on the DSC practices and intentions. The study indicates that Trust (T) is the primary influencer, along with Performance Expectancy (PE), closely followed by Facilitating Value (FV), Facilitating Conditions (FC), and Digital Literacy (DL).</jats:p>"

The fast-moving consumer goods industry is able to provide for such a demand, as it is one of the biggest industries globally. However, this industry has also been affected by reverse logistics, which has led to the industry in search of reverse logistics best practices to mitigate reverse logistics challenges. The main objective of this study was to examine reverse logistics best practices in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. This was achieved by employing a positivist research philosophy, and furthermore by employing the explanatory and descriptive research design. This study was quantitative in nature which promoted the use of a non-probability purposive method to further collect data through survey-monkey using online platforms. The study achieved an 80% response rate from the FMCG retail industry, where the descriptive results from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 27 revealed that RL best practices are moderately implemented.</jats:p>",

But such a simplistic portrayal of sustainability leaves out the boundaries of what firms would opt to do given certain market conditions and what customers (and other stakeholders) would be willing to sacrifice, if anything, to be sustainable. In response, we develop a theory of market-based sustainability and delineate its core tenets. The theory facilitates a deeper analysis of sustainability actions for firms and customers (but also other primary and secondary stakeholders) – via a focus on sustainability levels and changes – involving direct (doing good), indirect (warm glow), and synergy-related sustainability impacts as well as price fairness. Without such integrative theorizing, firms will likely allocate cost estimates (and price points) that are too high for the undertaken sustainability actions or impact estimates that are too low, or both, instead of achieving a maximum point of sustainability yield.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of pulse-modulated sub-RF range (100 kHz–1 MHz) excitation on atmospheric pressure argon plasma jet characteristics is studied. For this, a suitable power supply is developed, offering a sub-µs rise time with control of different parameters, such as voltage amplitude, pulse modulation frequency in the range of 1–30 kHz, and an oscillation frequency of ∼520 kHz, which can affect the plasma behavior. Plasma characteristics, such as reactive species generation, ionic composition, plasma plume length, and gas temperature, are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by employing diagnostics such as optical emission spectroscopy, molecular beam mass spectrometry, and optical imaging. Experimental observations indicate that the gas temperature of the plasma jet and plume length increase with the applied voltage for all pulse modulation frequencies, with a maximum value of ∼(325 ± 2 K) and a maximum length of ∼(23 ± 3 mm), respectively, at 30 kHz and 9 kVpp. The emission intensities of OH• and O• lines show an incremental behavior with the applied voltage across all pulse modulation frequencies. The relative yield of different positive (OH+, O+, etc.) and negative (OH−, O−, etc.) ions also increases with the applied voltage for all pulse modulation frequencies with maximum values of ∼(7.6%, 9.9%) and (3.9%, 9.4%), respectively; these are relatively close to RF excited ionic concentrations reported previously. Attaining a high plasma length and species yield signify the features of both kHz and RF atmospheric plasmas. This study offers significant insights and flexibility into exploring the impact of different RF frequency regimes on plasma characteristics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>применение планарных изделий в современных модулях электропитания – тенденция мировых лидеров в области силовой электроники. Причины перехода с традиционных моточных изделий заключаются в конструктивных и технологических решениях, принимаемых при разработке и проектировании планарных устройств. Так, например, правильно выполненный трансформатор определяет эффективность и высокий коэффициент полезного действия (КПД) любого импульсного источника питания (ИИП). Трансформатор в планарном исполнении, на первый взгляд, исключает возникновение проблем на операции сборки в связи с простотой конструкции. Однако проблемы могут возникнуть на других этапах производства: тестирование модуля, испытания при разных температурных режимах и других операциях, где определяют электрические параметры изделия. В данной статье выявлены причины проблем несоответствия электрических характеристик, проведен анализ вероятности нежелательных потерь при неблагоприятных результатах сборки модуля. С помощью моделирования сложных объектов, подобных трансформатору, можно определить потенциальные риски при эксплуатации изделия, а также предугадать поведение всей функциональной части модуля электропитания. Поэтому с целью подтверждения изменяющихся характеристик планарного трансформатора проведены моделирования в современной системе автоматизированного проектирования (САПР) ANSYS и программной среде FEMM. В статье также обнаружены закономерности изменения магнитных характеристик трансформатора в зависимости от расположения сердечников относительно друг друга</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>the use of planar products in modern power supply modules is a trend of world leaders in the field of power electronics. The reasons for the transition from traditional winding products are in the structural and technological decisions taken during the development and design of planar devices. For example, a properly executed transformer determines the efficiency and high efficiency of any switching power supply. A transformer in a planar design, at first glance, eliminates the occurrence of problems during the assembly operation, due to the simplicity of the design. However, problems may arise at other stages of production: module testing, testing at different temperature modes and other operations where the electrical parameters of the product are determined. In this article, the causes of the problems of mismatch of electrical characteristics are identified, the analysis of the probability of undesirable losses with unfavorable results of module assembly is carried out. By modeling complex objects like a transformer, it is possible to determine potential risks during the operation of the product, as well as to predict the behavior of the entire functional part of the power supply module. Therefore, in order to confirm the changing characteristics of the planar transformer, simulations were carried out in the modern ANSYS automated design system (CAD) and FEMM software environment. The article also reveals patterns of changes in the magnetic characteristics of the transformer depending on the location of the cores relative to each other</jats:p>",

Modern approaches to managing the commercial activities of companies define key performance indicators (KPIs) as a system of indicators that assess the degree of achievement of certain business objectives. Our study of the commercial activity of AZAL \"Flight Training Centre\" shows that the system of key performance indicators is not used to assess the effectiveness of commercial activity, although the sphere of ATC services requires increased attention to the construction of effective management with the possibility of assessing the results. In addition, the authors propose the use of Dupond's analysis as a tool for comprehensive assessment of the efficiency of the commercial activity of the ATC in order to identify the weaknesses of the ATC and timely development of measures to improve and increase the efficiency of its commercial activity. The purpose of this study is to develop a system of KPI indicators for a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of the management of the commercial activities of aviation training complexes, taking into account the specifics of the airline and the main areas of activity, using the tools of strategic management and marketing. Research methods - in the process of research the authors used both empirical and theoretical research methods, qualitative methods of interpretation and explanation of the characteristics of the studied economic object, methods of system analysis and decomposition. Significance of the study - the theoretical and practical results obtained can be used by ATC management as a tool for assessing and improving the efficiency of business activities. Results of the research - as a result of the research conducted on the basis of the analysis of the commercial activity of AZAL \"Flight Training Centre\" ATC, a system of key performance indicators of commercial activity in the following main areas has been developed: financial, production, customer relations and development indicators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health emergencies caused by epidemic-prone pathogens (EPPs) have increased exponentially in recent decades. Although vaccines have proven beneficial, they are unavailable for many pathogens. Furthermore, achieving timely and equitable access to vaccines against EPPs is not trivial. It requires decision-makers to capture numerous interrelated factors across temporal and spatial scales, with significant uncertainties, variability, delays, and feedback loops that give rise to dynamic and unexpected behavior. Therefore, despite progress in filling R&amp;D gaps, the path to licensure and the long-term viability of vaccines against EPPs continues to be unclear. This paper presents a quantitative system dynamics modeling framework to evaluate the long-term sustainability of vaccine supply under different vaccination strategies. Data from both literature and 50 expert interviews are used to model the supply and demand of a prototypical Ebolavirus Zaire (EBOV) vaccine. Specifically, the case study evaluates dynamics associated with proactive vaccination ahead of an outbreak of similar magnitude as the 2018–2020 epidemic in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The scenarios presented demonstrate how uncertainties (e.g., duration of vaccine-induced protection) and design criteria (e.g., priority geographies and groups, target coverage, frequency of boosters) lead to important tradeoffs across policy aims, public health outcomes, and feasibility (e.g., technical, operational, financial). With sufficient context and data, the framework provides a foundation to apply the model to a broad range of additional geographies and priority pathogens. Furthermore, the ability to identify leverage points for long-term preparedness offers directions for further research.</jats:p>"

Monthly data from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) over an 8-year period was collected and subjected to both Vector Autoregressive (VAR) Model and BVAR model for analysis.&#x0D;\nResults: The findings indicated that there is no long-run relationship between Nigerian narrow money and quasi money, but quasi money does granger cause changes in narrow money, and vice versa. This suggests a multi-directional effect between the two variables. The BVAR model consistently outperformed the VAR model in terms of higher Adjusted-R² values, indicating its stronger ability to explain the variance in the data. The BVAR model provided a more robust and accurate representation of the relationship between these variables. The model exhibited stability and the absence of heteroscedasticity in the residuals, indicating a stable relationship between the variables. The impulse response function showed an immediate impact of changes in narrow money on the overall money supply in Nigeria.&#x0D;\nConclusion: This study contributes to existing knowledge by empirically examining the relationship between Nigerian narrow money and quasi money and also concluded that there existed no co-integrating relationship between narrow money and quasi money, which has important implications for effective monetary policy strategies, particularly in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face significant challenges due to limited resources, market reach, and growing competition from larger corporations. To remain competitive, SMEs can leverage supply chain collaboration as a strategic approach to enhance operational efficiency, innovation, and market access. Supply chain collaboration involves partnerships with suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and even competitors to achieve mutual benefits. One key advantage is the ability to optimize resources and reduce costs. By collaborating with other entities, SMEs can share logistics, production, and distribution networks, which leads to reduced operational costs. Pooling resources also enables these enterprises to minimize inventory holding costs and streamline procurement processes, enhancing overall supply chain efficiency. Another important aspect of supply chain collaboration is expanded market reach. Partnering with larger distributors or retailers provides SMEs with access to broader distribution channels and new customer segments. Collaborating with established market players enables SMEs to expand their geographic footprint and increase brand visibility, thus improving competitiveness in a crowded marketplace. Collaboration also fosters innovation and product development. SMEs can work with supply chain partners to co-develop new products, share technological advancements, and gain access to specialized expertise. This enhances the ability of SMEs to innovate and differentiate their product offerings, which is crucial for brand competitiveness in the FMCG sector. Furthermore, supply chain collaboration strengthens risk management and resilience. Joint contingency planning and collective responses to disruptions, such as supply shortages or market fluctuations, help SMEs navigate challenges more effectively. This shared approach to managing risks enables SMEs to recover faster from supply chain disruptions, ensuring business continuity and competitiveness. Supply chain collaboration is a critical tool for FMCG SMEs to boost their competitiveness. By leveraging partnerships, SMEs can reduce costs, expand market reach, foster innovation, and improve resilience, positioning themselves more effectively in a highly competitive environment.</jats:p>"

These parameters are hard to control within the desired limits by only using traditional constant-speed compressors and constant-speed supply fans. The constant-speed devices with on-off control methods consume a high rate of energy and provide unsatisfactory control, especially for indoor humidity. Therefore, variable speed compressor (VSC) technology was developed to overcome the problems of control and energy consumption. In this study tested a split-type air conditioning system with a capacity of 1 ton (12,000 BTU/hr, 3.5 KW) of refrigeration was tested using R410A as the working fluid under different operating conditions. The system consists of a VSC, an air-cooled condenser, an electronic expansion valve (EEV), and a direct expansion evaporator (DX) with a variable-speed fan. The effect of compressor speed, degree of superheating, EEV opening, and supply fan speed on system performance was considered. Through experiments, concluded several points. First of all, the highest superheat was 20 ℃ at constant compressor speed. On the other hand, the smallest superheat was 10 ℃ at constant compressor speed. The performance coefficient increases when the compressor speed decreases. The highest value of the COP is 4.71, which can be obtained at the compressor speed of 3000 rpm and DS is  20 ℃, while the lowest value of the COP is 1.74 at the compressor speed of 5000 rpm and DS is 10 ℃ because of the increasing the compressor speed leads to an increase in energy consumption and a decrease in the COP, increasing the closing of the expansion valve opening leads to an increase in DS because of a decrease in the flow rate of the refrigerant to the evaporator. Finally, refrigeration capacity and COP increase linearly with evaporator temperature and airflow velocity due to the heat exchange process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the impact of COVID-19-induced disruptions on supply chains, specifically focusing on the interconnectedness of supply chains and the transmission effects they cause. The gravity model framework, together with difference-in-differences analysis, is employed to analyze monthly trade patterns among Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, Western European countries, and other trading partner countries. The model presented accounts for the country’s roles in global value chains (GVCs) by incorporating data related to exports, imports of intermediate and capital goods, and imports of final consumption goods. CEE countries have demonstrated a certain resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, they were not immune to adverse consequences due to disrupted supply chains, primarily in the imports of intermediate and capital goods. We find that the countries that suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic the least demonstrated remarkable resilience against disrupted GVCs. The findings of our study enrich the literature on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically for the CEE region, by providing a framework for understanding the pandemic’s impact on international trade. The results show that supply shock might be greater than demand shocks on production and trade dynamics. Furthermore, our results suggest that policymakers seek adaptability to changing supply and demand patterns, while enterprises should consider broader diversification both within the region and locally.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the highly competitive Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face unique challenges in maintaining supply chain resilience. These businesses are often more vulnerable to disruptions, such as global crises, supply shortages, and shifts in consumer behavior. Integrating digital marketing strategies into supply chain management presents a solution that not only enhances resilience but also fosters growth and adaptability. Digital marketing provides SMEs with critical tools for improving visibility, engaging customers, and strengthening supply chains. E-commerce platforms, for instance, allow SMEs to diversify their sales channels, reducing reliance on traditional distribution networks. By embracing online marketplaces and direct-to-consumer models, these businesses can mitigate the risks associated with physical supply chain disruptions. This diversification also enhances their ability to reach new customer segments and expand into emerging markets. Social media marketing plays a crucial role in maintaining customer engagement during disruptions. Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook enable real-time communication with customers, providing updates on product availability, delivery timelines, and promotional offers. This strengthens customer loyalty and trust, which are essential for maintaining sales during times of uncertainty. Additionally, personalized content and targeted advertisements can help manage demand fluctuations, ensuring a balance between inventory and sales. Email marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) systems further enhance supply chain resilience by facilitating effective communication with both customers and suppliers. CRM tools allow SMEs to track customer preferences, forecast demand, and adjust marketing efforts based on real-time data. This level of agility enables SMEs to respond quickly to supply chain challenges, aligning their operations with market needs. By integrating digital marketing strategies into their operations, FMCG SMEs can achieve a more resilient, responsive, and customer-centric supply chain. The use of digital tools not only mitigates risks but also unlocks opportunities for growth in an increasingly digital world.</jats:p>"

To achieve this purpose it was modeled with a structural equation system that reflects the causal relationship between economic variables that conforms to economic theory. In particular, the rice policy analysis model constructed in this study is a ex-post policy assessment model, and the analysis of the impact of government policy changes on the rices in harvest period and lean season before the next harvest by reflecting the price formation process by period in the model is different from previous studies. As a result of the analysis, the market isolation system was found to be effective in raising the selling price of farm households in line with the government's policy purpose. However, it was found that the government's fiscal expenditure increased due to the increase in rice purchase and management cost because of the increase in inventory. Furthermore it was analyzed that the government’s fiscal expenditure efficiency was reduced as the benefit-cost ratio of market isolation implementation was all less than 1. Since 2005, the government has operated a direct payment system and the target price has existed, so there are many limitations to positively evaluate the additional market isolation system. In the future, if the government’s market isolation policy is needed due to rapid price change, it is considered that in-depth research on inventory management and release plans will be needed to increase government fiscal efficiency.</jats:p>",

I compare these primary care specialties to other specialties that did not change residency length (first difference) before and after the policy implementation (second difference) to assess how physician supply evolved in response. To examine quality outcomes, I use a set of scraped data and repeat this difference‐in‐differences identification strategy for complaints resulting in censure against physicians in Ontario. I find declines in the number of primary care providers by 5% for up to 9 years after the policy change. These changes are particularly pronounced in new graduates and younger physicians, suggesting that the policy change dissuaded these physicians from entering primary care residencies. I find no impacts on quality of physicians as measured by public censure of physicians. This suggests that extending primary care training caused declines in physician supply without improvement in the quality of these physicians. This has implications for current plans to extend residency training programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This review paper examines the technological advancements in food supply chain management, drawing a comparative analysis between the United States (USA) and Africa. The global food supply chain plays a critical role in ensuring the efficient and effective distribution of food products from producers to consumers. In recent years, technological innovations have revolutionized various aspects of the food supply chain, impacting areas such as production, distribution, traceability, and sustainability. The paper begins by providing an overview of the key technological trends in food supply chain management, encompassing the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and data analytics. These innovations have the potential to enhance transparency, reduce waste, improve traceability, and optimize overall supply chain efficiency. A comparative analysis is then conducted, focusing on the disparities and similarities in the adoption and implementation of these technologies between the USA and Africa. The USA, as a technologically advanced region, has witnessed extensive integration of cutting-edge technologies in its food supply chain. This includes the utilization of IoT sensors for real-time monitoring, blockchain for transparent and secure transactions, and AI for predictive analytics and demand forecasting. In contrast, Africa, characterized by a diverse range of economies and infrastructural challenges, faces unique opportunities and obstacles in embracing advanced technologies in its food supply chain. The review explores initiatives and case studies that highlight the successful integration of technology in various African countries, shedding light on the potential for leapfrogging certain stages of traditional supply chain development. The discussion encompasses the role of government policies, private sector involvement, and international collaborations in shaping the technological landscape of food supply chain management in both regions. Furthermore, attention is given to the social and economic implications of technological advancements, emphasizing the need for inclusive approaches that address the specific needs of diverse communities. This review provides valuable insights into the current state of technological advancements in food supply chain management, offering a comparative perspective between the USA and Africa. By understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by each region, stakeholders can develop targeted strategies to enhance the resilience, sustainability, and inclusivity of global food supply chains in the face of evolving technological landscapes.</jats:p>"

Nowadays, distributed energy resources, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery energy storage systems (BESS), are being implemented in educational campus to save and manage its energy consumption. Additionally, electric vehicles (EV) are becoming more popular as they are more environmentally friendly than the traditional gasoline-powered cars. This research aims to examine the cost-effectiveness, environmental and technical aspects of a microgrid system that includes grid-connected solar panels, BESS and EV supply equipment (EVSE). The study was conducted for Universiti Teknologi MARA campus Pulau Pinang. The campus microgrid models are simulated using HOMER software to explore four different of microgrid configurations. The load profiles of the buildings in the campus were gathered and used in the model to identify the optimum microgrid model. The findings show Grid-PV-BESS has the best hybrid energy system based on the weightage sum decision making approach considering multiple criteria assessments. Through this study, a sustainable hybrid energy system in the educational campus can be proposed integrating solar PV, BESS and EVs.</jats:p>",

Solid biomass is derived from natural resources such as rice husk, bagasse, palm waste (shells, empty fruit bunches, palm stems), forest/agricultural waste, and industrial waste, which can be processed into fuel forms like pellets, briquettes or charcoal. This dense biomass serves as an alternative fuel to replace coal, particularly for industrial steam boilers. This research aims to identify the challenges faced by the biomass boiler fuel supply chain for the textile industry in West Java. Ensuring a consistent and reliable biomass fuel supply poses a significant challenge for the textile industry in this region. This study assesses the root causes of the current challenges and proposes solutions related to sourcing biomass as a raw material for low-carbon steam boilers to support industrial sustainability. The research methodology encompasses desk research, qualitative and quantitative data collection, and data processing and analysis. The results reveal various strategies that can be explored to address these challenges, including diversification of biomass sources, development of supply chain infrastructure, and improvement of biomass quality.</jats:p>",

To control health risks caused by THMs several countries have established a maximum content of these chemicals in DW. THMs can be removed by granular activated carbon (GAC) and their adsorption processes have been studied by different authors. However, there are few studies on their desorption from GAC and no data are available on their desorption at a full scale. This paper summarises the results obtained in the monitoring of the adsorption and desorption processes of THMs at a full-scale DW plant considering different types and stages of GACs, as well as several types of influent waters. This research was carried out during 3 years in a full-scale advanced DW plant (6.25 m3·h−1) that can use four different pre-oxidants. An increase on THMs concentration in the outlet of the AC filters due to desorption processes were checked, although the obtained doses were always far below the established European limit (100 μg/L).</jats:p>",

This study is a quasi-experimental, interrupted time-series analysis using ARIMA models applied to 2011-2020 data. The control group consists of observed values and the experimental group consists of ARIMA-forecasted values post-RTL. Research findings indicate that RTL does not affect rice supply trends in the overall rice supply and household sector. Conversely, in the commercial and NFA sectors, RTL has been observed to significantly influence rice supply trends. This reveals the ways in which RTL altered the dynamics within these sectors, thereby impacting their respective supply trends by influencing local production, buffer stock, and importation. The actualization of RCEF, buffer stock increase, and the development of plans to enhance agricultural sustainability are recommended.</jats:p>"

In this context, this paper introduces an optimization strategy tailored to clustered factories, considering the incorporation of carbon trading and supply chain integration throughout the entire production process of each factory. First, a workshop model is established for each factory, accompanied by an energy consumption model that accounts for the strict sequencing of the production process and supply chain integration. Furthermore, energy unit models are devised for the IES and then a low-carbon and economically optimized scheduling model is outlined for the IES within the industrial park, aiming to minimize the total operational cost, including the cost of carbon trading. Finally, case studies are conducted within a paper-making industrial park located in the Zhejiang Province. Various scenarios are compared and analyzed. The numerical results underscore the model’s economic and low-carbon merits, and it offers technical support for energy conservation and emission reduction in paper-making fields.</jats:p>"

Despite a continuously increasing demand from countries across all income groups, supply constraints, COVID-19 pandemic disruptions, and other factors have slowed the pace of introduction, particularly in low-resource settings. Using a population-based forecasting methodology and leveraging the WHO’s yearly vaccine supply data collection, we updated global demand and supply projections for the HPV vaccine for the period of 2022–2031. The analysis aimed at clarifying the magnitude of the challenges to bringing in equitable access to HPV vaccines, which can hinder the achievement of the Global Strategy for the Elimination of Cervical Cancer. The results of this analysis show that the risk of HPV shortages has significantly decreased, and global supply is now, under normal circumstances, sufficient to meet global demand. In the long term, HPV supply will be more than sufficient to meet the Global Strategy’s goal of 90% of girls fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by the age of 15 years. Nonetheless, paying attention to the formulation of policies and carefully managing demand and supply will be required to ensure the long-term sustainability of the HPV vaccine program.</jats:p>"

For this application, the scheme objective is to achieve a flexible charging current to adjust the charging time of the pulse power supply. Due to the existence of switching devices in the system, the dynamic characteristics of the control system are complicated; an LADRC (Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Control) controller is constructed to regulate the charging of the converter current so as to improve the flexibility and dynamic performance of high-voltage pulse power supply. LADRC linearizes the extended state observer and links its parameters to the observer bandwidth to simplify the design of ESO. The proportional coefficient or differential coefficient is connected with the bandwidth of the controller to simplify its tuning, simplify the nonlinear function, more parameters, and complicated adjustment of the ADRC in practical application. The inner loop current regulator assembled is beneficial to the dynamic performance of the loop. The resulting double closed-loop structure improves steady-state and transient current-tracking performance. In addition, stability analysis of the proposed strategy is also performed. The proposed control approach is compared with PI. To verify the feasibility of the proposed scheme, an experimental prototype was constructed and tested to confirm the superiority of the proposed method in terms of dynamic performance.</jats:p>"

This review examines the role of customer-centric marketing in enhancing both supply chain operations and financial performance for FMCG SMEs. Customer-centric marketing focuses on aligning business strategies with consumer needs, preferences, and feedback, which directly influences supply chain efficiency through improved demand forecasting, product innovation, and streamlined logistics. The integration of customer insights into supply chain management allows SMEs to optimize inventory management, reduce overproduction, and respond more swiftly to changing consumer demands. By tailoring products and services to customer expectations, businesses can reduce supply chain costs, minimize waste, and enhance operational flexibility. This approach not only improves efficiency but also drives profitability through increased customer satisfaction, loyalty, and brand differentiation. Customer-centric strategies enable more precise targeting, resulting in better returns on marketing investments and higher conversion rates. Additionally, SMEs that focus on customer-driven innovation gain a competitive edge by offering products that meet market demands while maintaining cost-effective supply chain operations. However, challenges such as resource limitations, the complexity of aligning marketing and supply chain functions, and the fast-evolving nature of consumer behavior can hinder successful implementation. By leveraging data analytics, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and adopting incremental customer-centric practices, SMEs can overcome these obstacles. Ultimately, customer-centric marketing plays a critical role in boosting supply chain efficiency and ensuring long-term profitability for FMCG SMEs in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.</jats:p>"

In pursuit of this goal, a thorough literature review is conducted, with a specific focus on quality management within circular supply chains, placing a significant emphasis on Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies. By analyzing 126 papers spanning from 1998 to 2023, this systematic review discerns prevailing trends, identifies research gaps, and charts future avenues for investigation. These results highlight the growing academic interest in utilizing I4.0 technology to improve quality control in circular supply chains. SCQM 4.0 is thus proposed to aid in a better comprehension of Supply Chain Quality Management 4.0, which incorporates infrastructure practices rooted in various disruptive technologies and supply chain operations that link with sustainable performance with three key metrics of input management, waste handling, and preservation concentrating solely on the environmental aspect.

However, the inclusion of smallholders for Sustainable Supply Chain Development (SSCD) is a growing concern for policymakers aiming to increase the profitability of farming communities. This study investigates the efficiency and inclusiveness of farmers in the citrus supply chain at the upstream level and factors responsible for SSCD using survey data from the Punjab province of Pakistan. The study employs endogenous treatment effect and principal component analysis apart from the descriptive analysis to explore study objectives. Results indicate that large farmers with abundant resources tend to participate in MSC, whereas smallholders are more likely to be inclined to Traditional Supply Chain (TSC) networks. The study also finds that participating in MSC has a positive impact on farmers' efficiency, and factors such as off-farm income, orchard size, education level, and access to extension services significantly affect profitability. The results of the principal component analysis revealed that for SSCD, six sets of factors, such as performance and quality, risk and climate, economics and market exploitation, knowledge and information, geographic and transportation, and innovation capability, are addressable. Therefore, these results suggest that policymakers should provide training programs, agriculture extension services, improved infrastructure, and educational facilities in rural areas to help smallholders alleviate poverty by creating sustainability in the agri-food industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Amidst disruptions and uncertainties, this research examines strategies to increase the resilience of agricultural supply chains. Factors such as diversification, adoption of technology, and climate-resilient agricultural practices emerge to fortify the robustness of supply chains. These events look set to become more common, and survey results point emphatically in the direction of diversifying sources and markets. Case studies offer a model for successful strategies against an uncertain future. Recognized as a resilience enabler, technology is challenged by limited access and concerns about data security and interoperability. Precision farming and geographic information system mapping are among the climate-resilient practices that help stabilize crop production. Financial limitations, which disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises, prevent the implementation of resilience measures. Differences in regulatory standards across the regions create bottlenecks, and all policies have to be standardized while still being locally sensitive. The research argues for strategic interventions, such as financial support mechanisms and skills development programs to remove obstacles limiting resilience. These results have far-reaching potential to inform policymakers, industry participants, and researchers about how to build an integrated regulatory environment for innovation in technology..

However, the amount of TSF electrical features is weak, and traditional protection devices cannot operate effectively, so it is urgent to obtain typical characteristics of TSF. In this study, the simulation experiment is carried out for the tree-contact single-phase-to-ground fault. Firstly, the relativity between fault and characteristics like zero-sequence voltage, zero-sequence current, and differential current are analyzed theoretically. Then, the simulation experiment platform of TSF is built, and the time-varying fault characteristics are acquired. The experimental results show that the average value of the zero-sequence voltage, the amplitude of the power-frequency component of the zero-sequence current, and the amplitude of the power-frequency component of the first and end differential current can accurately reflect the fault current development trend of the single-phase contact tree fault of the conductor, and can be used as the typical characteristic quantity of TSF. The results of this study are helpful for further understanding the fault characteristics of TSF and provide theoretical support for the identification and protection design of TSF.</jats:p>"

Of particular interest here is the influence of sediment supply timing on bedload transport rate and grain size distribution, bed surface composition and channel morphology. We conducted flume experiments in a sediment feed flume with poorly sorted sediment. A symmetrical, identical stepped hydrograph was used with five different sediment feeding schemes: no feed, constant feed, rising‐limb only feed, falling‐limb only feed, and variable feed. The same sediment mass of 800 kg was fed during each experiment. Sediment transport rates ranged over five orders of magnitude regardless of feeding scheme. Clockwise hysteresis was observed for bedload transport rate and bedload grain size, that is, the transport rate was larger and coarser during the rising limb. Counterclockwise hysteresis was observed for the grain size distribution of the bed surface, that is, the bed surface was finest during the rising limb. In all experiments sediment yield during the rising was higher than during the falling limb, indicating that the rising limb is more capable to transport the supplied sediment. Our study provides insight on how timing of sediment supply influences sediment transport and bed surface during a single hydrograph, essential information for artificial sediment supply projects to restore and habilitate gravel bed streams.</jats:p>",

DMA configuration, designed to meet specific distribution pipe criteria, is carried out through the EPANET 2.2 program. This study aims to identify the decrease in NRW through the implementation of the Fix and Variable Area Demand (FAVAD) pressure management method. Due to limited resources, a priority assessment for DMA formation was performed using the Weight Sum Model (WSM) method. The analysis results show the possibility of dividing the central drinking water supply system service area into 27 DMAs, with the formation of DMA I/11 identifies as the highest priority DMA. After the DMA was established, the NRW component that decreased was water loss caused by pipe leaks, resulting in a saved amount of 15,261 m3/month.

This review explores the implementation of omnichannel strategies and their significant impact on supply chain performance and market growth for FMCG SMEs. Omnichannel strategies integrate multiple sales channels such as brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce platforms, and mobile applications to provide a seamless customer experience. This integration allows SMEs to optimize their supply chain operations, improve inventory management, and enhance responsiveness to consumer demand. This highlights how omnichannel strategies enable better demand forecasting through real-time data analytics, leading to reduced stockouts and overstock situations. By synchronizing online and offline inventory, SMEs can enhance logistics efficiency and streamline last-mile delivery, ultimately improving customer satisfaction. Additionally, the review discusses the role of customer-centric marketing within omnichannel frameworks, which fosters brand loyalty and increases market reach. Despite the advantages, the review also addresses the challenges faced by FMCG SMEs in implementing omnichannel strategies, including technology integration, resource constraints, and complexity in supply chain coordination. To overcome these hurdles, SMEs are encouraged to leverage technology solutions, collaborate with third-party logistics providers, and adopt a phased implementation approach. Ultimately, this review concludes that adopting omnichannel strategies is critical for FMCG SMEs aiming to enhance supply chain performance and drive market growth. By embracing a holistic approach to customer engagement and operational efficiency, SMEs can position themselves competitively in an increasingly dynamic marketplace.</jats:p>"

High-voltage direct current (HVDC) remote supply have better application potential in this scenario due to their low transmission losses, attracting much attention. However, existing research has problems such as ambiguous optimal power supply distance under different voltage levels and a lack of behavioral models for converters. Therefore, this paper starts from the behavior of underlying converters, analyzes the loss composition of different converters in HVDC long-distance supply, and establishes a refined model for converters by determining the mathematical relationship between converter losses and operating power. Considering the economic feasibility of power supply solutions throughout the lifecycle, a modeling method is proposed that optimizes the voltage level of converters considering the behavior of converters for different supply distances. The optimal voltage level for different supply distances is discussed, and the effectiveness of the model is verified through examples, providing valuable guidance for optimizing the voltage level in HVDC long-distance supply for 5G base stations.</jats:p>"

(2) Undertaking CSR is beneficial to the development of the power battery market, and also helps to reduce the sense of unfairness among third-party recycling companies.

To achieve the research objectives, representative factors for variables were identified and the acceptability of the study sample was evaluated utilizing the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett's test of sphere city. Regression Analysis was used to test the proposed hypotheses and to validate the conceptual model.&#x0D;\nThe results indicated that the Managerial Support (MS), Competitive Pressure (CP), Government Support (GS), Vendor Partnership (VP), Compatibility (COMPA), and Relative Advantage (RA) factors are essential in AI implementation. The beta values of all the factors, as indicated by the coefficient, are 0.939[1], 0.367, 0.240, 0.249, 0.190, and 0.161 respectively, which is a reasonable representation of their influence on SCM Performance (SCMP) and AI Implementation (AIIM). The study findings show that variables influence the decision to implement AI applications in supply chain management. Examining these variables is anticipated to have a positive impact and assist strategic planners in developing plans to use AI to support the operational requirements of the company both now and in the future. Research findings have aided companies in realizing the value of artificial intelligence, developing strategies and plans to swiftly transition to digital technology, and streamlining workflows to improve supply chain efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although numerous studies have explored key variables for forecasting crude oil prices, the role of supply chain factors has often been overlooked. In the face of global risks such as COVID-19, the Russia–Ukraine war, and the U.S.–China trade dispute, supply chain management (SCM) has evolved beyond an individual company’s concern. This research investigates the impact of a supply chain-oriented variable on the forecasting of crude oil import prices in South Korea. Our findings reveal that models incorporating the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) outperform those without it, emphasizing the importance of monitoring supply chain-related variables for stabilizing domestic prices for policy makers. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid factor-based approach that integrates time series and machine learning models to enhance the prediction performance of oil prices. This endeavor is poised to serve as a foundational step toward developing methodologically sound forecasting models for oil prices, offering valuable insights for policymakers.</jats:p>"

Research materials and methods. The reaction of 18 varieties of winter wheat to different growing conditions was studied at the Askanian State Agricultural Research Station in the village of Tavrychanka, Kherson region (46°33’12”N; 33°49’13”E; 39 m above sea level) during 2015/16–2019/20. Research was conducted under different conditions of irrigation: with irrigation and without irrigation. Analysis of the resistance of winter wheat varieties to stress was carried out using 17 indices of drought resistance. Research results and their discussion. The obtained experimental data make it possible to distinguish winter wheat varieties that significantly exceed the average variety in terms of productivity under irrigation (Yp): Maria and Shchedrist Odeska with a yield of 7.41–7.53 t/ha, in stressful conditions (Ys): Lyra Odeska – 6, 25 t/ha and the Shchedrist Odeska – 6.12 t/ha. According to the most indices (12), the Lyra Odeska variety was singled out as the most drought-resistant, the Shchedrist Odeska variety was distinguished according to eight indices, and the Rosynka variety – according to seven. The yield of wheat varieties under both moisture conditions has a high positive correlation (r = 0.832–1.000) with the indices MP, YI, STI, GMP, M1STI, M2STI, MSTI, HMP. Yield under irrigation is characterized by a high positive correlation (r = 0.715) with the TOL and SSPI indices, an average positive correlation (r = 0.542) with the SSI index, and an average negative r = (-0.499–-0.549) with the YSI, RDI and ISR indices on the other hand, there is no dependence with productivity under stress (r = -0.013–0.207). Yield under stress had a high correlation (r = 0.852) with the DI index and a moderate correlation (r = 0.420) with yield under irrigation. According to the results of the GGE biplot analysis, winter wheat varieties Kokhana, Askaniyska and Shchedrist Odeska can be characterized as moderately drought-resistant, Lyra Odeska is the most drought-resistant, Maria, Mudrist Odeska and Nyva Odeska can be classified as non-drought resistant varieties. Conclusions. Most of the indices had a high correlation with yield under both conditions, or a high or medium correlation with yield under irrigation and no correlation with yield under stress, so only one index, drought tolerance (DI), was selected. According to drought resistance indices and biplot analysis, Lyra Odeska is the most drought-resistant selected variety. The Shchedrist Odeska variety stood out according to eight indices, but according to the biplot analysis, it was characterized as medium resistance. According to seven indices, the Rosynka variety stood out, which was characterized by the smallest decrease in yield due to deterioration of moisture conditions, but also had low productivity under both conditions.</jats:p>"

However, the management and evaluation typically associated with existing DMAs primarily focus on ensuring stable water volume and pressure. Consequently, these methods do not adequately address the maintenance of water quality elements within the water supply system, such as adequately managing residual chlorine and reducing water quality complaints. This study introduced a zoning tailored explicitly for managing water quality-oriented elements, facilitating stable water quality management, and enhancing responses to water quality incidents in large-scale domestic water supply networks. A method was proposed to establish priorities for each zone, using various geographic information system (GIS)-based water quality-related structured data (such as water quality measurement data and pipe data) and unstructured data (such as water quality complaints). Comprehensive water quality management was achieved by applying machine learning techniques based on clustering analysis to derive evaluation factors. The proposed methodology was implemented in Metropolitan City A in Korea, leading to the derivation and analysis of evaluation results. This data-centric water supply network priority management area designation methodology, as presented in this study, is anticipated to serve as a valuable decision-making tool for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of water supply network operation and the overall management of water supply operators.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to solve the problem of frequent pressure fluctuations caused by fluid quantity variation in hydraulic support liquid supply systems and the pressure response lag caused by long-distance pipelines, an online updated radial basis function neural network (RBF neural network) control method was proposed for the long-distance liquid supply system. Based on the analysis of the measured pressure fluctuations of the mining face and the process of the stable pressure liquid supply system, the influencing factors of the stable pressure liquid supply flow demand were obtained. The flow set of the stable pressure liquid supply system was established and fitted in the SimulationX–Simulink co-simulation model and the online correction was carried out by using the characteristics of the repeated action of the hydraulic support. Finally, the online updating RBF neural network regulator was established to realize the pressure regulator control of the pumping station, and the experimental platform was set up for verification. The results show that this method can effectively reduce the pressure fluctuations caused by the change in the flow demand of the mining face, and can adjust the flow rate of the mining face, reduce the pressure impact, and improve the efficiency of the machine.</jats:p>"

The first comment raised by Dr. Preil motivated an examination of the training and evaluation procedures in Experiments 2, 3, and 4. The Experiments 2 and 3 were reworked to address this, allowing the seed to vary for every training iteration, resulting in refined outcomes while there was no need of reworking of Experiment 4. The second comment focused on the benchmarking strategies involving the 1‐1 policy and the order‐up‐to (OUT) policy, clarifying the distinctions between the two policies and justifying the use of the 1‐1 policy for benchmarking in Experiment 4. The implementation of the widely accepted OUT policy was explained, highlighting the meaningful rationale behind its use. These discussions aim to enhance the methodology employed by Kurian et al and strengthen the implications of the findings within the domain of supply chain ordering management.</jats:p>",

The different intensities and prevalence of nuclear abnormalities (NA) and cytoplasmic abnormalities (CA) in fish from the same reservoir habitat show that to be able to obtain an objective view of the genotoxic risk of chemicals, it is necessary to respect the different requirements of the fish for the exploitation of the food available in the biotope and to subject all representatives of piscivorous, omnivorous and benthophagous fishes in the reservoir to cytogenetic analysis. The occurrence of certain categories of erythrocyte abnormalities in diseased fish draws attention to the need to know the state of health of the fish and to employ this knowledge to exclude parasitological, viral and other infectious agents. These results are the first report of the frequencies of erythrocyte abnormalities in native fish. They should serve to check which of the categories examined could be of use in assessing the genotoxic risk in other stagnant and running aquatic ecosystems affected by anthropogenic activities.</jats:p>",

This highlights a land-use paradox between economic and environmental goals: adding warehouse capacity increases climate pollution and traffic congestion around the ports and warehouses, while there is a deficit of affordable housing and high homeless rates in port-adjacent underserved communities. This study aims to inform regional policymakers and community stakeholders about these trade-offs by identifying current and future supply of and demand for warehousing and housing in Southern California through 2040. The study uses statistical analysis and forecasting, and evaluates across numerous scenarios the environmental impact of meeting demand for both with the Community LINE Source Model. Warehousing and housing are currently projected to be in high demand across Southern California in future decades, despite short-run adjustments in the post-pandemic period of inflation and net declines in population. Using state land for warehousing creates environmental justice concerns, as the number of air pollution hotspots increases even with electrifying trucking fleets, especially when compared against low-impact affordable housing developments. However, low-income housing demand appears to be positively correlated with unemployment, suggesting that the jobs provided by warehousing development might help to ameliorate that concern.</jats:p>"

Bu bağlamda firmalar küreselleşen dünyada pazarını kaybetmemek, karlılıklarını arttırmak ve rekabet üstünlüğü sağlamak sebebiyle kıt kaynakla en çok çıktıyı hedefleyerek verimliliği arttırmak için çalışmalarını yoğunlaştırmaktadırlar. Nitekim insan gücünden finansmana, teknolojiden pazarlamaya kadar birden çok verimliliği etkileyen araç ve yöntem mevcuttur. En çok karşımıza çıkan yöntem ve araçlardan iş etüdü, hat dengeleme ile işgücü verimliliğini, üretim kapasitesini arttırmak hedeflenmektedir. İşgücü verimliliği üretim aşamasından önce, üretim aşamasında ve tüm üretim etmenlerini bir araya getirmesi ile sürece yön vermesi noktasında önemli bir gösterge aracı ve rekabet gücünü belirleyen unsur olması nedeniyle verimlilik arışında ilk ele alınan konuların başında gelmektedir. Bu makalede, otomotiv tedarik sanayinde işgücü verimliliğini arttırmaya yönelik adam-makine analizi çalışmasında, mevcut durumda şirketin rotilli kol bölümünde bulunan iki kafa hidrolik işleme ve takoz-burç yeri işleme makinelerinde bir adam bir makineye bakmaktadır.

In this paper, a Stackelberg game pricing model, which is dominated by ELV part remanufacturers and composed of remanufacturers, recyclers, and consumers, is constructed considering consumer preferences for recycling channels. The influence of different subsidy strategies on the optimal pricing, profit, and recycling volume of the reverse supply chain (RSC) of ELVs is discussed, and the effects of factors such as subsidy amount and consumer preferences on the RSC of ELVs are analyzed using numerical simulation. The results show that the increase in consumers’ online recycling preferences has a positive effect on the recycling volume and profit of the RSC of ELVs. Considering the recycling volume of the RSC, when fewer subsidies are given, more recycling volume can be generated by subsidizing remanufacturers, and, on the contrary, recycling volume will be generated by subsidizing consumers. Considering the profit of the RSC, when subsidies are given at the lower-middle level, higher profits can be earned by subsidizing remanufacturers, and, on the contrary, higher profits can be earned by subsidizing consumers.</jats:p>"

Methods: A total of 100 water samples were collected from ten sites, including the Dandan water supply station and adjacent residential neighborhoods on the right side of Mosul city between September 2021 and February 2022. Results: The results of the study revealed that the concentration of nitrate ions ranged between (0.95-3.614 mg/L). Based on the study’s results, all of the analyzed water samples fell within the international drinking water quality standards set by the World Health Organization. The concentrations of nitrate ions corresponded to low values of both chronic daily intake (CDI) and hazard quotient (HQ or QI), which ranged from 0.05162 to 0.18164 mg/kg/day and 0.03226 to 0.11357, respectively. Consequently, the hazard index (HI) for this study remained within safe limits for drinking water. The study also revealed that infants and individuals within the age group of 21 and older were the most susceptible to potential nitrate-related health risks, while the age group of 16 to 18 exhibited the lowest susceptibility to such risks. Conclusion: The study recommends the use of examined water for drinking due to its safe and healthy nitrate ion concentration. It further suggests the continuation of periodic assessments of drinking water supply stations to ensure ongoing consumer safety, as no potential health risks, including cancerous and non-cancerous risks, were identified.</jats:p>",

After adjusting for confounders, regression analysis showed linear relationships between the AAPS (β = 0.605, p = 0.006), ATR (β = 70.76, p = 0.005), CR (β = −1.4451, p &lt; 0.01), and age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of prostate cancer, while no association was observed with APS (β = 0.030, p = 0.483) or AFS (β = 0.237, p = 0.405). Subgroup analysis suggested that dietary supply indicators were associated with ASIR in middle, middle-high, and high SDI, but not in countries with low and middle-low SDI. In summary, prostate cancer rates globally correlate significantly with AAPS, ATR, and CR, but not with APS and AFS. When considering the SDI of countries, the relationship is generally more pronounced in economically advanced nations, but not evident in low and middle-low SDI countries.</jats:p>"

Bioplastics, which can be bio-based and biodegradable, are a promising solution to address the various issues, i.e. social and environmental, caused by the intense use of conventional plastics. Nevertheless, using bioplastics as a more sustainable solution in the food packaging industry is still controversial. It involves a variety of opinions, consensus, and disagreements among food supply chain actors. The present study investigated stakeholders’ viewpoints regarding the acceptance of bio-based packaging in the Italian organic food supply chain. Individual perspectives from a selected group of organic stakeholders (producers, distributors, and researchers) were captured by applying the Q methodology. Two relevant divergent views were identified, as well as consensus agreements. The study shows how Q methodology can effectively discover the most relevant viewpoints about an emerging topic.</jats:p>",

Results : There were significant differences in self-efficacy and life satisfaction depending on whether or not to receive public pensions, the type and amount of public pensions, and urban and rural areas. Elderly people receiving public pensions had higher self-efficacy and life satisfaction than those who did not receive them, and pensions with high benefits such as military tuition and faculty pensions had higher self-efficacy and life satisfaction than those who did not. In addition, residents in urban areas showed high self-efficacy and life satisfaction according to their residence in urban and rural areas. Conclusion : Korea is expected to enter an ultra-aged society in 2025, but the elderly poverty rate is the\r\nhighest among OECD countries. In this reality, public pensions are one of the most effective means of maintaining the lives of the elderly. The government needs to establish policies to maintain the public pension at an appropriate level at a time when the finances of the national pension, civil service pension, private school pension, and military pension are inevitably depleted, and each individual should secure his or her retirement life by joining the public pension and further devise private pension and other income security measures.</jats:p>",

In order to achieve proper results, two mathematical models are presented in this paper: In addition to a finite-dimensional system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) for coupled dynamic pricing, production rate, and inventory level, which properly integrates Lyapunov stability analysis of the dynamical system and simulations, there is an infinite-dimensional Partial Differential Equation (PDE) production level modeling system available. Infinite and finite-dimensional systems incorporate a dynamic pricing approach in the mathematical modeling.

The study of the level of harmonisation of the EGIB, GESUT, and BDOT500 datasets with the BDOT10k database in terms of data quality and supply was performed by analysing the conceptual models of the discussed spatial data registers. The study of the degree of harmonisation of datasets was performed by classifying the analysed object classes into one of three groups, characterising the consistency of the attribute values: full, partial, and none. Analysing the degree of harmonisation of the conceptual models in terms of spatial data quality, it was found that the possibility of feeding quality properties from the EGIB, GESUT, and BDOT500 databases into BDOT10k is limited. BDOT10k has definitely richer characteristics regarding data quality. Analysing the extent of harmonisation of conceptual models in terms of feeding the data of the BDOT10k database with data from EGIB, GESUT, and BDOT500, significant inconsistencies were found. The data supply from these databases is limited especially in terms of descriptive attributes. Acquisition of geometric axes of linear and surface objects does not pose major technical problems. Potential difficulties will arise from, among others, topological and geometrical errors, such as close proximity of vertices or different segmentation. Correcting the conceptual model of the EGiB, GESUT and BDOT500 databases in order to achieve a high degree of harmonisation with the BDOT10k model is feasible.

This study delves into the analysis of optimal marketing channels within the vegetable supply chain, with a focus on understanding the factors that influence the selection of these channels. The study used cross-sectional primary data gathered from different supply chain actors, including 120 potato growers, 20 retailers, 20 consumers, 16 commission agents, and 16 wholesalers from two districts of Punjab, namely Okara and Chinote.  This research employs a two-fold methodology. First, it involves the identification of the optimal marketing channel among five alternatives using a unique ranking technique methodology. Second, it employs regression analysis with binary endogenous treatment to discern the factors affecting the choice of marketing channels. The study sheds light on the intricacies of marketing channel decisions in the vegetable supply chain, offering insights into the preferences and considerations of stakeholders in the Okara and Chinote districts of Punjab, Pakistan. The findings of the study contribute not only to the understanding of optimal channel selection but also to the broader knowledge of the factors that influence these decisions. These insights are valuable for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers aiming to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing strategies within the agricultural sector, benefiting farming communities and the country as a whole.</jats:p>"

Data were gathered from various stakeholders across the industry, including managers, IT experts, and logistics professionals. The findings indicate that relative advantage, top management support, and competitors influence blockchain technology adoption significantly and positively. However, openness to innovation use has an insignificant effect on adoption. Government support demonstrates the strongest positive influence on blockchain adoption, whereas vendor orientation and support showed an insignificant impact. Both blockchain technology adoption and the cultural compatibility of blockchain solutions significantly enhance operational excellence, but the moderating effect of cultural compatibility of blockchain solutions shows no effect on operational excellence.

Research materials: The main sources of data for this research are documents held within the Department of Ottoman Archives of the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey Directorate of State. Upon these documents, Ottoman and Crimean chronicles of the period were examined and evaluated. Research and novelty of the research: Both the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate established harem organizations and started employing eunuchs soon after the foundation of the state. These people, who were called eunuchs or castrates and had lost their masculinity due to natural or unnatural causes, were the backbone of the harem organization. It was found that the main method for supplying eunuchs to the harem was purchasing them from specialized merchants. Both states made efforts to identify children who had lost their masculinity due to natural causes and employ them in the harem. More over, in a very rare event in Ottoman history, Gazanfer and Cafer Aghas volunteered to be castrated out of a desire to be close to the Sultan during the reign of Selim II. The Ottoman administration paid special attention to social as well as physical characteristics of the eunuchs to be employed, and, for example, preferred that they learn Turkish in the Ottoman harem, under their own supervision. It was also observed that the Crimean Khanate attached great importance to the harem organization as in the Ottoman Empire. However, it has been revealed that the institutionalization in the harem organization was underdeveloped than in the Ottoman harem and that at least some of the eunuchs were part of the khan’s entourage and moved away from the palace when the khan was dethroned. It’s also been revealed that sometimes the information in the primary sources contradicts with the documents produced by the bureaucracy of the period. It’s been determined that a special emphasis was placed on the shaping of the eunuchs with the Ottoman high culture, and those who somehow lost their manhood, even if they were Muslims, lost their individual identity and were transformed into an officer belonging to the state.</jats:p>",

Currently, treatments are applied based on standards that are not optimized for the circumstances of each drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), neither for critical events. This paper presents a methodology for the creation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) decision support system (DSS), encompassing the principal steps of the drinking water treatment processes (coagulation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection), based on reinforcement learning techniques, that provides suggestions about the most efficient treatments (coagulant and chlorine dosages) for various raw water conditions, including critical events such as heavy rain and saline intrusions. Together with the model, a retraining strategy is included so the DSS adapts itself to the specific circumstances of each different DWTP. The model has been developed and validated in a DWTP replica. Furthermore, the model has been provided to a real DWTP to obtain feedback from experienced staff. The results and evaluation of the model are promising as a first approach on a DSS for drinking water treatments suggestion, although future versions might require more water quality parameters to characterize the raw water.</jats:p>",

This study used the water quality database provided by the National Water Commission (CONAGUA). Bi-monthly monitoring was registered from 2013 to 2020 for 23 water quality parameters in 23 sampling locations in tributaries and the mainstream river. Therefore, it was necessary to apply principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data and thus identify the parameters that contribute most to the variation in the water quality. This artificial intelligence algorithm promoted the ease of clustering sampling sites with similar water quality characteristics by reducing the number of variables involved in the database. The reduction highlighted nutrients (TN and TP), parameters related to dissolved organic matter (NH3-N and TOC), and pathogens such as fecal coliforms. The similarity of sampling sites was determined through hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean distance as a measure of dissimilarity and the Ward method as a grouping method. As a result, nine clusters were obtained for the rainy and dry seasons, reducing approximately 50% of the sampling sites and generating an optimized network of 11 sampling sites.</jats:p>",

To test the developed model and hypothesis, data’s has been collected from 129 respondents from 29 footwear industries in Ethiopia. AMOS v.23 is used to test model fit with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) (χ2/df, RMSEA, CFI, GFI, RMR, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI)). Reliability analysis was carried out to test the reliability and stability of the research questionnaires. Correlation analysis was performed to test the strength and association between dependent and independent variables. And to test the developed hypothesis structural equation modelling (SEM) or paths analysis was used. The findings of the CFA result indicated that data fit the model reasonably well. The finds of correlation analysis indicated that, AM best practices have positive, strong and significant relationship with cost, time and reliability related factors of SC performance. But it has very weak and insignificant relationship with customer related factors. In addition, the findings revelled that AM best practices have negative and insignificant relationship with supplier related factors. On the other hands, the findings of SEM confirmed that the identified four AM best practices positively and significantly improve SC performance. And this study concludes that manufacturing flexibility, material utilization, environmental control and product design optimization of AM plays a vital role in improving SC performance.</jats:p>",

This evolution is transforming how organizations operate to promote sustainable and circular practices. Consequently, this research empirically investigates the capabilities of I4.0 adoption to establish a sustainable and circular supply chain. The study investigates the impact of organizational factors on the deployment of I4.0 technologies to achieve sustainability objectives. Furthermore, this approach combines empirical and qualitative analyses within a methodological framework to investigate the relationship between organizational factors, I4.0 adoption, sustainable, and circular practices. In this context, survey responses have been collected from 323 supply chain professionals in the textile sector in Morocco. Consequently, employing structural equation modeling, our results reveal a strong link between I4.0 adoption and the promotion of circular and sustainable approaches. The study finds a positive association between I4.0 adoption, technological readiness, and environmental responsiveness while highlighting the challenges posed by organizational practices on I4.0 implementation in developing countries. This research contributes to the theoretical foundations of the potential influence of I4.0 technologies, and it provides practical contributions for stakeholders to effectively embrace I4.0 technologies and thereby drive more sustainable and efficient practices.</jats:p>",

Conditional process analysis was used to analyze survey data collected from 633 Chinese subjects in a scenario‐based role‐playing experiment. Analysis of the responses demonstrates that IB SCT indirectly enhances WPP through indirect reciprocity. In addition, the stronger the costly prosocial attributes of customers, the greater the indirect effect of IB SCT on WPP. The results indicate that IB SCT can add value to firms through consumer rewards, especially for costly prosocial consumers. These research constructs provide valuable insights for operators adopting IB to help them communicate and coordinate IB resources with consumers for IB sustainability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As many economies embrace global supply systems, there is a pressing need to focus on reducing the supply chains' adverse environmental impact. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), is an alternative idea that combines supply chain effectiveness with environmental considerations. GSCM is a powerful tool for distinguishing or separating a company from its competitors, and it can have a substantial impact on the company's success strategy. It is becoming more significant for Sri Lankan SMEs as they become more attentive to corporate social responsibility and the obligation to follow the terms of eco-friendly policy. Recently, it was found that there are many issues in the area of supply chain to the balance of biodiversity specially from the Small and Medium sector enterprises in Sri Lanka. Though various researchers have highlighted the penetration of GSCM practices in large-scale manufacturing industries, the present study is aimed at exploring the awareness of green supply chain management practices in Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMEs) in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the current state of Sri Lankan Small and Medium Enterprises in the context of Green Supply Chain Management Practices (GSCMP). This research study takes a qualitative approach rather than a quantitative one. The study depends on primary data, collected through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with seven Small and Medium enterprises in North Western Province, Sri Lanka. Interviews were conducted with managers of a set of SMEs in the Sri Lankan market in an attempt to meet the main objectives of this research. All the targets are located in North Western Province, as a matter of determining the geographical coordinates of the target. This study follows a thematic analysis approach to analyze the data. Highlighted findings were such that insignificant attention from SMEs in Sri Lanka is being paid towards the environment. SMEs were found not to be willing and seriously ready to take action so as to help in reducing environmental threats. Lack of customer awareness, Lack of knowledge &amp; experience training to personnel in Green supply chain management, Lack of top-level management commitment in adopting green supply chain management, Suppliers or vendors are reluctant to adopt Green supply chain management practices, Cost of Implementation for Green supply chain management and Lack of support &amp; guidance from regulatory authorities are the main reasons for lower level adoption to the green supply chain management practices among Sri Lankan SMEs. Various suggestions were offered in this study and proposed solutions according to the identified insufficiencies.</jats:p>",

The goal of this research is to address water scarcity and adapt to reduced rainfall by investigating the soil aquifer and evaluating the efficiency of managed aquifer recharge (MAR). The Wadi Araba Basin's alluvium aquifer is particularly important and contains a groundwater divide, with water flowing towards the Red Sea to the south and the Dead Sea to the north, as determined by rigorous modelling and scenario analysis. Precipitation infiltration is an important consideration in groundwater budget modelling. This study employs 12 monitoring wells to establish an acceptable relationship between estimated and observed water levels. Furthermore, the study creates a MAR suitability map, which evaluates eight potential MAR locations in the Wadi Araba region. According to forecasted scenarios, implementing MAR in conjunction with increased precipitation recharge has the potential to ameliorate the consequences of decreased rainfall in the model region. The plan aims to raise the water table in three areas by 1.96–3.12%, providing realistic solutions to enhance water availability and adapt to climate change.</jats:p>",

While the literature on sustainable agri-mechanisation (with an emphasis on Conservation Agriculture-based Sustainable Intensification) has focused on the potential impact on farmer livelihoods, there has been a significant gap in understanding the supply constraints that limit the availability of machinery for smallholders. Using a novel qualitative thematic coding approach based on machinery owner experiences, this study aims to fill this gap, highlighting issues around the inclusiveness of current approaches to encourage machinery services provision and the economic viability of doing so. The findings of this study are not only informative but also have practical implications for future work. To address key constraints, we identify five focus areas for future research, alongside the need to explore with communities their preferred methods to access machinery. In doing so, this work enables a more holistic understanding of the next steps to encourage widespread and equitable agri-mechanization across the EGP. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Effective supply-chain risk assessment is the basis for developing sustainable supply policies, and it has received growing attention in global oil supply system management. Dynamical modeling and data-driven modeling are two main risk assessment technologies that have been applied in crude oil supply networks. Dynamical risk modeling and data-driven risk modeling offer distinct advantages in capturing the complexities and dynamics of the system. Considering their complementary strengths, a hybrid modeling framework combining system dynamics and data-driven neural networks is proposed for risk assessment of crude oil transportation network. Specifically, the system dynamics module is to capture and interpret the underlying dynamics and mechanisms of the transportation network, while the deep neural networks module is to discover the nonlinear patterns and dependencies of risk factors from various inputs. Based on joint training, the hybrid model can ultimately develop the capability of risk prediction with a small amount of data. In addition, it can consider the dynamic nature of crude oil transportation networks to interpret the predicted results of the risk level for decision-makers to make specific risk-mitigating policies. Extensive experiments based on China’s scenario have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid model, and the results show that our model achieves higher accuracy in risk prediction compared to the current state of the art. The results also present an explanation for China’s policy change of building a resilient crude oil transportation system.</jats:p>"

This research is applied in terms of purpose and descriptive-quantitative in terms of data type. To collect information, both library and field methods were used, and in this way, the statistical population in this study is 415 employees of the green food manufacturing companies in Indonesia, such as: BOHAN Food , Asian Agri, Ardena Food and others, who were selected by Cochrane sampling method, and to measure information from a standard 19-item questionnaire in the period of 2022-2023. A five-point Likert scale was used. To analyze the data, partial least squares method and Smart-PLS software were employed. In order to fit the reliability, Cronbach’s alpha was used and its coefficient is more than 0.7 for all research constructs.  The results indicated that the performance evaluation of GSCM in the agricultural industry is significantly related to green purchasing, production, and transportation, whilst the green production is the most affecting variable. Based on the results of this research, it can be suggested to the agricultural and food companies of the studied area that, If the green supply chain is employed instead of the traditional one, the environmental performance will be maintained and the financial performance of their businesses will be improved concurrently.</jats:p>",

Terms like visibility, transparency, and traceability are used colloquially or as synonyms for one another, yet often without a proper conceptual basis. We argue that the absence of a clear understanding of SCT limits the ability of scholars and practitioners to fully understand the role played by transparency in supply chains and to study its antecedents, technologies, types, and outcomes. Therefore, transparency research is at the point where a scoping review of literature on SCT is particularly useful. Our review first provides a formal conceptualization of SCT, allowing us to identify how transparency has been understood, the building blocks of SCT, and what distinguishes SCT from other concepts. In the review, we initially identify relevant concepts underlying SCT with a view to establish a unifying and nuanced framework for SCT. Second, using that unified conceptualization as a basis, primary outcomes such as the benefits and risks of SCT are determined. Third, we systematically detect and classify future research opportunities arising from the building blocks of SCT.</jats:p>",

In such a context, Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems (AKISs) face the challenge of reconsidering their operational paradigms, redefining priorities, and designing strategies to achieve new aims. To do so, the actors participating in AKISs should develop and exploit a set of competencies known as dynamic capabilities, including the aptitude to sense the change in the external environment, the capacity to seize the opportunities that this change creates, and an ability to transform and adapt themselves to the new conditions that digitalization generates. In this study, using as examples the AKISs operating in Greece and Italy, we aimed to uncover if and how actors participating in these systems attempt and manage to deploy such capabilities. Based on a qualitative approach and drawing on data from two workshops, we discovered that seizing the opportunities sensed is a challenging task for AKIS actors. Our results also indicate that knowledge is a pivotal resource for AKISs, allowing actors to enhance their transformative capacity. However, to create a “collective” knowledge base, AKISs should ensure a functional connection between stakeholders and strengthen the roles of actors not actively engaged with the system, like public advisory organizations, universities, and technology providers.</jats:p>"

This for sure surpasses existing capacity due to which many countries are facing depletion issue or might face depletion issue in coming years. Realizing this challenge, economies all over the globe are shifting towards circular economy development in order to address the environmental sustainability issue. In Vietnam, economic activities are normally based on the principle of linear economy. However, this traditional approach not only creates shortage of natural resources but also becomes the reason of environmental destruction. Thus, the study is an attempt to find out the harmonious relationship of economic and non-economic determinants with circular economy in the presence of sustainable supply chain management as a moderator. By employing structural equation modelling, findings indicate that circular economy is the right direction as it ensures job security and bring quality education and political stability. Results also confirm that sustainable supply chain management increases the strength of positive relationship of said variables. In the light of the evidences, the paper proposes few suggestions and implications to promote the development of circular economy so that economic growth and environmental quality can be achieved at the same time.</jats:p>",

The COVID‐19 pandemic and its differential impact on different regions in the world offer an opportunity to explore these effects. We investigate the multiregional supply chain risk by focusing on credit risk measured by abnormal credit default swaps (CDS) spreads and US–China supply chain networks. Our evidence shows that local risks propagate through global supply chains to other regions. Using a matched sample, we find that abnormal CDS spreads for firms with Chinese supply chain partners increase by 12% to 13% relative to the average raw CDS spreads due to supply chain disruptions during the economic shutdown in China, and the abnormal CDS spreads decrease by 9% to 13% relative to the average raw CDS spreads when the supply chain activities resume in China. We also find that having a more global customer base can mitigate the effects of local household demand shocks. Lastly, we discover that firm size, supply chain network centrality, cash holdings, inventory, strong credit ratings, capital redeployability, and the number of segments increase resilience to global supply chain shocks, while financial leverage, operational leverage, and market competition weaken supply chain resilience. </jats:p>",

Indicators of productivity and chemical quality of oat grains were analyzed, and lodging and ryegrass inflorescences exposed on oat plants were analyzed in the field.\n \nResults and conclusion: The application of a single dose of nitrogen at the V4 stage resulted in higher grain and oat straw yields, without changes in the crude protein and crude fiber content of the grains. The combination of this nitrogen application method with a sowing density of 490 seeds m-2 increased the competitive capacity of white oat plants, reducing the number of ryegrass inflorescences.\n \nOriginality/value: This study contributes to more sustainable management practices in the use of nitrogen and the contribution of plant density in promoting competitive ability, reducing dependence on agrochemicals in ryegrass control and promoting food security and environmental protection.</jats:p>"

Evaluation of a SME manufacturing facility resulted with areas of improvement. The current manufacturing process was manually operated , for instance, from raw materials feeding into a mixing equipment to finished goods packaging, suppliers of raw materials being manually notified and customers placing orders on a manual ordering system. Proposal of a semi-automated manufacturing process was initiated as an improvement of the current traditional process by consideration of design principles and introduction of components such as flow control valves, stock level sensor/detector, conveyor belt, automated guided vehicle and SAP system and LOGON system. Integration of systems that adds to Enterprise Resource Planning were also recommended which can further improve the supply chain network. Simulation and modelling of the traditional manufacturing process and the proposed process of manufacturing that was improved were conducted by making use of Arena simulation software version 16.0. The outcome indicated an improvement potential of higher material input and material outputs at maintained processing efficiencies. It was concluded that the adoption of the proposed manufacturing process improvement can assist in improving the supply chain from raw material acquisition to product availability to customers.</jats:p>",

When looking at the business relations between micro-enterprises and retailers, the authors identify a problem in the form of purchasing policies of retailers that contradict the legislative intention of the Act on the Prohibition of Unfair Trading Practices in the Food Supply Chain and the Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the same subject. The paper aims to point out to the legislators that their approach to the issue has not led to the economic sustainability of the vulnerable links in the food supply chain, i.e., the supply side companies, as the problem has mostly been diverted to unfair prices. The authors point out the undue rigidity of the legislation concerning market competition in prohibited vertical agreements and the undue flexibility in price intelligence. In addition, this paper points out that unfair purchasing policies may constitute inflationary pressures not yet recognized by macroeconomic theory. The limitation of the paper stems from the likely generalization based on inductive inferences based on a case study.

This study aims to measure the resilience of supply chains (SCs) considering the characteristics of the network under which they operate. In this study, we proposed a new common set of weights (CSW) model in data envelopment analysis to evaluate the resilience of SCNs. Many external variables beyond decision-makers’ direct control impact SC operations and their resilience. Therefore, the proposed CSW model formulates the non-discretionary and non-controllable inputs in measuring the resilience of SCNs and provides a complete ranking with a higher discrimination power. To improve SCRes, SC managers are recommended to enhance the clustering coefficient and node degree of their SCN by establishing more connections with other SCNs in order to pinpoint the essential capabilities that companies should prioritise in order to develop a stronger and more adaptable SC in the post-COVID-19 pandemic.</jats:p>",

Global food crises and malnutrition issues arise from several factors including population growth, uncontrolled conversion of rice fields, shifting consumption patterns, and climate change. Therefore, efforts to maintain and increase domestic rice production have become crucial to reduce potential food vulnerabilities and dependence on other countries for food. This study aims to analyze the dynamics of domestic rice sufficiency in the Banyumas Regency, analyze key related variables, and formulate policies to maintain it. The research methods used were visual image interpretation, building dynamic models, and conducting prospective analysis using the MICMAC method. The results show that domestic rice sufficiency is decreasing, resulting in a widening gap between the population’s rice needs and the domestic rice supply. The domestic rice supply in the study area can meet the rice needs of the local population by 2025, and in 2026, a deficit will begin to occur. Policies that can be implemented include increasing the planting index, improving rice productivity, food diversification, and implementing regulations to protect the rice fields. Critical variables in its implementation include the Regent’s Regulation on Rice Field Protection, detailed spatial information on rice fields, irrigation water availability, and the active role of farmer groups.</jats:p>",

This study analyzes the impact of housing supply through redevelopment projects, especially on apartment resale prices in the vicinity and provides insights for relevant policy development. Accordingly, the Heukseok 3 redevelopment area was selected as the target site, and apartment complexes within 500 m, 1 km, and 1.5 km of the target site were established as the treatment group, control group 1, and control group 2, respectively, with a total of 10,300 cases in 14 apartment complexes. The analysis used the difference-in-differences method and multilevel modeling. The results obtained at various stages of the project implementation indicated that the prices of the surrounding apartments decreased during the association establishment and completion approval stages, whereas price increases were observed during the project design and property management and disposal planning phases. Moreover, the extent of price increases and decreases varied with distance from the Heukseok 3 zone oriented to the policy. Through this study, we confirmed the impact of housing supply through redevelopment projects in neighboring areas. These findings can serve as valuable evidence for future housing policy development.</jats:p>",

Previous research on agricultural products supply chain finance rarely incorporated the operational level of commercial banks. To fill this gap, this paper transforms the operational problem of the agricultural product supply chain finance of commercial banks into a matching problem between the agricultural product supply chain finance model and customers under the constraint of serviceability. First, a matching model of “mode-capability-customer” of agricultural products supply chain finance is constructed based on the theory of bilateral matching; second, a measurement index system of matching degree and satisfaction is constructed, where matching degree and satisfaction are calculated; finally, the optimal matching model is studied. This paper proposes a model that matches agricultural supply chain finance with customer satisfaction, considering bank serviceability constraints. It improves the implementation of agricultural product supply chain finance by commercial banks. The study uses surveys and evaluations to assess stakeholder satisfaction and preferences. An operational research model optimizes the matching process between supply chain finance models and recipients, ensuring suitability. The paper provides a theoretical basis for rural financial services and practical recommendations for commercial bank supply chain finance, with valuable real-world applications.</jats:p>"

This research aims to improve the income of farmers based on changing roles through strategies using system dynamic modeling. The impacts observed are the number of labors based on a proxy of government revenue and GDP, labor income, and benefits obtained. Scenarios to improve the income of farmers projected over the next 10 years are selling FFB to Farmer’s Cooperatives that own palm oil mill(s) and other palm oil mill(s). Each scenario has 3 sub-scenarios: Business as Usual, Optimist and Environment. With the addition of new plantations of 5.7-7% per year, CPO yields of 20%, and using the palm oil mill of 30 tons/hour owned by Farmers Cooperative, the income of farmers can be improved. Recommendations to attract more farmers to become members of Farmer’s Cooperatives include funding for implementing Good Agricultural Practices, buying FFB from Cooperative members at transparent prices based on mutual agreements, and providing assistant workers for farmers.</jats:p>",

Using game theory and optimization theory, this paper studies the green investment decision in a two-echelon agricultural supply chain composed of a risk-averse farmer and a risk-neutral retailer under different power structures including three kinds of decentralized decision making and three kinds of cooperative decision making and conducts the supply chain coordination based on generalized Nash bargaining model. The results show that under decentralized decision making, Nash vertical, farmer-led, and retailer-led maximizes green investment level, the expected utility of farmer and retailer, respectively. In addition, the cooperative decision increases the marginal revenue, sales price, and the expected utility of the retailer and decreases the expectations of farmers. Except for retailer-led cooperative decisions, all cooperative decisions have increased the level of green investment and wholesale prices; among the six decision models, the green investment level is negatively correlated with risk aversion, while it is positively correlated with the cost-sharing contract. The optimal cost-sharing ratio is positively correlated with risk aversion and bargaining power. The cost-sharing contracts are invalid when farmers have full bargaining power. Numerical analysis shows that a cost-sharing contract with equal bargaining power can achieve perfect coordination in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An approach is presented to employ two different types of converters in bridgeless configuration for supply side power factor enhancement of the system. The isolated single‐stage electric vehicle battery charger uses two different converters in a bridgeless configuration to extract the advantages of both converters for supply‐side power factor enhancement. For the negative and positive semi‐cycles of the supply voltage, the power factor‐enhanced asymmetrical alternating current–direct current converter utilises a fourth order single‐ended primary‐inductor converter and a second order buck‐boost converter, respectively. The use of single‐ended primary‐inductor converter and buck‐boost converter in bridgeless configuration reduces the net order of the system with respect to conventional bridgeless‐single‐ended primary‐inductor converter schemes. The buck‐boost converter also needs the supply‐side filter to eradicate the unwanted harmonics in the supply current which increases the order of the system. The usage of both converters presents many benefits like input inductance of the single‐ended primary‐inductor converter can be utilised as a filtering element with a capacitor for the buck‐boost converter. The anti‐parallel diode conduction operation of both switches facilitates the elimination of extra reverse feed diodes (generally used in bridgeless schemes). The single‐stage charger itself comes with the benefit of elimination of extra stages and thus the losses associated with it. The presented charger also witnesses the elimination of the rectifier due to usage of bridgeless configuration. The isolated single‐stage electric vehicle battery charger is also garnished with electrical isolation which adds to the safety standard of the system. To attain power factor enhancement, the asymmetrical alternating current–direct current converter functions in discontinuous current conduction mode in the present work. The elimination of extra‐stages (with respect to two stage charger), a filter, a rectifier, two extra reverse‐feeding diodes, one voltage sensor, one current sensor (with respect to continuous current conduction mode), and electrical isolation not only makes the system compact and safer but also makes the system cheaper. Elaborated mathematical modelling and stability analysis of the presented alternating current–direct current converter using a pole‐zero map and bode plot have been included in the article. The prototype and MATLAB/Simulink model of isolated single‐stage electric vehicle battery charger system with discontinuous current conduction mode control has been built and results of both prototype and MATLAB/Simulink are deployed to verify isolated single‐stage electric vehicle battery charger system's performance during dynamic and steady‐state conditions.</jats:p>",

However, one of the most important gaps in this area is the lack of strategic attention to the issue of green management among human resources and in the strategic and operational plans of the organization, which can play a significant role in the environmental performance and organizational sustainability of this organization. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of integrated green supply chain and human resource managements for sustainable development of companies. This research is based on structural equation model and on the questionnaires’ and statistical approach. The statistical community was made up of industrial companies (145 IT companies of Indonesia) and the statistical sample was considered based on Morgan’s table. The main factors of the proposed method as the hypothesis are as Green transformational leadership, Green shopping, Customer environmental cooperation, Reverse Logistics, Internal environmental management, Environmental orientation, Green human resources, Green product, innovation, Green process innovation, environmental function, Green innovation, Green supply chain management. At the first stage their validity and reliability was tested based on confirmatory factor analysis in the SPSS software. The interaction of the variables were investigated and it was founded that the integrated green supply chain by human resources can be effective in sustainable development and Green shopping, Green human resources and Green process innovation demonstrated most effective variables in the process. The outcomes of the current study can be employed to improve the sustainable performance of industrial companies regarding the environment and performance.</jats:p>",

It is assumed that Manufacturers producing similar goods experience very high random demand; hence, safety stock of raw materials is held in reserve in their warehouses. The vendor supplying this raw material (principal ingredients) as a policy restricts shipments to multiples of full truck load. Thus, it is necessary to take replenishment decision and coordinate delivery among these manufacturers. To solve this problem, we modeled the single vendor, single manufacturer version of the problem (AlDurgam et al., 2017) using simulation optimization techniques, which was validated numerically using parameters and results from AlDurgam et al. (2017). The simulation model was modified systematically to relax the single manufacturer assumption under two distribution policies namely, joint reorder point and vendor managed inventory. These policies were evidently modeled with stringent conditions in literature. A numerical example was provided to compare the performances of the two proposed policies, and the VMI policy was found to performed better in terms of financial savings. Lastly, we investigate the robustness of the famous continuous review (Q, R) inventory policy which is widely used in the mathematical modeling of this problem, against the common cycle assumption. The coefficient of variation is thus suggested as a judgment criterion of when to embrace simulation modeling ahead of other modeling techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article deals with studying the state of providing heat supply services. The quality indica-tors of centralized heat supply services have been categorized. The evaluation of the quality of cen-tralized heat supply services hinges on principal benchmarks such as punctuality in starting and fin-ishing the heating season, uninterrupted service provision, and adherence to current regulations. Having analysed the heat energy supply, its pricing was divided into two components – condi-tionally permanent and conditionally variable. Such division allows us to mitigate the adverse effects of the seasonality of this housing and communal services category. It's noteworthy that this tariff formation developed with the 'cost plus' method (which also includes heat energy losses), is assumed imperfect according to European standards. It provides only a minimal level of profitability, which neither fosters equipment development nor encourages cost savings nor motivates employees.  The study on the quality of heat supply services revealed that the assessment was primarily based on the minimum technical requirements and consumer relations. The article states that the principal challenge in providing high-quality heat supply services is the lack of competition in this sector. Heat supply enterprises do not have enough incentives to enhance their efficiency and seek opportunities for implementing investment programmes to ensure a more cost-effective service sup-ply. To improve quality and resolve current issues the authors propose to adopt non-conventional measures, to investigate changes in the quality of heat supply services and how they are evaluated by consumers, to inform the regulatory housing and communal services authorities and local self-government bodies about the existing problems of heat supply services and their quality so that they can make effective management decisions. For the purpose of enhancing the quality of heat supply services, it has been recommended to use monitoring based on the integrated quality index calculation. This index comprises elements such as commercial service quality, service reliability, service accessibility, and technical quality.</jats:p>",

In addition, the CVaR decision models for supply chain finance under two scenarios of partial credit guarantee and blockchain technology empowerment are constructed. The inverse solving is conducted with the help of the Stackelberg model to find out the optimal ordering quantity, wholesale price, and interest rate. The influencing factors of decision making are investigated. This study shows that, within a certain risk‐averse range, the ordering quantity of retailers under the partial credit guarantee model is larger than that under the blockchain technology‐enabled model. In contrast, the conditional risk value of suppliers under the partial credit guarantee model is much smaller than that under the blockchain technology‐enabled model. In conclusion, the blockchain technology is beneficial to reduce supply chain finance risks.</jats:p>",

Modeling of cell surface carbonate chemistry indicated that diffusive CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply to the cell surface was greatly reduced in large diatoms at higher photosynthetic rates. Laboratory experiments demonstrated a trend of an increasing requirement for eCA with increasing photosynthetic rate that was most pronounced in the larger species, supporting the findings of the cellular modeling. Microelectrode measurements of cell surface pH and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> demonstrated that individual cells exhibited an increased contribution of eCA to photosynthesis at higher irradiances.

Episodic mixing events characteristic of WBC systems can temporarily alleviate nutrient scarcity by vertically entraining deep nutrients into surface waters. However, our understanding of these nutrient fluxes is lacking because they are spatio‐temporally limited, and once they enter the sunlit layer, the nutrients are rapidly consumed by phytoplankton. Here, we use a novel application of nitrate Δ(15–18), the difference between the nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of nitrate, to characterize three (sub)mesoscale events of upward nitrate supply across the Agulhas Current in winter: (1) mixing at the edges of an anticyclonic eddy, (2) inshore upwelling associated with a submesoscale meander of the Agulhas Current, and (3) overturning at the edge of the current core driven by submesoscale instabilities. All three events manifest as upward injections of high‐Δ(15–18) nitrate into the thermocline and surface where nitrate Δ(15–18) is otherwise low; these entrainment events are not always apparent in the other co‐collected data. The dynamics driving the nitrate supply events are common to all WBCs, implying that nutrient entrainment facilitated by WBCs is quantitatively significant and supports productivity in otherwise oligotrophic subtropical surface waters. A future rise in energy across WBC systems may increase these nutrient fluxes, partly offsetting the predicted stratification‐induced decrease in subtropical ocean fertility.</jats:p>",

The molecules of structured water are not scattered randomly, but are connected to each other in a single structure. Negatively charged structured water has a biostimulating effect on fish, which manifests itself in increasing survival, fertilization of eggs, accelerating the growth rate of juveniles, reducing the load of pathogenic microflora on the body of aquatic organisms. The cultivation of sturgeons was carried out at the optimal water temperature for their growth – 22 °C, the oxygen content did not exceed 8.0 mg/l. Special attention was paid to pH due to its shift towards the alkaline reaction of the medium in water with negative (lowering) values of the redox potential (RP). During experiments on sturgeons, the positive effect of water with negative RP on the body of Russian sturgeon × Lena sturgeon (RS × LS) hybrids was established, which manifested itself in an increase in fish-breeding and biological indicators of cultivation. The absolute increase in individuals kept in water with controlled RP was 26% higher compared to the control. The average daily growth rate was also higher in individuals of the experimental group, it was 0.72%. It was noted that when fish were kept in water with electrochemically regulated RP, an improvement in hematological parameters was observed (hemoglobin – 73.3 g/l, total protein – 22.7 g/l), as well as a decrease in the rate of erythrocyte sedimentation to 2.5 mm/h, which indicates a favorable effect of structured water on the physiological state of aquaculture facilities.</jats:p>",

To enhance the efficiency of utilizing water and land resources comprehensively and the rationality of the joint allocation of these resources, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the eco-economic system of water and land resources, encompassing six key aspects: system emergy flow, water resources subsystem, land resources subsystem, economic subsystem, ecological subsystem, and social subsystem. By considering three types of land use (construction land, agricultural land, and unused land), we constructed a sustainable evaluation index system for the eco-economic system of water and land resources based on the emergy theory. We employ the emergy theory analysis method to provide a comprehensive assessment of the sustainable development status and development trend of the Luoyang City from 2011 to 2020. The results show that Luoyang belongs to the consumer economy and the development of water and soil resources of the ecological economic system in Luoyang is in a critical state of unsustainable and mild sustainability from 2011 to 2020.</jats:p>",

The problems include lack of traceability and transparency, scalability and cost issues, sustainability, efficiency, patchwork logistics, and bullwhip effect issues. In this paper, we have suggested some solutions with the help of blockchain technology. The solutions can solve multiple significant issues in supply chain management. Our blockchain-based solutions can provide a secure and visible record of all transactions and data along the supply chain, which can improve traceability and transparency, a decentralized and efficient method of data processing and exchange that can also increase scalability and reduce cost, a transparent and accountable way to track and verify sustainability-related data. Our method can enable more streamlined and automated tracking and data sharing, helping to reduce the risk of delays and inefficiencies while mitigating the risk of the bullwhip effect by providing real-time visibility and enabling better communication and collaboration between parties. The paper discusses the implications and challenges of implementing blockchain in supply chain management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Companies have increasingly used supply chain financing instead of bank financing when engaging with financially constrained suppliers. We investigate the effectiveness of different financing mechanisms at supporting supply chain responsibility. We consider a decentralized supply chain where a buyer sources from a financially constrained supplier who borrows from either a bank or the buyer to finance his production. The buyer audits the supplier for responsibility compliance and will refuse to accept and pay for the order if the supplier fails the audit. We find that under conventional bank financing, the bank is concerned with the supplier's audit failure and will raise the interest rate. This not only hinders the supplier's compliance effort but also hurts the profitability of every stakeholder. In contrast, under buyer financing, the buyer may offer the supplier a low interest rate to motivate him to be more compliant when the supplier's collateral is of low value. However, if the supplier's collateral is of high value, the buyer may be tempted to set a high interest rate to exploit the supplier—leading to a reduction in supplier's compliance and supply chain profitability. Thus, we conclude that buyer (bank) financing is more preferable for encouraging responsibility when the supplier has low (high) collateral. Our findings suggest that buyer financing may not always be an effective approach for encouraging supply chain responsibility. As such, we propose an alternative mechanism under which the buyer offers a reward to the supplier if he passes the audit while the supplier continues to borrow from a bank. We prove that this combination of bank financing and buyer reward always improves the compliance level and in most cases increases the total supply chain profit. It is even more effective than buyer financing in encouraging responsibility especially when the supplier's collateral is of low value. </jats:p>",

Phosphate fertilizers, derived from rock phosphate, are characterized by the presence of potentially toxic elements, such as Zn, Co, Pb, Ni, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Cu, which are dispersed in the form of solid dust-like materials from the pipes of the factory. This study aimed to investigate the effects of airborne industrial emissions on the chemical and biochemical compositions of cotton grown in the immediate vicinity of a fertilizer factory in Uzbekistan. The composition of airborne dust deposited on the plants, the chemical composition of the cotton leaves before and after washing, as well as that of above- and below-ground plant organs, and their protein contents were determined. The concentrations of macro- and microelements in the leaves and roots were determined using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The fluorine contents in the leaves and in the roots were determined using a fluorine-selective electrode. The radius of dispersion of industrial emissions in the air was best described by measuring the fluorine contents in washed and unwashed cotton leaves. The relationships among P, K, Mg, Ca, S, F, and Mn in plant roots and leaves as a function of distance from the pollutant source were analyzed. Based on the fluorine contents in washed and unwashed cotton leaves, the two following zones of technogenic pollution were distinguished: the zone &lt; 5 km from the factory, with high technogenic pollution, and the zone &gt; 5 km from the factory, with moderate technogenic pollution. It was found that the resistance of cotton to air pollution from industrial emissions is determined by the ability of cotton plants to neutralize toxic compounds by increasing the influx of alkaline earth metals into the affected tissues. This study showed the possibility of growing cotton at a distance of &gt;5 km from the fertilizer factory. It is strongly recommended to analyze the chemical composition of plants located in a highly polluted zone only after the dust particles have been washed off of the plant’s surface. Despite the resilience of cotton to industrial pollution, the monitoring of areas identified as pollution zones is recommended.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a chain portrait framework of the SSC based on a resource perspective, which comprehensively depicts the threat model and threat surface indicator system of the SSC. The portrait model includes an SSC threat model and an SSC threat indicator matrix. The threat model has 3 levels and 32 dimensions and is based on a generative artificial intelligence model. The threat indicator matrix is constructed using the Attack Net model comprising 14-dimensional attack strategies and 113-dimensional attack techniques. The proposed portrait model’s effectiveness is verified through existing SSC security events, domain experts, and event visualization based on security analysis models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>.</jats:bold> Within the framework of ensuring the country's energy security and pursuing a policy of decarbonization of the economy in the Republic of Belarus, it is assumed to maximize the use of its own fuel and energy resources (TER). However, the question of choosing the type of heat source in centralized heat supply  systems when using local fuels (LF) remains open.  The commissioning of the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant and the relatively high unit cost of power generation capacities running on LF inclines the scales to use boiler houses as heat sources. Based on the world experience in the development and application of heating as the most energy-efficient solution in the field of heat supply, this problem has been studied in the conditions of Belarus. It is shown that the electric capacity of mini-thermal power plants using traditional LF connected to the unified system of the country is less than 100 MW, and the main technologies implemented at mini-thermal power plants using LF in the Republic of Belarus are traditional steam power plants with water steam as the working fluid (11 power plants) and steam power plant with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) (3 power plants). Geographically, mini- thermal power plants operating on LF are located evenly throughout the entire territory of the Republic of Belarus. The number of hours of use of the installed capacity of renewable energy sources (RES) of the Republic of Belarus has been determined. Energy sources based on organic waste and biomass (over 4,000 hours per year) and on hydro resources (about 3,500 hours per year) have a clear advantage, for which indicator of the number of hours of installed capacity use is much higher than for solar and wind power installations. In addition, biomass generating capacities have the lowest coefficient of electricity supply to the combined  energy system. Based on the analysis of modern trends in the development of energy, technical and economic “attractiveness factors” for the construction of heating systems for heat supply on LF in the conditions of Belarus have been formulated, which, in addition to traditional factors (substitution of imported fuel – natural gas and oil), include improvement of the quality and reliability of energy supply to consumers in remote locations, development of polygeneration, reduction of losses  of electric energy for its transport, participation in covering the electric load schedule of the unified power system, and also indicated the possibility of creating an energy hub on the basis of a mini-thermal power plant, structured for the integration  of energy sub-sectors, distributed generation sources and the option of generating “green” energy carriers.</jats:p>"

In this study, the water needs and potential for rainwater harvesting (RWH) in the Kysylsu River Basin are estimated at different altitudes. The mean annual net rainfall depth varied from 545 to 900 mm. With an average roof area of 550 m2, 211 m3 to 344 m3 rainwater can be harvested for dry and wet years respectively. Based on the estimated water demand and rainfall deficit, the average household need was estimated to be 100 m3. For a low-cost water storage solution, we tested different types of waterproof materials to replace smaller 12-18 m3 concrete tanks commonly used in the region. Soil pits lined with 0.3 mm double layer polyethene (0.6 mm in total) was the best solution for 5 m3 volume tanks in terms of the costs and durability and 0.8 mm double layer polyethene (1.6 mm in total) was ideal for sealing 10 m3 volume tanks.

Promptly addressing these water quality problems during the supply process is crucial, as delays can swiftly escalate health risks for residents and cause economic damage to the region. Therefore, developing control techniques is imperative to minimize the rapid dissemination of accidents. This study aims to proactively identify and calculate the spread pattern of water quality incidents within the pipe network, utilizing residence time as a critical factor. A practical and efficient spread control zoning methodology was proposed to curtail the expansion of accidents. Applying the proposed methodology to the pipe network system in Cty A (Korea) involved quantitative analysis of newly defined areas based on the target residence time intended for practical management and control during water quality accidents. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the proposed method offers the potential to establish a novel concept of a response area for rapid reactions to water quality incidents. This facilitates the design of a zone centered around valves essential for crisis response, thereby creating an area with precise control over the spread of water quality accidents within a target response time.</jats:p>",

According to the study findings, the combination of F4 fertilizer with TI yielded the best results in terms of reproductive traits, resulting in an average of 18.66 fruits and a total fruit weight of 1,229.5 g. In the case of CWI, the highest number of fruits and their combined weight were observed at the F3 fertilizer level, with 13.42 fruits and 846.3 g, respectively. The study also revealed that TI with soil texture S1 produced the highest average yield for all growth traits, while CWI with the lighter soil texture S3 exhibited superior results in vegetative and reproductive growth traits. The maximum fruit weight (1,460.26 g) was achieved using TI and S1F4, and the highest fruit weight (995.57 g) was obtained from S3F3 when using CWI.</jats:p>",

As these two principles suggest, in order to apply these principles, consumption and production of taxable services must be clearly distinguished in terms of their behavior and place. However, with the changes in the industrial environment, IT-enabled services have emerged, making it difficult to distinguish between the production (provision) and consumption (use) of services, and it is sometimes difficult to specify the production (provision) and consumption (use) places.\r\nIn the supreme court decision 2018du39621 dated July 29, 2022(hereinafter “the Decision”), the Supreme Court judged the place of supply of service based on the place where the important and essential part of the service was performed, not on the VAT tax principle or the VAT Act, for IT-enabled services supplied across borders. However, it was found that this judgment was problematic and began this study.\r\nIn this paper, it was reviewed the taxing right and the place of supply of service under the VAT Act from an academic and legal perspective, analyzed the precedents in which the controversy over the place of supply of service  was an issue, and confirmed that the Supreme Court's position has generally been to judge the place of supply of service as the place where it is consumed. It was also suggested that the Korean VAT Act be amended in the direction of specifying the general principle of the place of supply of services in the law text, and establishing exceptions for each type of service in subordinate legislation, as in the VAT Acts of Germany, the United Kingdom, and the Consumption Tax Act of Japan.\r\nThis study will be an opportunity to establish new criteria for the place of supply by considering the characteristics of IT-enabled services, and that it will be helpful for the future improvement of the VAT Act.</jats:p>",

The study found an increase in the total volume of drugs dispensed, the financial volume of expenditures on pharmaceutical care for diabetics with DM2 and costs per patient per year. A significant increase in the number of DM2 patients during the study period is shown. The analysis of prescriptions of oral medicines revealed the continuing trends of predominance of sugar-lowering therapy in medical organizations of the Republic of traditional approaches.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper considers a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer who wholesales new products through the traditional retail channel and distributes remanufactured products via a direct (online) channel established by himself. Two dynamical Stackelberg game models are developed based on the assumption that the retailer is an adaptive player, and the manufacturer is a bounded rational player who may adopt a delay decision. The existence and locally asymptotic stability of the Nash equilibrium are examined. Moreover, the impacts of key parameters on the complexity characteristics of the models and the performance of chain members are studied by numerical simulation. The results reveal that the excessively fast price adjustment speeds of the manufacturer, the larger consumers’ discount perception for the remanufactured products, and the consumers’ preference for the direct channel have a strong destabilizing effect on the Nash equilibrium’s stability. Furthermore, the delay decision implemented by the manufacturer could be a stabilizing or destabilizing factor for the system. The manufacturer will tolerate a considerable profit reduction while the retailer gains more profits when the dual-channel CLSC system enters periodic cycles and chaotic motions. </jats:p>",

In the modern world, planning for the sustainable development of countries at the state level should take into account the economic-geographical position (abbr. – EGP) of the territories, which determines the nature of the organization of their heat supply, which is of particular relevance for mountainous areas. Materials and methods. The starting point of the study was an analysis of the structure of the sustainable development goals (abbr. SDGs), among which five SDGs were selected, interconnected with each other and with the EGP (SDGs 7, 3, 9, 11, 13). To compile the materials, statistics on the countries of the post-Soviet space of the World Energy portal were used. Two main types of energy economy of countries were identified, meeting the needs for heat supply, which are largely determined by the EPG of the territories. Results. It is shown that the organization of heat supply to territories needs to be improved in the context of SDG 7 “Affordable and clean energy”, so the question arises about strategic planning of its scenarios. Based on the results of the study, five scenarios were proposed for selection aimed at the sustainable development of territories: centralized heat supply, the use of traditional decentralized sources, the transition to the use of electricity, the development of renewable energy sources and the transition to nuclear energy. Discussion. In the mountainous areas of the countries studied, the use of one of the proposed scenarios is not possible; a combined scenario for organizing heat supply is required. The authors propose to use an approach based on the method of hierarchy analysis, on the basis of which provisions are formulated for its application in order to plan the sustainable development of mountain areas. Conclusion. Based on the results of the work, conclusions were drawn that reflect the stages of the research, which are based on a scientific and practical approach to the formation and selection of scenarios for organizing heat supply to mountainous areas. Areas of promising practice-oriented research include studying the possibilities of using renewable energy sources (including solar and wind power plants), which are currently little used in heat supply to mountainous areas.</jats:p>",

Understanding the delayed response of local streamflow response to remote reservoir operations is crucial for effective water management and flood control. In this work, we utilize historical hydrological data and statistical analysis techniques to investigate the time-lagged response of streamflow in the LYR to water regulation by the Xiaolangdi Reservoir. The results demonstrate that there is a time lag of 1.98 days, 2.86 days, and 3.93 days between the record of water regulation at Xiaolangdi Reservoir and the arrival time at Gaocun, Aishan, and Lijin stations, respectively. Time lag correction is proven to be crucial when establishing the relationship between the daily streamflows in the LYR and those at Xiaolangdi station. Further analysis reveals that the travel distance of streamflow is the dominant factor determining the lag time, with a time lag coefficient of 0.57 days per hundred kilometers. It is expected that the findings in this study could offer a fundamental basis for decision-makers in water resource management.</jats:p>"

To optimize temperature scheduling and energy planning, building energy managements need reliable building thermal models and efficient estimation methods to accurately estimate space heating and cooling supply (or power demand) over a certain period (e.g., 24 h). This accurate estimation capability is vital for performing temperature control strategies. Therefore, the present study used resistor-capacitor (RC) models and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) integrated with nonlinear least square (NLS) to develop a method for precisely estimating heating and cooling supply to control zone temperature. To evaluate the capability of the method, two case studies are conducted. The first case study involves a made-up simple RC model, while the second case study uses monitored data from a single detached house in different scenarios. The capability of the method is evaluated by applying the estimated heating and cooling supply to the RC thermal model and simulated zone temperatures. Then, assess whether the controlled zone’s temperature meets the expected temperature or not. The performance evaluation shows that the developed method can accurately estimate the heating and cooling supply, validating its applicability to temperature control objectives.</jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Practical Application</jats:title><jats:p>This research provides a valuable contribution to modern building industry professionals by offering a precise method for estimating heating and cooling supply for temperature control in buildings.

Existing location methods either only detect PB areas or are only applied to relatively simple pipe networks. Thus, it is necessary to develop a PB localization method that can both accurately locate the PB and be used for complex pipe networks. Accordingly, in this study, a complex experimental pipe network with a high-frequency SCADA was built, and PB events were constructed under different conditions. After they were analyzed, the water pressure and flow anomalous features of the PBs were summarized. According to the propagation laws and damping theories of transient flow (TF), a PB localization method, that is, the TF simulation (TFS) method, was first proposed and developed after a TF model of the experimental pipe network was established. Using this method, two PB events were recognized, the burst pipes were identified, and the PBs were accurately located. Compared with the negative pressure wave method, the TFS method exhibits a higher location accuracy and a wider applicability to pipe networks. Through error analyses, it is shown that the TFS method has small errors. To reduce cost, the sampling frequency was decreased to 50 Hz, that is, the minimum required sampling frequency for this study, and under this condition, PB localization was successfully realized. An additional three PB localizations illustrate that they have acceptable errors and that the TFS method has good repeatability. </jats:p>",

Consequently, in the support of food cold chain systems, physical quality and logistics information quality have improved during the distribution and logistics processes. Therefore, there is a need for distribution and logistics companies to derive and examine service quality factors that impact relationship maintenance and performance in the supply chain management process with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry during the Fourth Industrial Revolution era. This study aims to identify the cold chain service quality factors of third-party logistics (3PL) companies based on expert in-depth interviews and a three-dimensional service quality model. Additionally, it seeks to understand the influence of relationship orientation in Korean food SMEs on supply chain performance. To achieve this, a systematic survey was conducted through preliminary investigations, distributing structured questionnaires, and collecting a total of 240 responses, excluding 9 unreliable responses, for empirical analysis. The collected survey data were analyzed using SPSS version 28.0 for frequency analysis to understand the general characteristics of respondents. Furthermore, Smart PLS version 4.0 was employed to test the internal consistency reliability, concentration, and discriminant validity of the measurement model. After evaluating the structural model, hypotheses were verified. The results of the analysis indicate that all three-dimensional service quality factors of cold chain services provided by 3PL companies (data processing expertise, digital-based customer responsiveness, and smart logistics information accuracy) positively influence relationship orientation. Additionally, the relationship orientation of food SMEs toward 3PL companies was confirmed to have a positive impact on supply chain performance. Therefore, the significance of this study lies in providing service quality factors for distribution and logistics companies to maintain relationships with food SMEs in South Korea and confirming the causal relationships affecting supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The article provides an overview of the world's current trends in renewable energy, as well as the formation of areas that should be focused on when reforming the energy sector. The long-term energy policy of the state should be focused on the effective integration of RES into the power supply system. To this end, it is necessary to stimulate and control the implementation of distributed power generation management systems, virtual power plants, and energy storage systems.

Problem: Efficiency and uniformity in gas mixing for Power-to-Gas applications are influenced by pressure varia- tions and supply configurations. Objective: To assess the impact of pressure variations and supply configurations on the efficiency of the Venturi mixing process, utilizing indicators such as the Z-factor and the coefficient of variation (CoV). Methodology: Numerical simulations were conducted for four mixer configurations. For CO2/H2 mixtures, pressures of 1 bar (case i) and 4 bars (case ii) were considered; for CH4/H2 mixtures, pressures of 3 bars (case i) and 35 bars (case ii) were studied. Results: As the inlet gas pressure increases, uniformity decreases for both mixtures. Horizontal H2 feeding improves CO2/H2 uniformity, while vertical feeding benefits CH4/H2 mixing. The mixer reduces CoV by an average of 80% for CO2/H2. For CH4/H2 mixtures at 3 bars, there is a 60% reduction, but at 35 bars, coefficients increase by 56%. Conclusion: Pressure and supply configuration significantly influence the mixing process, underscoring the impor- tance of considering these factors in Power-to-Gas applications. Originality: The study explores the Venturi mixing process in specific gas mixtures for Power-to-Gas applications. Limitations: The studied conditions and configurations may not encompass all possible scenarios in Power-to-Gas applications.</jats:p>"

Moreover, the glucose metabolism is one of the most important processes of the metabolism. However, glucose cannot be efficiently converted into energy in cells under ischemia hypoxia conditions. In this study, a high‐energy intermediate fructose hydrogel (HIFH) is developed by the dynamic coordination between sulfhydryl‐functionalized bovine serum albumin (BSA‐SH), the high‐energy intermediate in glucose metabolism (fructose‐1,6‐bisphosphate, FBP), and copper ion (Cu<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>). This hydrogel system is injectable, self–healing, and biocompatible, which can intracellularly convert energy with high efficacy by regulating the glucose metabolism in situ. Additionally, the HIFH can greatly boost cell antioxidant capacity and increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the ischemia anoxic milieu by roughly 1.3 times, improving cell survival, proliferation and physiological functions in vitro. Furthermore, the ischemic skin tissue model is established in rats. The HIFH can speed up the healing of damaged tissue by promoting angiogenesis, lowering reactive oxygen species (ROS), and eventually expanding the healing area of the damaged tissue by roughly 1.4 times in vivo. Therefore, the HIFH can provide an impressive perspective on efficient in situ cell energy supply of damaged tissue.</jats:p>",

In this paper, adult equivalent scale (AES) variables representing the household population structure were introduced into the energy intake model to quantify the impact of population structure changes on energy intake and reveal the characteristics of energy intake changes in the life cycle of Chinese residents. It is found that the change in the population structure has a significant impact on the energy intake of urban households in China, and the elasticity is 0.446. The energy intake of Chinese elderly over the age of 60 shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, especially after the age of 65, which indicates that the aging will promote a decline in food consumption in China. The energy intake of 1–10-year-old children, 22–30 year old, and 40–45 year old women all showed a change of first a decrease and then an increase, which may be related to parents’ care for young children and women with children’s management of body size. The average household size expressed by the adult equivalent scales of energy consumption is 2.341, which is smaller than the 3.052 calculated by the population number. The conclusion indicates that the prediction of the food and nutritional demand should be adjusted according to the changes and differences in accordance with the intensification of “fewer children” and “aging”, as well as the life cycle changes in residents’ energy intake, which is conducive to the formulation of food and nutrition security policies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated containment strategies have significantly impacted the logistics of supplying sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services to adolescents and young adults (AYA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies conducted in the region indicate an increase in sexual activity, particularly among young people, during the pandemic. However, the impact of these changes on their utilization of SRH services remains unclear. This scoping review aims to synthesize the available evidence on the impact of COVID-19 on the SRH behavior and service utilization of AYA. This review focuses on examining the demand and supply of SRH for AYA during the COVID-19 lockdown period (January 2020 &amp;ndash; December 2021). Following the Arksey &amp; O&amp;rsquo;Malley (2005) procedure and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewer&amp;rsquo;s Manual (2020), the review encompasses comprehensive search strategies, analysis, and reporting of results. The search for relevant articles was conducted across various databases, including Medline Complete, Africa-Wide, SocINDEX, Academic Search Complete (all through EBSCOhost), Public Health, Social Science &amp; Sociology databases, the Middle East &amp; Africa Database (all through ProQuest), and Web of Science. Articles published between January 2020 and December 2021 were included in this review. The studies discussed in this review shed light on the discrepancies in the demand for and supply of SRH services during the COVID-19 pandemic, exposing a substantial gap in addressing the specific SRH needs of AYA. This review also examines the strategies adopted by countries in SSA to mitigate these effects. Several countries in SSA demonstrated resilience as health providers fulfilled their role, while AYA sought alternatives to mitigate the shortage in the supply chain for SRH services and commodities, often resorting to alternative medicine. The findings underscore the urgency of further research to address the risks imposed by COVID-19 on the utilization of SRH services by AYA in SSA. The evidence presented in this review can inform strategic efforts to ensure the availability and accessibility of SRH services for AYA during any unforeseen emergency or future pandemic.</jats:p>"

The proposed methodology combines a qualitative characterization of needs and goals, a social cartography, a quantitative characterization of indicators and the use of multicriteria classification for prioritizing development policies. Eight localities with sixteen small rural settlements are taken as a research unit, to apply the proposed methodology and determine the implementation level of a public policy. The results show that a set of priority policies that both meet the authorities’ objectives and the population’s needs can be defined. Moreover, a vector of priority is proposed to define the weakest items, as a guide to local government administrations to focus efforts on interventions to achieve greater impacts on the rural community development under study. Finally, via a double field validity assessment, those strategic lines are hierarchized and analyzed regarding their potential relationships, as a social system.</jats:p>"

CDI's electrode design is a key to better performance as it determines the extent of water purification. For carbon electrodes, the pore structure is an important factor influencing removal kinetics and ion storage. Herein, porous carbon nanofibers with diameters ranging from 277 to 348 nm were fabricated from blends of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and cellulose acetate (CA) through electrospinning and carbonization. Surface area and pore properties were adjusted by varying the proportions of the precursors while ensuring no adverse alteration to the products' tangible properties. Enhanced pore structure and specific surface area were evident in the blend-based carbon nanofibers. The blend ratio of 2:8 (CA:PAN) had a high specific surface area of 925.47 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.7884 cm3/g. Correspondingly, a high specific capacitance of 177.5 F/g was attained. Desalination performance was determined in batch mode using 500 mg/L NaCl solution. A salt adsorption capacity of 6.57 mg/g and charge efficiency of 0.46 was obtained for the blend that had 20% CA. The carbon nanofibers demonstrated good desalination stability when used repetitively indicating their excellent potential for practical application.</jats:p>",

To conduct a more comprehensive investigation into the erosion characteristics of the leaking jet on the soil, this study employed a custom-built soil-test system to investigate the erosive effects of leakage from the water supply pipe network on the clay roadbed above. The study considered water flow rate, leakage port size, and leakage angle as influential factors. The experimental results demonstrated that reducing the water flow rate significantly enhances the soil’s erosion resistance. There is a positive correlation between the caliber of pipe leakage, pipe diameter, and the erosion rate of the soil cavity. Under identical conditions, the erosion rate of the specimen increased consistently with an increase in the leakage port angle. The study also investigated and summarized the curve depicting the formation of soil cavities. The aforementioned findings offer valuable insights for the implementation of reinforcement measures using fine-grained cohesive soil backfill in urban water supply pipelines.</jats:p>"

These are responsible for the recycling, echelon utilization and low-carbon innovation of waste power batteries. This provides a new way for the development of reverse supply chain node enterprises and lays a theoretical foundation. In this paper, we use the backward solution method to solve the Nash equilibrium solution of the Stackelberg game. Through numerical calculation and simulation, the decision variables, profit and income of the supply chain are analyzed and the equilibrium results are compared. The experimental results indicate that the implementation of low-carbon innovative production by cascaded utilization enterprises is conducive to the growth of their profits with lower cost inputs. The impact of the initial waste power battery recycling rate on the decision variables is negative, while, for the supply chain as a whole, the profit growth of the node companies can be positive and the location of the inflection point appears to be particularly important. The sensitivity coefficient of low-carbonization levels has a positive regulatory effect on decision variables and location of all parties. The closed-loop supply chain model proposed in this study promotes the overall development of a power battery closed-loop supply chain, and also provides theoretical guidance for reasonable pricing decisions of node enterprises under the new model. Based on the results of this paper, the government can implement incentives such as subsidies, or formulate reasonable policies for the development of a power battery closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>"

The biological cleavage of methylphosphonate (MPn), which releases both phosphate and methane, is one pathway that may contribute to this paradox. Here, we explore the genomic and functional potential for oxic methane production (OMP) via MPn in Flathead Lake, a large oligotrophic freshwater lake in northwest Montana. Time series and depth profile measurements show that epilimnetic methane was persistently supersaturated despite high oxygen levels, suggesting a possible\n            <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic>\n            oxic source. Metagenomic sequencing indicated that 10% of microorganisms in the lake, many of which are related to the Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) and Actinomycetota, have the genomic capacity to cleave MPn. We experimentally demonstrated that these organisms produce methane stoichiometrically with MPn consumption across multiple years. However, methane was only produced at appreciable rates in the presence of MPn when a labile organic carbon source was added, suggesting that this process may be limited by both MPn and labile carbon supply.

We show that methane is supersaturated in a large oligotrophic lake despite the presence of oxygen. Metagenomic sequencing indicates that diverse, widespread microorganisms may contribute to the oxic production of methane through the cleavage of methylphosphonate. We experimentally demonstrate that these organisms, especially members of the genus\n              <jats:italic>Acidovorax</jats:italic>\n              , can produce methane through this process. However, appreciable rates of methane production only occurred when both methylphosphonate and labile sources of carbon were added, indicating that this process may be limited to specific niches and may not be completely responsible for methane concentrations in Flathead Lake. This work adds to our understanding of methane dynamics by describing the organisms and the rates at which they can produce methane through an oxic pathway in a representative oligotrophic lake.\n            </jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>New approaches to the preparation and processing of raw materials in the process of jet grinding are gaining more and more importance. This is due to the need to increase the efficiency of grinding and reduce the energy consumption of the equipment, increase its reliability and service life, and expand the possibility of using the jet mill in various industries. All this determines the importance of developing and implementing new approaches to two-phase flow organization in the channels of a jet mill. The goal of this work is to investigate a method for improving two-phase flow organization in the gas jet mill tracts. Numerical studies of a two-phase flow in the ejector of a jet mill showed the advisability of using an additional energy supply through the walls of the accelerating tube of the ejector to increase the efficiency of its operation. Controlling the gas flows in the mill ejector by using the energy of additional gas flows allows one to speed up the main flow at the exit of the ejector accelerating tube and form a protective layer around the tube walls to prevent their wear. The installation of a conical nozzle at the end of the accelerating tube prevents flow separation and vortex formation and provides a uniform velocity distribution at the ejector exit. The paper presents new solutions and recommendations on improving the efficiency of two-phase flow organization in the ducts of a gas jet mill. The scientific significance of the results lies in the development of a gas-dynamic method for controlling the gas flows in the jet mill tracts, which provides a uniform acceleration of the bulk material particles and reduces mill wear. The practical significance lies in the development of recommendations on increasing the efficiency of two-phase flow organization in the gas jet mill tracts. The results may be used in mining, metal manufacture, construction, the chemical and the food industry, and agriculture, and they will be employed in further development of scientific fundamentals of gas jet mill improvement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seaborne trade, particularly containerized trade, was expected to suffer a significant decline at the outbreak of the coronavirus of the 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Due to the reason that supply chains are obliged to import various items and resources from China to meet consumer demand for commodities such as medical equipment, home office supplies, and computer equipment. As China recovered from months of trade suspension, an imbalance was developed, with the country sending around three containers for every one imported. Furthermore, the container crisis reflects a slowdown and delays in the maritime supply chain because of pandemic-related strains, such as port labor shortages, port congestion (also due to blank sailings), and capacity constraints in the truck and other inland transportation systems. Due to a lack of empty containers, backlog at ports resulted in freight prices surpassing record highs by the end of 2020 and early in 2021. The surge in freight prices was felt in various developing countries, including Africa and Latin America. As a result, shipping and container rates skyrocketed, resulting in prolonged delays for businesses, the total cost of ownership (TOC), and thus the price of commodities. Therefore, this paper emphasizes over repercussions of constraints on the whole maritime supply chain and propose measures for dealing with potential future container shortage.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this work was to establish how three different dosages of herbicide solution affect the number of microorganisms in two subtypes of garden-suitable cherno-zem of the Lipetsk region. The research was carried out in 2022-2023 in the 3-year-old cherry orchard of the agricultural processing supply and marketing consumer cooperative \"Timiryazevsky\" of the Dolgorukovsky district of the Lipetsk region. The object of the study was two subtypes of soil: leached chernozem and podzo-lized. In the garden, after row-to-row mechanical treatment, the soil surface was sprayed with a solution of the herbicide Glyphoshans Super. The concentration of the herbicide in an aqueous solution was 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0%. After 3 days, the number of microorganisms in the 0-10 cm layer was determined. The introduction of herbicides based on glyphosate with a working solution concentration of 2% into the chernozems of gardens leads to a decrease in the number of microorganisms. After 3 days, the number of bacteria is reduced by 2-2.5 times, mold fungi – by 6-115 times, the total microbial number – by 2.8-12.3 times. Of the soil microor-ganisms, mold fungi especially suffer from herbicides. As the concentration of glyphosate-based herbicide de-creases, the number of bacteria, mold fungi and the total microbial number of leached and podzolized cher-nozem decreases. The microflora of podzolized chernozem is more resistant to herbicidal load than microor-ganisms of leached chernozem.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that in regions with a high level of urbanization, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in river water is lower, and the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration is higher. Under the influence of typhoon rain events of varying intensities, the response of water quality parameters in the urban water network of Zhongshan City varies.

The system consists of multiple battery cells or modules connected in series to provide high voltage output. Additionally, low-power flyback converters are connected in series with each battery cell or module at the inputs, and their outputs are connected in parallel to provide lower voltage output. The SOC balancing algorithm ensures that the lower voltage output remains at a desired reference value by adjusting the average duty cycle of each power converter, while also balancing the rate of charge or discharge of each battery cell or module. This SOC balancing process does not affect the normal operation of the high voltage power output. In other words, the dual output (high voltage and low voltage) of the battery system can function independently, and the balancing current only flows through the low voltage power path. Experimental results from a prototype are provided and discussed to validate the proposed dual-bus battery system and controller.</jats:p>"

However, the critical success factors (CSFs) for sustainable I4.0 in operations and supply chain management (S-OSCM4.0) are unclear, and there is a lack of a holistic and empirically validated taxonomy of CSFs from multiple stakeholders' perspectives to guide organizations in this transition. Moreover, developing countries face specific challenges that require prioritizing the proper set of CSFs for sustainable digitalization. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a CSFs-based taxonomy for S-OSCM4.0 to help organizations stay current in I4.0 adoption and integrate sustainability in OSCM. We first conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 131 papers using bibliometric and content analyses and synthesized the theoretical findings into an alpha taxonomy of CSFs following an inductive approach. Then, we employed a Delphi survey technique combining fuzzy logic to solicit experts' perceptions from a developing country to analyze and validate the taxonomy and determine the most pertinent CSFs, resulting in a beta taxonomy of CSFs for S-OSCM4.0. The developed taxonomy represents a pioneering managerial artefact that can guide sustainable development through an inclusive digital transformation with less environmental impact, contributing to decision-making in S-OSCM4.0, especially for operations in developing countries.</jats:p>"

Integrated safer supply pilot programs offer pharmaceutical alternatives, coupled with comprehensive support services, to individuals using unregulated drug supply who are at high risk of overdose. We collected data from December 2020 to January 2023 on clients receiving safer opioid supply from five frontline service providers in Toronto, Canada, using interviewer-administered questionnaires. We assessed the incidence rate ratio of self-reported overdose comparing pre- and post-enrolment in the programs and examined changes in the prevalence of social and substance use outcomes post-enrolment. Forty-one participants were recruited, of whom 26 were followed up for a median of eight months (interquartile range, 5.0–11.7). The incidence rate ratio of overdose comparing post-enrolment to pre-enrolment was 0.20 (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.43). Participants reported several positive social and substance use outcomes at follow-up, including a reduction in reliance on the unregulated supply and reduced criminal activity. Future implementation of integrated safer opioid supply pilot programs with larger sample sizes and rigorous epidemiological designs could help further illustrate the potential impacts of these programs in reducing overdose rates in Canada.</jats:p>"

One hypothesis posits that a cardiac oxygen insufficiency impairs the heart’s capacity to pump sufficient oxygen to body tissues to sustain up-river swimming, especially in warm water when oxygen availability declines and cardiac and whole-animal oxygen demand increases. We tested this hypothesis by measuring cardiac and metabolic (cardiorespiratory) performance, and assessing the upper thermal tolerance of coho salmon (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus kisutch</jats:italic>) during sustained swimming and acute warming. By surgically ligating the coronary artery, which naturally accumulates arteriosclerotic lesions in migrating salmon, we partially impaired oxygen supply to the heart. Coronary ligation caused drastic cardiac impairment during swimming, even at benign temperatures, and substantially constrained cardiorespiratory performance during swimming and progressive warming compared to sham-operated control fish. Furthermore, upper thermal tolerance during swimming was markedly reduced (by 4.4 °C) following ligation. While the cardiorespiratory capacity of female salmon was generally lower at higher temperatures compared to males, upper thermal tolerance during swimming was similar between sexes within treatment groups. Cardiac oxygen supply is a crucial determinant for the migratory capacity of salmon facing climatic environmental warming.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the uncertainty of each sub-objective of the ideal solution and Pareto solution of the objective is extracted using the Degree of Membership Function. Secondly, each solution is mapped into an affiliation degree fuzzy set and the information contained in the fuzzy set is reprocessed using Fuzzy Information Entropy Theory. Finally, the amount of information contained in the ideal solution solved by the Pareto method is used to guide the evolution of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, thus avoiding the traditional multi-objective optimization process of assigning weights to solve the fitness link. This paper combines both the Fuzzy Relevance Entropy method and the Stochastic Weight method with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms to address the five-objective flow shop scheduling problem in the supply chain environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Fuzzy Relevance Entropy method effectively solves the multi-objective flow shop scheduling problem in the supply chain environment and achieves better optimization results compared to the Stochastic Weight method. </jats:p>",

To reveal the changes in baseflow in an arid area, Loss Plateau, China, we analyzed the annual, seasonal, and monthly baseflow fluctuations in 1981–1990 and 2006–2010. We discussed the effects of PET (potential evapotranspiration), precipitation, HI (humidity index), and temperature might have on baseflow in the basin. Results showed that the annual baseflow decreased significantly, and seasonal baseflow and baseflow index (BFI) were distributed differently in the four seasons. Baseflow and BFI were stable during the winter, but during May and June, baseflow was unstable while BFI remained stable. During 1981–1990, January and December exhibited a slight variation in baseflow, while January, May, and June exhibited a slight variation in BFI. From 2006 to 2015, baseflow was stable, with limited fluctuations in January, February, March, April, May, November, and December. The correlations between baseflow and PET, precipitation, HI, and temperature were neither statistically significant nor robust. Increases in PET, precipitation, HI, and temperature did not result in a corresponding increase or decrease in baseflow from the annual, seasonal, and monthly time scales.</jats:p>",

It is noted that in order to increase the efficiency of DM cart drives and increase the speed of their movement, it is necessary to develop geared motors with a high gear ratio. The most promising option seems to be the use of energy-intensive gearmotors equipped with wave transmission. The rationale for the use of highly efficient gearing is given through theoretical studies. It is indicated that today, in the design of machines of this type, wheel gears with ineffective worm gears are used, as a result of which a blocked connection and uneven peripheral wheel speeds are formed in the transmission of running systems, which leads to a decrease in efficiency. operation of gear motors. It is possible to eliminate such negative qualities of the operation of the Kuban-LK DM by equipping it with gearmotors with wave transmission. Experimental studies of the machine were carried out at Ozery JSC, Kolomensky district, Moscow region, on a prototype of an 8-bogie electrified multi-support DM “Kuban-LK1”. On four trolleys (No. 2, No. 3, No. 7 and No. 8), gear motors with wave transmission were installed on each wheel. Potatoes were watered. Agricultural background is a field planted with potatoes. The slope of the field along the water supply pipeline and in the direction of movement of the carts did not exceed ± 0.01. As a result of the research, operational indicators were obtained, presented in Table 1, which allowed us to draw the following conclusions: power consumption of the support trolley with a modernized drive when operating; two electric motors, is 300 - 370 W. Under the same conditions, a serial drive consumes 630 – 670 W. Thus, power savings occur due to increased efficiency. drive (η) from 0.5 to 0.8 and its unlocking, on average, by approximately 1.8 times.</jats:p>",

In connection with the use of ground and surface waters for water supply in Ryazan and their different proportions in the water supply system, the quality of drinking water in individual districts of the city may have special features. AIM: Comparative hygienic assessment of the qualitative composition of drinking water of the centralized water supply system in the residential districts of Ryazan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of laboratory quality control of drinking water of central water supply system for the period from 2012–2021 were analyzed according to the monitoring data of the Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology in the Ryazan Region. The calculation of the average many-year concentrations and the percentage of samples that do not meet hygienic requirements, was carried out. For statistical processing, the method of analysis of variance and Scheffe and Tamhein tests for paired comparisons were used, taking into account the results of Levene test. Statistical parameters were calculated in SPSS Statistics 19 software. RESULTS: Excess hardness of drinking water was recorded in all districts of the city, with the proportion of such samples ranging from 0.8% (Solotcha) to 74.1% (Stroitel). The average value of the total water hardness in Stroitel district was the highest, 7,554 mg-eq./l, exceeding the hygienic norm. In most districts, with the exception of Kanishchevo, Diagilevo, Zheleznodorozhny and Sovetsky, water samples (0.9–2.7%) were recorded that did not meet hygienic requirements for the content of generalized and thermotolerant coliform bacteria. The average many-year concentration of iron (2+) in the drinking water of the centralized water supply system of the village of Solotcha 2.5 times exceeded the MPC (0.3 mg/l) and was significantly higher than in the compared territories, and in 64.6% of samples its one-time concentrations did not correspond to the hygienic norm. In the territories of the districts: Dashkovo-Pesochnya, Kanishchevo, Mirny, Sovetsky and Zheleznodorozhny, the proportions of water samples with one-time concentrations of aluminum exceeding the MPC (0.2 mg/l) ranged from 1.5% (CI 95%; 0.3–8.2%) to 6.1% (CI 95%; 2.4–14.6%). One-time concentrations of boron above the MPC (0.5 mg/l) were recorded in drinking water in all districts of the city with the exception of Diaghilevo and Oktyabrsky, and ranged from 1.0% (CI 95%; 0.2–5.2%) to 1.9% (CI 95%; 0.52–6.68%). The average many-year concentration of cadmium in the drinking water of Dashkovo–Pesochnya residential area was 0.0006 mg/l and 1.9-14 times exceeded that in other districts of the city (p &lt; 0.05), while the proportion of water samples where one-time concentrations of this toxicant exceeded the MPC (0.001 mg/l) was 4.7%. Also, cadmium concentrations exceeded the hygienic standard at the control points of water supply network in Mirny (in 2.9% of samples), Sovetsky and Zheleznodorozhny districts (0.9% of samples in each). One-time concentrations of nickel most often exceeded the respective MPC (0.02 mg/l) in the drinking water of Dashkovo-Pesochnya and Solotcha residential areas making 10.9% (CI 95%; 4.7–23.0%) and 11.1% (CI 95%; 4.8–23.5%), respectively, and least often of Mirny and Moskovsky areas — 2.2% (CI 95%; 0.4–1.3%) (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The territorial features of the qualitative composition of drinking water of the centralized water supply system of the city of Ryazan are determined, consisting in higher average values of individual parameters and the percentages of samples that do not meet hygienic standards for hardness in Stroitel, Sovetsky, Zheleznodorozhny and Dashkovo-Pesochnya districts; for the content of sanitary-indicative microorganisms — in Stroitel, Dashkovo-Pesochnya, Mirny and Oktyabrsky; for the iron content (2+) — in Stroitel, Zheleznodorozhny, Oktyabrsky, Kanishchevo and Solotcha; for boron — in Stroitel; for cadmium — in Dashkovo-Pesochna and Mirny; for nickel — in Dashkovo-Pesochna and Solotcha; for lead — in Stroitel and Mirny.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Aiming at the problem of long task calculation delay of traditional edge computing offloading strategy (COS), a joint caching and COS for power supply chain services under cloud edge collaborative computing environment is proposed by introducing the master-slave game model. First, for the network of information interaction between power grid system and electrical equipment suppliers, the corresponding overall model of cloud edge collaborative network is constructed by combining cloud computing, edge computing, supplier terminal communication and remote cloud. Then, the cloud-side collaborative network model is analyzed and solved by building the service function cache model, task unloading and data transmission model and power business data calculation model, respectively. Finally, by introducing the master-slave game model, the whole system is divided into three different interests of power service providers, communication providers and communication network terminal providers and the joint caching and COS for power supply chain services is given. Through simulation experiments, the proposed computing unloading strategy and the other three methods are compared and analyzed under the same experimental conditions. The results show that the service cache hit rate of the proposed method is the highest, reaching 96.35%. Compared with the other three comparison methods, it increased by 14.96%, 11.24% and 4.85%, respectively. In addition, its task computing delay is the least affected by agent computing power and agent computing resources, and its performance is better than the other three comparison methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is considered suitable for the remediation of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated farmlands, because of its large biomass and resistance to Cd stress. The addition of nitrogen (N) fertilizer is an important measure used to increase crop yields, and it may also affect Cd accumulation in plants. To clarify the effects of different forms and concentrations of N on plant growth and Cd absorption in kenaf, a hydroponic experiment was conducted using three N forms (NH4+–N, NO3−–N and urea–N) at four concentrations (0, 2, 4 and 8 mM, 0 mM as control) under Cd stress (30 μM). The plant growth, the antioxidant enzyme activity and the Cd contents of various parts of the kenaf seedlings were measured. The results showed that the N form had the greatest impact on the growth of the kenaf and the absorption and transport of the Cd, followed by the interaction effect between the N type and the concentration. Compared to the control, the addition of N fertilizer promoted the growth of kenaf to varying degrees. Among all the treatments, the use of 2 mM of NO3−–N enhanced the biomass and Cd accumulation to the greatest extent compared to CK from 2.02 g to 4.35 g and 341.30 μg to 809.22 μg per plant, respectively. The NH4+–N significantly reduced the Cd contents of different parts but enhanced the translocation factors of Cd stem to root (TF S/R) and leaf to stem (TF L/S) by 34.29~78.57% and 45.10~72.55%, respectively. The peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) enzyme activities of the kenaf increased with the N treatments, especially with NH4+–N. Overall, applying low concentrations of NO3−–N can better promote the extraction of Cd by kenaf.</jats:p>"

Hypoxic damage to fetal brain cells still remains an unsolved problem of obstetrics and gynecology. Methods: 27 inventions were found from the beginning of the 21st century to 26.08.2023 in databases such as EAPATIS, BYPATENTS, DWPI, DEPATISnet, PATENTSCOPE, Espacenet, RUPTO, USPTO, CIPO, CNIPA, KIPRIS, PatSearch, J-PlatPat, Google Patents and TPO. Due to the small number of inventions, methodological heterogeneity, and differences in the content of their claims, a quantitative meta-analysis could not be performed. Results: Prospects for innovative obstetric care proposals aimed at improving fetal viability in hypoxia during pregnancy and delivery were analyzed. Results of the included studies were presented only qualitatively (descriptively). Conclusion: Fetal resistance to impending labor hypoxia has not been previously investigated, so values of low fetal resistance to intrauterine hypoxia are still not among the indications for the use of excess oxygen and the choice of Cesarean section to exclude stillbirth and neonatal encephalopathy. The first systematic review of published inventions shows innovative ways of assessing fetal adaptive reserves to hypoxia, oxygen and apnea administration, and selecting the optimal timing and type of delivery to prevent stillbirth and neonatal encephalopathy.</jats:p>",

During metalimnetic oxygen minimum (MOM), the reservoir is divided into four regions: surface oxygen-rich (SOR), middle anoxic (MA), middle oxygen (MO), and bottom anoxic (BA). This article focuses on the link between DOM and disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors and DO in reservoirs. The DOM in SOR was characterized by the highest proportion of protein-like components, lowest humification and aromaticity, which was indicated mainly affected by algae blooms. The DOM in MO was affected by terrestrial, with the highest ratio of humic and fulvic-like fluorescent and the highest extent of humification and aromaticity. The humification and aromaticity in MA and BA were between MO and SOR water. Moreover, according to redundancy analysis, the dominant DBPs, including trichloromethane and haloacetic acid precursors, mainly originate from a high degree of humification and aromaticity in DOM, suggesting that the terrestrial-derived DOM was a dominant source of DBP precursors. This study provides the distribution in DOM characteristics and its driven DBPs in the Sanhekou Reservoir during the MOM, which is of great significance for selecting appropriate water intake regions for subsequent water treatment.</jats:p>",

The study employed a qualitative approach. Data were collected using purposive sampling with a sample size of eight SMEs in the construction sector registered under the National Enterprise Development Authority of Sri Lanka. Using structured interviews, data were collected, and the responses were analysed using the Manual Thematic analysis procedure. The study findings states that collaboration, entrepreneurial orientation, internal integration, and outsourcing have been the main factors that have contributed to making the Sri Lankan construction supply chains resilient during Economic crisis. Therefore, it is recommended for the construction firms to focus and improve the presence of these factors in their respective supply chains, to make the supply chains more resilient. This study's significance lies in its focus on construction SMEs in Sri Lanka, offering insights from the perspective of manufacturers, which has been relatively unexplored in existing resilience related research. Although some research articles do touch upon this area, mostly these studies have been conducted in developed nations. Thus, this study contributes to the scant Sri Lankan supply chain resilience literature. Sri Lanka is making strong efforts to support its economy to combat the economic downturn and stabilize. Therefore, the findings of this paper will undoubtedly be useful for the Sri Lankan construction sector while aiding the country to flourish again. \nKeywords: Construction Industry, SMEs and Supply Chain Resilience.</jats:p>",

There are many countries, including India, whose drinking groundwater contains fluoride more than the parameters set by World Health Organization (WHO) that is 1.5 ppm. Drinking such fluoridated water repeatedly and for a long time causes dangerous fluorosis disease in people. This disease remains life-long in people and there is no permanent cure till now. Thousands of people around the world are suffering from this disease. Generally, the water of surface water sources (puddles, rivers, canals, streams, lakes, ponds, dams, reservoirs, etc.) is considered to be free of fluoride. However, according to WHO, its quantity in the water of different surface water sources has been estimated from 0.01 to 0.3 ppm. But recent studies revealed that in many of these freshwater sources, the amount of fluoride was found to be more than 1.0 ppm or 1.5 ppm. If such water is used for drinking for long time, then the health of the people gets affected and there is a possibility of getting dreaded fluorosis disease. Due to fluorosis, people’s teeth become weak and discoloured (dental fluorosis) and their diverse skeletal bones become porous, weak, and deformed (skeletal fluorosis). People also become hunchbacked (kyphosis) and lame (crippling) for life due to this disease. Many health complaints such as gastrointestinal discomforts, polydipsia, polyuria, repeated abortion, impaired reproduction and endocrines, neurological disorders, etc. are also found in people afflicted with chronic fluoride intoxication. If animals also start drinking this water for a long time, then they also get this dangerous disease. In rural areas, this water is also used for agricultural irrigation which also causes serious anomalies in diverse species of agriculture crop plants and ultimately reduces annual agricultural yield. However, before supplying drinking water to the human population from any of surface water sources, the water of these sources must be tested for evidence of fluoride. From the point of view of health, if the amount of fluoride is found to be more than the prescribed parameters, the water supply of such water sources should not be done as far as possible. The present communication highlights various potential adverse consequences in humans from drinking water from surface water sources containing fluoride above the permissible or acceptable limit or level.</jats:p>"

Questions relating to particularly rare diseases, which increasingly include ever smaller subgroups of common diseases (individualised therapies, e.g. based on certain genetic characteristics), as well as increasingly important endpoints such as Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) and Patient-Reported Experience Measures (PREMs) cannot be clarified in an RCT.

The main result is that the average number of beds per 1000 inhabitants in low complexity systems is below the average defined for Colombia and Latin America, thus requiring greater attention in implementing beds to reach the required accessibility levels. These valuations allow concluding that the accessibility of healthcare institutions requires the use of significant calculation tools, such as the E2SFCA method, which has not had great applications within the Colombian territory.</jats:p>",

The Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm was employed to solve this model owing to its excellent performance in the field of engineering majorization. Based on this model, an optimal scheduling method for CPSs was proposed and applied to the three-stage pumping station system. The results demonstrate that the optimization schemes based on the HHO algorithm can improve the operational efficiency and annual cost savings under three different pumping flow conditions by 0.16, 0.55, and 0.56%, reducing the annual operating cost by ¥22,703, ¥74,581, and ¥75,356, respectively, relative to the currently used schemes. These results are better than those obtained by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, in terms of computational time, the optimization method with the HHO algorithm can show an improvement of 8.94–29.74% compared with those of PSO and GA, verifying the feasibility and efficiency of the HHO algorithm in the optimal scheduling for CPSs. Therefore, the proposed method is effective at solving the scheduling problem of CPSs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study is to establish a methodology for the equitable distribution of loads among participants in an en-ergy community consisting of low-power renewable energy sources. This is achieved through the utilization of a modified resource allocation algorithm. The proposed approach effectively considers multiple criteria, limited initial information, and the need for flexible assignment and reprioritization of objectives and constraints. To achieve this, linguistic characteristics are employed. Furthermore, under specific conditions, the list of objective functions can be expanded to capture the diverse interests of actors in the electricity market, such as suppliers and operators. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, statistical data on the operation of renewable energy sources supplying electricity to consumers within a spe-cific region was utilized. Optimal operating modes for these sources were investigated. The focal point of this research is to develop a tool that ensures the optimal functioning of the network comprising low-power sources. To attain this, optimization criteria encompassing technical, economic, and environmental aspects were employed to derive the optimal operating modes for the renewable energy community.

For the 3D printed heart-like material, the Material Jetting AM technique was employed due to its ability to fabricate 3D printed composite parts with variable properties. Several compositions for the print-out materials were examined, and the material with the appropriate mechanical behavior compared to the actual heart, i.e. RWT-ENT A50 composite, was utilized. The 3D printing process of the physical heart-like structure was performed with the highest accuracy. Finally, the 3D printed heart-like structure was evaluated  in terms of dimensional accuracy and surface roughness achieving sufficient accuracy with mean absolute error of 1.05mm and mean surface roughness of 2.78μm.</jats:p>"
