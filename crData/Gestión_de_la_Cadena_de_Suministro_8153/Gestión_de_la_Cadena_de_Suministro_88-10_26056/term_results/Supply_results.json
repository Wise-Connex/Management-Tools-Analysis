The 1987-88 academic year survey was sent to educators from the 30 U.S. schools listed in the Petroleum Engineering and Technology Schools book published by SPE. Twenty-five of these schools offer degree programs in petroleum engineering and five offer options in petroleum engineering within another engineering degree program. Twenty-eight of the 30 schools responded to the survey.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The survey asks each school to report the number of graduates during the 1987-88 academic year at the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. levels. The number of non-citizens included in these graduates and the number seeking employment in the U.S. job market are also reported. For those graduates who have reported to their school that they have found employment, the type of employer is requested. The following six employer categories are used:</jats:p>",

It is shown that a flat-rate income tax and a general sales tax have the same incidence; if the production function is Cobb-Douglas (unit elasticity of substitution), both are borne entirely by labor income. Feldstein's finding that a proportional capital income tax is partly shifted onto labor income is shown to hold even when saving elasticities are zero. A proportional wage tax reduces after tax wage income by more than the tax, while increasing interest income, demonstrating that labor bears more than a 100% share of this tax's burden. These results are compared to the incidence results of static general equilibrium analysis. It is shown that the general equilibrium results hold in the long run only if the production elasticity of substitution is infinite. </jats:p>",

Somatomedin C, specifically measured by radioimmunoassay after separation from its binding protein, did not exhibit typical diurnal variations, in contrast to somatotropin and insulin, which increased particularly after concentrate intake. Somatomedin C markedly decreased at parturition and reached lowest values around the peak of lactation, while levels of somatotropin, nonesterified fatty acids and ketone bodies were high and those of glucose, insulin, thyroxine and triiodothyronine were low. Thereafter somatomedin C values slowly increased up to the 12th week of lactation and remained elevated. Low energy and protein balances were characterized by particularly low somatomedin C concentrations. An additional protein deficit at peak lactation, when cows were already provided with low amounts of energy, did not further decrease somatomedin C levels. However, when high amounts of energy were given in the form of starch or crystalline fat, somatomedin C increased. Overall, there was a positive correlation of somatomedin C primarily with energy, but also with protein balances and a negative correlation with milk yield. Conversely, somatotropin increased markedly after parturition and was positively correlated with milk production and negatively with protein and energy balances. Thus, somatomedin C levels were paradoxically low in the presence of high circulating somatotropin. Insulin most closely paralleled somatomedin C levels. Therefore the anabolic state of metabolism at the end of pregnancy was characterized by high somatomedin C and insulin and relatively low somatotropin, whereas the catabolic state of early lactation was characterized by high somatotropin, low somatomedin C, insulin and thyroid hormones.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Undoped and boron-doped polycrystalline silicon films were prepared on a fused quartz at 500–840 °C by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) from a SiH4+B2H6+H2 mixture, using the same fabrication system. The effects of plasma (rf power) supply on the structural and electrical properties were investigated. Below 700 °C, all films show a 〈110〉 preferential orientation (P.O.), increasing with an increase in rf power. Particularly between 650 and 700 °C, an extremely stronger 〈110〉 P.O. is found at a rf power &amp;gt;15 W. Above 730 °C, undoped LPCVD and PECVD films and boron-doped LPCVD films represent a nearly random orientation. On the other hand, for boron-doped PECVD films, a strong 〈111〉 texture is observed in the intermediate doping range. The 〈110〉 texture increasing with rf power in undoped PECVD films is interpreted as indicating enhanced nucleation at the surface in contact with the gas phase. The plasma supply also has essential effects for smoothing the surface and improving the boron-doping efficiency. The effects of plasma supply are discussed in terms of increased surface diffusion of adsorbates, sputtering effect, and a contribution of hydrogen covering the surface. PECVD films are more stable for foreign contamination after fabrication than LPCVD films.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent changes in federal support for leadership training have raised the issue of supply and demand for special education professionals with doctoral degrees. It was the purpose of this study to operationalize supply and demand in this labor market and to obtain measures of each over time. Using data from the Center for Educational Statistics as a measure of supply and counts of the frequency of position announcements in the Chronicle of Higher Education as a measure of demand, it was determined that in special education demand may soon exceed supply. This situation was considered especially serious because the measure of supply is likely to be an overestimate. In communication disorders, demand is growing, but supply has consistently exceeded demand. However, demand may be seriously underestimated because few clinical positions are advertised in the Chronicle and the number of clinical positions that require doctoral degrees in communication disorders is great. </jats:p>",
