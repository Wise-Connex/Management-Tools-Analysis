      "abstract": "<jats:p>The successful installation of sand control in four wells in the Berri field, Saudi Arabia, is discussed. A combination of underreamed openhole gravel packs, large diameter equipment, and proper field selection provided rates of over 80,000 BOPD with less than one-half ppm sand production. The paper explains the initial sand production problem and sand control in these wells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Openhole gravel-pack completions performed in four new water supply wells in the Berri field have proven successful in greatly reducing the sand content in the produced water. The wells are located on Abu Ali Island at the northern end of the Berri field, Saudi Arabia. These new supply wells, and the existing wells, provide water for the water injection program at Berri.Sand production was found rate sensitive when the first supply wells were tested at Berri with levels as high as 150 ppm at rates in excess of 80 MB/D (12 700 m3/d). This level of sand production is short-lived and the level declines to as low as 4 ppm after several hours of stabilized flow at 80 MB/D (12 700 m3/d). Ten of 19 wells require restriction orifices due to increased sand production at higher flow rates. Sand producing levels have tended to increase at constant production rates indicating an increase in sand producing characteristics with time (see Fig. 1).An extensive testing program was conducted to determine the detrimental effects of the produced sand. Originally it was believed that a sand level of 15 ppm could be tolerated through centrifugal pumps at the Berri injection plant. However, within a period of 6 months there were seal and throttle-bushing failures in the pumps due to erosion by sand. Erosion damage was noted also on the impellers and pump casings. In addition, sand was collecting in the gathering lines. It was also noted that at 100 MB/D (15 900 m3/d) the stabilized sand production tended to be above 10 ppm.Since the test data indicated that damage to the water injection plant was severe at a sand production level of 15 ppm, a level of 3 ppm was set as the acceptable upper limit. However, in spite of efforts to monitor the sand, it continued to cause or contribute to pipeline failures in three ways:erosion of the bottom of the pipe,erosion of the inhibitor film resulting in pitting, andcorrosion as a result of sand and inhibitor deposits on the bottom of the pipe.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The water injection wells required workovers to remove sand and corrosion products and stimulation treatments to repair the formation damage caused by the fill. Plans were made to install submersible pumps in these source wells when they would no longer flow at reasonable rates, however additional damage to the equipment was anticipated unless sand could be controlled downhole. Because of the problems with produced sand, the decision was made to openhole gravel pack the water source wells as a means of controlling sand. Four test wells were selected for a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of gravel packing in these high-rate conditions. The test program was also designed to evaluate the procedures and equipment used in these completions.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 2097＾</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

In this paper we show that during the recession teenage employment has been favoured relative to the employment trend of the past and that the large increases in teenage unemployment have largely arisen from the marked change in the labour force participation rate. The paper goes on to examine factors which seem to have been important in generating the changed supply response —changes in school participation rates, the increased importance of part‐time work, increases in unemployment benefits, the permissible income levels for unemployment benefit recipients, changes in wage levels and the important interactions between these various factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Soviet women have the highest labor force participation rate in the world and are crucial to the Soviet economy. This article attempts to assess whether the Soviet leadership will be able to maintain this high rate of labor force participation over the next quarter of a century.; The general approach is to make both the case for and against the potential decline in female labor force activity. Arguments favoring a decline are that: (1) women will become frustrated because they work in the lowest paying and relatively less desirable areas of the economy; (2) a high percentage of women express dissatisfaction with their jobs; (3) the work day is considered too long, especially in respect to the obligations to care for children. Part-time work is considered highly desirable; (4) women bear a disproportionate burden of child and home care responsibility with an inadequate amount of preschool facilites.; The case for maintenance of the present level offemale activity is that: (1) there is no evidence that acquisitive expectations will not accompany rising Soviet incomes; (2) there is a high correlation historically between the percentage of Soviet women who work and the level of educational attainment, and the latter is now quite high; (3) the evidence from the other industrialized nations of the world is that rising national affluence does not per se cause women to reduce their work activity; (4) declining birth rates increase the convenience of being employed.; The author concludes that the likelihood of a decline in Soviet female labor force participation is small. </jats:p>",

Econometric procedures were then employed in an analysis of sheep producers' decision making regarding the annual supplies of wool, lamb and mutton, and annual changes in the inventory levels of sheep, lambs and ewes maintained for breeding purposes. Estimates show that wool prices provide the long‐run stimulus for increases and decreases in the sheep flock while mutton and lamb prices are responsible for short‐run changes in flock composition. Substitution between sheep and beef cattle is of considerable importance although no significant substitution between sheep and cropping could be found. Seasonal conditions proved to be an important short‐run supply shifter, affecting both numbers and composition of the sheep flock.</jats:p>",

Currently, agricultural credit is supplied by three sets of institutions: (1) private firms and individuals, (2) the quasiprivate cooperative Farm Credit System, and (3) the federal public programs of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) and Small Business Administration. Statuatory authority currently limits federal programs to a residual role of lending to borrowers who cannot receive credit from the other segments. Though a large component of public programs consists of emergency loans in areas of economic disaster, the FmHA also makes farm operating and real estate loans to farmers who meet the statuatory requirements. The source of funds for some FmHA loans is federal appropriations and money market certificates. However, guaranteed loans have become an important component of FmHA programs. These loans are made in cooperation with other agricultural finance agencies. The public agency insures or guarantees repayment of the loan. The cooperating firm negotiates the loan and provides the funds. Usually the interest payment is below the current market interest rate structure.</jats:p>",

The influx of glucose into the heart of intact, living, anaesthetized rats was measured when the levels of insulin the blood were (a) low (as a result of fasting), (b) normal, and (c) high (as a result of injecting insulin). The findings showed that the transport of glucose into cardiac cells is carrier‐mediated and is strongly insulin‐independent. 2. The major barrier to the supply glucose to the heart from the circulating blood is at the surface membrane of the cardiac cells, rather than at the endothelium of the cardiac capillaries. 3. The extracellular space of the heart was measured and was found to be approximately 25% of the cardiac tissue. 4. During life, glucose, as well as its analogue, 3‐O‐methylglucose passes across the membranes of the cells of the heart by means of a transport system which is strongly dependent upon insulin and appears to be carried‐mediated. A likely explanation for the effect of insulin is that it increases considerably the affinity of the transport carrier for glucose. Saturation of the carrier takes place when the levels of insulin and of glucose in the blood are high. However, when the concentration of insulin is low, e.g. during a fast, the affinity of the carrier for glucose is reduced so that saturation cannot be demonstrated. 5. It is suggested that the low level of insulin that is found in the blood in the early morning, which is due to the night fast, may lead to the cardiac dysfunction which often develops at that time.</jats:p>",

In the continuous flow experiments, the nitrogen content of the plants increased with the increased concentration of nitrate in the seawater. In the batch culture experiments, a lag period of 3–7 days often occurred before changes in the nitrogen supply were reflected in corresponding changes in the nitrogen content of the plants. Growth rates were a linear function of tissue nitrogen which varied between 1–3% dry weight. Saturation of growth rate as a function of tissue nitrogen did not occur, although tissue nitrogen levels did saturate as a function of external nitrate supply. Juvenile <jats:italic>M. pyrifera</jats:italic> sporophytes do not appear to “store” nitrogen.
