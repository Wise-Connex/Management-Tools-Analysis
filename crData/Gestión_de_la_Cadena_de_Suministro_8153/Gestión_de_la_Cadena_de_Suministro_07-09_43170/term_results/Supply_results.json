      "abstract": "<jats:p>Singapore Customs is one of the fi rst countries in the world to implement a national supply chain security program, Secure Trade Partnership (STP). The goal is to raise the level of supply chain security by creating awareness of the importance of adopting a total supply chain approach to cargo security, with companies encouraged to play their part in securing their own processes within supply chains. It is envisaged that this would enhance the security of global supply chains and prevent disruptions to the smooth flow of goods, and in turn, raise Singapore’s profile as a secure trading hub. Certification of companies under the STP program is voluntary, however, eight companies have achieved certifi cation and others are working with Singapore Customs to enhance their existing security practices. Closer cooperation with and between countries to achieve robust supply chain security programs will facilitate the movement of goods of certified companies across international borders, and ensure the smooth and efficient flow of trade even during times of greater security risk.</jats:p>"

The aim of these controls is to seek cooperative arrangements between regulatory agencies and businesses, and to identify security risks before goods move. This paper shows the complexity of the cross-border environment, including the operational frustrations experienced by interviewed representatives at United Kingdom (UK) ports. It also maps out the institutional mechanisms between public and private sector actors shaping cross-border procedures. It is argued that current mechanisms for shaping governing rules and procedures are insufficient. Further alignment of institutions with operational requirements is required to ensure that supply chain security objectives are met.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Für die Energieversorgung autarker Sensoren und Messsysteme werden in Zukunft Mikrobrennstoffzellen an Bedeutung gewinnen, die durch einen ausreichend großen Speichervorrat einen wartungsfreien Langzeitbetrieb gewährleisten. Mit der am Fraunhofer IZM entwickelten PEM-Mikrobrennstoffzellentechnologie wird das bereits bei sehr kleinen Systemen möglich sein. Dieser Artikel geht insbesondere auf die bedarfsgerechte Erzeugung von Wasserstoff im Mikrosystem ein. Für Systeme, die ihren Energiebedarf aus dem Tageslicht mittels Solarmodulen decken können, wurde eine miniaturisierte Modultechnologie entwickelt, die es erlaubt, hocheffiziente Solarzellen zu Modulen von nur wenigen Quadratzentimeter Fläche zu verschalten. Als Zwischenspeicher für die aus der Umwelt gewonnenen Energie sind vor allem Li-Polymer-Batterien geeignet. Mithilfe der Wafer-Level-Battery-Technologie können diese Batterien direkt auf dem Substrat oder Wafer mit minimalem Volumenbedarf integriert werden.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This SiC diodes and switches provide greatly enhanced performance at higher operating\nvoltage, but the base material provides a high barrier to adoption in commercial systems. Commercial\nadoption has not occurred by adopting SiC components in place of Si devices, but only when\nthe characteristics of SiC components can successfully leverage system performance and cost. Doing\nso requires a close look at current roadblocks and examining topologies and techniques that can\nbring more optimal system performance (density, efficiency, cost) with SiC components. High density\nconverters using conventional components are becoming limited by the volume and cost of passive\ncomponents, particularly the EMI filters and bulk filter capacitors. To address this and demonstrate\nthe performance capabilities of SiC in SMPS, a PWM isolation converter is proposed using\nthe resonant reset forward converter in an interleaved configuration. This topology can extend energy\nrecovery from the primary bulk bus capacitor used for hold up time, as well as minimizing filtering\nrequirements for input and output capacitors. The interleaved converter is developed from\ncascode switches using experimental SiC JFETs, in a configuration derived from previous work\nwith a single switch converter. Overall performance as well as design issues will be discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managing security in global supply chains has been gaining increasing attention in business and governmental agendas since the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. Since then several new voluntary government-business partnership programs have emerged to enhance security in end-to-end supply chains. However, a few programs have existed for a longer time, one of them is the BASC (Business Alliance for Secure Commerce) program, active as a business alliance in Latin America since 1996, originally fighting narcotics smuggling, and later converted into a holistic supply chain security management program. Understanding the implications – costs, tradeoffs, benefits, etc. – of security management programs is a complicated task, with very limited existing literature. This paper, being the first survey of its kind, presents the results of the survey carried out with 102 BASC member companies, including: (1) the most commonly implemented security measures; (2) the most (and least) efficient security measures; (3) the relationship between the cost and effectiveness of the measures; and (4) the benefits obtained while implementing these security measures. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for governmental and company decision-makers on designing future ‘win-win’ supply chain security programs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In many industries, Internet referral services, hosted either by independent third-party infomediaries or by manufacturers, serve as digitally enabled lead generators in electronic markets, directing consumer traffic to downstream retailers in a distribution network. This reshapes the extended enterprise from the traditional network of upstream manufacturers and downstream retailers to include midstream third-party and manufacturer-owned referral services in the supply chain. We model competition between retailers in a supply chain with such digitally enabled institutions and consider their impact on the optimal contracts among the manufacturer, referral intermediary, and the retailers. Offline, retailers face a higher customer discovery cost. In return, they can engage in price discrimination based on consumer valuations. Online, they save on the discovery costs but lose the ability to identify consumer valuations. This critical trade-off drives firms' equilibrium strategies. We derive the optimal contracts for different entities in the supply chain and highlight how these contracts change with the entry of independent and manufacturer-owned referral services. The establishment of a referral service is a strategic decision by the manufacturer. It leads to diversion of supply chain profit from a third-party infomediary to the manufacturer. Further, it enables the manufacturer to respond to an infomediary, by giving itself greater flexibility in setting the unit wholesale fee to the profit-maximizing level. Both third-party and manufacturer-sponsored referral services play a critical role in enabling retailers to discriminate across consumers' different valuations. Retailers use online referral services to screen out low-valuation consumers and sell only to high-valuation consumers in the online channel. Our model thus endogenously derives a correlation between consumer valuation and online purchase behavior. Finally, we show that under some circumstances, it is too costly for the manufacturer to eliminate the referral infomediary. </jats:p>",

Since nitrogen availability can depress symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen fixation can make plant growth independent of soil nitrogen availability but is energetically costly, it is unclear how allocation patterns in nitrogen-fixing species should respond to variation in soil nitrogen availability. We examined the effect of nitrogen source and concentration on the growth and allocation patterns in the nitrogen-fixing shrub Alnus viridis subsp. crispa (Aiton) Turrill. Plants were grown with either NH<jats:sub>4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup></jats:sub>-N or NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup>-N at a range of low N concentrations, from 0 to 2 mmol·L<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, and either inoculated with Frankia or not.

Even though nodulated plants increased growth with nitrogen concentration, allocation to roots as a fraction of total biomass did not vary in these plants, suggesting increased growth resulted from more efficient nitrogen acquisition. Allocation to roots was a significant predictor of plant growth in non-nodulated plants (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.318, for linear least squares fit with log mass) but not for nodulated plants (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.108).

But it is very difficult to effectively manage the international outsourcing and supply chain mainly because their limited size and resources. International outsourcing agents emerge as a potential solution pursued by many western companies. Currently it has very limited information from both practical and theoretical aspects to understand the agents and their characteristics. This paper, based on four case studies of agents in three major industrial sectors in China, introduces business models and growth paths of the international manufacturing outsourcing agents, and establishes a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) for evaluation. The paper seeks to help western SMEs and hightech startups recognize the Chinese maturing and an ideal system for implementation, and to provide theoretical insights about the agents role and characteristics in international supply networks.</jats:p>",

The study seeks to answer one critical question: Does financial development in sub‐Saharan African countries exhibit a supply‐leading or demand‐following response? Using three proxies of financial development against real GDP per capita (a proxy for economic growth), the study finds that the direction of causality between financial development and economic growth is sensitive to the choice of measurement for financial development. In addition, the strength and clarity of the causality evidence is found to vary from country to country and over time. On balance, a demand‐following response is found to be stronger in Kenya and South Africa, whilst in Tanzania a supply‐leading response is found to be dominant. The study therefore recommends that for Kenya and South Africa the real sector of the economy should be developed further in order to sustain the development of the financial sector. However, for Tanzania, there is need for further development of the financial sector in order to make the economy more monetized.</jats:p>",

However, given the large number of water supply systems in China and the cost of implementing such a risk assessment procedure, there is a necessity to first conduct a strategic screening analysis at a national level. An integrated methodology of risk assessment and screening analysis is thus proposed to evaluate drinking water safety of a conventional water supply system. The violation probability, indicating drinking water safety, is estimated at different locations of a water supply system in terms of permanganate index, ammonia nitrogen, turbidity, residual chlorine and trihalomethanes. Critical parameters with respect to drinking water safety are then identified, based on which an index system is developed to prioritize conventional water supply systems in implementing a detailed risk assessment procedure. The evaluation results are represented as graphic check matrices for the concerned hazards in drinking water, from which the vulnerability of a conventional water supply system is characterized.</jats:p>",

Adaptive extended enterprise arrangements allow participating enterprises to leverage their combined assets for collective exploration and exploitation. In the context of extended enterprises, where significant investments have been directed toward instituting common interfaces, this study examines the question: How does the use of standard electronic business interfaces (SEBIs) enable supply chain partnerships to become more adaptive?</jats:p><jats:p>This study conceptualizes the use of SEBIs as a boundary-spanning mechanism that helps overcome boundaries that impede knowledge transfer between enterprises in supply chains. SEBIs enables partners to gain insight into their broader environments, enriching each partner's perspective (enhanced bridging). SEBIs also help strengthen the cooperative ties between partners, motivating each partner to adapt for collective gain (enhanced bonding).</jats:p><jats:p>Our research model is empirically tested using data collected from 41 demand-side supply chain partnerships (between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, and retailers) in the information technology (IT) industry. The results show that collaborative information exchange (CIE) between supply chain partners mediates the relationship between use of SEBIs and mutual adaptation (MA) and adaptive knowledge creation between supply chain partners. Interestingly, the use of SEBIs is found to be directly associated with MA but only indirectly associated with adaptive knowledge creation.</jats:p><jats:p>The study points out that the strategic impacts of SEBIs go well beyond the exchange of transaction information and process integration. It also shows that multilateral, quasi-open, and information exchange–and process linkage–oriented SEBIs can result in both bonding and bridging across supply chain partners without binding them inflexibly to specific partners. Based on the model and results, the study offers practical implications for how SEBIs should be developed, adopted, and used.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The plant basal immune system can detect broadly present microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs, also called PAMPs) and induce defenses, but adapted microbes express a suite of effector proteins that often act to suppress these defenses. Plants have evolved other receptors (R proteins) that detect these pathogen effectors and activate strong defenses. Pathogens can subsequently alter or delete their recognized effectors to avoid defense elicitation, at risk of a fitness cost associated with loss of those effectors. Significant research progress is revealing, among other things, mechanisms of MAMP perception, the host defense processes and specific host proteins that pathogen effectors target, the mechanisms of R protein activation, and the ways in which pathogen effector suites and R genes evolve. These findings carry practical ramifications for resistance durability and for future resistance engineering. The present review uses numerous questions to help clarify what we know and to identify areas that are ripe for further investigation. </jats:p>",

The concentrations of muscle glycogen and lactate were higher in the 2‐week‐occluded group, whereas staining intensity of muscle lipid droplets was lower in the 2‐week‐occluded group than those in the sham‐operated group. The percentage of type I muscle fibre decreased, whereas that of type IIb fibre increased in the 2‐week‐occluded group when compared with the sham‐operated group. Although the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor‐188 mRNA increased, the number of capillaries around the muscle fibres tended to decrease (<jats:italic>P </jats:italic>= 0.07).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold> Chronic venous occlusion causes skeletal muscle hypertrophy with fibre‐type transition towards faster types and changes in contents of muscle metabolites.</jats:p>",

This change in institutional focus is a natural outcome of changing resource conditions, in particular the high levels of water resources development achieved in many regions as well as rising economic prosperity and associated changes in environmental perception. Surprisingly, this analysis reveals that transboundary water law in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) follows these global trends even though SSA's levels of water resources development, economic prosperity, and food security are significantly lower than any other region in the world. These findings suggest that the nature of SSA's transboundary water law may be largely “handed down” from other parts of the world with different realities than those present in SSA. Recognizing this relationship can provide important lessons for improving transboundary water governance in the region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mostly fueled by mandates, adoption, and implementation of the RFID, technology in the retail industry is growing rapidly. At these early stages of adoption, one puzzling issue for retailers and suppliers is the compelling business case for RFID. In order to explore the potential business case for RFID, we conducted a case study using actual RFID data collected by a major retailer for the cases shipped by one of its major suppliers. We show the physical layout of the RFID readers on a partial supply‐chain covering product movement from distribution centers to retail stores. First, in the analysis phase, we identify several performance metrics that can be computed from the RFID readings. Next, using this RFID data, we compute the values of those performance metrics. These values represent mean time between movements at different locations. Then, we discuss how these measures can assist in improving logistical performance at a micro supply chain level of operations between a distribution center and a retail store. We present how such information can be valuable to both the retail store operator and the supplier. We also discuss the initial lessons learned from actual RFID data collected in the field, in terms of data quality issues. </jats:p>",

Merr.] varieties with low seed phytic acid will depend on the stability of the trait when grown in soils with a wide range of P availabilities and on the impact of altered P composition on seed protein and oil concentrations. Impacts of deficient (0.05 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) to excessive (0.9 to 1.2 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) levels of external P on seed P composition of normal and low phytic acid lines and of altered seed P composition on seed protein and oil synthesis were evaluated. Soybean lines homozygous recessive (<jats:italic>pha</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>pha</jats:italic>) at one of two loci with genes that condition the low seed phytic acid trait had the same greater‐than‐threefold increase in phytic acid in response to increasing external P as their normal phytic acid parent, ‘AGS Prichard‐RR’ (<jats:italic>Pha</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>Pha</jats:italic>). This supports the conclusion from previous inheritance studies that the low seed phytic acid trait in CX1834‐1‐2 is controlled by epistatic interaction between two independent recessive genes. The seed phytic acid concentration in the low phytic acid line G03PHY‐443 (derived from CX1834‐1‐2) was &lt;2 g phytic acid P kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> dry wt. when grown under deficient to excessive external P. As the P supply increased, seed inorganic P concentrations for this line increased from 0.8 to 4.0 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> dry wt., compared to an increase of 0.2 to 0.6 g kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> dry wt. for the normal phytic acid lines. Seed protein and oil concentrations did not differ significantly between normal and low phytic acid lines. These results support continued development of varieties with low seed phytic acid and high yields.</jats:p>",

This activation appeared to be largely independent from sufficient or optimal sulfate supply and from the established sulfate deficiency response.

Although the lesion has been described as richly innervated, its vascular supply has not been critically appraised to date in the pathology literature. To this end, we have undertaken a morphological study of 16 archival cases of osteoid osteoma, focusing primarily on the patterns of vascularization, utilizing traditional histological and immunohistochemical approaches. The study demonstrated that a prominent arterial and arteriolar blood supply was a constant finding within the various zones of soft tissues, skeletal muscle, and bone surrounding the nidus. It also showed that the caliber of the vessels underwent gradual attenuation throughout their centripetal course toward the nidus, where the vessels lost their muscularis as they merged into the capillary network of the nidus. Immunostaining with antibodies to neurofilament and S100 proteins revealed a pattern of innervation that was overall less exuberant than that described in some reports and that was virtually absent from the nidus. Taken together with data reported in the radiological literature, our findings lead us to wonder whether the osteoid osteoma may represent a response to the local stimulation of bony tissue by a primarily aberrant vasculature, a hypothesis that warrants further elucidation using state-of-the-art imaging approaches. </jats:p>",

The authors describe how concepts learned from published evaluations of manufacturing and service supply chains, as well as lessons learned from responses to natural disasters, naturally occurring outbreaks, and the 2001 US anthrax attacks, can be applied to design, evaluate, and improve the bioterrorism response supply chain.

Results are based largely on a 33‐year mark‐and‐recapture study in a forest fragment in northwest Ohio, USA. Behavioral plasticity in such reproductive traits as mating system and parental care allows this species to adjust quickly to changing environments. The species has a relatively “fast” life history, with rapid attainment of sexual maturity and high fecundity in the face of high mortality rates. Maximal reproductive effort early in life enables a rapid population response. Food supply, in the form of mast, determines the size of the reproducing population in early spring, which, in turn, influences the size of the late summer peak population. The peak population size is also affected by short‐term weather events possibly acting via the food supply. The effects of weather and food on population growth are in part mediated through competition, including defense of space and suppression of reproduction. The inelasticity of female territories appears to set an upper limit to population density.</jats:p>",

Two samples, one comprising the farmers and the other the agricultural workers, were randomly selected through a field survey during the 2003/2004 season. A log‐linear model of multiple regressions was fitted to the data. The results indicated that labour demand and supply depend mostly on variables related to the household characteristics and economic and non‐economic conditions.</jats:p>",

The oversampling of low birth-weight and African-American births in NMIHS provides a larger proportion of disabled children and a bigger sample of black mothers than available in data used in prior studies. The empirical analyses examined the impact of child disability on maternal employment participation and conditional intensity by race and marital status using alternative measures of disability based on occurrence of specific health conditions as well as activity performance and general development. Exogeneity of activity-based disability measures was tested using health conditions as instruments and instrumental variable models were used to estimate their impacts on maternal labor supply. The results indicated that activity-based measures are endogenous for black single and white married mothers. Model results suggested large reductions in likelihood of employment participation of black single as well as white single and married mothers. Work intensity of employed black single mothers was also substantially reduced by child disability. Overall, no consistent effects of child disability were observed for black married mothers. </jats:p>",

Here, we report the distribution of these two encoded catalytic subunits in the minor Class‐1 and predominant Class‐2 PEPC enzyme‐forms, the latter of which is a novel high‐molecular‐mass, hetero‐oligomeric complex containing <jats:italic>both</jats:italic> CrPpc1 (p109) and CrPpc2 (p131) polypeptides. The Class‐1 enzyme, however, is a typical PEPC homotetramer comprised solely of p109. We also document that the amount of both CrPpc1/2 catalytic subunits is up‐/down‐regulated by varying levels of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/feb2s0014579307009866-math-si1.gif\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00145793:media:feb2s0014579307009866:feb2s0014579307009866-math-si1\" /> supplied to the culture medium.</jats:p>",
