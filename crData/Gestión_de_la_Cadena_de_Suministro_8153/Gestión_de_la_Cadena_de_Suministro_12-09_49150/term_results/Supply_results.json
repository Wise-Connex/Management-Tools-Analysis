These include production process adjustment advice and implementation of different sustainable product standards. In practice two different approaches are taken. Development projects focus on enabling farmers to adjust their practices to Organic, Fairtrade and other standards requirements. In international trade, buyers from developed countries implement separate supply chain assurance systems. This article presents nine case studies of practices from both approaches in the cotton supply chain in India.</jats:p><jats:p>The results show improvements in the livelihoods of small farmers but increased market access depends on what approaches are used.

On the downstream side, inventory costs, inventory days of supply, and cash‐to‐cash cycle time tend to increase due to geographically dispersed sales network. Increased geographic dispersion in the upstream and downstream supply chain results in the decline of perfect orders, and increases order fulfilment cycle time. However, the increased dispersion of the production network reduces order fulfilment cycle time. The results also indicate that the larger the firm, the better it can alleviate the negative implications of dispersion on perfect order fulfilment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In general, social capital is defined as new intellectual capital created by combination and exchange among firms in structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions. The structural dimension means characteristics and topology of relationships among firms, the relational dimension consists of the quality of network components like trust, norms, and reciprocal obligations, and the cognitive dimension is the sharing of vision, value, and common fate among firms. Understanding social capital as an emerging technological component of Supply Chain Networks (SCN) will be increasingly important in order to enable continued SCN improvement. With the social capital concept, we investigate how these dimensions of supply chain social capital have an effect on firm performance and how the relation between firms moderates the effect using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The result demonstrates that the relational dimension indirectly affects innovation and executive-oriented performance, the structural dimension directly affects both innovation and executive oriented performance, and cognition also affects only innovation-oriented performance. Supply chain social capital provides an opportunity and challenge to supply chain managers in order to improve firm performance. We provide several implications for supply chain managers. First, we relate three dimensions of social capital to three firm performances and highlight the importance of raising and utilizing social capital to improve supply chain performance. In order to improve innovation-oriented performance, such as the business process, new technology adoption, and capability, supply chain managers should pay close attention to the cognitive dimension of social capital. Managers should build up cognitive capital based on relational capital among supply chain partners. It may be made by common events for sharing value and vision together and also by firms’ interacting with supply chain information systems.\r\nManagers also should develop different supply chain social capital according to the supply chain strategy and characteristics with regards to the products within the supply chain network. If a supply chain deals with functional products and takes an efficient supply chain strategy (Fisher, 1997), managers should attempt to make structural capital to improve executive performance.\r\nSecond, managers need to separate and manage supply chain performance metrics because the performances are different depending on social capital and the relation. In other words, managers should separate and control performance metrics into innovation-oriented and executive-oriented performance measures through a strong and weak supply chain network in order to improve management performance..\r\nIn general, social capital is defined as new intellectual capital created by combination and exchange among firms in structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions. The structural dimension means characteristics and topology of relationships among firms, the relational dimension consists of the quality of network components like trust, norms, and reciprocal obligations, and the cognitive dimension is the sharing of vision, value, and common fate among firms. Understanding social capital as an emerging technological component of Supply Chain Networks (SCN) will be increasingly important in order to enable continued SCN improvement. With the social capital concept, we investigate how these dimensions of supply chain social capital have an effect on firm performance and how the relation between firms moderates the effect using Structural Equation Model (SEM). The result demonstrates that the relational dimension indirectly affects innovation and executive-oriented performance, the structural dimension directly affects both innovation and executive oriented performance, and cognition also affects only innovation-oriented performance.</jats:p>",

This study, however, suggests that Rome did not suff er from frequent food crises between 442 and 455. Adducing Vandal taxation policy, numismatic evidence, archaeological land surveys, and precipitation data from modern Tunisia, it furthermore contends that the Vandals were in fact sending grain to Rome during this time, even if in lesser amounts than what North Africa had been shipping previously. It also postulates that the empire’s demand on grain had fallen substantially since the fourth century because of a shrinking Roman army and a reduction in the city of Rome’s population. Finally, it is suggested that after 442 the western empire still possessed sufficient grain producing lands to meet the needs of Rome’s urban population.\n\t</jats:p>",

The proposed framework has been developed based on the literature review and evaluated against the case study. The case study describes SCD at two Swedish companies; one from the appliance industry and the other from the furniture industry, both having a significant international presence.

It is essential that this process is aligned with new product development (NPD), so they exchange information, and operate based on the same segmentation model. The main benefits of a differentiated supply chain are enhanced competitiveness, as supply chain management (SCM) changes from being a cost center to being a value generating function, and increased profitability, by allowing differentiated customer needs to be satisfied cost‐efficiently. To succeed with developing a differentiated supply chain, logisticians must be extensively involved with both the NPD process and the strategic marketing process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Current models of SCD are simplistic and not well developed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ‘reclaiming’ by Paris of its water back into public hands is a paradox in the homeland of transnational water companies and at a time when the European Commission rather favours the liberalisation of public services ‘of general economic interest’. Yet what has happened is more complex. A quick historical review of management formulas in Europe reveals both the specific model of delegation to private companies made in France, and also the maintained direct labour management formula (with direct public procurement by municipalities) used in several French cities to be presented. Paris has a long history of public procurement of water, whilst using a private company for metering and billing customers. Mayor Chirac changed to a semi-public company with public production and private distribution contracted out to two private companies (with responsibility for the right and left banks). Mayor Delanoë managed to reclaim the distribution in a commercial but public institution called an Établissement Public à caractère Industriel et Commercial (EPIC); this had unsuspected impacts on water supply issue in the suburbs. While Paris can obviously run its services directly, the emerging issue appears to be multi-level governance at the metropolitan level, rather than just a public–private debate. This paper also discusses in detail the arguments put forward by Anne le Strat, Deputy Mayor for Water, in favour of returning to public control, and presents the difficulties of assessing the performance of a service operator, under both delegation and direct management.</jats:p>",

Projection and contraction method was utilized to solve the model. Numerical examples were given to illustrate the impact of risk-averse degree of manufacturers and retailers on network equilibrium patterns in case of capacity constraints and price ceilings. The results show that under the same condition, the system profits decrease to a lower level when the manufacturers’ risk degree increase compared with retailers. The retailers bear more loss due to their positions in the supply chain.</jats:p>"

These services are mostly perceived as unsatisfactory across urban centres and the sector is widely perceived to be misgoverned with large number of municipalities making financial losses. However, this common perception of inefficient services has not much scientific basis as the efficiencies of these services are not measured. This paper, therefore, attempts to evolve a framework for evaluating the relative inefficiencies of water supply services and applies a non-parametric approach, data envelopment analysis (DEA), to 20 urban centres in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India, by applying three different models. The results of the analysis indicate that there are significant inefficiencies amongst the various municipalities that supply water. It was found that larger cities exhibit better efficiencies than smaller ones, requiring policy interventions. However, even the larger municipalities need restructuring and downsizing of their operations to be more efficient. DEA results also show that significant savings with respect to operating expenditures, staff and non-revenue water are actually possible if best practices are adopted. The paper discusses the results of the study in the context of policy issues that are relevant from a developing country perspective.</jats:p>",

In addition, this paper has been constructed in Excel® as a prototype, with the aim of being used in workplaces to support decisions making in SMEs supply chains. For this investigation, a number of best practices have been analysed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays, it is a really important issue to improve the supply quality of city public bus transportation in many cases. Meanwhile, the different participants of transport systems have different ideas on the ways of improvement, for this reason the taken measures can be inefficient and expensive. The operational costs are steadily increasing (e.g. price of fuel, wages, etc.) therefore the decision makers do not really have the opportunity to lower the price of tickets. For solving the above mentioned problems, before creating a plan of improving a certain public system, a clear image should have been gained on the preferences of passengers, company managers and governmental decision makers. In the current paper a general three-level-hierarchical model has been set up to analyze dynamically the public bus transport system of a city. The price is excluded, only the elements of supply quality are assessed in the hierarchy. Based on the model, questionnaires were created and for the analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine preference weights of evaluators from different evaluator groups. Passengers, company managers and governmental officers evaluated exactly the same type of questionnaires so the results are comparable. Avoiding the difficulties of other AHP applications, we used a simplified Saaty-scale for scoring so that the missing data of the matrices could be calculated by an algorithm as well. This study revealed a priority ranking of the elements of supply quality within each level, and this ranking is comparable among the participants of public bus system. This may help the policy makers to synthesize various aspects of public transportation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the processes used and the choices made while developing a procedure to evaluate Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) and Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) chargers and provides some results of the testing process. The procedure defines the battery charging system (i.e., the battery charger, EVSE, battery storage system, auxiliary loads, and vehicle). Each test element is evaluated in terms of function, reliability, safety, quality, cost, efficiency and power quality. The development of a charging system evaluation procedure comes from Southern California Edison’s (SCE) responsibility to ensure safe and reliable function and to minimize system impact. Up to one million PEVs have been projected to be operating in SCE’s service area by 2020. SCE must not only serve these PEVs, but must ensure that they do not have a negative impact on the utility grid. Therefore it is critical that SCE understand the impact of those battery charging systems. SCE also supports the creation of standards to limit wasted energy and negative power quality impacts that these battery charging systems may create. SCE is also using the test procedure to evaluate EVSEs and PEV charging systems for implementation in SCE’s fleet. The results of this procedure are used to give fleet managers the information needed to acquire the most effective and efficient PEV charging equipment. The results will also tell a fleet manager or PEV owner what EVSE would work best with their selected vehicle or vice versa. The procedure provides for the discovery of PEV and EVSE individual and compatibility issues before the PEV is deployed. The final result ensures optimum performance of the PEV system. Through this process, SCE has been able to work with manufacturers of PEVs and EVSEs in order to improve the functionality, robustness, and interoperability of the products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Affordability of water services is a pressing water policy issue for both the developed and, in particular, for the developing world. Despite its well-known theoretical shortcomings, affordability analysis of water supply has, up to now, been widely based on the ratio of a household's water expenditure to its income, the Conventional Affordability Ratio (CAR). However, in the housing sector, alternative concepts for measuring affordability have been developed, among them being the ‘Potential Affordability Approach’ (PAA) and the ‘Residual Income Approach’ (RIA). Against this background, this paper compares these three prominent affordability measures (CAR, PAA, RIA) on the basis of an empirical case study of a peri-urban, low-income area in the second largest Mongolian city of Darkhan, using household data from a survey conducted in 2009. Thus we gain insight into both the water-related affordability situation of people in Mongolia, checking the World Bank's finding of an absence of water affordability problems in peri-urban areas in the Mongolian capital Ulaanbaatar, as well as into the comparative functionality of different affordability measures. It is shown that affordability problems do occur but have to be distinguished depending on the economic causation. We argue that none of the regarded measures give a satisfyingly contoured notion of affordability properly distinguished from the adjacent problems of poverty and access.</jats:p>",

Whereas the “Great Game”—the often violent scramble among nations for control of territories harboring energy reserves—is still relevant, today it has become equally, if not more, important to control the technology assets, the hardware, and the software. Thus, the game has changed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>New technologies have empowered nations, and they have made corporations and individuals active participants in the energy game. Smart meters, the Internet, and advanced software allow individuals to fine-tune energy consumption, underscoring the “Power of One”—the ability of every person to proactively manage his or her energy consumption and carbon footprint. This generational change is a function of heightened awareness of the impact of energy consumption on household expenses, foreign policy, and the environment. Energy consumption is no longer an economic act; it is becoming a conscious act and an act of conscience. By understanding and managing energy use, individuals can save money, companies can increase profits, and both can lessen their environmental impact. Everyone wins.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Danger Ahead—A License to Operate?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The breakneck pace of the energy technology revolution has likely masked inherent risks, especially in terms of the environment and public reaction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The expansion of hydraulic fracturing and the accelerated production of the Canadian oil sands coincided with the global economic crisis that began in 2008. This initially blunted reaction to potential dangers of new energy technologies, because the general public was absorbed by its core economic concerns and thus inclined to think more about the savings from less expensive energy than about environmental concerns. Essentially, in the competition between desire for cheaper energy and fear of the eco-consequences of fossil fuels, desire was at the forefront.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Today, environmental concerns are again front and center because of the recent series of energy-linked environmental challenges and public concerns: the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the Fukushima nuclear incident, the controversy over hydraulic fracturing, and more. The unsettled nature of these concerns means companies still have not secured a free and clear “license to operate” from the public.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our knowledge of the potential and consequences of new technologies is in its infancy. “The Great Game 2.0” may well decide which countries and companies emerge as enduring powers in the 21st century.</jats:p>",

The construction supply chain was divided into four sectors – material suppliers, construction companies, property developers and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The findings indicate that the impact was minimal for both material suppliers and construction companies, but especially severe for the more leveraged property developers and REITs. Building material suppliers and construction companies have benefitted substantially from the building economic stimulus package provided by the Australian government to mitigate the effects of the GFC. Decreases in the valuation of assets have, to a large extent, reduced the profitability of property developers and REITs during the GFC but these companies have recovered quickly from these adverse conditions to return to a sound financial position by the end of the 2010 financial year. The results will inform investors, managers and construction professionals in devising strategies for prudent financial management and for weathering future financial crises.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>This article considers a class of fresh‐product supply chains in which products need to be transported by the upstream producer from a production base to a distant retail market. Due to high perishablility a portion of the products being shipped may decay during transportation, and therefore, become unsaleable. We consider a supply chain consisting of a single producer and a single distributor, and investigate two commonly adopted business models: (i) In the “pull” model, the distributor places an order, then the producer determines the shipping quantity, taking into account potential product decay during transportation, and transports the products to the destination market of the distributor; (ii) In the “push” model, the producer ships a batch of products to a distant wholesale market, and then the distributor purchases and resells to end customers. By considering a price‐sensitive end‐customer demand, we investigate the optimal decisions for supply chain members, including order quantity, shipping quantity, and retail price. Our research shows that both the producer and distributor (and thus the supply chain) will perform better if the pull model is adopted. To improve the supply chain performance, we propose a fixed inventory‐plus factor (FIPF) strategy, in which the producer announces a pre‐determined inventory‐plus factor and the distributor compensates the producer for any surplus inventory that would otherwise be wasted. We show that this strategy is a Pareto improvement over the pull and push models for both parties. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted, which reveal some interesting managerial insights on the comparison between different business models.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The risk of supply disruption increases as firms seek to procure from cheaper, but unproven, suppliers. We model a supply chain consisting of a single buyer and two suppliers, both of which compete for the buyer's order and face risk of supply disruption. One supplier is comparatively more reliable but also more expensive, whereas the other one is less reliable but cheaper and faces higher risk of disruption. Moreover, the risk level of the unreliable supplier may be private information, and this lack of visibility increases the buyer's purchasing risk. In such settings, the unreliable supplier often provides a price and quantity (P&amp;Q) guarantee to the buyer. Our objective is to study the underlying motivation for the guarantee offer and its effects on the competitive intensity and the performance of the chain partners. Our model also includes a spot market that can be utilized by any party to buy or to sell. The spot market price is random, partially depends on the available capacity of the two suppliers, and has a positive spread between buying and selling prices. We analytically characterize the equilibrium contracts for the two suppliers and the buyer's optimal procurement strategy. First, our analysis shows that P&amp;Q guarantee allows the unreliable supplier to better compete against the more reliable one by providing supply assurance to the buyer. More importantly, when information asymmetry risk is high, use of a guarantee may enable the unreliable supplier to credibly signal her true risk, thereby improving visibility into the chain. This signal can also be used by the buyer to infer the expected spot market price. In spite of these benefits, a guarantee offer in an asymmetric setting may not always be desirable for the buyer. Rather, it can reduce competition between the suppliers, resulting in higher costs for the buyer. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management. </jats:p>",

Banks write tighter contracts than their peers after suffering payment defaults to their own loan portfolios, even when defaulting borrowers are in different industries and geographic regions from the current borrower. The effects persist after controlling for bank capitalization, although bank equity compression is also associated with tighter contracts. The evidence suggests that recent defaults inform the lender's perception of its own screening ability, thereby impacting its contracting behavior.</jats:p>",

The estimates reveal a shift rather than a movement along the supply curve. We find that ambiguities are due to the absence, in the theory, of a clear distinction between a change in consumption that is partly due to changes in the wage rate and partly due to changes in purchasing power.

To the authors’ knowledge, no quantitative investigations of farmers’ preferences with regard to supply contracts for biogas plants have been carried out so far. Hence, it has been only possible to a limited extent to make predictions for a targeted ar-rangement of supply contracts. We, therefore, investigated, to what extent different factors have relevance for the conclusion of substrate supply contracts. This has been done by conducting a survey with 178 German farm managers. The survey included a choice experiment in which participants were confronted with different contract features. These features were varied systematically and thus revealed the influence of each individual feature on the probability of contract conclusion. It becomes clear that the farmers who were interviewed preferred to conclude contracts with other farmers or with a bioenergy village rather than with external investors. The probability of contract conclusion decreases with an increasing lifetime of the contract. However, a contract with a higher sales price is more attractive for the farmers. The investigation of the characteristics of respondents shows that the amount of the premium for one additional year of contractual lifetime depends on the individual valuation of the entrepreneurial freedom of the respective farm manager. It cannot be established that risk-averse farmers tend to prefer contracts with fixed prices over contracts with price adjustment clauses. In addition, there are no great differences in the choice behavior of farmers who have already signed a substrate supply contract and farmers without this experience.</jats:p>"

Drawing on different literature streams, international standards and corporate disclosure, this paper presents a conceptual framework for the quantitative assessment of the comprehensiveness of firms' environmental strategies. This framework allows us to capture: (i) the environmental inputs and outputs addressed, (ii) the firm versus supply chain orientation of environmental strategies, and (iii) the environmental management practices adopted by companies. We illustrate the application of this framework with a content analysis of corporate sustainability reports for a cross‐sectoral sample of sustainability leaders. Our results indicate that there is a need for greater specificity in environmental reporting and that, overall, companies remain firm‐oriented. It is also observed that supply chain orientation can generally be associated with stakeholder pressure. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

The introduction provides the conceptual framework used in the papers for considering the relationship between sourcing seed from market and rural household decision-making as well as the effects this has on two key farm outcomes: on-farm diversity and household welfare. Approaches for data collection and study site selection are described, with a focus on how methodological issues were addressed in the different studies. Lastly, the paper summarizes the results of the individual papers and draws broad conclusions and policy implications for promoting the sustainable utilization of crop genetic resources through increasing market access and in a manner that supports agricultural production.</jats:p>",

Power supplies are devices of special interest since their internal components such as diodes, capacitors, MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) and IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) operate under continuous stress conditions and often present elevated failure rates. The aim of this work is to present a methodology for detecting the gradual health degradation of a COTS (Commercial off-the-shelf) power supply. An accelerated aging process for power MOSFETs was conducted. During this experiment, power MOSFETs were subjected to thermal overstress in order to increase die- junction temperature above rated value through large current from drain to source. Multivariate regression analysis was applied to the raw data collected during the tests in order to assess the power supply health status.\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

Additionally, an initial empirical application of the multidimensional human capital model is provided by exploring labor supply and human capital formation in the FA Premier League in England, the leading domestic soccer league globally in financial terms. The chapter then offers a summary of the principal theoretical and empirical findings, some discussion of the limitations of the proposed model, and suggestions for future research. It has been shown that the English Premiership has the highest penetration rate by foreign players among the top European soccer leagues.

The results of the analysis point to the fact that foreign trade is an important factor stabilising the development of the food sector in Poland and in Germany. However, in Germany imports are a much stronger stimulator of the development of agriculture and food industry than in Poland. A comparison reveals the desirable direction of changes in Poland, where the role of imports in the supply of materials to agriculture and the food industry should increase. Thanks to this, the imported products and global processes will have a significant influence on further development and modernisation of the Polish agribusiness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This research examines residential parking supply in London before and after the minimum off-street parking standard was replaced by a maximum one in 2004. Based on 11 428 residential developments after and 216 developments before the reform, it is found that parking supply was reduced by approximately 40 per cent. Ninety-eight per cent was caused by the removal of the minimum standard, while only 2 per cent was due the imposition of the maximum standard. However, the parking supply is actually higher in areas with the highest density and the best transit service than in the areas immediately outside; the adopted maximum standard follows a similar pattern. The market-oriented approach to parking regulation can reduce excessive parking, but it depends on the particular sub-markets. Complementary policies such as strict parking maxima, on-street parking controls and parking taxes are often necessary to form an efficient parking market. </jats:p>",

This study investigates how the hydraulic characteristics of different <jats:italic>Sphagnum</jats:italic> species (<jats:italic>Sphagnum fuscum</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Sphagnum rubellum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Sphagnum magellanicum</jats:italic>) contribute to desiccation avoidance, on the basis of numerical simulations parameterized with measured soil hydraulic characteristics for each species. Although having similar unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values, the upper 5 cm of <jats:italic>S. magellanicum</jats:italic> retains ~20% less moisture under tension than <jats:italic>S. fuscum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S. rubellum</jats:italic>; in fact, <jats:italic>S. rubellum</jats:italic> on average retained slightly more water than <jats:italic>S. fuscum</jats:italic>. Hydrus‐1D was used to simulate daytime and nighttime conditions over a 7‐day period, where daily potential evaporation was 4 mm, to explore the governing mechanisms controlling water supply to the capitula. The simulations showed that <jats:italic>S. fuscum</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S. rubellum</jats:italic> were able to retain sufficiently high moisture content under the prevailing simulated water demand to sustain surface soil‐water pressure heads (greater than −100 cm), whereas <jats:italic>S. magellanicum</jats:italic> could not prevent depressurization and the concomitant desiccation of its surface layer. A similar number of the same size pores were observed in all species; however, there was lower pore connectivity in <jats:italic>S. magellanicum</jats:italic> leading to the desiccation of the capitula. Contrary to previous studies, the results of this study indicate that it is not only soil‐water retention but also pore connectivity that allows hummock species to thrive above the water table.

This paper proposes a framework to address sustainable transport systems design where both environmental (i.e. carbon and water footprints) and economic performances are taken into account along the bioethanol supply chain. A multi‐objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming modeling framework supporting strategic design and planning decisions for multi‐period and multi‐echelon upstream ethanol supply chains is developed. Hybrid biofuel production networks, where both corn grain and stover are used as suitable feedstocks, are optimized according to several features, involving technology selection and by‐products end‐use option. A case study is presented referring to the emerging Italian biofuels market. Results show the effectiveness of mathematical‐programming‐based tools to optimal design of biofuels supply chains, assessing the pros and cons of alternative configurations and, thus, allowing investors to drive planning decisions. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

In this study, mail questionnaire have been sent to the managers consists of the Malaysian manufacturing and service firms. A total of 202 firms participated in this study. While greater level of TQM practices tends to enhance KM practices, we found that both TQM and KM are significantly positively related to supply chain learning. The findings of this study empirically tested and confirmed the proposed integrated model.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Fuelwood is the dominant source of energy used by most rural households in southern Africa to meet daily domestic energy requirements. Due to limited financial resources, most rural households are unable to make the transition to electricity thus they remain dependant on the woodlands surrounding their settlements as a source of cheap energy. Unsustainable fuelwood harvesting due to increasing demand as a result of growing human populations may result in environmental degradation particularly in the high-density, communal savannah woodlands of South Africa. Evaluating the sustainability of current fuelwood harvesting patterns requires an understanding of the environmental impacts of past logging practices to establish patterns of woodland degradation. This study evaluates impacts of fuelwood harvesting from 1992–2009 on the woodland structure and species composition surrounding two rural villages located within the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere Reserve (Mpumalanga Province, South Africa). Both villages (Welverdiend and Athol) were of similar spatial extent and exhibited similar socioeconomic characteristics. The total wood stock in the communal woodlands of both villages declined overall (with greater losses seen in Welverdiend) and, in Welverdiend, there were also changes in the woodland structure and species diversity of the species commonly harvested for fuelwood over this period. The woodlands in Welverdiend have become degraded and no longer produce fuelwood of preferred species and stem size in sufficient quantity or quality. The absence of similar negative impacts in Athol suggests more sustainable harvesting regimes exist there because of the lower human population and lower fuelwood extraction pressure. The Welverdiend community has annexed neighbouring unoccupied private land in a social response to fuelwood scarcity. Athol residents behaved similarly during drought periods. The potential for future conflict with neighbouring conservation areas within the Kruger to Canyons Biosphere is high if current land uses and fuelwood extraction patterns are maintained.</jats:p>",

We address this question by examining an important, demand‐side barrier to licensing—the buyers' cost of integrating a licensed technology. We argue that this cost can be affected by suppliers' knowledge transfer capabilities, buyers' absorptive capacity, and the cospecialization between R&amp;D and downstream activities in the buyers' industries. Following this argument and a stylized bargaining model, we hypothesize that the supplier's knowledge transfer capability stimulates licensing. Moreover, the importance of this capability increases when licensing to industries where potential buyers have weak absorptive capacity or R&amp;D and downstream activities are cospecialized. We find support for our hypotheses using a panel dataset of small ‘serial innovators.’ Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Of a total population of 8 million, about 1 million Azerbaijanis were refugees or internally displaced persons who had fled areas occupied by Armenian forces. Another 2 million Azerbaijanis had left the country, mainly to find work.2</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Contract of the Century also provided the opportunity for the Azerbaijani private sector to rebuild itself by working with BP and associated service companies.

Although this can seemingly misalign the interests of a manager, we show that the use of such measures can help supply chain partners to overcome hold‐up issues with respect to capacity and promotion investments. We develop a game theoretic model in which two supply chain partners engage in repeated interactions in which the supplier invests in capacity and the buyer invests in demand promotion. Following the realization of demand in each period, the two firms negotiate over the output quantity and wholesale price. The novelty of our model is that we allow the owners of each firm to delegate decision‐making power and negotiating responsibility to a free‐agent manager. We characterize the conditions under which the owners of both firms employ RF‐MPMs in equilibrium and benefit from doing so. For a special case of our model, we show that for the owners of the buyer, an RF‐MPM is equivalent to a price only relational contract, and that it complements a price and quantity relational contract as a mechanism for mitigating hold‐up issues. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>It is necessary to infuse a consistent supply of improved seed varieties into local sub‐Saharan African crop production to improve low crop yields. The best distribution channel for the improved seed varieties may be small‐scale commercial seed companies, but local entrepreneurs struggle to determine whether such businesses are viable. Using a multi‐echelon supply chain approach, a decision support system (DSS) was designed to help African seed entrepreneurs make informed decisions about small‐scale seed chain businesses. Specifically, entrepreneurs make decisions about where to locate seed enterprises, with which farmers to contract, and where to store seed. Optimization and simulation modeling are used to evaluate infrastructure variables such as distance, transportation cost, and storage loss and cost in three development level areas. Currently, the decision tool is used in Mozambique, Malawi, Kenya, and Tanzania. The model has supported the start‐up of at least 17 small seed companies that are now introducing improved seed varieties into villages and farms. The DSS applies decision science research in a humanitarian application and offers important managerial implications about supply chain infrastructure to nongovernmental organizations and humanitarian groups. Such applications are vital as groups such as USAID, the Gates Foundation, and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi‐Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) continue to move toward micro‐enterprise, value chain, and market‐oriented development programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the service commitment strategy and pricing decisions in a single-supplier single-retailer supply chain where all the players (and consumers) are risk averse. Motivated by various industrial practices, we explore the case where the retailer determines whether to provide a service guarantee (SG) or to provide no service guarantee (NSG). The main incentive for using SG is to reduce the service-level risk to consumers. We derive the range of the supplier's degree of risk aversion and the range of the consumer's sensitivity (or attitude) to service reliability over which the retailer chooses SG. We find that (i) the retailer's motivation to use SG increases with the consumer's product quality perception, (ii) the retailer's motivation to use SG decreases with the retailer's degree of risk aversion but increases with both the consumer's degree of risk aversion and the retailer's service investment efficiency, and (iii) the unit wholesale price under NSG is lower than that under SG if and only if the consumer's service-level sensitivity is sufficiently small. In addition, we illustrate that the endogenization of unit wholesale price raises the retailer's motivation to use SG if the consumer is sufficiently risk averse; otherwise, it may decrease this motivation. In the make-to-stock mode, we also find that a higher unit-holding cost weakens the retailer's motivation to use an availability guarantee. </jats:p>",

The need to jointly price the services assumes significance because they are partial substitutes of one another. Our study finds that the influence of the logistics network on prices is especially strong when there are non‐linearities in the cost of provisioning the logistics services. Furthermore, the impact of logistics decisions on different types of pricing schemes (e.g., volume discount, bundled pricing) is different, both in its structure and extent. In present times, when the market for the fit‐sorting service is relatively immature, our findings have major implications to the way an SLP's business is managed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The bullwhip effect is a major source of supply chain inefficiency. Whereas prior literature has identified a number of potential contributing factors and recommended such remedies as information sharing enabled by information technology (IT) or electronic linkage (EL), few studies have provided empirical support. We use industry-level data to examine whether EL use with buyer and supplier industries helps reduce the bullwhip effect as measured by inventory–demand variance ratio. Our major findings are that (1) EL use with supplier industries reduces the bullwhip effect, whereas (2), surprisingly, EL use with buyer industries increases it, but (3) this adverse effect tends to be mitigated by IT use. These findings point to the possible asymmetric effects of EL use in supply chains and provide a different perspective to the existing conclusions in the literature that EL use improves performance. Combining the above results, we have learned that the use of EL tends to behave differently depending on whether it is used upstream or downstream in the supply chain. This also sheds light on the conditions under which such investment may be more (or less) beneficial. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last decade, most organizations have implemented enterprise-wide applications and integration platforms. These implementations have delivered benefits in terms of data synchronization and information flows within the organization, and with trading partners providing valuable inputs for planning and optimization of schedules and reporting. The best and the most important technology of these technologies is RFID or Radio Frequency Identification systems. RFID is one of the most promising and the most advanced technologies released in recent years. Perishable and short life products, especially foodstuffs, are those cases causing the largest problems and challenges for supply chain management. These challenges are mainly due to the variety in the number of products, special needs for tracing and tracking the product flow during the supply chain, the short life of the products, the requirement for controlling the temperature in the supply chain and the high volume of the products we deal with.  Using the RFID system is one of the best potential solutions helping the supply chain management solve logistic problems of spoilable products. In food industries, the period of the product storage is short due to the high probability that the product spoils and the short time of the storage of the final product. Today, the changes in the ways of producing, distributing, maintaining and selling foodstuffs have caused changes in consumers' demands to increase the quality and the durability of foodstuff packages. Innovations are created in this industry to make sure of the desirable performance of packing in the supply chain of the foodstuffs, such as active or intelligent packing methods.

Model systems suggest that food supply can drive these often highly variable properties, yet for many wild species, quantifying such effects and assessing their implications have been challenging. We used spatially explicit time series of a well-studied marine reef fish (black surfperch<jats:italic>Embiotoca jacksoni</jats:italic>) and its known prey resources to evaluate the extent to which fluctuations in food supply influenced production of young by adults and survival of young to subadulthood. Our analyses reveal: (i) variable food available to both adults and to their offspring directly produced an order of magnitude variation in the number of young-of-year (YOY) produced per adult and (ii) food available to YOY produced a similar magnitude of variation in their subsequent survival. We also show that such large natural variation in vital rates can significantly alter decision thresholds (biological reference points) important for precautionary management. These findings reveal how knowledge of food resources can improve understanding of population dynamics and reduce risk of overharvest by more accurately identifying periods of low recruitment.</jats:p>",

Most studies of heterogeneous watering have focused on responses of whole populations rather than individuals in a population. The effects of water supply heterogeneity may also depend on nutrient levels. Thus, we investigated the integrated effects of water supply heterogeneity and nutrient levels on plants within a population. Six plants of <jats:italic>Perilla frutescens</jats:italic> per pot were grown under different combinations of frequency of water supply and nutrient level. The effects on yield per pot, individual biomass, and allocation to roots were analyzed after a 44‐day watering regime. A homogeneous water supply resulted in a greater yield per pot and greater biomass of individual plants than a heterogeneous supply. However, the interaction between water supply heterogeneity and nutrient level was significant only in larger individuals, not in smaller plants or at the p. Water supply heterogeneity affected the growth of all plants, but the effects differed among individuals depending on their relative size within their population. It is therefore important to focus not only on whole‐population characteristics such as yield but also on individuals in a population in order to reveal the detailed effects of water supply heterogeneity.</jats:p>",

Emerging economies can fully capitalize on this to start a 'revolution' and leap-frog developed nations by skipping completely the several major computing architectures gone through in developed nations. An analogy is the leap-frogging, that has taken place with wireless telephony. We briefly introduce our research into streamlining India’s grain supply chains and then discuss in detail on how cloud computing can play a pivotal role. Although the focus is on the portion of the supply chains between wholesalers and consumers, we also discuss how cloud computing can streamline the entire supply chains and how it offers leap-frogging opportunities for the entire society. The proposed use of web-terminals for accessing the cloud for all computing needs is new, and we point out several high-impact research subjects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The real and/or perceived shortage of veterinarians serving food-supply veterinary medicine has been a topic of considerable discussion for decades. Regardless of this debate, there are issues still facing colleges of veterinary medicine (CVMs) about the best process of educating future food-supply veterinarians. Over the past several years, there have been increasing concerns by some that the needs of food-supply veterinary medicine have not adequately been met through veterinary educational institutions. The food-supply veterinary medical curriculum offered by individual CVMs varies depending on individual curricular design, available resident animal population, available food-animal caseload, faculty, and individual teaching efforts of faculty. All of the institutional members of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC) were requested to share their Food Animal Veterinary Career Incentives Programs. The AAVMC asked all member institutions what incentives they used to attract and educate students interested in, or possibly considering, a career in food-supply veterinary medicine (FSVM). The problem arises as to how we continue to educate veterinary students with ever shrinking budgets and how to recruit and retain faculty with expertise to address the needs of society. Several CVMs use innovative training initiatives to help build successful FSVM programs. This article focuses on dairy, beef, and swine food-animal education and does not characterize colleges' educational efforts in poultry and aquaculture. This review highlights the individual strategies used by the CVMs in the United States. </jats:p>",

        "• Lord Bridge says that Kerr LJ (in the Court of Appeal) in finding for the seller had in fact misinterpreted what Lord Fraser had said about The Canada Steamship v R [1952] 1 All ER 303 in the Ailsa Craig case! This is an excellent paragraph for demonstrating the way in which judges argue about other cases, following, distinguishing, overruling or stating the precedent or a case erroneously. • Lord Bridge decides the common law point in favour of the sellers in agreement with Lord Denning in the Court of Appeal. • Lord Bridge turns to discuss the ‘statutory’ issue. We now begin to understand the reference to ‘the Act’ in issue (2) as set out by Lord Bridge at Appendix 1, p 310, para 2. • The modified s 55 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 is set out. • The Sale of Goods Act 1979 was a statute that was pure consolidation. (This means that it merely collected together the existing law and put it in one place.) • Modified s 55 preserves the law between 18 May 1973 (the date that the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act came into force) and 1 February 1977 (the date that the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 came into force). • Section 55, sub-ss (1), (4), (5) and (9) are set out. Students need to study s 55 carefully to ensure that they understand what it is providing for and that they can follow the discussion of it by Lord Bridge. So, let us stop here for a moment… for a statutory diversion."

        "• Lord Bridge goes on to say that his answer in relation to the question is not necessary for the outcome of this case and declines to answer one way or the other! It is interesting to note that if he had categorically answered the question, yes or no, it would be a clear example of an obiter dictum statement in a strong case by a senior judge and may well have been used in argument in a later case where this issue is at the core of the case. • Eventually, Lord Bridge turns to the ‘application of the statutory language’ to the case. • He states that only s 55(5)(a) and (c) are relevant. (This is the moment to re-read s 55(5)(a) and (c) in Figure 4.16, above, if you do not remember the provisions. Otherwise, one loses sight of the argument!) • As to s 55(5)(c), he says of course the buyer knew of the condition as it was standard throughout the trade. • As to s 55(5)(a), he states that there was evidence that similar limitations had never been negotiated with representative bodies. • Witnesses for the appellant said that it had always been their practice in genuine justified claims to settle above the price of the seeds but that, in this case, settlement had not been possible. Lord Bridge said ‘this evidence indicated a clear recognition…that reliance on the limitation of liability imposed by the relevant condition would not be fair or reasonable’. • Lord Bridge concluded, therefore, that wrong seed was supplied due to the negligence of the applicant’s sister company. Seedsmen could insure against the risk of crop failure caused by the wrong supply without materially increasing the cost of seeds."

        "DECISION IN CASE House of Lords (all judges agreed with the opinion of Lord Bridge.) Lord Bridge (1) The common law issue That the limitation clause was operative and could effectively limit liability. The wording of the condition was unambiguous in this regard. Limitation clauses do not have to adhere to the strict principles laid down for complete exclusion clauses (see Ailsa Craig (1983)), although they must be clearly expressed and must be strictly interpreted against the party relying on them (contra proferentem). Decision partly supported by the following precedents Photo Production Ltd (1980). Even in cases of fundamental breach, (core) limitation clauses are available to be relied upon by one party. Ailsa Craig (1983). There is a difference of approach appropriate between limitation and exclusion clauses. Limitation clauses do not have to be so strictly interpreted. (2) The statutory issue Even though the clause was enforceable at common law, after considering s 55(4), (5)(a) and (c), Lord Bridge decided that the common law provision was overridden by the statutory obligation in s 55(4) for such clauses to be fair and reasonable otherwise. The clause was therefore unenforceable. The grounds for deciding clause unfair and unreasonable were that: (a) in applying s 55(5)(a), it was clear that in the past appellants had sought to negotiate a settlement that was higher than the price and had not relied on the limitation clause; (b) supply of seed was due to the negligence of appellants sister company; (c) appellant could easily have insured against loss. Obiter dicta (a) The phrase ‘to the extent that’ discussed and said to mean ‘in so far as’ or ‘in the circumstances which’. Section 54(4). Although this is not relevant to this case it is possibly an important obiter dictum. (b) There may be some mileage in discussion concerning whether there can be partial reliance on limitation clauses again. Although this is not relevant to this case, possible important obiter dicta.
