In 5 cases (16%) their course was asymmetric; on one side every segment was fed by an artery of its own, whereas on the other side a segmental artery fed 2 or more segments. The course, distribution and size of the 1st to 4th lumbar arteries were constant in every case except one, while the middle sacral artery and its branches, the 5th lumbar arteries, varied in size, being frequently compensated for, partly or wholly, by the iliolumbar arteries derived from the internal iliac arteries. In their course around the vertebral bodies, lumbar arteries frequently passed between and beneath fibrous attachments of the crura of the diaphragm and the psoas muscle. </jats:p>",

La presenza di rifornimenti esterni per le cisterne è stata anche confermata dal ritrovamento di numerose sezioni di canali, condotte e tubi. Il confronto della capacità delle cisterne con le quantità d'acqua necessarie per irrigazione e per altri usi agricoli suggerisce che le cisterne permettessero un rifornimento idrico per uso domestico e per gli animali, permettendo inoltre di irrigare piccoli orti, ma non estesi campi coltivati. La localizzazione di queste strutture idriche viene esaminata in relazione alia generale topografia di alcune aree. Viene proposto che le ville, le fattorie e gli insediamenti rurali ottenessero acqua da una serie di possibili sistemi di acquedotto, che andavano dalla presenza di rubinetti nel più generale sistema di acquedotti romani, alla presenza di acquedotti più piccoli amministrati da una municipalità locale, fino alla presenza di sistemi a piccola scala costruiti e mantenuti da cooperative o da privati</jats:p>",

Hull, which had received ammonium nitrate applications in the field for 30 months, was assessed using scores of visible injury and measurements of the rate of total electrolyte leakage from excised shoots following controlled freezing treatments in the laboratory. There was good overall correlation between the two methods (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.77), but leakage measurements were more sensitive than injury scores to the effects of nitrogen. Visible injury was not significantly altered by nitrogen supply (Kruskal‐Wallis non‐parametric test). Ion leakage was analyzed in different ways, using either calculations of the first‐order rate coefficients or expressions of relative conductivity. These analyses produced similar results with respect to the effect of frost and nitrogen. Shoots of nitrogen‐fertilized (40, 80 and 120 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) <jats:italic>C. vulgaris</jats:italic> sampled in October 1991 showed significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) less leakage after overnight frosts of −15 and −20 °C than did the water‐treated controls. In October the temperature which killed 50% of the shoots (LT<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>), derived from the leakage data, was raised by at least 4 °C by the highest nitrogen treatments compared with the control plants. Frost treatments to pot‐grown <jats:italic>C. vulgaris</jats:italic> in November produced similar visible injury to attached and excised shoots from the same plants, both being significantly less damaged by a −18 °C frost after a 7‐month exposure to an NaNO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> mist solution (1.0 mM, pH 4.5) than were water‐misted controls. Ammonium‐mist treatments also marginally reduced frost injury, but the effects were not statistically significant.

Vertical profiles of velocity indicated that turbulent stress, and thus turbulent mixing, were three (slow flow) to ten (fast flow) times higher over the mussel bed compared to the smooth flume bottom. In two experiments that used natural seawater, initial fluorescence was low and there was little temporal depletion at either flow speed. In the one experiment in which cultured phytoplankton were added to filtered seawater so that initial fluorescence was much higher, significant vertical and substantial horizontal gradients in fluorescence developed. In this experiment, depletion was enhanced in slow flow compared to fast flow in both the downstream and vertical directions, as qualitatively predicted by the model. Furthermore, with a flow‐speed‐dependent mussel filtration velocity, modeled vertical profiles of fluorescence were consistent with the observations.</jats:p>",

In laboratory scale continuous cultures optimum production of 2,3‐butanediol + acetoin was obtained at an RQ value between 4.0 to 4.5. This agreed well with optimum RQ value (4.0) stoichiometrically derived from the bioreactions involved. In fed‐batch cultures product concentrations as high as 102.9 g/L (96.0 g/L butanediol + 6.9 g/L acetoin) can be achieved within 32 h cultivation with an RQ control algorithm for oxygen supply. Under similar conditions only 85.7 g/L product (77.6 g/L butanediol + 8.1 g/L acetoin) was obtained with control of constant oxygen supply rate throughout the cultivation.</jats:p><jats:p>In pilot scale batch cultures under identical oxygen supply rate the achievable RQ value was found to be strongly influenced by the reactor type and scale. The initial oxygen supply rate influenced the achievable RQ as well. However, in all the reactors studied the specific product formation rate of cells in the exponential growth phase was only a function of RQ. The same optimum RQ value as found in continuous cultures was obtained. It was thus concluded that RQ can be used as a control parameter for optimum production of 2,3‐butanediol + acetoin in both laboratory and pilot plant scale reactors. © 1994 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",
