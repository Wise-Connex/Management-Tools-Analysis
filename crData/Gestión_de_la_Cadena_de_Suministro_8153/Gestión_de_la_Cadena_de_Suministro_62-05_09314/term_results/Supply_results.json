The article discusses the technical challenges of sea water conversion, brackish water conversion, and presents several alternative approaches to expanding water supplies besides conversion that include: reduction of evaporation from impoundments; weather modification; more efficient use of water in agriculture, public supply, and industry; reuse of water; water pollution control; more storage, both above and below ground surface; and, watershed management.</jats:p>",
