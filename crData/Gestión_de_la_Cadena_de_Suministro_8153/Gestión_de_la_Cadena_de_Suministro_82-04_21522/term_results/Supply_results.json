      "abstract": "<jats:p>The assumption that transpiration is the lesser of an atmospheric demand function and a water supply function was tested by simulation with Federer's (1979) soil‐plant‐atmosphere model. The best estimate of atmospheric demand is called unstressed transpiration, defined as the transpiration that would occur in ambient conditions if stomata were unaffected by plant‐water potential. For practical purposes the Penman equation provides a good estimate of unstressed transpiration for short vegetation but not for forests. Even when atmospheric variables and the Penman estimate are held constant among forest canopies, unstressed transpiration can vary by a factor of two because of variation both in the maximum value of leaf conductance and in the ratio of canopy conductance to leaf conductance. The best water supply function incorporates depth variation of soil water potential and of root and soil properties. A more practical supply function uses the ratio of available water in the root zone, <jats:italic>W</jats:italic>, to maximum available water <jats:italic>W</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>M</jats:italic></jats:sub>. The maximum available water is soil water held at potentials less than that at which the hydraulic conductivity is 2 mm/d and greater than the critical leaf water potential at which stomata are completely closed. Using a mature hardwood forest as a standard, various parameters were varied to examine their effects on a water supply function defined as a supply constant times <jats:italic>W</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>W</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>M</jats:italic></jats:sub>. The supply constant was found to be independent of soil texture and physical properties. Root density and the internal resistance of the plant to water flow were the most important determinants of the supply constant. Reasonable variation of root density and internal resistance produced variation in the constant from 1.9 mm/h, which implies that supply is less than demand only when soil is very dry, to 0.5 mm/hr, which implies that supply cannot meet the demand even when the soil is wet.</jats:p>",

These values corresponded to intakes of about 3.7kg and 7.1kg fresh silage, and 16g and 27g DM/kg liveweight, respectively.

This mutagenicity was found to be perpetual in the water from at least one sampling point and probably originated from the same source. Extraction of the mutagen(s) from the water was achieved by adsorption onto XAD-2 resin, followed by desorption with acetone. No base-pair substitution mutagen could be detected. Optical density, pH and electrical conductivity determinations showed that the relative contribution of surface and groundwater to the drinking-water at the different sampling points remained fairly constant during the survey. No correlation could be found between mutagenicity and the volatile halogenated organic compounds as well as the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in the waters. The survey was organized as part of an identification process, so that the results could be used not only to establish whether there was a need for further identification of the mutagen(s), but to furnish some of the information needed for their successful isolation.</jats:p>",

Under additional hypotheses, the equilibrium conditions are the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for a concave, quadratic programming problem. For the case in which the equilibrium conditions do not correspond to a programming problem, an iterative process for obtaining a solution is discussed. This iteration is motivated by the Project Independence Evaluation System (PIES) energy model algorithm. An algorithmic method to determine the sensitivity of an equilibrium solution vector to data perturbations is described. Both the sensitivity analysis and the convergence of the iterative solution method are based upon a solvability lemma, which guarantees that a solution of the equilibrium conditions may be expressed in terms of the problem data. Nondegeneracy assumptions for the inter-regional flows are unnecessary for this discussion. An example of the equilibrium problem which arose in modeling the supply and demand of eastern coal is briefly described. </jats:p>",

An analysis of this issue, drawing upon a wide array of empirical water use research, casts doubt upon the presumed connection. Water availability seems likely to have little effect upon the amenities which draw newcomers to Western cities. It also seems to have little effect upon the locational decisions of industries which affect growth by creating new jobs. Consequently, there is little reason to oppose municipal water restrictions as prejudicial to urban growth or to favor such restrictions in the hope of constraining growth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Off‐farm employment has become increasingly important as an aspect of resource adjustment and a source of income in Australian agriculture. However, it is surprising that there is a paucity of work on this topic reported in the agricultural economics literature. Therefore, we have drawn upon recent developments in labour economics in order to investigate off‐farm employment in Australia. A conceptual model of the allocation of a farmer's labour between farm and off‐farm work is developed and applied to cross‐sectional data from the Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey. A Tobit maximum likelihood procedure is utilised to test the influences of the life cycle, level of human capital, wealth, non‐wage income and farm income on the off‐farm labour supply of farmers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> The application of a water balance model in finding “solutions” to the supply/demand problem was demonstrated using the South Platte River basin as a case study. Solutions were ascertained by hand, using both “average” and “stress” supply/demand conditions, and were developed for 1980, 2000, and 2020; nonquantifiable boundary conditions were incorporated by judgement. The solution obtained for a particular set of conditions is not unique and has strong normative characteristics; thus it must be judged by various interest groups having different ethical positions. The water balance model has a tabular display format and so the “model” is merely a simple table, i.e., a “water balance table.” In this work the water balance table was displayed on an eight‐foot by eight‐foot color‐coded magnetic board. The board provides a means to both find and display the needed supply/demand “solution.” The tabular display facilitates understanding of the systemwide solution and the formulation of value judgments. Based upon these value judgments and an initial “straw man” solution, successive negotiated solutions can be found which can minimize “conflict.”</jats:p>",
