      "abstract": "<p>Water in ancient Greek cities can be considered under several rubrics— aesthetic enrichment of urban spaces, ornamentation of enclosed precincts, nuisance or danger in the form of flood or excessive storm runoff, domestic amenity, public ritual and spectacle, to name a few. This chapter focuses on public fountains, which were both amenity and necessity, contrasting them with the more humble domestic arrangements of the same cities. The appearance, function, and location of fountains cannot be understood as merely visual matters, even though the form and ornamentation of fountains made significant architectural and aesthetic contributions to the cityscape. Rather, understanding the local geology and climate and the principles of hydraulic engineering makes possible a new and clearer understanding of this architectural type. The technological and geological basis of water supply is of equal weight in urban development with the formal presentation of water as an urban amenity. Water management in ancient Greek cities expressed in its physical forms both the simplicity and the sophistication of their hydraulic technology. The physical arrangements were expressed in the same vocabulary of the Greek orders and decorative details that were used for other buildings and fittings, and in the same range of local and imported materials. Placement of the water system elements not only facilitated their use but also indicated the high value placed on water and on its use. The dangers of too much water or not enough were not only solved by Greek technological tradition but also expressed in the physical forms given to the individual parts and to the water system as a whole. Each of the water elements I have studied is simple, fulfilling its function economically, yet each is sophisticated enough that modern day practice is just beginning to catch up with these crafty ancients. For instance, having both the flowing water of fountains and wells, and the stored rainwater of cisterns, meant that the water supply of a Greek city was diversified for greater safety in time of war or shortage, and for ecological soundness. In the late twentieth century we are just beginning to understand the utility of redundancy.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply chain management is becoming an increasingly important issue, especially when in most industries the cost of materials purchased comprises 40–60% of the total sales revenue. Despite the benefits cited for single sourcing in the popular literature, there is enough evidence of industries having two/three sources for most parts. In this paper we address the operational issue of quantity allocation between two uncertain suppliers and its effects on the inventory policies of the buyer. Based on the type of delivery contract a buyer has with the suppliers, we suggest three models for the supply process. Model I is a one-delivery contract with all of the order quantity delivered either in the current period with probability β, or in the next period with probability 1 – β. Model II is also a one-delivery contract with a random fraction of the order quantity delivered in the current period; the portion of the order quantity not delivered is cancelled. Model III is similar to Model II with the remaining quantity delivered in the next period. We derive the optimal ordering policies that minimize the total ordering, holding and penalty costs with backlogging. We show that the optimal ordering policy in period n for each of these models is as follows: for x ≥ ū<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>, order nothing; for v̄<jats:sup>n</jats:sup> ≤ x &lt; ū<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>, use only one supplier; and for x &lt; v̄<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>, order from both suppliers. For the limiting case in the single period version of Model I, we derive conditions under which one would continue ordering from one or the other or both suppliers. For Model II, we give sufficient conditions for not using the second (more expensive) supplier when the demand and yield distributions have some special form. For the single period version of Models II and III with equal marginal ordering costs we show that the optimal order quantities follow a ratio rule when demand is exponential and yields are either normal or gamma distributed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper puts forward an explanation for the negative elasticity of supply of beef found in many LDC's. As is explained by Jarvis (1974), the elasticity of supply of beef may be negative in the short run due to the dual role of cattle as both a capital and a consumption good. But in some LDC's, and especially in Latin America, one may find a long‐run negative association between slaughter and prices, that cannot be explained by assuming shocks to slaughter are causing changes in prices. It is no coincidence that Jarvis' hypothesis itself was developed to explain developments in Argentina, a country with chronic high inflation. The paper argues that this long‐run relationship cannot be explained by the Jarvis hypothesis, and offers an alternative hypothesis based on the demand for cattle as a hedge against inflation.</jats:p><jats:p>The long‐run negative association between slaughter and prices has been found in high inflation countries. High inflation combined with excessive regulation of capital markets cause the well known phenomenon of desintermediation. It is argued here that cattle plays a role in the inflation hedged portfolio that is then demanded. Therefore, with imperfect capital markets the supply of beef is affected by the demand for cattle as an asset, and this demand, in turn, is affected by inflation. This paper will only attempt to prove the link between imperfect capital markets and the supply of beef. The way inflation in a repressed capital market leads to an imperfect capital market is not addressed here, for reasons of brevity. The paper will develop a model that in the context of imperfect capital markets results in a negative elasticity of supply. The model will then be tested with Uruguayan data. Uruguayan data are very adequate to test the hypothesis because they cover both a period without inflation and a period of high inflation. The results support that cattle was used as an alternative to money holdings when inflation signified a big tax on the latter. Inflation therefore affected the demand for cattle, or, conversely, the supply of beef.</jats:p>",

Expected served demand is employed to measure reliability taking into account both insufficient heads and flows at individual nodes in the network since it is the most important service level index provided to individual users. A basic method proposed is to assume that the insufficient nodal head reduces the effectiveness of flow supplied at the node and that the authority provides the maximum service to customers so that the real‐time pump and network flow operations maximize the effective served system demand. The average value of the maximum effective served system demand relative to the total system demand over all system states is defined as system reliability, and the nodal reliability for each demand node is similarly defined. The Markov chain method introduced by Beim and Hobbs (1988) is employed to describe the evolution of the storage level over time so that the real‐time pump and network flow operations can be accurately implemented by solving a nonlinear programming model. Two example systems are presented to demonstrate numerically the advantage of the method proposed in its consideration of the distribution network and nodal reliabilities.</jats:p>",

When unanticipated supply shocks are small, markdown behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that packers follow an average processing cost (APC) pricing rule. One implication of our results is that reducing industry concentration is not likely to lead to changes in cattle prices predicted by SCP‐based studies of the industry.</jats:p>",

The pathogenesis of the sequence is a subject of debate. However, a new hypothesis proposes that Möbius sequence results from an interruption of embryonic blood supply (subclavian artery supply disruption sequence). Here we present an infant with bilateral facial nerve palsy (VII), external ophthalmoplegia (IV, VI), paresis of cranial nerves V, IX, X, XI, and XII, absence of the pectoralis major muscle (Poland anomaly), terminal transverse limb defects, and absence of the right diaphragm. Also, he was found to have discrete foci of brainstem calcifications in the region of the dorsal respiratory group on both CT scan and the histologic sections with microscopic evidence of diffuse brainstem “injury.” The anomalies and histopathology noted in this infant imply that vascular insufficiency prior to the sixth week of gestation involving the proximal sixth intersegmental artery may result in the manifestations presented in this report and lend further support for the existence of a subclavian artery supply disruption sequence. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

Growth rates, photosynthetic capacity and enzymes of carbon and nitrogen metabolism were monitored to assess the acclimatory capacity of the chickpea. Initial growth rates were stimulated by high temperatures, particularly in nitrate‐fed and nodulated plants. Older HT plants had fewer laterals, smaller leaves, and fewer flowers were produced than in LT plants. There was some indication of an acclimation of photosynthesis to high temperatures and this was independent of nitrogen supply. Rubisco activity was increased by high growth temperatures. However, HT plants also had higher transpiration rates and lower water use efficiency than LT plants both in respective growth conditions and when compared in a common condition. High temperatures reduced shoot nitrate reductase activity but had little effect on root activity, which was the same if not greater than activity in LT roots. The amino acid, asparagine, was found at high concentrations in all treatments. Concentrations were maintained throughout growth in HT plants but declined with age in LT plants.</jats:p>",

Seedlings of a population from Bodø (67°N lat.) were grown in Leonard jars under controlled conditions in a phytotron. For induction of frost hardening, plants were first exposed to 12 h photoperiod conditions for 2 weeks at 18°C, then for 2 weeks at 6°C and finally for 2 weeks at 0.5°C. Frost hardiness after treatments at 6 and 0.5°C was significantly enhanced by increasing nitrogen supply and was positively correlated with total nitrogen content of the stolons. Frost hardiness of nodulated plants correlated to the tissue nitrogen concentration. Content of soluble proteins in stolons decreased during hardening at 6°C but did not change during treatment at 0.5°C. There were minor changes in total amount of free amino acids during hardening. Both absolute and relative amounts of proline and arginine increased, and those of asparagine decreased during hardening. Absolute amounts of all free amino acids increased with increasing nitrogen supply, but the changes during hardening were similar in all treatments. There was a significant increase in the content of soluble carbohydrates during hardening. However, this increase was inversely related to nitrogen supply.</jats:p>",

The results of the calculations, when combined with redox measurements of the cells in the growth plate, indicate that the metabolism of the chondrocytes is not controlled simply by the available oxygen supply. </jats:p>",
