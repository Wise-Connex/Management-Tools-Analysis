      "abstract": "<jats:p>The analysis conditions for measuring trace concentration of Cr(VI) based on the ion chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (IC-ICP-MS) method was examined. By optimizing the analysis conditions, the measurement of 0.02 μg-Cr(VI)/L was achieved with a high degree of accuracy. The behavior of Cr(VI) through the water treatment process in Osaka city was investigated and it was determined that there was a tendency that the Cr(VI) concentration slightly fluctuated throughout the water treatment process with the highest concentration being observed in finished water. The Cr(VI) concentration at the outlet of Kunijima purification plant was less than 0.02–0.13 μg/L, while water taps where retention time from the plant was 4–15 h, were less than 0.02–0.10 μg/L. Also, it was found that Cr(III) was oxidized to Cr(VI) by sodium hypochlorite and ozone being used in the water treatment process. Based on this finding, the oxidation reaction of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) was examined. When sodium hypochlorite was added to granular activated carbon (GAC)-treated water and purified water containing Cr(III), the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) proceeded and the Cr(VI) production in GAC-treated water was relatively higher. In addition, it was determined that the Cr(III) oxidation reaction rate depended on water temperature and it was faster when the water temperature was higher.</jats:p>",

A survey and interviews with decision‐makers in western <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">N</jats:styled-content>orth <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">C</jats:styled-content>arolina reveal that there is only low‐level concern about water quantity, and this drives a continued emphasis on supply‐side management and no perceived need for hydrological data. The historical realities of low demand and abundant water have generated a perception of ‘water supply’ as disconnected from physical, hydrological systems and allowed for ad hoc decision‐making processes to prevail. The lack of well‐established processes may, ironically, provide significant opportunities for employing collaboration among researchers and decision‐makers to develop policies and processes that integrate data into making water management decisions and thus prompt increased attention to water demand.</jats:p>",

Undoubtedly, the idea of renewable energy production can be justified and promising. However, it should be considered from a wider perspective of supply chain than merely focusing on the share of renewable sources in total energy production. The economic and ecological importance of biomass use to energy generation largely depends on the logistics of biomass supply to power plants. The location of biomass sources and the organization of supply are very important stages that impact on final economic results of energy production. Furthermore, the improper choice of means of transport and process organization for managing renewable sources of energy might have a negative ecological effect. Therefore, the authors attempted to analyze the cost-related aspects of biomass supply (including the seasonal biomass price fluctuation) to the analyzed power plant and the effect of this factor on financial results of energy production.</jats:p>"

Cooperation refers to the integration of different parts of an organization or different organizations in supply chain to accomplish a collective set of tasks and to achieve mutual benefits. The use of modern information technology (IT) decision support systems is fast becoming an indispensable tool for designing and managing complex supply chain systems today. This study describes a model of intelligent framework for cooperation in the supply chain environment. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate that agent technology can represent the supply chains by (a) reviewing intelligent agent applications for supply chain and (b) illustrating how a multi-agent system can provides a solution for supply chain cooperation. We review and synthesis existing applications in comparison to traditional and Internet-based technologies and critically evaluate agent technology applicability for supply chain management. This paper thus provides an intelligent framework for extended enterprise cooperation (i-SEEC) by adopting the techniques of the Semantic Web service and Multi-agents system. The proposed system can integrate different information technologies to make its behavior more intelligent and to catch more useful information from supply chain actors.</jats:p>"

The paper shows that compensating option price does not generally rank three or more projects correctly, even when the projects only impose a change in a single good. Equivalent option price, like equivalent variation with certain outcomes, always ranks three or more projects correctly. This paper also presents a method to empirically estimate equivalent option price using estimates of the benefits of certain changes. This approach is practically important so that the same study results can be used to estimate equivalent option price even as new projects are developed or as changes occur in the scientific information regarding the probabilities of various project outcomes. An application of the empirical method estimates the benefits of a policy to improve air and water quality when there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the policy.</jats:p>",

Different seed production initiatives are undertaken by public and private sectors. However, their role and effectiveness on seed sector development have not been assessed. A review on secondary data related to seed production and usage and primary data collected from different public and private organizations in the year 2011were used to assess the role of District Level Seed Self Sufficiency Program and Community Based Seed Production program on current seed supply situation in Nepal. DISSPRO is the most popular, widely adopted and cheapest seed producing program with annual production of 40.4% followed by CBSP 3.83% of the total certified/improved seeds in the country. The seed production trend of DISSPRO and CBSP is rapidly increasing. Strengthening seed sector through the integration of DISSPRO, CBSP and other seed initiatives together with effective enforcement of seed regulation for quality seed multiplication, distribution and use is necessary for rapid rise on SRR, enhancing crop production and food security in Nepal.

These phases took place at different periods of agricultural research, with a common thread to improve our knowledge of the impact of diseases on crop yield quantity and quality. In this review, we provide a discussion on these phases. In particular, we emphasize the seminal research that has laid a foundation for a new phase to develop. We do this through an examination of the measurement of injury and crop losses, the current statistical models used to define thresholds and damage functions, and what is currently known regarding qualitative losses. Crop loss research enters a fourth phase of crop loss assessment, the multi-criteria assessment phase. In the latter portion of the review, we provide a brief discussion on the efforts, the concepts, and the necessary multidisciplinary dialogue, that the multi-criteria assessment phase requires in order for crop loss assessment to truly change the ways diseases are managed and how management itself is truly seen among the disciplinary fields that contribute to sustainable agricultural development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to investigate the effect of different wavelengths (254, 266, 280 and 365 nm) in polychromatic medium-pressure (MP) UV radiation on the ability of photolyases in repairing dimers and discusses its impact on subsequent photoreactivation. Photolyase was exposed to various doses and irradiances of the UV wavelengths and the dimer repair abilities of the irradiated photolyase were determined via a spectrophotometric assay. At wavelengths below 300 nm, dimer repair rates were not influenced by the UV irradiation between 0.03 and 0.10 mW cm−2. For 365 nm, photolyase exhibited enhanced dimer repair at 0.05 mW cm−2 and then reduced dimer repair with increasing irradiance. In addition, photolyase was found to have decreasing dimer repair rates when exposed to increasing UV doses at all tested wavelengths. Lower photoreactivation levels after MP UV disinfection as compared to low-pressure (LP) UV disinfection was not attributable to a single wavelength in the polychromatic radiation, but is possibly due to the simultaneous exposure of photolyase to a broad spectrum of radiation, which led to a reduction in the dimer repair ability of photolyase. This study is the first to report the direct effects of UV radiation on photolyase enzyme. The data in the study provide some evidence for the mechanism for which MP UV disinfection suppresses photoreactivation in Escherichia coli, which has only been speculated on so far. The knowledge from this study will provide a basis upon which to investigate other enzymes involved in the repair of UV damage to DNA.</jats:p>",

To explore particular phenomena, water distribution analysis may require a coherent set of cases. Readily available in the literature are simple synthetic networks used for benchmarking, either real-life cases that are too diverse in size and configuration. The network generation tool (NGT) developed on the principles of graph theory connects any seed of nodes prepared in EPANET modelling software, by avoiding pipe crossings or unnecessary duplications. The pipe properties can be assigned by specifying a range of arbitrary lengths and diameters, by using coordinates to calculate the lengths, or by genetic algorithm optimisation of initial diameters. Equally, the nodal elevations and demands are arbitrarily assigned when not predefined in EPANET. Several sets of networks have been generated, up to 200 junctions. To test robustness of the tool, 13,000 layouts of a 50-junction seed have been generated using different settings. NGT has been proven to be capable of executing this task mostly within a few minutes, producing network layouts that resemble those from practice.</jats:p>",

The DOC was fractionated into six fractions based on hydrophobicity and acid base functionality: hydrophobic acid (HPOA), hydrophobic base (HPOB), hydrophobic neutral (HPON), hydrophilic acid (HPIA), hydrophilic base (HPIB), and hydrophilic neutral (HPIN). The trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of the isolated fractions was measured. Fractions collected from the Red River showed significant variation in the specific THMFP, normalized to DOC concentration, ranging from 23 to 1,372 μg THM/mg DOC, while the Assiniboine River THMFP ranged from 11 to 575 μg THM/mg DOC. Although the DOC composition of the two rivers was similar, the THMFP for the fractions differed significantly. The Red River HPOB and HPIB fractions had the highest normalized THMFP of 1,002 μg THM/mg DOC and 1,372 μg THM/mg DOC, respectively, while the HPOA fraction showed the lowest with 23 μg THM/mg DOC. Comparatively, the HPOA fraction from the Assiniboine River was found to have a higher specific THMFP of 478 μg THM/mg DOC. These findings suggest that THM formation is dependent on unique organic composition of the local water and that caution should be taken when estimating THMFP from DOC fractions isolated from different water sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Despite the efforts made towards the millennium goals targets during the last decade, access to improved water supply or basic sanitation remains still not accessible for millions of people across the world. This paper proposes a set of models that use 25 key variables from the WatSan4Dev dataset and country profiles involving Water Supply and Sanitation (Dondeynaz et al., 2012). This paper proposes the use of Bayesian Network modelling methods because adapted to the management of non-normal distribution, and integrate a qualitative approach for data analysis. They also offer the advantage to integrate preliminary knowledge into the probabilistic models. The statistical performance of the proposed models ranges between 80 and 95% which is very satisfactory taking into account the strong heterogeneity of variables. Probabilistic scenarios run from the models allow a quantification of the relationships between human development, external support, governance aspects, economic activities and Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) access.  According to models proposed in this paper, a strong poverty reduction will induce an increment of the WSS access equal to 75–76% through: (1) the organisation of on-going urbanisation process to avoid slums development; and, (2) the improvement of health care for instance for children.  On one side, improving governance, such as institutional efficiency, capacities to make and apply rules or control of corruption will also have a positive impact on WSS sustainable development. The first condition for an increment of the WSS access remains of course an improvement of the economic development with an increment of household income.  Moreover, a significant country environmental commitment associated with civil society freedom of expression constitutes a favourable environment for sustainable WSS services delivery. Intensive agriculture through irrigation practises also appears as a mean for sustainable WSS thanks to multi-uses and complementarities. Strong and structured agriculture sector facilitates rural development in areas where WSS access often steps behind compared to urban areas1. External financial support, named Official Development Aid (ODA), plays a role in WSS improvement but comes last in the sensitivity analyses of models.  This aid supports first poor countries at 47%, and is associated to governance aspects: (1) political stability and (2) country environmental commitment and civil society degree of freedom. These governance aspects constitute a good framework for aid implementation in recipient countries.  Modelling is run with the five groups of countries as defined in Dondeynaz et al. (2012). Models for profile 4 (essential external support) and profile 5 (primary material consumption) are specifically detailed and analysed in this paper. For countries in profile 4, to fight against water scarcity and desertification pressure should be the priority. However, for countries in profile 5, efforts should first concentrate on political stability consolidation while supporting economic activity diversification. Nevertheless, for both profiles, reduction of poverty should remain the first priority as previously indicated.  1 JMP statistics, 2004 http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/table/\n                        </jats:p>"

Where business operates across national boundaries whether as multinational companies (MNCs) or as lead firms in international supply chains, the relational nature of power relationships between and within firms is significant to understanding the bargaining power of labour at the point of production (Coe et al., 2008a). Although there is no single body of theory relating to the analysis of international supply chains, the article argues that the perspectives developed by different authors relating to global commodity chains (GCCs), global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs) have a contribution to make to labour process analysis. This contribution lies in the understanding of the contested nature of systems of managerial control, on the one hand, and the sources of resistance and ability of labour to mobilize, on the other. </jats:p>",

From 2010 onwards important changes have taken place to the way ODA is reported including disaggregation between aid flows for water supply and aid flows for sanitation. This paper reports findings from a consultative group regarding issues requiring clarification for the revised codes to be applied consistently. These include: disaggregation of water and sanitation from within integrated water sector projects; disaggregation of water and sanitation components from projects in other sectors; clarity on working definitions of ‘large and basic’ when reporting water and sanitation projects; capacity development that directly supports implementation; and recording the transition from projects to programme-based aid. Case studies drawn from donors' reporting of ODA are used to illustrate key issues for users of ODA statistical information who aim to capture data on aid flows to the water sector.</jats:p>",

The hypothesis that any predictable monetary policy has no influence on output is extended by the inclusion of foreign exchange rationing to the supply side of the economy as cointegrated with money supply. The final prediction error determines the proper lag length that is used by the dynamic analysis to examine the causality relationship between imports, foreign price, foreign income, and output. The vector autoregressive is used to determine the exogeneity property of foreign exchange and output; it also helps extract the anticipated and unanticipated components of foreign exchange and money series. Empirical evidence provides considerable support for short run cyclical movements in the output of highly industrialized countries in affecting the real output in the United States. Indeed, any policy response in raising output should take into account the well-being of other developed countries. Predicted or not, an increase in the level of growth of other advanced countries does not leads to offsetting expectation and results in raising the economic growth. Empirical test presents no evidence that boosting the money supply leads to an increase in the level of growth. The result also refutes the view that the United States can quickly recover through a monetary policy aimed at depreciating the dollar and stands against the idea that devaluation tends to expand domestic output in industrialized countries. Incompatible with the economic logic is the lack of support of the apparent reality of output determination in industrialized countries open economy models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the extant vertical integration literature, the question of how a firm's portfolio of outsourced work is managed across suppliers has been relatively understudied. We seek to advance this area of research by examining factors that influence how concentrated the firm's outsourcing is among its set of suppliers. Using data on the outsourcing of patent legal services, we find empirical evidence that outsourced knowledge-based service work is concentrated in the hands of fewer suppliers when (1) it requires greater firm-specific knowledge, (2) there is a higher level of interrelatedness across outsourced projects, (3) the firm's reliance on outsourcing is high, (4) its outsourced projects are focused on a narrower (capability) domain, and (5) the technological dynamism of this domain is low. Our study suggests that examining portfolio-level phenomena in outsourcing is a useful complement to the predominant focus on transaction-level outcomes in prior research because it provides insights into how firms manage trade-offs across their entire set of outsourced projects. </jats:p>",

The biosand filter (BSF), an intermittently operated slow sand filter, was developed to address this problem. The BSF is used in homes to improve water quality. Three main objectives were examined in this research: (1) investigate initial startup and recovery performance after cleaning BSF, (2) examine the number of people the BSF may effectively serve, and (3) determine effects of an extended pause period on BSF performance. Laboratory experiments examined the BSF's ability to reduce fecal coliforms (FC) and turbidity for the various objectives. Results indicate that during the startup period, 27 days were needed to achieve 1 log reduction, while only 17 days were needed after cleaning the BSF to achieve 1 log reduction. A maximum of six people can be effectively served by a single BSF based upon the results of the experiment. A 7-day extended pause period determined that the bacterial layer will begin to go dormant or die off when the filter is not used for an extended period.</jats:p>",

A combination of advanced oxidation by UV/H2O2 treatment and granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration is installed. Medium pressure UV experiments in a standard pilot reactor have been carried out into the degradation of a representative selection of pesticides found in PWN's main raw water source, the IJssel Lake. It was observed that atrazine and diuron are more sensitive to direct photodegradation while bentazone and bromacil are primarily degraded by hydroxyl radical oxidation. Addition of H2O2 increased the decay rate of all selected herbicides. Using computational fluid dynamics, irradiance distribution and kinetic models developed by Trojan Technologies Inc., an optimized UV-reactor was designed. In tests with a pilot reactor according to this new design, the predicted performance was confirmed, both for photodegradation and hydroxyl radical oxidation. During the research period, the scope broadened from pesticides to pharmaceuticals, endocrine disrupting compounds, solvents and algae toxins. At process conditions 0.56 kWh/m3 and 6 mg/L H2O2, 80–100% degradation was achieved for compounds such as mecoprop, clofibric acid and diclofenac. A somewhat lower degradation was found for dicamba, 2, 4-D, bentazone, ibuprofen, carbamazepine and sulphametoxalol. The developed modelling was used to design a full scale UV/H2O2 system with an electric energy of 0.56 kWh/m3 for treatment of 3,000 m3/h. In a site acceptance test, degradation of atrazine was measured at two UV-doses at a fixed H2O2 dose of 6 mg/L. The installation performed as predicted by the design models and design criteria were met. At wtp Andijk, UV/H2O2 is integrated in the existing process train, preceded by conventional surface water treatment (coagulation, sedimentation and filtration) and followed by GAC filtration providing a robust barrier against reaction products from both oxidation and photolytic degradation (assimilable organic carbon, nitrite). Replacing the conventional pretreatment by ion exchange followed by ceramic microfiltration will further improve the economics of UV/H2O2 treatment.</jats:p>",

The second is to optimize water supply and distribution from the standpoint of water quality based on total organic carbon and the third is to attempt optimization that satisfies the first two objectives through multipurpose fuzzy linear programming (LP). This study mathematically formulates water operation planning issues focusing on reducing energy consumption and improving water quality in a water distribution system. Estimates show that a reduction in energy use of around 10% can be expected. Fuzzy LP is applied to achieve a balance among multiple objectives.

This evaluation tests the policies and provides a comparison of donor supported and government projects. The results indicate that policies will result in relatively high levels of beneficiary satisfaction and will increase the likelihood that the communities will sustain the systems over their design lives. More confidence in Water User Associations as governing and management bodies for water schemes is medium and more transparent selection processes are required. Although beneficiaries are agreeing to and paying tariffs that cover operation and maintenance costs, it affects the quantity of water they use and leads to negative health impact. High percentages of respondents have expressed dissatisfaction with current water charges, water quantity and water quality. Findings suggest that RWS Project's strategy for developing communities' capacity and meaningful involvement in planning and managing their own water systems is effective, however, progress is needed in two areas: RWS subsector still lacks a clearly agreed strategy and a demand-responsive approach should be adopted strictly in all programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays significant role in water safety due to not only the natural occurrence but also man-induced pollution. To characterize and predict DOM treatability becomes therefore a very important and hot topic. In this paper, enhanced coagulation by four typical coagulants (FeCl3, Al2(SO4)3, polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and high performance polyaluminum chloride (HPAC)) without pH control was characterized using the chemical fractionation (resin adsorption, RA) and physical fractionation (high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) combined with peak fitting technique). The results show that the DOM removal can be separated into two stages, rapid removal and continual slow removal. The PAC exhibits efficient removal in the rapid part while the traditional salts are more efficient in the latter part. It is also very important for pH control to improve DOM removal by the traditional coagulants. DOM treatability per unit dosage (1 × 10−4 mol/l) for the four coagulants was then calculated in the order of HPAC (26.0%) &amp;gt; PAC (17.3%) &amp;gt; FeCl3 (14.3%) &amp;gt; Al2(SO4)3 (12.0%). Two sets of DOM treatability models, i.e. removal efficiency, for enhanced coagulation of the four coagulants were developed by combining the chemical and physical DOM fractions based on the quantitative analysis of the removal state of raw water. The two sets of models could be transformed to each other. The composition of the removable DOM by enhanced coagulation of the four coagulants was revealed and validated using 29 raw waters (in 13 source waters in three seasons), and as a result the low deviation indicated that the predicted data matched well with the actual data. It provided the possibility for the application in practical operation of water plant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Drinking water treatment plants in South Africa rely almost entirely on surface water sources, which are often compromised due to high return flows and indirect reuse. The typical treatment plants focus on the removal of physical and microbial contaminants which include turbidity, colour, chemical compounds and microorganisms. A relatively new concern to this list is natural organic matter (NOM) which has become a major concern in potable water treatment due to its recent regulation. In this study, eight different raw water samples from the various water types found in the country were seasonally collected and treated for the removal UV absorbance at a wavelength of 254 nm (UV254) using enhanced coagulation (EC). The efficacy of EC, which can be employed as a practical technology in the removal of both turbidity and NOM, was evaluated in remaining UV254 from these raw water sources. Jar tests were conducted, with ferric chloride used as the coagulant (due to its extensive use as a coagulant in the water treatment industry in South Africa) and specific pH values (initial water pH, 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0 and 4.5) were chosen as target values guiding the six different coagulant dosages for the jar tests. The pH of the low-alkalinity (&amp;lt;60 mg/L CaCO3) raw waters were adjusted and raised by the addition of sodium carbonate. The response parameters of the tests were turbidity (NTU), pH and UV254. Algorithms for finding the optimum coagulant dosage for UV254 removal were developed and consistently applied to all the results. Results showed large variations in the nature of NOM across the country from specific ultraviolet absorbance values. From the UV254 values, the concentrations of NOM also varied greatly geographically than temporally. The general trend observed in the EC results suggested that the pH should always be dropped to between 4.5 and 7.0 to lower the amounts of UV254 and turbidity to reasonable levels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Today, public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the water supply and sanitation sector, including the affermage, are increasingly hybrid, performance-based models. These include evolved, more sophisticated affermage models – such as what we refer to as the performance-based affermage (PBA). This model is based on an incentive-driven and more equitable distribution of the efficiency gains between the operator and the contracting authority (CA). The operator's expenses are reduced through efficiency improvements; the operator's fee reduces and the payment to the CA increases. The operational surplus increases and its eventual distribution depends on whether or not the operator meets its financial and technical contractual targets. Hence the PBA model may be more politically attractive to public authorities whose bargaining power to demand improved service delivery from the operator is strengthened. Key preconditions for the successful implementation of a PBA include: (i) an incentive mechanism based on an audited and validated baseline, and (ii) a capable CA, leading to a balance of power and mutual respect between partners. This output-based affermage (PBA) option is structured with appropriate investment obligations and allocation of risks between the operator and the CA. These are based on each entity's ability to manage risks – and both are rewarded on their performance and the respective levels of risk assumed.</jats:p>",

Second, using the stationary state, we define the stochastic perturbation and study the squared mean values of the system states for the linearised model. Third, we prove that for certain parameters, the stationary state in the deterministic model is asymptotically stable. Similarly, we also prove that the squared mean values of the variables in the linearised stochastic model are asymptotically stable. Finally, we perform the comparative dynamic analysis for the propensities to save and to enjoy leisure, the tax rates used to finance research and the knowledge utilisation efficiency.</jats:p>",

Indeed, due to political or environmental reasons, a possible supply restriction policy could be applied by producers. The present work aims to contribute to assessing possible shortage periods, if such scenarios occur. Our approach consists in carrying out a prospective modelling and simulation of the lithium market. We use a Multi-Agent System (MAS) method so that the individual behaviour of the market players is considered. The results of our work enabled us to conclude in a time-limited risk of a shortage in France, even in the event of a restriction combined with an increase in demand. Regarding the rest of the world, the conclusion is more pessimistic. In that case, the work attempted to search possible alternative supply scenarios to compensate shortages resulting from restrictions. At a methodological level, this work provided a promising test regarding a first application of MAS on the modelling of an industrial mining market (a field of macroeconomics). This methodological choice was motivated by the increasing interest aroused by MAS in this field since the economic crisis, generated by individual behaviour, began in 2009; a crisis, where an important supply shortage may be a future occurrence.</jats:p>"

The risks considered include damage caused by pipe failure (main burst) like revenue loss, third party property damage as well as damage to intangible assets (loss of company reputation). The innovative part of this concept is the intelligent combination of a remaining-service-life prognosis for pipelines with structural load factor verification, technical condition assessments, geo-referenced analyses and detailed costing. This approach allows a very detailed risk assessment of several thousand pipe sections (high spatial resolution approach). The outcome based on this concept are the required maintenance items (what and where) and a catalogue of maintenance actions (how and when) including maintenance type and costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Netherlands, biological trickling filters without chemical pre-oxidation are generally applied to treat anaerobic groundwater, containing methane, iron, ammonium and manganese. Previous research showed that all compounds can be removed in one filter step and that not only the ammonia oxidation (by nitrification), but also the iron oxidation is often a biological process, despite oxygen saturated conditions and neutral pH. However, the optimal conditions for each process differs. In this paper, we report the preliminary results of a demonstration plant (40 m3 h–1) with two consecutive trickling filtration steps. The first highly loaded filter removed 1–1.5 ppm of methane and 5–6 ppm of iron with filtration rates up to 30 m h−1. The second filter step removed 5–6 ppm of ammonium and 0.5–0.6 ppm of manganese virtually completely at 2 m h−1. Quantitative (real time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) indicated that the growth of methane-oxidizing bacteria was marginal, but biological iron oxidation by Gallionella bacteria accounted for a quarter to over half of the total iron conversion.</jats:p>",

Supply voltage (V<jats:sub> CC </jats:sub>) and switching activity factor (α) are main sources of dynamic power dissipation in CMOS technology. Furthermore, the power dissipation increases exponentially by the value of supply voltage. New approach based on switching activity analysis and multiple supply voltage is implemented successfully in logical circuits, taking in mind the critical path(s) of the design and switching activity factor of each element in the design. High supply voltage is applied on elements on the critical path(s). Elements off the critical path(s) are classified into categories according to their switching activity factors. The total power dissipation is reduced, while the propagation delay remains without any increase. The proposed approach combines the concepts of critical/non-critical paths and switching activity analysis to assign different V<jats:sub> CCs </jats:sub> to different elements. </jats:p>",

The results indicated that ozonation and GAC treatment showed limited ability to remove hydrophilic fractions (23%), while removal of hydrophobic fractions was 72%. The contribution of hydrophilic fractions to HAA formation increased from 30 to 61% along the treatment train because of better removal for hydrophobic fractions both in concentration and reactivity.

We analyzed three contracts of revenue sharing (RS), overproduction risk sharing (OS), and combination of RS and OS (RO), and contrasted them with uncoordinated model. We studied the optimal order decision for downstream manufacturer and the optimal production decision for upstream manufacturer. Numerical examples were presented to illustrate the results. The study showed that the RS contract and OS sharing contract both have their advantages and disadvantages and the RO contract could benefit the whole supply chain best. We found out that the OS contract gives the upstream manufacturer incentive to produce more so as to maximize the profit value, but the upstream manufacturer may receive less as the price of overproduced part increases. We also found out that under most scenarios, the supply chain benefits from the yields and demand risks reduction and generates a higher profit. But sometimes in the OS contract the downstream manufacturer profit can increase as yields randomness increases. And, in the uncoordinated case and OS contract, the upstream manufacturer profit can increase as demand randomness increases. </jats:p>",

The market is asymmetric because the buyers can carry inventory of the products ordered but the suppliers cannot store their capacity. In such a market, we might expect to see something like a price for capacity emerge to equilibrate demand and supply. The financial risk of participating in such a market will be driven by the volatility of the capacity price. In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty. We use continuous time stochastic optimal control techniques and numerical experiments to demonstrate these insights. </jats:p>",

Removal of DOM and bromide in raw water from two different waterworks using magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX), ferric coagulation and their combination was investigated. Results showed that as MIEX dose increased, DOM and bromide coexisting in raw water could be removed effectively. DOM tended to be mainly removed by MIEX at low dose (&amp;lt;4 mL/L), regardless of the bromide concentration. Bromide could compete for exchange sites with DOM at high MIEX dosage (&amp;gt;4 mL/L). The fluorescence spectra and high performance size-exclusion chromatogram analysis indicated that at low MIEX dosage, bromide decreased the removal of low molecular weight (MW), soluble microbial byproduct-like and aromatic protein-like organic matters, which had lower affinity with MIEX in raw water. The removal of high MW humic acid, which presented greater affinity with MIEX, was not influenced at low MIEX dose but decreased at high MIEX dose with the addition of bromide. The combination of MIEX and ferric coagulation significantly enhanced the removal of DOM and reduced the requisite ferric dose by at least 67% compared to coagulation alone.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Side weirs are widely used to divert flows from rivers and channels. However, the hydraulic behavior of this type of weir is complex and difficult to predict accurately. Previous studies on side weirs have generally focused on side weirs in rectangular channels with a smooth bed. However, one of the applications of side weirs is in irrigation systems which have trapezoidal cross sections and significant bed roughness. The present study investigates the hydraulic behavior of a broad crested side weir in an earthen channel with a rough bed under subcritical flow. These investigations showed that the side weir discharge coefficient is influenced by four main parameters which are upstream Froude number, ratio of the main channel width to the upstream flow depth, ratio of the length of the side weir to the main channel width and ratio of side weir height to the upstream flow depth. The results showed that the discharge coefficient of the side weir gives a lower coefficient value compared to other researchers’ equations. Nearly 90 experimental tests were carried out and finally new equations are proposed for prediction of discharge coefficient of a broad crested side weir in an earthen channel under subcritical conditions which can be mainly used in common irrigation systems.</jats:p>",

Principal component analysis of the water was conducted. In the first principal component, many elements exhibited high factor loadings, whereas the major contributor for the second principal component was iron (Fe). The unlined steel pipe, which was beyond its working lifetime, had a significantly high Fe content in suspended solids. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis showed differences in the abundance ratios of Fe3O4 and α-FeOOH among the sampling points. It was concluded that the concentration and speciation of Fe in supplied water can be a useful index for detecting the ageing of pipes.</jats:p>",

The quality of each product unit is measured by a continuous variable that follows a normal distribution and is correlated within a batch. The firm conducts an inspection and pays the supplier only if the product batch passes the inspection. The inspection not only serves the purpose of preventing a bad batch from reaching customers but also offers the supplier an incentive to improve product quality. The firm determines the acceptance sampling plan, and the supplier determines the quality effort level in either a simultaneous game or a Stackelberg leadership game, in which both parties share inspection cost and recall loss caused by low product quality. In the simultaneous game, we identify the Nash equilibrium form, provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, and find parameter settings under which the decentralized and centralized supply chains achieve the same outcome. By numerical experiments, we show that the firm's acceptance sampling plan and the supplier's quality effort level are sensitive to both the recall loss sharing ratio and the game format (i.e., the precommitment assumption of the inspection policy). © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The aim of the study is to use a new chemical oxidation method to degrade TCE source pollution in groundwater. Fenton-like reactions (hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by iron minerals generates hydroxyl radicals) and sodium persulfate activation (sodium persulfate activated by heat/iron minerals to produce sulfate radicals) have strong oxidative capacity to degrade a wide range of organic contaminants. In this work, hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium persulfate catalyzed by siderite (designated as STO, SO, PO systems, respectively) degrading TCE in groundwater were investigated. Removal rates of TCE in STO, SO, and PO systems were 100%, 57%, 20%, respectively. The order of TCE removal rates is in agreement with that of hydroxyl radicals generated in the systems, indicating that hydroxyl radicals play a critical role in removing TCE. No by-product except CO2, Cl− and H2O generated as final products in the STO system suggests that TCE was near completely mineralized. The results show that the STO is an effective method to treat TCE contaminated source in groundwater.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hollow fiber membranes are of great commercial interest with several applications at the forefront of research to carryout bioseparations, drinking water purification, wastewater treatment besides liquid phase separations and gaseous separations. An experimental study was carried out to synthesize hollow fiber membranes from polyethersulfone (PES) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymers to fabricate modules for surface water treatment and clarification of fungal enzyme broth. Design drawings of a manual hollow fiber spinning machine and spinneret were prepared to fabricate the necessary equipment for extrusion of hollow fibers. Effect of various spinning conditions on specific macroscopic fiber properties, such as outer diameter and wall thickness and membrane pore structure was studied. Concentrations of 15–20 wt% PES in n-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and PAN in dimethyl formamide (DMF) solvents with important additives and pore formers were prepared. These polymer solutions were extruded through the spinneret and subjected to phase inversion in a water bath. The membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and pure water flux studies. PAN and PES exhibited 99.8 and 95.4% turbidity rejection. PAN exhibited a 5 log reduction of Escherichia coli bacteria for surface water treatment at a low hydraulic pressure of 1 bar with a flux of 54.2 L/m2 h at a water recovery of 80% whereas PES gave a flux of 36.6 L/m2 h with 4 log reduction of E. coli. PAN and PES membranes exhibited 54.9 and 69.3% xylanase enzyme recoveries from fungal broth at reasonable flux with turbidity rejection of 94.8 and 95.7% respectively.</jats:p>",

This research conceptualizes three dimensions of supply chain responsiveness and develops a reliable and valid instrument for measuring this construct. The study further tests the relationships between supply chain management (SCM) practices, supply chain responsiveness, and competitive advantage using structural equation modeling based on 294 responses from industry professionals in the manufacturing and supply chain area. Research findings point out that higher level of SCM practices can lead to improved supply chain responsiveness and enhanced competitive advantage of a firm.

The method is used to compute price‐reaction functions that show how the prices of the different stages in a food supply chain dynamically respond to each other and whether or not these responses reveal any asymmetric patterns. Empirical applications for the U.S. pork‐meat and broiler‐composite chains illustrate the convenience of the method and reveal that in the pork chain asymmetric price transmission enables retailers (wholesalers) to increase their marketing margin vis‐à‐vis the wholesalers (farmers), whereas in the broiler sector the retailers face both temporary decreases and increases in their marketing margin as a consequence of asymmetric wholesale‐retail price transmission.</jats:p>",

We focus on the role that private information about demand has on firms' ability to align their capacity decisions. When forecasts are private information, there are at most two equilibria: a complete coordination failure or a monotone equilibrium. The former equilibrium always exists, whereas the latter exists only when the marginal cost of capacity is sufficiently low. We also show that both truthful information sharing and preplay communication have an equilibrium with higher profits. We then test the model's predictions experimentally. Contrary to our theoretical predictions, we show that private demand forecasts do not have a consistently negative effect on firm profits, though capacities are more misaligned. We show that preplay communication may be more effective at increasing profits than truthful information sharing. Finally, we document that “honesty is the best policy” when communicating private information. </jats:p>",

However, all such measures are expensive and difficult to implement, and decisions about if and to what extent such measures should be applied hinge on the magnitude of benefits and associated costs. We used an integrated forest estate pest-impact planning model to quantify harvest impacts for three plausible outbreak scenarios, and the effect of these typical mitigation strategies for 3.0 million ha in New Brunswick. Cumulative harvest reductions, relative to the no defoliation case, reached 18% and 25% by 2052 under moderate and severe defoliation patterns, respectively. We demonstrate that up to 30% to 50% of these projected reductions could be avoided through foliage protection treatments, depending on the outbreak scenario. Salvage and re-planning mitigated harvest losses by up to 20% in the short term (20 to 25 years), but had little benefit over the long run (40+ years). Even with aggressive implementation of all mitigation measures, significant harvest impacts (10% reduction from 2017 to 2042) were unavoidable, regardless of outbreak scenario. </jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to evaluate water treatment performance with a sharp increase in raw-water turbidity. This evaluation was carried out from the perspective of turbidity response by a pilot-scale plant using sand filtration and membrane filtration with coagulation–sedimentation pretreatment. Two coagulants were used; namely, polyaluminum chloride with a basicity of either 72% (PACl-72%) or 51% (PACl-51%). Raw-water turbidity was increased from 5 to 300 TU by adding kaolin suspension. In the case of sand filtration, the filtered-water turbidity increased during the filter stabilization period. An increase in the coagulant dosage produced a more rapid decrease in the filtered-water turbidity and shortened the filter stabilizing period. Filtered-water turbidity decreased more rapidly for PACl-72% than for PACl-51%. In the case of membrane filtration, an increase in raw-water turbidity caused no significant increase in filtered-water turbidity or transmembrane pressure. These results demonstrated that, although neither filtration technique completely failed, membrane filtration was more robust than sand filtration against a sharp increase in raw-water turbidity.</jats:p>",

The milestone of this experimental work was to determine the adsorption and filtration capacities and the physicochemical properties of five commercial activated carbons with a view to determining which activated carbon might replace the open sand filters of the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) of the city of Salamanca (western Spain). Compliance with the requirements and physicochemical characteristics stipulated in the EN 12915 European standard for the different activated carbons tested was analyzed, and studies of the prewashing and behavior of the carbons operating in the filters were performed. In this sense, filtration tests to study the saturation of the bed, the variations in pressure drop and the performance of the removal of organic matter in suspension were carried out. Furthermore, the optimal time and rate of the countercurrent washing of the filters and the expansion of the filter bed were evaluated. In the adsorption assays, the specific surface area, porosity, useful lifetime and capacity of adsorption of the dissolved organic matter –especially humic acids, the major precursors of water chlorination by-products – of the activated carbons were determined. The results not only provided an overview of the actual behavior of different types of commercial activated carbons from their initial installation up to the end of their useful life, but also permitted optimization of the filtration and adsorption processes that could lead to the corresponding economic savings and energy reduction in the use of such activated carbon filter-adsorbers.</jats:p>",

Standard linear programming was used to test the effects of four key policy issues: (1) aim for a targeted forest age structure inspired by natural fire regime and forest dynamics (multi-cohort approach), (2) agglomerate harvest blocks in operating areas to reproduce natural disturbance patterns at the landscape scale, (3) maintain cumulated clearcutting and natural disturbance rates inside the historical range of variability, and (4) exclude from harvest areas of potential interest to aboriginal people. The targeted forest age structure was achieved with a minimum reduction of periodic timber supply, but only after 50 years. Compared to a “business-as-usual” scenario, inclusion of the first three policy issues resulted in a 3% to 11% reduction in planned timber supply and a restoration period requiring that 43% to 67% of the productive area be excluded from clearcutting activities for the next 50 years. Such results require that partial cutting not be confined to operating areas eligible for clearcutting. Further exclusion of forest areas of potential interest to aboriginal people resulted in an additional 4% to 10% decrease in planned timber supply. Validation of the coarse filters used in this study (first three policy issues) was done using habitat requirements of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Almost all scenarios induced a disturbance rate likely to allow a self-sustaining woodland caribou population within 25 years.</jats:p>",

The effects of nitrate and ammonium on gene expression, enzyme activity and metabolite composition have been documented extensively with the aim of understanding the way in which plant cells respond to the different forms of nitrogen, but ultimately the impact of these changes on the organisation and operation of the central metabolic network can only be addressed by analysing the fluxes supported by the network. Accordingly steady‐state metabolic flux analysis was used to define the metabolic phenotype of a heterotrophic <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">A</jats:styled-content>rabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic> cell culture grown in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M</jats:styled-content>urashige and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">S</jats:styled-content>koog and ammonium‐free media, treatments that influenced growth and biomass composition. Fluxes through the central metabolic network were deduced from the redistribution of label into metabolic intermediates and end products observed when cells were labelled with [1‐<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]‐, [2‐<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]‐ or [<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>]glucose, in tandem with <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C‐measurements of the net accumulation of biomass. Analysis of the flux maps showed that: (i) flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway varied independently of the reductant demand for biosynthesis, (ii) non‐plastidic processes made a significant and variable contribution to the provision of reducing power for the plastid, and (iii) the inclusion of ammonium in the growth medium increased cell maintenance costs, in agreement with the futile cycling model of ammonium toxicity. These conclusions highlight the complexity of the metabolic response to a change in nitrogen nutrition.</jats:p>",

The Dhc transcriptome was examined at three time‐points throughout a batch feeding cycle: <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (27 h) when TCE, dichloroethene (DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC) were present; <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (54 h) when only VC remained; and <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> (13 days) when Dhc had been starved of substrate for 9 days. Ninety percent of the Dhc open reading frames (ORFs) that were detected in the ANAS DNA were found to be expressed as RNA sometime during the time course, demonstrating extraordinary utilization of the streamlined genome. Ninety‐seven percent of these transcripts were differentially expressed during the time course indicating efficiency of transcription through regulation in Dhc. Most Dhc genes were significantly down‐regulated at <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, responding to a lack of substrate as would be expected. The <jats:italic>tceA</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>vcrA</jats:italic> genes, which code for proteins with known chlorinated ethene reduction functions, were highly expressed at both <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> and <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, whereas two other putative reductive dehalogenase genes (DET0173 and DET1545) were most highly expressed at <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, likely in response to the presence of VC. Hydrogenases were most highly expressed at <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, reflecting their important role in accumulating electrons used to initiate reductive dechlorination and other biosynthesis pathways. Cobalamin transport genes were preferentially expressed at <jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, reflecting an increase in corrinoid transport as chloroethenes were degraded and a decrease in activity of the transport system after dehalogenation was complete. This is the first application of a microarray targeting a known genus, including both core genomes and identified strain‐specific genes, to improve our understanding of transcriptional dynamics within an undefined microbial community.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Amino acids and glucose acutely stimulate fetal insulin secretion. In isolated adult pancreatic islets, amino acids potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), but whether amino acids have this same effect in the fetus is unknown. Therefore, we tested the effects of increased fetal amino acid supply on GSIS and morphology of the pancreas. We hypothesized that increasing fetal amino acid supply would potentiate GSIS. Singleton fetal sheep received a direct intravenous infusion of an amino acid mixture (AA) or saline (CON) for 10–14 days during late gestation to target a 25–50% increase in fetal branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Early-phase GSIS increased 150% in the AA group ( P &lt; 0.01), and this difference was sustained for the duration of the hyperglycemic clamp (105 min) ( P &lt; 0.05). Glucose-potentiated arginine-stimulated insulin secretion (ASIS), pancreatic insulin content, and pancreatic glucagon content were similar between groups. β-Cell mass and area were unchanged between groups. Baseline and arginine-stimulated glucagon concentrations were increased in the AA group ( P &lt; 0.05). Pancreatic α-cell mass and area were unchanged. Fetal and pancreatic weights were similar. We conclude that a sustained increase of amino acid supply to the normally growing late-gestation fetus potentiated fetal GSIS but did not affect the morphology or insulin content of the pancreas. We speculate that increased β-cell responsiveness (insulin secretion) following increased amino acid supply may be due to increased generation of secondary messengers in the β-cell. This may be enhanced by the paracrine action of glucagon on the β-cell.</jats:p>",

Empirically, because <jats:italic>N</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>in</jats:italic></jats:sub> is difficult to measure, nutrient concentration is investigated instead. Our model predicts that the spectral slope is positively correlated with nutrient concentration due to the accumulated mesozooplankton biomass, which was confirmed by our study in plankton community in a subtropical reservoir in Taiwan.</jats:p>",
