      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ontogeny of terminal growth in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) suggests that the growing season in Michigan be divided into three 2—month periods: April—May,June—July, and August—September. It is during the middle period that mitotic activity at the shoot apex initiates dwarf shoot primordia in the bud for the subsequent season's foliage; thus, preconditioning one year has a strong effect on next year's growth. Water was applied to or withheld from the soil under 23—year—old trees in various combinations of the 2—month periods over two growing seasons. All effects of drought were greatest on the terminal shoot of the main stem, diminishing on terminals of branches with distance from the apex, and disappearing at the base of the crown. Shoot extension was governed equally by conditions of the middle period of the previous year and of the early period of the current year. Each year fascicle density was regulated only by water conditions of the early period of the current year, regardless of preconditioning. Spacing of needles on shoots depended on elongation of the stem internodes between dwarf shoots, and was independent of the number of fascicles. Number of fascicles per shoot was governed only by conditions of June—July of the previous year, with drought during this period reducing the number of 30%. Length of needles was related to two factors: the number of fascicles produced per shoot and the water treatment of the period during which needles elongated. Thus when the water supply of the middle of the previous year was deficient, fewer but longer needles were produced currently; when water during the middle of the current year was deficient, needles were reduced in length by about 30%. It is concluded that the interaction of two seasons' water supply are usually compensative, rarely additive. The average net effect on foliage production is along—term, year—to—year stability in photosynthetic potential for red pine.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effect of light and of glucose in the nutrient medium on the release of OH- or H+ and on ion accumulation by sugar beet plants grown with NO3 or NH4 nutrition was studied at a constant pH of 5.50. Decrease in OH- production rate in the dark was probably caused by retarded nitrate assimilation or carbohydrate shortage in the roots. Decrease in the rate of H+ production (NH4 uptake) in the dark was probably due to carbohydrate depletion. Both 24-h illumination and the addition of glucose increased H+ production during NH4 uptake and OH- production during NO3 uptake. 24 h darkness decreased the carboxylate pool on both N sources and it was tentatively concluded that light and darkness exert more influence on the carboxylate pool than N assimilation. Relationships between organic acid, carbohydrate and N metabolism, H+ or OH- production and inorganic composition were considered in detail.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1970s and into the next decade, petroleum and natural gas derived in conventional ways will continue to constitute the major share of the fuel consumed in the United States and the world. After 1985 other forms of energy will increase in importance. Since the demand for oil and gas will increase in the near term, it is likely that prices will also rise. Thus, during the next ten to twenty years, the supply and price of oil and gas will be critical elements in the energy policy of both consuming, and exporting, nations. An ideal solution to the supply-price matter would be a rise in the supply of oil and gas which would meet the demand until alternative energy sources are available. Concurrently, the price of oil and gas should rise, but should not substantially exceed the cost of the alternative sources being developed. In order to pursue such an ideal solution, it must be understood that there is a real problem: the current energy difficulties are not created by an oil conspiracy; the price of oil and gas will not fall; and easy solutions cannot be expected. As a necessary part of the ideal solution, the major consuming areas should jointly approach the energy situation; another cooperative effort should be joint development of new energy sources. All should avoid narrow self-serving, near term actions. The cooperative approach to the world's energy problems fits well into the larger framework of cooperation on international matters pursued by the Nixon administration. </jats:p>",
