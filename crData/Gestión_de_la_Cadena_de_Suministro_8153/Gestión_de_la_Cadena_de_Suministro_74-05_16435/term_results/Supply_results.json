The ship has been developed for use in the Norwegian Arctic, i.e., Svalbard and the Continental Shelf of the Barents Sea. It is designed to be able to operate in the area on a year\"' :round basis.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The design considerations are reviewed bearing in mind the operating, icebreaking, and classification requirements. A description of the ship is given and its operating modes as well as expected capabilities are discussed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The first exploration drilling on Svalbard started in 1965, when Caltex put up the first rig. Since then, most of the oil potential areas have been claimed by Norwegian and foreign oil companies.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Drilling so far has only been taking place during the summer. Equipment and supplies are being brought in from Norway by ice-strengthened cargo ships. Unloading is carried out by landing crafts and helicopters. The shipping season usually lasts from May to October, but this depends very much on the ice conditions.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>So far a dozen wells have been drilled, but no commercial fields have yet been discovered. There have, however, been interesting traces of oil and gas. The future development will probably be that, as soon as commercial discoveries are made, the drilling season will be extended and year-round operations will commence. As more advanced offshore drilling technology becomes available, exploration of the ice-covered waters around the Svalbard islands will probably also begin. These waters are very promising with large sedimentary basins, and them may well turn out to contain major oil fields.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In anticipation of such a development, the shipyard Kaarbp's Mek. Versed and the supply organization Nor service, both of Hardstand, Norway, have decided to analyze some of the problems involved in the transportation of equipment and supplies needed for these activities. Part of these studies have been carried out in cooperation with The Ship Research Institute of \"Norway, and as one of the results of this cooperation, a concept of an Arctic supply vessel has been developed. The ship is intended to serve both onshore and offshore oil drilling and will, in addition to carrying supplies and passengers, be able to do towing and anchor-handling, as well as act as an icebreaker.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>AREA OF OPERATION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Even if an Arctic supply vessel should be able to operate in ice-filled waters worldwide, it appears that the wide range or ice and - -weather conditions that egoist in the Arctic. itself will necessitate different types of vessels. It was therefore decided to construct the vessel for one particular area, the Norwegian Arctic.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A brief review and interpretation of regional and world-wide trends in total energy consumption and its composition since the end of World War II is given. A review of energy-consumption projections into the 1980s ‚Äî world-wide and regional ‚Äî focuses on the role of international trade in oil in achieving supply‚Äîdemand balances. The prospective position of the U.S. as a major oil importer is emphasized. An analysis of the sensitivity of world supply prospects to alternative assumptions concerning the growth of indigenous sources of supply in the United States of America and Western Europe is presented. The post-war growth rate in world energy consumption averaged out to over 5% per annum. Marked shifts in regional shares and variations in regional growth rates have occurred, but regional differences in the level of per capita energy use, while narrowing, remain conspicuously wide. The sharp relative decline of coal during this period was accompanied by a dramatic relative increase in both oil and gas. The rapid growth of world energy consumption as a whole, the continued shift toward oil and the rising volume of U.S. oil imports all failed to be adequately anticipated in past energy projections. A standard projection to the mid-1980s shows: world-wide energy growth of between 5-J- and 6% ; an even faster growth rate for oil, resulting in about 115x10¬Æ barrels (18.3 x 10¬Æ m3)/day in 1985 (compared to 53 x 102 b (8.4 x 104 m3)/d in 1972); and the addition of the U.S. to the ranks of the major oil importers. The Middle East, along with areas of lesser reserve holdings, is in all likelihood physically capable of accommodating expected oil demand to the mid-1980s. But the acute degree of dependence that this would pose for major consuming regions prompts the question of how a greatly expanded indigenous producing capability in the U.S. could blunt the one-sidedness of the demand-supply picture. Recently completed research suggests that, within an appropriate policy setting, the U.S. could probably meet all but 20% of its oil and gas internally by 1985 - and do so at real prices no higher than the $6/barrel ($38/m3&gt;) delivered price rapidly being approached by Persian Gulf crude. Such a development, along with whatever contribution can be made by Western Europe‚Äôs own petroleum-producing capability, can perhaps introduce a stabilizing element of major importance into world energy flows.</jats:p>",
