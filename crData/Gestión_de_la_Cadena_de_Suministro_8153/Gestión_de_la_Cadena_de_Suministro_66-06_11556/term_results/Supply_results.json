      "abstract": "<jats:p>The potato industry in South Australia is characterised by very unstable prices. One hypothesis for this instability is that potato growers' acreage responses follow a cobweb pattern, that is, a one year lag of acreage to price. This hypothesis is tested, together with a two year lag and a distributed lag. The distributed lag model seems the most satisfactory and gives a short‐run elasticity of acreage to price of 0.36 and a long‐run elasticity of 1.09. An alternative to the lagged price hypothesis is the \"constant cash return\" hypothesis which postulates that potatoes are grown to provide a certain cash income to permit farm development. This explanation of acreage response only seems relevant in the dairying and fat lamb areas of the State.</jats:p>",

The experiments were done on soils selected for their liability to drought. Grain yield was decreased by water deficit; the effects differed between varieties, but the varietal differences were not consistent in the 2 years.</jats:p><jats:p>In glasshouse experiments, plants of Cappell‐Desprez were subjected to drought for 3–4 days during ear development and subsequently watered normally. When this treatment preceded pollen meiosis by a few days many of the lower florets of each spikelet were male‐sterile but female‐fertile. Also there was often proliferation, within the spikelet, of normally fertile florets above the male‐sterile ones, showing that the number of florets formed may increase until a late stage in ear development.</jats:p><jats:p>The results of the field experiment suggested that grain yield was restricted by the capacity of the grains as sinks for photosynthates. If so, a genetic improvement in grain yield could be obtained by breeding for an increase in number of florets per spikelet.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Following the establishment by previous work in this department of the practicability of using water lubricated bearings for boiler feed pumps and similar applications, and of the suitability of various journal/bearing material combinations for use in water lubricated bearings running in clear water, this project was undertaken to determine the effects of debris in the lubricating water, such as might be encountered in practical applications. </jats:p><jats:p> A number of material combinations were subjected to a standard test-run to obtain a comparative evaluation under extreme dirty water conditions. The best material combination, which was found to be a tungsten carbide journal with a metallized carbon bearing, was then used to determine wear rates and loading limits under various conditions. </jats:p><jats:p> Relationships between bearing load, dirt particle size and wear rate have been established and the results lead to the recommendation that the water supply to water lubricated bearings in the boiler feed water circuit should be filtered to remove particles of debris bigger than one third of the calculated minimum film thickness, unless this latter is greater than 60 μ (about 0.0025 in), in which case filtration is unnecessary, since it has been established that very few particles greater in size than 20 μ are present in boiler feed water. </jats:p>",
