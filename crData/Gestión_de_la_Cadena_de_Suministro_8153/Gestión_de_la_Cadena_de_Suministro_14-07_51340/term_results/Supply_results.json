Agriculture sector is facing lot of challenges due to poor infrastructure, unorganised retail market, poor adoption of modern technology and overall inefficient supply chain. There is strong need to develop linkages between farmers and food processors and markets. Lack of coordination is the major problem in food supply chain. It is causing major loss to country as a whole. This study has tried to identify major factors responsible for coordination in the food supply chain. Further, a framework has been developed to quantify the effectiveness of coordination in the supply chain. This has been further illustrated with a case of food supply chain. This framework can be also useful for supply chains from other sectors to quantify its effectiveness and further improve their respective performance.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The interactive emphasis of vertical and horizontal collaboration in the semiconductor industry supply chain (SSC) support the buyer(s) performing procurement activities with supplier(s) through joint planning and decision-making, information sharing, resource sharing and incentive alignment. The paper proposes a framework to explore the resource sharing conditions under which enterprises are motivated to collaborate and the conditions in which such collaboration would be successful. A lateral collaboration scheme is proposed, which can be operated by the e-market intermediary to motivate buyers and suppliers to collaborate under competion. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed collaboration mechanism yields an effective infrastructure for each members of the supply chain that supports efficient exchange of information and resources among all members. It is expected that the proposed scheme would enable the optimal capacity decision among competing suppliers for minimum expected total cost of the supply chain by appropriate selection of ordering quantity and penalty cost as imposed by the e-market intermediary. It is argued that the managerial decision-making in procurement perspective contribute to the matching between supply and demand for gaining mutual benefits.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply disruptions are all too common in supply chains. To mitigate delivery risk, buyers may either source from multiple suppliers or offer incentives to their preferred supplier to improve its process reliability. These incentives can be either direct (investment subsidy) or indirect (inflated order quantity). In this study, we present a series of models to highlight buyers’ and suppliers’ optimal parameter choices. Our base‐case model has deterministic buyer demand and two possibilities for the supplier yield outcomes: all‐or‐nothing supply or partial disruption. For the all‐or‐nothing model, we show that the buyer prefers to only use the subsidy option, which obviates the need to inflate order quantity. However, in the partial disruption model, both incentives—subsidy and order inflation—may be used at the same time. Although single sourcing provides greater indirect incentive to the selected supplier because that avoids order splitting, we show that the buyer may prefer the diversification strategy under certain circumstances. We also quantify the amount by which the wholesale price needs to be discounted (if at all) to ensure that dual sourcing strategy dominates sole sourcing. Finally, we extend the model to the case of stochastic demand. Structural properties of ordering/subsidy decisions are derived for the all‐or‐nothing model, and in contrast to the deterministic demand case, we establish that the buyer may increase use of subsidy and order quantity at the same time. </jats:p>",

So, Irstea and Veolia Water decided to create a new system of water loss indicators designed for use in France and that would take into account these parameters. The study was initially carried out at District Metered Area (DMA) level. These analyses showed the advantages of considering the ratio of losses to number of connections, but did not highlight a significant link between water loss levels and average pressure. After that, using a module that automatically calculates average pressure based on an EPAnet model of a network, it was possible to carry out a study at the system level. The results at the system scale were similar to those obtained at the DMA level. The study demonstrates that it is relevant to use a performance indicator of losses per connection. On the other hand, it showed no link between the volume of losses and the average pressure, which is contrary to what is commonly admitted.</jats:p>",

Effective management of these risks is essential to prevent minor as well as major risks that may occur in day-to-day operations of the firm. In this paper an attempt is made to bring out a schema for analyzing supply chain risks faced by the firm and develop a risk management action framework that would serve as a guide for practitioners to identify the level at which their firms are operating and the strategies they need to employ to combat or prevent supply chain risks. The data is collected by means of an online as well as an event survey from logistics managers of various supply chain firms. Indeed Singaporean firms need to properly document these supply chain risks. Moreover, there are gaps in specific areas where Singaporean firms can improve themselves and thus become globally effective corporations.</p>",

It is mainly based on the book by Ernest Feline related to the qanat system in the arid M'Zab valley in southern Algeria. It also refers to some related lectures on the traditional water legislation in the Sahara region and more generally on the Islamic water jurisprudence which does reveal a specific culture perpetuated through a relevant adaptation of al-hisba principles. Subsequently the present paper argues that if updated and adapted, the traditional knowledge can serve current water management issues within the framework of the water sensitive urbanism associated with the integrated water resource management. With this respect the spatial concept called ‘harim al-ma’ and the traditional community actions towards the qanat system can contribute to protecting water quality and improving public health.</jats:p>",

The annual review contains country- by-country data on oil and gas production and consumption. The report shows the continuation of several trends that have begun in the past few years: tremendous oil production growth in the United States, the continued decline of oil in overall energy market share, increases in oil supply and demand below historical averages, and the rise of coal in the energy mix.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The US “shale revolution” has not only transformed the country’s short- to medium- term outlook, reversing years of oil production decline, but also is having a significant impact beyond North America as well. US oil production in 2013 rose by 1.1 million BOPD, one of the highest year-on-year increases in history, according to the review. US oil production now exceeds 10 million BOPD, the country’s highest level since 1986.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The fastest demand growth last year was also in the US, as consumption grew by 400,000 BOPD. Growth was led by the industrial sector, indicating continued recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis. US demand growth outpaced China’s for the first time in 1999. China’s energy demand growth still hit 4.7%, but lagged its 10-year average of 8.6%.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The price of oil is at its most stable since 1970, as the large production increases in the US have offset supply declines in the Middle East/North Africa region. A cumulative 3 million bbl has been lost “since the start of the 2011 Arab uprising,” according to the report, but US output has grown by similar amounts. The price of Brent averaged USD 108.66/bbl in 2013, a slight decline from the year before, and the third straight year that the oil price has exceeded USD 100/bbl.</jats:p>",

Second, the complexity of today’s supply chain, with a high percentage of imported ingredients, is making integrity issues harder to detect. Third, halal integrity issues once detected go viral on the internet, exposing the integrity of a country’s halal system and the brand owner concerned. The neglect of halal requirements throughout the entire supply chain is gradually weakening consumer confidence in halal certified products.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Due to the unavailability of clean water sources and poor sanitation most of the inhabitants of Kpakungu are threaten with the spread of diseases such as diarrhoea and cholera and this has led to the degenerating situation of Kpakungu. Assessing the problems of water supply and sanitation in Kpakungu area of Minna, Niger State using GIS (Geographic Information System) is aimed at providing access to adequate portable water supply and a better sanitation through the use of research and advocacy. This is achieved by identifying the pattern of access to public water supply and sanitation in Kpakungu and the creation of a database of the existing water source and their yield was determined to enhance planning. This research involved the use of both primary and secondary data to achieve a thorough assessment of the problems of poor water supply and sanitation in the study area. It was discovered that the problems of poor water supply and sanitation often leave most women and children on queues for several hours and those that cannot endure are forced to travel long miles in search for alternative source of water, which may not be fit for drinking. In the light of this, mothers are prevented from domestic work and most children are kept away from school. At the end of the research water and sanitation blue print for the study area was designed and a proposal was sent to relevant government agencies and ministries for the provision of more sources of potable water in the community. In this regard, Public Private Dialogue (PPD) was initiated and adequate follow up process was made until the aim of the research was achieved.</jats:p>"

Based on energy assessment projects involving 150 manufacturing sites and distribution centers, this paper presents two case studies – one energy intensive manufacturing organization, and one typical distribution center – to illustrate the kind of energy saving opportunities that can be typically identified in manufacturing, and in supply. As a major effort to promote energy efficiency, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has developed a new set of standards addressing the use of energy in businesses: ISO50001:2011. This proposes technical and management strategies for companies to follow so that energy use may be maximized, costs may be reduced and there is minimal stress on the environment. In reality, however, industrial companies need understanding and real life cases to be able to plan for actions. The cases in this paper provide a window to look into same fairly common examples of energy saving possibilities that exist in the manufacturing sites and the distribution centers within a supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the next 20 years, the United States airline industry is expected to hire in excess of 95,000 pilots. This hiring will be the result of new aircraft growth, pilot retirements, and pilot attrition from the industry for reasons other than retirement. In addition, government regulations may also cause an increase in the number of new pilots required. Given this increased demand, will there be enough new pilots to ensure a long-term and continuous supply? The purpose of this research is to examine the supply and demand for US airline pilots. Several new considerations are having an impact on future supply and demand of airline pilots including cost of training, growth, retirement, regulatory changes, and slowing supply of military pilots. The methodology provides an empirical analysis of the pilot labor supply in the US. A multivariate regression model was developed to forecast demand. To explore supply, a variety of data sources have been included and a survey was implemented. The results of the study indicate that the US airline industry will experience a shortage of approximately 35,000 pilots for the 2013 to 2031 time period. The impact of the shortage on regional and major airlines is examined. Possible solutions are discussed.</jats:p>"

Out of the various methods developed for effective removal of fluoride adsorption using activated alumina (AA) is popular as it has a low initial cost. AA offers excellent chemical and mechanical stability, selectivity for fluoride, favorable hydraulic properties, regenerability but offers lower adsorption capacity as there is reduction in material and capacity with an increased presence of aluminum. Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles have been found to possess high adsorption capacity for fluoride but they lack mechanical stability and favorable hydraulic properties. In this study, we synthesized a hybrid adsorbent, modified activated alumina, prepared by dispersing nanoparticles of hydroxyapatite inside AA granules. The hybrid adsorbent possesses a maximum adsorption capacity of 14.4 mg F/g which is at least five times higher than that of the virgin AA which has been used extensively for fluoride removal. A column run carried out on the hybrid adsorbent with a synthetic solution containing 3 mg/L fluoride lasted for 450 bed volumes before a breakthrough of 1.5 mg/L was observed. The exhausted adsorbent could be fully regenerated in a column within six bed volumes using commonly available innocuous chemicals. The study will contribute to the field of effective removal of fluoride from contaminated drinking water.</jats:p>",

In today’s scenario eco design is very important for saving our environment. This papers aims to investigate the technology, organization and environment factors of the eco design that influence the adoption of Green Supply Chain Management using Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment (FQFD). Quality function deployment (QFD) is a planning and problem-solving methodology used to translate customer requirements (CRs) into technical requirements (TRs) in the Course of new product development (NPD). In the proposed model, fifteen fundamental requirements of customers are identified and eight main factors of eco design are derived to satisfy the overall requirements as detailed. The importance of the customer requirements and relationship strength were identified as linguistic data. We have collected data for the criteria from the decision makers of the automotive industry. Under different situation the values of subjective data are often inaccurate so we have applied Fuzzy Quantitative Approach to overcome this deficiency of high subjectivity and low reliability. This study shows the fuzzy logic using Quality Function Deployment for easy decision making. So this proposed method shows the final ranking of the important eco design factors that influences the adoption of Green Supply Chain Management in the automotive industry. The final result of paper gives Stakeholder Cooperation is the most important factors of eco design.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Supply chain networks have expanded globally in today's business environment due to cost efficiencies, advanced technology, and market growth. This expansion makes the supply chains more vulnerable to disruption risks in different countries. A disruption in one country can cause serious global impacts. In this paper, the authors formulate a multi-criteria optimization model for supporting strategic supply chain network design decisions. The model considers disruption risk of supply chain components (i.e., facilities and transportation links) as well as profit and customer responsiveness as conflicting criteria. This consideration is important since disruption at any supply chain component may lead to the disruption of the entire supply chain network. They apply goal programming (GP) techniques to handle multiple and conflicting network design objectives. The authors present a numerical example to illustrate how to incorporate disruption risk when making strategic supply chain decisions. The results demonstrate how supply chain network designs that over emphasize profit may include inexpensive supply chain components with high disruption risk. Therefore, more attention must be paid to managing potential disruptions and designing supply chain networks that balance profit and risk. They discuss tradeoffs among multiple design solutions and identify opportunities for future research.</p>",

It describes some of the large-scale residential programs implemented such as home retrofits, showerhead exchanges, washing machine rebates, toilet retrofits and rainwater tank rebates. It identifies key savings evaluation techniques used including participant-control and regression analysis, and summarizes water savings results from evaluation studies conducted. It also discusses key learnings from both the evaluation techniques employed and the programs implemented. The paper will be of significant interest to water service providers looking for evidence of actual savings achieved and/or wanting to understand how to evaluate their own programs.</jats:p>",

The main power supply unit, photovoltaic cells, connects the DC bus through a DC regulator circuit. The bus voltage can be maintained stable by real-time adjustment of photovoltaic cells’ output power. The battery module connects the DC bus through a bidirectional Boost-Buck circuit. The charges and discharges of batteries can be real-time controlled according to the bus voltage level. The AC/DC module connects the DC bus as a backup, which can real-time detect the bus voltage to determine whether to start.

Focusing on the adjustment of working‐capital financing, we find two pieces of supporting evidence from international firm‐level panel data covering the period 2002:I–2012:<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">IV</jats:styled-content>. First, for industries where specific investment in the input supplier–customer relationship is large, firms are more exposed to credit‐market shocks. We find that measures of global credit‐market shocks are negatively associated with trade receivables, trade payables and inventories, conditional on the level of contract intensity in the industries where firms operate. Second, firms in emerging markets are more vulnerable to\ncredit‐market shocks than are firms in developed countries. We are also able to verify the economic significance of sales growth, operating cash flows, cash stock and firm size in the overall adjustment. Our findings highlight the importance of balance‐sheet contagion along supply chains during the 2007–09 global financial crisis.</jats:p>",

The network is divided into different sub-networks based on the Pearson correlation analysis of the nodal pressure measurements. The Pearson correlation analysis is performed to find out the set of nodes, whose water pressures are highly correlated, and thus a corresponding sub-network is formulated. As a case study, 47 sub-networks are recognized for a region with an area of 250 km2 and 77 nodes in total. For each sub-network, a linear model is constructed to quantify the pressure transfer. The output of the model is the pressure estimate for the node of our interest which is called the center node. The rest of the nodes in the sub-network are called the correlated nodes of the center node, and the pressure measurements at the correlated nodes constitute the input to the model. The average relative error of the model is less than 3%. A pressure regulating method based on the model is proposed and tested numerically.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In marketing, a customer purchases a product while a consumer uses the product; which means that an adopter of an innovation behaves like a consumer of a new product. But surprisingly no initiative has been made to relate/integrate an adopter with a consumer. This article has done this. Technological, organizational, environmental factors as well as “expectations” from using the technology are important for the acceptance and continued use of a technological innovation. This paper integrates the effect of innovation characteristics along with the expectation on RFID adoption, in the context of Australian livestock industry. To do this, this study first presents a theoretical analysis then presents the outcomes from eight interviews which were conducted among livestock farms in Australia. Finally, it proposes a research framework while proposing eleven propositions related to RFID adoption. Contribution-wise, policy makers may compare their experience with this study, evaluate the past, and find the future direction.</p>",

The number of microfinance institutions offering this ‘green microfinance’ varies considerably across developing economies. Drawing from a sample of countries in Latin America, we consider whether the green microfinance market is attractive for firms to enter without the need for market interventions. That is, we test the hypothesis that entry will occur provided there is high demand for green microfinance and an absence of barriers to entry. We also test an alternative hypothesis that these conditions are insufficient and that direct support from governments or development organisations is required to promote market entry. Regression analysis using data sourced from development organisations, government databases and industry publications confirms our hypothesis and leads us to reject our alternative hypothesis.</jats:p>"

None of the national variables is significant, confirming the importance of limiting housing market analysis to the local level. The price elasticity of supply estimated is in the range of 2.0 to 3.2 for housing starts and 0.01 to 0.02 for housing stock. These estimates are higher than most of the elasticities for the other UK local markets. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – There is the need to better understand the supply of housing at the various local housing markets. Unfortunately, however, most housing supply studies use national data. Because national data are aggregation of local data, using national studies results for local markets may be uninformative. Also, the few existing local studies use typically cross-section data or at least time series over relatively short time spans. This paper makes an effort to use quarterly time series data over a 25-year period for a local market and also include a planning variable which is different from local markets and often ignored in national or regional studies.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

It places this study in the context of the global consolidation, restructuring and acceleration of supply chains as well as in the specific context of privatisation of infrastructure and deregulation of labour in Greece in the aftermath of the debt crisis. Anatomising the tangled dynamics of deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation, it illustrates the complexity of the interrelationships between specific local factors and global forces in reshaping work. It also shows how the fragmentation of labour resulting from these impacts makes it easy for global corporations in the logistics sector both to consolidate their power and to evade contemporary forms of labour mobilisation. After chronicling the forms of resistance adopted by workers at the port, the article concludes by reflecting on the implications for organisation along the increasingly tightly integrated supply chains which link the labour of production workers with that of logistics workers.</jats:p>",

Especially for assets with a long planning horizon this is a critical part for planning and design. One solution is to make centralized organized water infrastructure with a long-planning horizon resilient and adaptive. For existing centralized infrastructure such a transition would be to increasingly implement decentralized measures. But such a transition can cause severe impacts on existing centralized infrastructure. Low flow conditions in urban drainage systems can cause sediment deposition, and for water supply systems water age problems may occur. This work focuses on city-scale analysis for assessing the impact of such measures. For that a coupled model for integrated city-scale analysis is applied and further developed. In addition, a geographic information system (GIS)-based approach for sensitivity analysis is enhanced and also implemented in that model. The developed approach is applied to assess the water infrastructure of an alpine case study. With the obtained results it is demonstrated how the planning process is enhanced by indicating where and where not to implement decentralized measures in an existing water infrastructure.</jats:p>",

Globalization, competition and information technology development have forced the industries to manufacture the products with low cost, good quality, availability in the market. Integration of all business entities will promote the value of above said criteria. Supply chain management is an integrated activity, which can meet this critical challenge. Supplier, customer and manufacturer are the entities of the supply chain, which are associated with more uncertainty. Therefore, the supply chain requires an effective rescheduling strategy to manage the disruption and uncertainty by updating and revising the existing schedule. However, the literature survey on rescheduling activity is very limited. The present literature review attempts to analyze the rescheduling activity due to the disruption from the supplier, manufacturer and customer. Literatures on the rescheduling environment, rescheduling factors, and rescheduling algorithm are reviewed to get over all focus. Finally, the review suggests that, to meet the delivery schedule with least makespan and without any disruptions the following factors viz (i) delivery capability (ii) machine utilization rate and (iii) stock level are to be considered.

Criteria and factors are reviewed for green supply chain management, supply chain risk, and supply chain efficiency. Selected papers balancing criteria in supply chain decision‐making are reviewed with the purpose of demonstrating risk and environmental criteria with efficiency. The conclusions discuss how systemic features are demonstrated by these decision‐making criteria.

More specifically, the econometric analysis undertaken reveals that there is no evidence of sample selection bias and that WTP positively relates to the respondents' household income, their level of education, the continuity of the water supply service, and the fact of being forced to carry water to cover their basic needs of drinking, cooking and hygiene.</jats:p>",

The authors exploit two ontology based information models, EEM and CBVVocab within a distributed and decentralised framework that consumes real time EPCIS events as linked data to generate the linked pedigrees.

This new approach considers the multi-choice programming into the cost coefficients of objective function and stochastic programming which is incorporated in three constraints namely sources, destinations and capacities constraints followed by Cauchy's distribution for solid transportation problem. The multi-choice programming and stochastic programming are combined into solid transportation problem and this new problem is called multi-choice stochastic solid transportation problem (MCSSTP). The solution concepts behind the MCSSTP are based on a new transformation technique which will select an appropriate choice from a set of multi-choice which optimizes the objective function. The stochastic constraints of STP convert into deterministic constraints by stochastic programming approach. Finally, the authors have constructed a non-linear programming problem for MCSSTP and have derived an optimal solution of the specified problem. A realistic example on STP is considered to illustrate the methodology.</p>",

In Sumatera, power outages of up to 6 hours per day are part of the power crisis experienced. To date, deficits experienced by Sumatera require better management strategy and operation of electric power systems, taking into account the security system, reliability and customer service. This paper briefly discusses the impact of rolling blackouts on the community's economy and proposed demand-side management strategies as short term measure to overcome the power supply deficit in Sumatera. From the analysis, electricity savings in household equipment can save energy consumption by 98.79 MW at peak load and 97.55 MW for off peak load time. </jats:p>"

The outcome of information acquisition may turn out to be successful such that the firm learns much about the market demand, thus becoming “informed,” or unsuccessful such that it learns very little about the market demand, thus remaining “uninformed.” After the outcome becomes clear, the firm knows its information status, informed or uninformed, and the information content if informed. The client firm usually requires strict confidentiality that forbids the consultant to make any disclosure about the information acquisition, believing that greater informational advantage will surely be to its own benefits. As a result, neither the information content nor the information status is known to any third party. But should the firm always care so much about strict confidentiality? Will it be beneficial if the firm's information status, but not the information content, is known to its partners or any other firms? We investigate this issue in the context of a two-tier supply chain. A manufacturer offers a menu of contracts for supplying a product to a retailer who sells it in a market with random demand that has a known continuous distribution. The retailer hires a consultant to acquire demand information, with uncertain outcome. With probability t, the retailer becomes informed about the market demand, and with probability 1 − t, he remains uninformed, where the probability t can be regarded as representing the retailer's information acquisition capability. We find that disclosing its information status benefits the retailer if its information acquisition capability is less than stellar and the market variability is intermediate. Our investigation shows that there are benefits that are foregone by following strict confidentiality but can potentially be recovered by switching to a policy of partial confidentiality. </jats:p>",

Nature Inspired Intelligence (NII) is a challenging new subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) particularly capable of dealing with complex optimization problems. Related approaches are used either as stand-alone algorithms, or as hybrid schemes i.e. in combination to other AI techniques. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Particle Swarm Optimization, Artificial Bee Colonies, Artificial Immune Systems and DNA Computing are some of the most popular approaches belonging to nature inspired intelligence. On the other hand, supply chain management represents an interesting domain of OR applications, including a variety of hard optimization problems such as vehicle routing (VRP), travelling salesman (TSP), team orienteering, inventory, knapsack, supply network problems, etc. Nature inspired intelligent algorithms prove capable of identifying near optimal solutions for instances of those problems with high degree of complexity in a reasonable amount of time. Survey findings indicate that NII can cope successfully with almost any kind of supply chain optimization problem and tends to become a standard in related scientific literature during the last five years.</p>",

This fact has been seriously considered in the automotive industry supply chain where the company and its associate suppliers are socially and environmentally responsible. Hence, green supply chain has emerged as a key approach for automotive industry to become environmentally sustainable and supply chain integration becomes a vital contributor to supply chain performance and the firm competitiveness. This chapter has reviewed refereed articles related to the topic. This is used as a basis to conceptualize green supply chain integration in the automotive industry. Therefore, there are a growing need to discuss further on internal and external integration including the activity, information technology and logistic integration. This chapter will also discuss on the integrations of both information and material flows between supply chain partners and the effect on operational performance and competitiveness in automotive industry. </jats:p>",

Applying real options thinking, production decisions account for actual supply capabilities, whereas investment decisions are made in advance. To model triangular supply and demand correlations, we adapt the concepts of random capacity and stochastic proportional yield while using concordant ordered random variables. Optimal profit decreases monotonically in supply correlation and increases monotonically in supply–demand correlation. Optimal resource selection, however, depends on the trivariate interplay of supply and demand and responds non‐monotonically to changing correlations. Moreover, supply hedges (i.e., excess capacity at alternative sources) can be optimal even if supply resources are perfectly positively correlated. To accommodate changing degrees of correlation, the firm adjusts the lower margin capacities under random capacity; but under stochastic proportional production capability, it uses either low‐ or high‐margin capacities to create tailored “scale hedges” (i.e., excess capacity at one source which can partially substitute for diversification). </jats:p>",

The fact that these municipal government jurisdictions for the purpose of improving co-operative municipal- and integrated water resources management (IWRM), in most instances do not correspond with environmental and physical land features such as the demarcated surface water (rivers) drainage regions’ boundaries, could lead to the ineffective, inefficient and non-economic municipal management of water, sanitation and environmental services.The aforementioned is a case with reference to water services management in the Free State Province town of Lindley located in the Vals River catchment and the Nketoana Local Municipality’s area of jurisdiction.An extensive literature review, the use and study of geographic tools such as maps, ortho- photos and information data bases, as well as two field visits to the area, enabled the researchers to identify the essential geographical, geo-hydrological and municipal management aspects of importance for the potable water service providers and managers in the Lindley municipal area.The researchers argue that effective trans-boundary municipal management through simunye-type co-operative governance and IWRM must be facilitated in the Vals River surface water catchment between the respective local- and district municipalities for the benefit of the Lindley, Arlington, Steynsrus and Kroonstad communities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Vehicle routing problems (VRP) are receiving a growing attention in process systems engineering due to its close relationship with supply chain issues. Its aim is to discover the best routes/schedules for a vehicles fleet fulfilling a number of transportation requests at “minimum cost”. Pick-up and delivery problems (PDP) are a class of VRP on which each request defines the shipping of a given load from a specified pickup site to a given customer. In order to account for a wider range of logistics problems, the so-called supply-chain management VRP (SCM-VRP) problem has been defined as a three-tier network of interconnected factories, warehouses and customers. In this problem, multiple products are to be delivered from some supply-sites to a number of customers through a routes-network in order to meet a set of given demands. The vehicle routes must satisfy capacity and timing constraints while minimizing an objective function stating the specified transportation cost. Pickup sites for each demand are decision variables rather than problem specifications. The SCM-VRP had been modeled as an MILP problem and the resolution of this formulation via a standard branch-and-cut software can provide optimal solutions to moderate size instances. In order to efficiently address larger problems, a decomposition method based on a column generation procedure is introduced in this work. In contrast to traditional columns generation approaches lying on dynamic-programming-procedures as route generators, an MILP formulation is here proposed to create the set of feasible routes and schedules at the slave level of the method. Furthermore, a branch-and-price method based on node-to-routes assignment decisions is constructed to better exploit the MILP route-generator. Finally, several benchmark examples were presented and satisfactorily solved.</p>",

We also examine potential moderating effects of absorptive capacity and supply network partner innovativeness on innovation output. We hypothesize that firms will experience greater innovation output from (1) higher levels of supply network accessibility and supply network interconnectedness, (2) the interaction between the levels of these two structural characteristics, (3) the moderating role of absorptive capacity on supply network accessibility and the moderating role of supply network partner innovativeness on supply network interconnectedness. Supply network partner relationships are drawn in the context of the electronics industry using data from multiple sources. We use social network analysis to create measures for each supply network structural characteristic. Using regression techniques to test the relationship between these structural characteristics and firm innovation for a sample of 390 firms, our findings suggest that supply network accessibility has a significant association with a firm's innovation output. The results also indicate that interconnected supply networks strengthen the association between supply network accessibility and innovation output. Moreover, the influence of the two structural characteristics on innovation output can be enhanced by a firm's absorptive capacity and level of supply network partner innovativeness. By addressing the need for deeper structural analysis, this study contributes to supply chain research by accounting for the embedded nature of ties in supply networks, and showing how these structural characteristics influence the knowledge and information flows residing within a firm's supply network.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Persian and also Roman aqueducts are examples of such hydrosystems. Their value is often overlooked but they have undeniable advantages: they have functional interconnectedness with their surrounding society and ecology, which sometimes leads to revitalization plans. By using the notion ‘qualifying role’, this paper will raise questions concerning the disregarded functions and early and historical positions of hydraulic heritage systems. This article illustrates the qualifying role of Qanats in urban drainage by describing the skill in their planning and construction. This is shown by a problematic case study in Iran, where the construction of a drainage system modelled on bygone Qanat techniques resulted in a dramatic drawdown in the water level of the area soon after construction.</jats:p>",

This article attempts to measure bullwhip effect in a six echelon CLSC with recycling as a reprocessing option for materials like paper and plastics (perhaps the first time in CLSC literature). The proposed model considers the effect of two critical parameters of CLSC: quality of recyclable raw material (in terms of its yield) and degree of segregation at source. It is assumed that the echelons in CLSC employ an Order-Up-To (OUT) inventory policy with Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) forecasting scheme, and that the demand forecast is performed via a first order Auto Regressive Moving Average model (ARMA [1, 1]). The model developed is employed to investigate the impact of Auto Regressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) parameter, yield of recycled material, degree of segregation at source and the lead-time on the bullwhip effect. The model enables the CLSC managers to anticipate the downstream demand. In order to avoid order-process instability, a careful selection of Auto Regressive (AR) and the MA parameters is advised. Sensitivity analysis on replenishment lead-times provides managerial insights for effective design of recycling—distribution system, with constant accumulated lead-time. Further, the analysis reveals that increased degree of segregation at the source reduces the bullwhip effect. </jats:p>",

Management of arsenic waste is now becoming a major public concern due to its harmful effects on the surrounding environment, including serious health problems such as skin cancers and various internal carcinomas. The main aim of this paper is to review: (i) the characteristics of arsenic waste produced by arsenic treatment systems; and (ii) the treatment and disposal methods of this waste. Arsenic waste type or its characteristics play an important role in choosing the best method of treatment and disposal. Currently, encapsulation of arsenic waste through solidification/stabilization (S/S) techniques is considered to be the most attractive solution and this method is the focus of this review. A number of studies have used cement by itself and in combination with additives such as lime, iron, silicates, or fly ash in the S/S process. Although there is a lack of systematic investigations and differing procedures for testing the effectiveness of the treatment methods, it was agreed that incorporating additives could increase the effectiveness of the S/S process depending on the type and dose of additives.</jats:p>",

As a result, regressions of total caloric production on futures prices produce estimates of the supply elasticity that are biased downwards by up to 75%. Regressions of the world's growing area on futures prices have a much smaller bias of about 20% because although yield shocks are partially predictable, this predictability has a relatively small effect on land allocation. We argue that the preferred method for estimating the crop supply elasticity is to use regressions of growing area on futures prices and to include the realized yield shock as a control variable. An alternative method for bias reduction is to use instrumental variables (IVs). We show that the marginal contribution of an IV to bias reduction is small—IVs are not necessary for futures prices in supply analysis.</jats:p>",

We used the critical incident technique on 302 buying firms in China to capture two (one successful, one unsuccessful) supplier‐induced disruptions (yielding a total of 604 incidents) to test our theorizing grounded in justice theory. We find evidence that different aspects of trust damage (ability, benevolence, and integrity) can be mitigated through the supplier's selective use of appropriate justice approaches (procedural, interactional, or distributive justice), which, in turn, foster relationship continuity intentions. Within this realm, we make a number of contributions. First, we find that procedural justice is the most effective mechanism (followed by distributive justice and interactional justice) to recoup the damage to buyers’ trust in the suppliers’ ability, benevolence, and integrity. Second, we find that mitigating damaged ability is the most powerful precursor (followed by recuperating damaged integrity) for locking in future business. Conversely, the mitigation of damaged benevolence is not found to affect future business intentions. Third, our post hoc results suggest that disruptions and consequent mitigation efforts pose relational threats as well as opportunities—yet the “double‐edged” nature is affected by the “base” level of trust (i.e., the trust level prior to the disruption). Broadly, our study suggests that suppliers can overcome the negative relational repercussions of disruptions (that they caused) by employing well‐developed, but nuanced, mitigation efforts and, in doing so, repair, solidify or even enhance the relationships.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the best GEP from the economic, supply reliability, and environmental aspects considering the penetration of RE generation. For this purpose, this paper proposes a model of a utility's GEP process considering RE generation. The proposed method is based on stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) in which long‐term uncertainties are modeled by geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the binomial lattice process. The variation of RE generation output due to the weather conditions (short‐term uncertainty) is also considered in the proposed method by means of the net load curve.</jats:p>",

Hence, the integration of various interconnected elements, which should be synchronized appropriately, is a necessity to meet the patients’ requirements. The performance of the blood supply chain is a function of different variables that are dependent of each other. Therefore, the main aim of the chain is the optimization of the overall supply chain by considering the dynamic behavior of the system. The purpose of this study is to develop a system dynamic simulation model for a complex blood supply chain in order to improve the average level of inventories. The developed model is based on three echelons with a centrality on a regional blood center. The performance of the supply chain network in the current condition is investigated and based on the objectives, 17 scenarios were experimented for improving the average level of inventories to avoid outdates while there are not any backlogged orders. In addition, the best values of the investigated parameters (safety stock, supplier preparing lead time, in transit time and separation time) were determined.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Quality issues in milk—arising primarily from deliberate adulteration by producers—have been reported in several developing countries. In the milk supply chain, a station buys raw milk from a number of producers, mixes the milk and sells it to a firm (that then sells the processed milk to end consumers). We study a non‐cooperative game between a station and a population of producers. Apart from penalties on proven low‐quality producers, two types of incentives are analyzed: confessor rewards for low‐quality producers who confess and quality rewards for producers of high‐quality milk. Contrary to our expectations, whereas (small) confessor rewards can help increase both the quality of milk and the station's profit, quality rewards can be detrimental. We examine two structures based on the ordering of individual and mixed testing of milk: pre‐mixed individual testing (first test a fraction of producers individually and then [possibly] perform a mixed test on the remaining producers) and post‐mixed individual testing (first test the mixed milk from all producers and then test a fraction of producers individually). Whereas pre‐mixed individual testing can be socially harmful, a combination of post‐mixed individual testing and other incentives achieves a desirable outcome: all producers supply high‐quality milk with only one mixed test and no further testing by the station. </jats:p>",

Among mothers who had weaned by the time of questionnaire completion, more than half (n = 52) reported IMS as a reason, and 53.8% of these mothers reported this occurring during the first 2 days postpartum. Mothers often identified IMS by using less sensitive indicators of adequate intake such as receiving a hungry look from the infant after nursing (34.6%) and not feeling the presence of milk (28.8%). More sensitive indicators of adequate intake, such as the number of wet/soiled diapers, were not reported. More than a third of mothers (39.2%) could not express a reason for the occurrence of IMS. Among those who identified reasons, nearly one-fourth of mothers attributed IMS, at least partially, to dietary factors such as poor appetite (23.5%). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion:</jats:title><jats:p> Self-reported IMS appears to be a common barrier to breastfeeding continuation among this sample of Chinese mothers.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Differences in sediment supply between single‐thread and braided channel types provide a long‐recognized, though difficult to quantify, pattern discrimination. Building on the results from our preceding paper, we present a multiscale assessment of the sediment supply, geomorphology, and sediment transport characteristics of braided, gravel‐bedded reaches in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. First, we present a quantitative, theoretically based discriminant function that stratifies single‐thread and braided reaches on the basis of variations in bankfull sediment concentration and dimensionless discharge following the work of Millar (2005) and Eaton et al. (2010). This function correctly classifies 50 of the 53 channel types where bed load concentrations are known. Second, while channel pattern transitions are often linked to changes in slope, field studies along Sunlight Creek, Wyoming, show that downstream transitions between single‐thread and braided reaches are instead caused by valley constrictions and changes in the grain size of sediment from tributaries. Finally, we demonstrate that the two‐dimensional variability in flow properties in braided reaches produces locally high values of shear stress and bed load transport. Yet bed load measurements and sediment transport calculations also show that sediment transport rates between adjoining braided and single‐thread reaches may be approximately equal where channels are near the pattern threshold and downstream variations in bank fortitude and channel constriction force pattern transitions. Taken together, these results indicate that high bed load concentrations are fundamental to the braided channel planform and that braided channels likely reflect a quasi‐equilibrium state within watersheds with persistent high sediment supply.</jats:p>",

It addresses the question of the amount of agricultural products consumed in the city and their nitrogen content, their origin and their fate after consumption. Changes in dietary nitrogen flows in nineteenth century Vienna are embedded in the context of a socio-ecological transition from an agrarian to an industrial socio-metabolic regime. Similarities and differences in the size and dynamics of urban nitrogen flows in Vienna and Paris are discussed. Critical reading of historical sources and historical material flow accounting are the methodological backbone of this study. Between 1830 and 1913, inflows of dietary nitrogen into the city increased fivefold. Throughout the time period under observation, the urban waterscape was the most important sink for human and animal excreta. The amount of nitrogen disposed of in the urban waterscape via urban excreta increased sevenfold. The average daily consumption of nitrogen per capita was very similar to that in Paris, but the composition of foodstuff differed. In Vienna, the share of meat in food consumption was considerably higher. Both cities had to face the challenge of increasing output flows. However, urban authorities in Vienna and Paris came to different solutions of how to deal with this challenge. Besides institutional settings, the specific geomorphology of the cities as well as biogeographic factors such as the absorption capacity of the Danube in Vienna and the Seine in Paris mattered.\n</jats:p>",

Here we demonstrate that nitrate limitation reduces shoot branching in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) both by delaying axillary bud activation and by attenuating the basipetal sequence of bud activation that is triggered following floral transition. Ammonium supply has similar effects, suggesting that they are caused by plant nitrogen (N) status, rather than direct nitrate signaling. We identify increased auxin export from active shoot apices, resulting in increased auxin in the polar auxin transport stream of the main stem, as a likely cause for the suppression of basal branches. Consistent with this idea, in the auxin response mutant axr1 and the strigolactone biosynthesis mutant more axillary growth1, increased retention of basal branches on low N is associated with a failure to increase auxin in the main stem. The complex interactions between the hormones that regulate branching make it difficult to rule out other mechanisms of N action, such as up-regulation of strigolactone synthesis. However, the proposed increase in auxin export from active buds can also explain how reduced shoot branching is achieved without compromising root growth, leading to the characteristic shift in relative biomass allocation to the root when N is limiting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Human water use has significantly increased during the recent past. Water allocation from surface and groundwater sources has altered terrestrial discharge and storage, with large variability in time and space. Water supply and allocation, therefore, should be considered with water demand and appropriately included in large-scale models to address various online and offline implications, with or without considering possible climate interactions. Here, we review the algorithms developed to represent the elements of water supply and allocation in large-scale models, in particular Land Surface Schemes and Global Hydrologic Models. We noted that some potentially-important online implications, such as the effects of large reservoirs on land-atmospheric feedbacks, have not yet been addressed. Regarding offline implications, we find that there are important elements, such as groundwater availability and withdrawals, and the representation of large reservoirs, which should be improved. Major sources of uncertainty in offline simulations include data support, water allocation algorithms and host large-scale models. Considering these findings with those highlighted in our companion paper, we note that advancements in computation, host models, system identification algorithms as well as remote sensing and data assimilation products can facilitate improved representations of water resource management at larger scales. We further propose a modular development framework to consider and test multiple datasets, algorithms and host models in a unified model diagnosis and uncertainty assessment framework. We suggest that such a framework is required to systematically improve current representations of water resource management in Earth System models. A key to this development is the availability of regional scale data. We argue that the time is right for a global initiative, based on regional case studies, to move this agenda forward.\n                        </jats:p>"

Therefore, the appropriateness of using systems dynamics as a research method, by focusing on managerial applications, to analyse APP policies is proven. From the combination of systems dynamics and APP, recommendations and action strategies are considered for each scenario to understand how the system performs and to improve decision making on APP in the SC context.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– The research design analyses a typical factory setting with representative parameter settings for five different conventional APP policies – inventory levelling, workforce variation, overtime, outsourcing and a combination of overtime and outsourcing – through deterministic systems dynamics-based simulation. In order to validate the simulation model, the results from published APP models were replicated. Then, optimisation is conducted for this deterministic setting to determine the performance of all these typical policies with optimal parameter settings. Next, a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation is used to assess the robustness of such performances in a variety of demand settings. Different aggregate plans are tested and the effect that events like demand variability and production times have on the SC performance results is analysed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The results support the assertion that the greater the demand variability, the higher the flexibility costs (overtime, outsourcing, inventory levelling, and contracts and firings). As greater inter-month oscillations appear, which must be covered with additional alternatives, the optimum number of employees must be determined by analysing the interchanges and marginal costs between capacity oversizing costs (wages, idle time, storage) and the costs to undersize it (penalties for lowering safety stocks, delayed demand, greater use of overtime and outsourcing). Accordingly, controlling the times to avoid increased costs and penalties incurred by delayed demand becomes an essential important task, but one that also depends on the characteristics of this variability.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– This paper has developed a modelling approach for APP in a manpower intensive SC by applying system dynamics.

The main challenge is how to act in multi-echelon supply chains considering the levels involved. Making a choice independently or integrating with some or all levels will be a critical decision, and therefore affects the overall profit of the chain. This article proposes a non-cooperative game theory approach to helping in making a better decision in the supply chain and gaining the most accessible benefit. Our research considers unlimited three-echelon supply chains with S suppliers, M manufacturers and K retailers. The Nash equilibrium and definition are used bearing in mind inventory and pricing and marketing cost as decision variables for this matter. This paper studies a three-echelon supply chain network and focuses on the value of integrating a pair of partners in the chain. In the decentralized case, the supplier sets its own price, the manufacturer points out order quantity, wholesale price and backorder quantity, and the retailer charges the final retail price of the product and marketing product. Though there are multiple players at a single echelon level, each manufacturer supplies only a specific product to a given retailer. In addition to the decentralized case, two integration scenarios have been taken into account: manufacturer-retailer and supplier-manufacturer. As for manufacturer-retailer integration, inventory/holding cost issues diminish to a single warehouse and the retailer does not have to enforce marketing effort any more. Supplier-manufacturer integration brings similar benefits. Under each scenario, all parties involved simultaneously set their strategies. Through a numerical experiment, 17 design cases (through designing experiments) have been developed and the total profit of the supply chain under each scenario has been evaluated. Statistical tests on the above introduced 17 experiments have found that the decentralized system performs significantly worse than the integration of the supplier with the manufacturer, whereas no significant difference can be observed regarding other combinations.</jats:p>",

The system captures contaminated air in an area near the ceiling and this captured air is then exhausted through the ceiling outlet. For quantitative evaluation, heat and gas capture efficiencies were defined and calculated. Experiments were conducted to compute heat and gas capture efficiencies based on the temperature and SF<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> concentration data that were measured at the exhaust locations. To find optimum operation conditions for a CSEV system, numerical analysis was carried out. The numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental values. Maximum differences between the two methods are 17% for hood system and 10% for CSEV. Both heat and gas capture efficiencies would increase as exhaust flow rate of the hood increases. However, the optimum supply flow rate of ceiling nozzle was found to be 100 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/h for maximum efficiency. This optimum flow rate condition would improve removing heat and contamination from the kitchen for better indoor air quality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This research addresses the theoretically neglected question of how the internal diffusion of inter-organizational systems (IOS) into a firm's activities and its external diffusion into the supply chain partners influence performance improvement. Drawing on the resource-based view, our research model posits that organizational and relational resources affect both internal and external diffusion, which in turn, influence performance improvement. Survey results from 187 managers in Korean and Chinese firms showed that while the impact of organizational resources on a firm's performance improvement was fully mediated by IOS diffusion, the diffusion partially mediates the impact of relational resources on performance improvement. This study also revealed a significantly different pattern of diffusion between Korean and Chinese firms, i.e. showing the impact of organizational and relational resources on a firm's performance through external diffusion of IOS are significantly greater in Korean firms, while the impact of internal diffusion was significantly greater in Chinese firms. In other words, Korean firms tend to externally diffuse IOS toward their business partners, while Chinese firms tend to internally diffuse IOS by deploying IOS from their partners. The implications of these findings for both research and practice are discussed.</p>",

However, as a result of natural consequence of unplanned and incorrect energy policies, dependency rate of consumed energy of Turkey has reached out a rate of 72 percent. Since need to energy is increasingly growing and a large part of consumed energy is imported, dependency seems to continue to increase. Toward this end, studies related to reducing foreign dependency on energy, the largest input of manufacturing industry in Turkey, are reviewed and discussed with a literature survey methodology. And policy recommendations concerning energy supply security are made. Renewable energy has been attached great importance worldwide as well as nationwide because of providing reliable energy regarding economy, policy, and environment. In order to meet the increasing electricity needs of Turkey as a developing country; the number of facilities on renewable energy are also growing. Domestic production of equipment for renewable energy producing and integrating those into conventional system is of high importance because of energy supply security and sustaining reserves as well as reducing foreign dependency.</jats:p>",

It infers the (residual) paid work expression. As the latter is recovered from uncensored regressions, it makes direct use of the complete set of observations. Hence, it contains more information than the conventional labor supply functions that are estimated from the data obtained from paid work participants via the Tobit and Heckit or selection-bias correction (SBC) techniques.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The women surveyed generally allocated 69 percent of their time toward non-work, 18 percent to unpaid work, and 13 percent to paid work. The non-work function is dominated by the autonomous component, and all three functions depend on subjects’ age, wage, non-labor income, household composition, the unpaid work contributions of adult relatives and region of residence. The unpaid work and non-work functions are more consistent with the SBC rather than the Tobit version of the labor supply. Moreover, the Tobit predicts unrealistic paid work allocations for women engaging in very little non-work.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The unpaid work and non-work functions are regressed separately, as often the case in the literature. Their consideration within a seemingly unrelated regression framework necessitates a reduction in the number of observations to match those considered in the Tobit and SBC versions of the labor supply. Nuances may arise when the time reported in the diaries does not add up to 24 daily hours for all respondents. Knowledge of the recovered regional, age, household member and other effects on women time allocation might had come handy to economic development authorities who sought to attract women out of the household into market production, and from part-time to full-time employment in the context of the 2000-2010 Lisbon Strategy. Similar lessons may be valid today.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The data set derives from a survey that has not been used before. It relies on week-long diaries in order to avoid the occurrence of many zeros in a good number of activities (which is the norm in short diaries), and to ensure the study of a censored time-use function through its uncensored complements. The findings are compared to those of a weekly diary survey conducted in 1987 that solicited similar information. Hence, the study fills a gap in time-use analysis. Identifying the factors which influence the number of hours that women engage in work (both paid and unpaid) and non-work is useful for economic policy purposes. The study exposes a limitation in the conventional estimation of the labor supply which, in turn, casts doubt on the reliability of empirical results for policy making.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In many real world applications, data are often stochastic. A successful approach to address uncertainty in data is to replace deterministic data via random variables, leading to chance-constrained DEA. In this paper, a chance-constrained hybrid integer data envelopment analysis (CCHIDEA) model is developed and also its deterministic equivalent which is a nonlinear program is derived. Furthermore, it is shown that the deterministic equivalent of the CCHIDEA model can be converted into a quadratic program. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the CCHIDEA model is discussed with respect to changes on parameters. Finally, a case study demonstrates the application of the proposed model.</p>",

The simulation has broader learning objectives than other supply chain related activities such as the Beer Game. Competing supply chains work to produce and sell two products, each experiencing differential demand. Seasonal demand, time delays, quality defects, and disruptions offer complexities that are part of actual supply chain management. The behavioral dynamics of collaboration between various functional nodes is illustrated through students’ interactions as they try to achieve their role's objectives. Through their decisions and actions, students develop a practical understanding of the processes and complexities of supply chain management. The classroom simulation actively engages students, and has been used successfully in multiple courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels at multiple universities and by a major corporation during a manager training session. Assessments indicate that the simulation is an effective experiential learning activity. While it offers learning outcome flexibility, common debrief themes are SCOR model processes, supply chain relationships, information flow, seasonal demand, quality defects, reverse logistics, and supply chain disruptions.</jats:p>",

An existing groundwater‐flow model of Salt Lake Valley, Utah, was adapted for use with convolution‐based advective particle tracking to explain broad spatial trends in dissolved solids. This model supports the hypothesis that water produced from wells is increasingly younger with higher proportions of surface sources as pumping changes in the basin over time. At individual wells, however, predicting specific water‐quality changes remains challenging. The influence of pumping‐induced transient groundwater flow on changes in mean age and source areas is significant. Mean age and source areas were mapped across the model domain to extend the results from observation wells to the entire aquifer to see where changes in concentrations of dissolved solids are expected to occur. The timing of these changes depends on accurate estimates of groundwater velocity. Calibration to tritium concentrations was used to estimate effective porosity and improve correlation between source area changes, age changes, and measured dissolved solids trends. Uncertainty in the model is due in part to spatial and temporal variations in tracer inputs, estimated tracer transport parameters, and in pumping stresses at sampling points. For tracers such as tritium, the presence of two‐limbed input curves can be problematic because a single concentration can be associated with multiple disparate travel times. These shortcomings can be ameliorated by adding hydrologic and geologic detail to the model and by adding additional calibration data. However, the Salt Lake Valley model is useful even without such small‐scale detail.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to measure the impact of various vigor-related defects on the monetary value of hardwoods. To achieve this, we sampled 64 sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall) and 32 yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) trees from two locations in southern Quebec, Canada. We identified over 420 defects, which were grouped into 8 categories. The trees were then harvested and processed into lumber, and the value per unit volume of each stem was calculated from the value of the product assortment (lumber, chips, and sawdust). We found that visible evidence of fungal infections (sporocarps and (or) stroma) and cracks had the largest negative influence on value in both species. A model that included these defects was almost as good at predicting value as one that included a specifically designed quality classification. A more accurate assessment of value could be achieved using wood decay assessment tools and (or) by considering site-specific variables. Results from this study showed that visual identification of fungal infections and cracks could be used to enhance tree marking guidelines for hardwoods. This would meet both the silvicultural objective of selection cuts, by removing low-vigor trees, and the wood supply objective, by improving stem quality assessment prior to harvest.</jats:p>",

However, desalination is vulnerable to seawater pollution or emergency breakdowns. Therefore, reservoirs of a substantial capacity are needed for water supply under contingency, since existing water in storage and the water network can sustain maximum of two days of water demand in Abu Dhabi. The government has introduced Artificial Storage and Recovery (ASR) as part of Strategic Water Reserve program. This paper studies the effect of ASR on the current water supply system using system dynamics approach. As a result of the simulation, ASR can delay the appearance of the first water shortfall by 2 years and 9 months. Under uncertainties of red tide incidents and demand seasonality variation, Monte Carlo simulation analysis shows that the first water shortfall will be delayed by two and a half years at 97.5% confidence level than if no ASR is in place.</jats:p>",

Previous research has studied this topic, but not from the point of view of micro‐sized companies. Micro‐sized companies are of critical importance for economies worldwide. Thus, in Europe 90% of companies are micro‐enterprises and account for 53% of employment. This article presents a new perspective by studying the impact of the introduction of e‐supply chain management on such firms. Through a literature review, we identified four key supplier‐related factors, that is, the use of ICTs, process efficiency, workforce capabilities, and the introduction of e‐supply chain management. However, these factors could differ in the case of micro‐sized companies. The data used for the empirical analysis came from a survey of 405 micro‐sized companies in Spain. Using a structural equation modeling, the results indicate that ICTs have a positive direct effect on e‐supply chain performance. It is also found that this effect is accompanied by the improved development of human resource skills and enhanced process efficiency. In addition, a number of recommendations for improving managerial practices are also proposed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a supplier selling to multiple retailers using one of two constant wholesale pricing strategies: a uniform wholesale price (UWP) vs. a retailer‐specific wholesale price (RSWP). In line with the prior literature in economics, our initial finding is that as long as retailers are asymmetric, then (a) the supplier and less efficient retailer would prefer the RSWP strategy and (b) the more efficient retailer would prefer the UWP strategy. By examining the total profits of the supply chain under each pricing strategy, we present a new result: the UWP strategy results in a greater degree of supply chain efficiency as compared to the RSWP strategy. The key intuition driving this result is that by charging a UWP, the supplier signals a fair treatment for downstream retailers, which leads to the more efficient retailer being able to reduce market prices and hence capture a larger share of market demand. Noting that the supplier prefers the RSWP scheme as compared to the UWP scheme, we propose a contract which comprises two components: a UWP per unit complemented with a slotting allowance or side payment. The contract is always preferred by the supplier and also leads to greater supply chain efficiency. </jats:p>",

On the East Rift Zone (EZR) of Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, the effusion of lava causes changes in topography. When these elevation changes are summed over the area of an active lava flow, it is possible to quantify the volume of lava emplaced at the surface during the time spanned by the TanDEM‐X data—a parameter that can be difficult to measure across the entirety of an ~100 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> lava flow field using ground‐based techniques or optical remote sensing data. Based on the differences between multiple TanDEM‐X‐derived DEMs collected days to weeks apart, the mean dense‐rock equivalent time‐averaged discharge rate of lava at Kīlauea between mid‐2011 and mid‐2013 was approximately 2 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s, which is about half the long‐term average rate over the course of Kīlauea's 1983–present ERZ eruption. This result implies that there was an increase in the proportion of lava stored versus erupted, a decrease in the rate of magma supply to the volcano, or some combination of both during this time period. In addition to constraining the time‐averaged discharge rate of lava and the rates of magma supply and storage, topographic change maps derived from space‐based TanDEM‐X data provide insights into the four‐dimensional evolution of Kīlauea's ERZ lava flow field. TanDEM‐X data are a valuable complement to other space‐, air‐, and ground‐based observations of eruptive activity at Kīlauea and offer great promise at locations around the world for aiding with monitoring not just volcanic eruptions but any hazardous activity that results in surface change, including landslides, floods, earthquakes, and other natural and anthropogenic processes.</jats:p>",

In 2009, a relative increase in the isolation of Mycobacterium gordonae from pulmonary samples originating from General Hospital Zabok was noted by the National Mycobacteria Reference Laboratory. An epidemiological survey revealed a contamination of the cold tap water with M. gordonae and guidelines regarding sputum sample taking were issued. In addition, all incident cases of respiratory infection due to NTM reported from 2007 to 2012 at General Hospital Zabok were included in a retrospective review. Out of 150 individual NTM isolates, M. gordonae was the most frequently isolated species (n = 135; 90%) and none of the cases met the criteria of the American Thoracic Society for pulmonary NTM disease. While concomitant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was confirmed in only 6 (4%) patients, anti-tuberculosis treatment was initiated for a significant portion of patients (n = 64; 42.6%) and unnecessary contact tracing was performed. This study points out the need to enhance the knowledge about NTM in our country and indicates the importance of faster NTM identification, as well as the importance of good communication between laboratory personnel and physicians when evaluating the significance of the isolated NTM.</jats:p>",

Impact of [Formula: see text]:[Formula: see text] ratio and nitrogen supply on nitrogen remobilization in potted chrysanthemum grown in a subirrigation system. Can. J. Plant Sci. 94: 867–880. Subirrigation is being adopted as an environmentally friendly strategy for managing the nutrition of potted greenhouse plants. Here, we investigated two strategies for enhancing the remobilization of N during the development of the inflorescence in subirrigated potted chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.) in an attempt to improve nitrogen (N) use efficiency. (1) The replacement of a portion of the nitrate in the nutrient solution with ammonium decreased the nitrate content, especially in the stem plus petioles, and increased the reduced N content early in the growth cycle, but did not improve N use efficiency. (2) The use of a lower N supply (200 vs. 400 mg total N per pot delivered over 3 and 5 wk, respectively), either as nitrate or ammonium nitrate, eliminated nitrate accumulation prior to inflorescence development, thereby improving N use efficiency. Inflorescence quality was unaffected; however, at the lower N level there was some evidence of chlorosis on the oldest leaves. Thus, there may be considerable potential to reduce the N supply in a commercial greenhouse setting as long as an adequate supply is provided early in the growing period. </jats:p>",

Model calibration focused on the measured data (root depth, crop phenology, and the above‐ground biomass by year of growth. Calibration results showed a very good match between measured and simulated values. The largest and only significant difference was noted in 2008, when the crop was establishing and exhibited uneven radication. The simulation results for the next 5 years showed a variance from −4 to 5.7%, believed to be a very good match. A high coefficient of determination (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.995) and high Willmott index of agreement (0.998) were also indicative of a good match between simulated and recorded biomass yields.

The retailers are the same except their degrees of risk sensitivity. In this supply chain, we examine the performance of the buyback contract via behavioral experiments in which the supplier is played by human subjects and the risk‐sensitive retailers are computerized. We study the effect of profit margin and also demand dispersion under different game scenarios. Our behavioral experiments reveal that the human suppliers can be classified into three types, namely type I (the highly consistent and rational players), type II (the highly strategic players), and type III (naïve and highly irrational players). We further generate a few insights: (i) Decision‐makers behave as type II players in the low profit margin scenarios but not in the high profit margin cases; (ii) there are no significant pieces of evidence on the existence of the demand dispersion effect and the game type effect on both type I and type III players; and (iii) the average profits earned by type I and type II decision‐makers are similar, whereas type III decision‐makers are the smallest in almost all cases. We believe that this paper provides many new insights on supply contracting with reference to the behavioral risk of human decision‐makers. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Difficulties in accurate surveillance including imperfect diagnostic tools impair effective response to outbreaks. With arboviral infections causing a wide spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic infection to fatal neuroinvasive and haemorrhagic fevers, the potential impact on blood safety is significant. Asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals may introduce virus into the blood supply by donation, while recipients can potentially suffer severe consequences. Dengue, West Nile and chikungunya outbreaks have led to responses by blood transfusion services which can inform future planning. Reports of transfusion‐associated transmission demonstrate the potentially fatal consequences of lack of haemovigilance. South‐East Asia remains vulnerable to arboviruses with permissive climate and high levels of endemic transmission as well as the potential for emerging and re‐emerging arboviral diseases. Resource limitations constrain the use of expensive technologies for donor screening. Continued surveillance and research will be required to manage the arboviral threat to the blood supply.</jats:p>",

Features in the lithogenic flux record of each core correspond to similar features in the record of dust deposition in the EPICA Dome C ice core. Biogenic fluxes correlate with lithogenic fluxes in each sediment core. Our preferred interpretation is that South American dust, most probably from Patagonia, constitutes a major source of lithogenic material in Subantarctic South Atlantic sediments, and that past biological productivity in this region responded to variability in the supply of dust, probably due to biologically available iron carried by the dust. Greater nutrient supply as well as greater nutrient utilization (stimulated by dust) contributed to Subantarctic productivity during cold periods, in contrast to the region south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF), where reduced nutrient supply during cold periods was the principal factor limiting productivity. The anti-phased patterns of productivity on opposite sides of the APF point to shifts in the physical supply of nutrients and to dust as cofactors regulating productivity in the Southern Ocean.\n          </jats:p>",

In the metropolitan zone of Yaoundé, these vegetables are produced year round in family and commercial exploitations. The quality of the seeds, their mode of production and their system of distribution are little known. With the aim to better understand the seed system of traditional vegetables, a study on the supply, the production and the quality of these seeds was carried out. The data were collected using questionnaires on a sample of 133 traditional leafy vegetable producers of the urban and peri-urban zone of Yaoundé. The data were analyzed using SNAP 9 software. The study showed that the most produced species are amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus), nightshade (Solanum scabrum) and jute mallow (Corchorus olitorius). The market-gardeners are influenced in their choice of vegetable to cultivate by the preference of the customers (85.7% of the respondents) and the productivity of the cultivars (66.2% of the respondents). More than 40% of the respondents buy seeds in the markets while 7.5% buy seed from other producers and 10.5% in the agricultural inputs stores. About half (47.4%) of the respondents produce seeds by leaving plants in the field after the first or the second harvest while 36.8% of the market-gardeners select the most vigorous plants for seed production. On average, 58.7% of respondents preserve the seeds in hermetically closed bottles and plastic bag. Storage on field is practiced by a significant part of market-gardeners (41.4%). A total of 79.7% of the producers reported constraints with the produced seeds. Poor seed germination (81.1% of respondents) and the non uniformity of the seed (48.1% of the producers) were reported as the major constraints. The principal source of seed supply in the metropolitan zone of Yaoundé is the self production with rudimentary production and storage techniques subject to many qualitative constraints.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In regions that utilize thermal desalination as part of their water supply portfolio, the cogeneration of water and power in cogeneration desalination plants couples the supply sides of the electricity and water grids. For a fixed plant design, there is a limited range of ratios of generated electric power to produced water at any given time. Due to this coupling, electricity and water require co-optimization. In an environment in which electricity supply is determined by deregulated wholesale markets, this need for co-optimization suggests a need for integrated electricity and water markets. In this market, independent power producers, independent water producers and independent cogeneration plants would submit bids to satisfy demand over a time horizon to a clearing mechanism, indicating relevant physical constraints. The mechanism would then optimize supply of both electricity and water over the time horizon of interest. Recently, a simultaneous co-optimization method has been contributed for the economic dispatch of networks that include water, power and cogeneration facilities in such an integrated market. This paper builds upon this foundation with the introduction of the corresponding unit commitment problem.</jats:p>",

Here, we sought to identify novel targets for increasing plant Ca accumulation using genetical and comparative genomics. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping to 1895 cis- and 8015 trans-loci were identified in shoots of an inbred mapping population of Brassica rapa (IMB211 × R500); 23 cis- and 948 trans-  eQTLs responded specifically to altered Ca supply. eQTLs were screened for functional significance using a large database of shoot Ca concentration phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana. From 31 Arabidopsis gene identifiers tagged to robust shoot Ca concentration phenotypes, 21 mapped to 27 B. rapa  eQTLs, including orthologs of the Ca2+ transporters At-CAX1 and At-ACA8. Two of three independent missense mutants of BraA.cax1a, isolated previously by targeting induced local lesions in genomes, have allele-specific shoot Ca concentration phenotypes compared with their segregating wild types. BraA.CAX1a is a promising target for altering the Ca composition of Brassica, consistent with prior knowledge from Arabidopsis. We conclude that multiple-environment eQTL analysis of complex crop genomes combined with comparative genomics is a powerful technique for novel gene identification/prioritization.</jats:p>",

        "Norwich, a small city in Eastern Connecticut located in New London County, is at the source of the Thames River that flows into Long Island Sound passing the U.S. Submarine base in Groton and the Coast Guard Academy in New London along its way. The area contains several other small cities, most of which supply some of their residents with municipal water. Small towns also spread over the 600 sq. miles of county land along with some farms and many residential areas. Gradually over the years a considerable number of well water tests began to show pH's below the desirable range of 6.5 to 9.0. A summary of these pH tests and the increasing acidity trends are shown in Figure 1. for two types of wells, dug and drilled."
