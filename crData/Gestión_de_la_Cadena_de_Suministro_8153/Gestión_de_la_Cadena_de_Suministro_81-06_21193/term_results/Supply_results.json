Any scheme that is devised to solve the problems of international transfer prices should feature general ‘rules’ on how the various countries ought to share in central costs.

Each approach defines the critical concept of “adequate supply” in a different way. Other issues addressed include: who should engage in forecasting; what methods should be employed; is it worth the effort to forecast requirements for dental specialists; should forecasting be done for small areas; and what is the “political” reality of forecasting.</jats:p>",

Different distribution formulas, political influence of congressional representatives, bureaucrats, and individual aid recipients have been studied as the sole determinants of aid allocations. Each explanation, however, fails to examine the question of aid allocations from a demand-side perspective. This omission assumes that all governmental units are equally desirous of federal assistance and that any bias in the distribution of federal aid is a function of supply-side conditions. Identifying a linkage between demand-side and supply-side determinants of aid allocations, this article proposes and tests hypotheses derived from an integrated model of federal aid allocations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This study describes in detail the arteries supplying the ileum, cecum and proximal loop of the ascending colon in the ox important to the veterinary surgeon treating disorders of these segments of the intestinal tract. The ileum was vascularized by the mesenteric ileal artery (from the ileocolic), the first ileal artery (from the cranial mesenteric) and by the ileal branches of the cecal artery which, by means of their anastomoses, form a row of antimesenteric arches in the ileal part of the ileocecal fold. The termination of the ileum was also supplied by twigs from the ileocecocolic arch. The ileum appears to be the most vascular part of the small intestine. The cecum was supplied mainly by the cecal branches of the cecal artery. The proximal end of the cecum was also vascularized by branches from the ileocecocolic arch. The proximal loop of the colon was vascularized by the three colic branches of the ileocolic. The first colic branch supplied the third part of the loop, the second colic branch supplied the first and the second parts of the loop and the third colic branch supplied the first part and, together with the first cecal branch of the cecal artery, formed the ileocecocolic arch at the dorsolateral surface of the ileocecocolic junction.</jats:p><jats:p>The terminal branches of the arteries to the ileum, cecum and proximal loop of the colon detached lateral branches in the tunica muscularis which anastomosed with similar branches from neighboring arteries in an arcuate manner in the tunica submucosa. The terminal branches from both sides terminated in the free border, releasing branches which anastomosed with each other in the tunica submucosa.</jats:p><jats:p>The colic lymph nodes were supplied by the colic branches of the ileocolic artery, die two largest nodes being perforated by some of the branches of the first two colic branches. The ileal lymph nodes were supplied by the ileal arteries of the cranial mesenteric. They were also perforated by these arteries. Cecal lymph nodes were seen only in the specimen from the calf. They were much smaller than the colic and ileal nodes and were supplied by the first two or three cecal branches of the cecal artery and also by twigs arising directly from the cecal artery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Chemostat cultures of Bacillus subtilis subsp. niger WM were exposed to changes in the availability of phosphorus by means of a resuspension technique. Responses in wall metabolism were recorded by measuring the amounts of peptidoglycan and anionic polymers (teichoic or teichuronic acid) in the wall and extracellular fluid fractions. With respect to the wall composition, the effect of a change in orthophosphate supply was a complete shift in the nature of the anionic polymer fraction, the polymer originally present in the walls (\"old\" polymer) being replaced by the alternative (\"new\") anionic polymer. The peptidoglycan content of the walls remained constant. It was concluded that the incorporation of old polymer was completely blocked from the moment the orthophosphate supply was changed. However, from a measurement of the total amount of polymer in the whole culture during the course of the experiments, it was evident that synthesis of old polymer continued, but it was secreted. Synthesis of the new polymer started immediately, and it was incorporated exclusively into the wall. During adaption of the cells to the new environment, wall turnover continued in an identical fashion to that extant in steady-state cultures. It was concluded that the primary adaptive response to a change in orthophosphate supply occurred through a mechanism interacting with polymer incorporation and thus at the level of wall assembly at the membrane.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>River basin computer simulation studies often do not properly include the complex legal and institutional factors governing water allocation. These factors include formal water rights and informal borrowing agreements among the basin water users. An attempt has been made in this study to show that such factors can be included. We also show that an optimal, integrated approach to reservoir operations in a river basin can do much to alleviate the burden of new demands placed on available water resources. The procurement of a firm water supply for a proposed coal fired power plant is analyzed as a case study. An efficient river basin simulation model is used to determine the viability of a scheme for providing an annual firm water supply to the plant, with consideration of the existing water storage and demands within the basin. Given the hydrologic sequence considered, the model results show that the proposed strategy is viable in that the required firm water supply can be realized without causing harm to decreed water users in the basin. However, integrated diversion and reservoir operations are required to assure a desirable uniform rate of delivery of reusable effluent to the power plant.</jats:p>",
