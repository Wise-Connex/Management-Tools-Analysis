      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water suppliers worldwide are challenged by climate variations, but so far only the qualitative change in boundary conditions has become clear but not yet the degree and impact on the water supply systems. Short-term quality changes in surface waters can, e.g. be caused by extreme rainfalls after dry periods. Longer heat periods without rain can induce middle-term quality changes in surface waters due to lacking dilution. Furthermore, unsustainable management of groundwater can lead to long-term quality changes and to water shortages, especially in times with higher water demand. Depending on the individual situation, the expected effects on the supply system differ widely, so a general adaptation strategy will not suit the individual problems. The purpose of our work is to enable water supply companies to systematically identify potential risks resulting from climate change and other external factors in a water safety plan approach, and to adapt the supply system in a most effective way by taking advantage of ongoing modernization measures and ‘no-regret’-measures. A suitable adaptation strategy should address climate change conditions as well as other external factors like changing water demand and also to take into account possible effects on every part of the supply system.</jats:p>",

So, using static DEA models in dynamic environment can be potentially misleading. Using impulse response analysis it has been seen that shocks given to marketing strategy in MR affects more at each of the decision-making unit’s (DMU’s) compared to other variables, further the authors could also investigate the dependent variables (output) shocks to input variables. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Methodology can be applied to a wide range of evaluation problems in place of conventional DEA models. Results show that lagged effects can lead to substantial discrepancies in evaluation results. Biased evaluation results would easily lead to erroneous decision and policy making for the firm. Therefore the authors should always take a broader perspective in evaluating longitudinal performance by incorporating the effects into evaluation and decision-making processes. Future work of this study could look into the possibility of modeling in a stochastic supply chain environment. In addition, it will also be interesting to look into evaluating the stochastic DEA model in multiple time periods in order to examine whether there is any technological influence on the supply chain efficiency. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The contribution of this study provides useful insights into the use of DDEA as a modeling tool to aid managerial decision making in assessing supply chain efficiency in dynamic environment.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

The authors conducted exploratory case studies in two large Brazilian companies and two major suppliers, interviewing top supply chain executives. In the first case, they identified a more relational type of governance that was mainly based on the company's relationship with its suppliers which was driven by the desire to achieve a greater market share. IT investments focused on sales and operations planning projects where all systems were being integrated. In the second case, they identified transactional governance as the predominant form. This reflects the presence of a great number of suppliers, low partnership and low supply on time delivery rate. IT investments are being made to achieve more relational governance through expenditure on e-procurement and greater integration with their suppliers using ERP.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cooperative–adversarial dichotomy has served as the prevailing buyer–supplier relationship typology in the literature. Cooperative buyer–supplier relationships have been associated with closely tied relationships, while adversarial relationships have been equated to arms‐length relationships. We propose, however, that this perspective is overly simplified; a cooperative relationship is orthogonal to a closely tied relationship and an adversarial relationship to an arms‐length relationship. That is, there can be a closely tied yet adversarial relationship and an arms‐length yet cooperative relationship. We theorize the buyer–supplier relationship in two orthogonal aspects—(1) relational posture, that is, how two firms regard each other (as cooperative partners or as adversaries) and (2) relational intensity, that is, how much two firms’ operations are interlinked (closely tied or arms‐length). By considering the two aspects concurrently, this article proposes an expanded typology of buyer–supplier relationships. We label a closely tied and cooperative buyer–supplier type as “deep”; a closely tied but adversarial type as “sticky”; an arms‐length and adversarial type as “transient”; and an arms‐length but cooperative type as “gracious.” We then present an analysis that supports the orthogonality of the two relational dimensions. This analysis suggests that the expanded relationship types are associated with different relational outcome trade‐offs. The data are collected from a global, large Japanese automaker and 163 of its suppliers in North America. Overall, the results provide empirical support for the expanded buyer–supplier relationship typology.</jats:p>",

Our results suggest that competitive incentives can be an effective approach to improving delivery, quality, innovation and flexibility, for purchases where the buyer–supplier relationship is characterized by balanced and moderate amounts of mutual dependence. However, competitive incentives are ineffective at generating improved cost performance. Cooperation appears to be the only way to improve cost but is only fruitful under conditions of high mutual dependence. In general, we find that high mutual dependence provides a good basis for cooperative incentives to successfully improve each of the types of performance included in our study. Finally, we find evidence that cooperation and competition can coexist without significant risk of decreased performance.</jats:p>",

The primary data were collected from randomly selected 1000 sample households at Tamil Nadu collected during the year 2009-10. The growth rate, AIDS model and supply projection techniques were employed to derive appropriate conclusions. The area under groundnut and sesame crop was found declining over years in Tamil Nadu. The sunflower area was also declining, but, the yield showed increasing trend implying the production growth mainly driven by yield. Unlike other oilseed crops, the coconut production was driven by area rather than productivity. The results of demand estimation revealed that about 66% increase in demand is expected by 2020 for groundnut oil whereasthe demand forsesame, coconut and other edible oils would increase by 67%, 66% and 78%, respectively in Tamil Nadu. Among all major edible oils,sunflower oil's demand was the highest followed by groundnut, palm, sesame and coconut oil. It is projected that there will be leapfrog jump in sunflower oil demand in the coming years, mainly due to increased awareness about low-saturated fat content in this oil. The total edible oil demand would increase from 6.38 lakh tonnes to 10.75 lakh tonnes by 2020. The resultsfrom thisstudy also revealed that, the groundnut oil and sesame oilsupply available from the state sources would decline and widen the production-household demand gap. Hence, urgent policy measures have to be initiated to increase the current level of production in these crops.</jats:p>"

This  might  be  attributable  to  the  character of construction  projects  and  the  structure  of  the  construction  industry. Formal  and  informal control mechanisms are well established in retail and manufacturing supply chains whichis evident  in  improved  product  performance.  However,  there  is  a  paucity  of  research  on  the construction  supply  chain especially  atidentifying  the  interplay  of  control  mechanisms  and their  relationship  with  project  performance.  In  the  case  of  large  and  complex  construction projects,  the  client-contractor  relationship  requires  input  control,  behaviour  control  and output control for successful project delivery. In the light of organisationcontrol theory and the existing literature on construction supply chains, this study evaluates the modus operandi of the client-contractor relationship based on three control mechanisms: input control (project risk  and  reward  power, and  intra-project  communication),  behaviour  control  (opportunism) and output control (project performance) using a structural equation model. A survey data of258 construction professionals working on construction projectsin Indiawas collected. The study findingsreveal that input control, in terms of project risk and reward power,and intra-project communication, largely influence behaviour control in terms of opportunism. However, behaviour controls do not directly affect output control in terms of project performance; rather, a direct effect of the input control mechanism of output control is particularly evident.</jats:p>"

To promote and guide future research in this nascent area, we engaged in a two‐step process that included a systematic review and categorization of product recall‐related literature and interviews with executives from along the entire supply chain. By oscillating between findings in the literature and themes that emerged during our interactions with executives, we discovered several research opportunities that have yet to be systematically examined by scholars. We also highlight four underutilized theories in supply chain management research—upper echelons theory, punctuated equilibrium theory, enactment theory, and justice theory—that could help guide future research in this area. For managers, this study reveals insights related to four key aspects of product recalls: (1) recall precursors (factors that may lead to recalls); (2) the recall process; (3) the impact of recalls; and (4) mitigation approaches (mechanisms firms can employ to reduce the impact of recalls). For scholars, our study identifies several emergent research opportunities and theoretical lenses in the same four areas and thus serves as a road map for future product recall research.</jats:p>",

We take a contingency perspective in the present research to investigate why this may be the case. Unlike most prior studies, we examine the issue from the viewpoint of the supplier as the recipient of buyer‐driven knowledge transfer, and assess factors that may attenuate or hamper its effect on the supplier's operational performance. We suggest, basing our arguments on the theoretical framework of motivation–opportunity–ability (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MOA</jats:styled-content>), that while buyer‐driven knowledge transfer activities provide an<jats:italic>opportunity</jats:italic>for enhancing the supplier's operational performance, the degree to which this opportunity is realized depends upon both the relative absorptive capacity (<jats:italic>ability</jats:italic>), as well as the supplier's trust in the buyer, and the supplier's innovativeness (<jats:italic>motivation</jats:italic>). Specifically, we theorize that the supplier's perceived overlapping knowledge and its perceived cognitive congruence with the buyer (reflective of the supplier's relative absorptive capacity) and the supplier's trust in the buyer serve as positive moderators, and the supplier's own innovativeness as a negative moderator. We assess these hypotheses within a unique context, namely that of small‐ and medium‐sized suppliers of large<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">S</jats:styled-content>outh<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">K</jats:styled-content>orean conglomerates (so‐called<jats:italic>chaebols</jats:italic>), using hierarchical linear modeling.

The reasons vary from inadequate institutional structures to chronic under-investment in water infrastructure. To address this, governments embark on reforms based on commonly accepted principles of good governance such as: separation of policy, regulation and service delivery; protecting customer interests; and ensuring financial viability of water utilities and restructuring them so as to benefit from economies of scale and economies of scope. Kosova initiated water sector reforms in 2000 based on five pillars: (i) establishment of a legal and institutional framework, (ii) consolidation of 30 municipal water utilities into seven regional entities, (iii) incorporation in line with corporate governance principles, (iv) establishment of an independent economic regulator and (v) ownership and pushing of reforms by government. The paper describes the challenges encountered in implementing these reforms which, as far as the institutional and legislative framework is concerned, were successfully completed by 2008. Also, the difficulties associated with consolidation of newly created institutions resulting from the reform and defining their roles in the water services sector are described in the paper.</jats:p>",

Despite this, the lack of monitoring requirements produces a lack of references for their water consumption. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting a case-study water consumption analysis of a public swimming pool in the city of Bologna (Italy). After upgrading the water fixtures and filters in summer 2012, consumption and attendance at the Cá Selvatica swimming pool were monitored. With an average daily attendance of 88.6 people/day, taking into account both personal and technical consumption, an overall per capita consumption of about 96.1 l/person/day was determined. The water demand for personal uses only (showers, toilets, etc.) was found to be about 44.6 l/person/day. These values can be used to assess retrofitting benefits and water consumption benchmarks.</jats:p>",

This SPAM services coverage area may cover 4 (four) regions in Riau province such as; Rokan Hulu regency, Rokan Hilir, Bengkalis and Dumai. The capacity of this SPAM is 500 l/second. Total financing required for development of this SPAM was approximately Rp. 344 billion. Project finance will be obtained from budget sharing scheme from APBN (Rp. 140 billion or 41%), APBD (Rp. 62 billion or 18%), and the private sector (Rp. 141 billion or 41%). Three stages of risk analyses have been applied in this paper, such as; (i) risk identification, (ii) risk assessment, and (iii) risk mitigation. Based on the simulation result, it was identified that the initial project NPV was in the rage of-Rp. 6.68 billion up to Rp. 18.01 billion. The mean value of the projected NPV was Rp. 6.27 billion. This project is considered to be risky to proceed, as there is 90% probability the projected NPV &lt; Rp. 0. After risk mitigation procedure will be applied, there is a mean value of the project NPV is Rp. 9.9 billion (increase by 30% from the initial NPV). Four significant risk variables affected NPV performance are identified as follow; (i) engineering cost for constructing water treatment plant and facilities, (ii) cost of pipelines installation and accessories, (ii) electricity costs, and (iv) chemical cost expenditure. A reduction of technical uncertainties including design changes; redundant of engineering risk costs, introduction of energy efficient technology during project operation may reduce electricity and chemical costs. Hence, based on the simulation results, it is confirmed that, the risk analyses procedure may improve regional SPAM regional technical and economy performances (e.i. NPV parameters).</jats:p>"

Geographical realities, population growth, and favorable economic conditions can create the impetus for investments in new technologies, while support by activist groups and NGOs can encourage more sustainable approaches using locally sourced water. New approaches–whether desalination, stormwater use, water recycling, or potable reuse–share a common path to mass adoption. After a period of piloting and demonstration-scale projects, water providers with few options become early adopters of new technologies. And after the early adopters have gained experience and have used it to support the new approaches, the costs and risks of failure decrease for other providers. Thus, a wider cross section can adopt the new approach. The pioneering projects described herein are the first stage of the reinvention of our urban water systems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water-supply outlooks that predict the April through July (snowmelt) runoff and assist in estimating the total water-year runoff, are very important to users that rely on the major contributing watersheds of the Colorado River. This study reviewed the skill level of April through July forecasts at 28 forecast points within the Colorado River basin. All the forecasts were made after 1950, with considerable variation in time period covered. Evaluations of the forecasts were made using summary measures, correlation measures and categorical measures. The summary measure, a skill score for mean absolute error, indicated a steady increase in forecast skill through the forecast season of January to May. The width of the distribution for each monthly forecast over the 28 locations remained similar through the forecast season. The Nash-Sutcliffe score, a correlation measure, showed similar results, with the Nash-Sutcliffe median showing an increase from 0.4 to 0.8 during the forecast season. The categorical measures used a three-section partition of the April through July runoff. The Probability of Detection for low and high flows showed an increase in skill from approx. 0.4 to 0.8 during the forecast season. The same score for mid-flow years showed limited increase in skill. The low False Alarm Rate illustrated the under forecast of  high-flow years. The Bias of the mid-runoff forecasts indicated over forecast early in the forecast season (January to March), with lower Bias later in the forecast season (April and May), ending the forecast season at 1.0, indicating no Bias. Forecasts for both low and high runoff were under forecast early in the season with a Bias near 0.5, improving to nearly 1.0 by the end of the forecast season. The Hit Rate measure illustrated the difficulty of mid-flow forecasts, starting at 0.5 in January and increasing to 0.75 in May due to the forecasting assumption of normal climatology for the remaining forecast period. There was no relationship between basin elevation and forecast skill, reflecting the snow vs. rain dominance in all basins.</jats:p>"

Even though, the Single Buyer Model had passed several process of evolution, it still a form of imperfect competition in which there is only one buyer and many sellers of a product. Therefore, other alternatives of electricity market model for MESI have been proposed, in order to carry on the MESI previous plan towards restructuring. This paper discusses three electricity market models; Single Buyer Market Model, Pool Market Model and Hybrid Market Model.

After a detailed dissection of the superior mesenteric artery we distinguished a branch, which is routed to the right lobe of the liver. The diameter of this vessel is 3.7 mm and the length is 8.2 cm. In the artery pathway, three consecutive branches were observed.

Although it grew slowly at first, after 1660 the company began to take on tens of thousands of customers. The company’s rapid expansion caused it serious problems in distribution, forcing it to re-evaluate its strategy for distributing water. Relying on the recommendations of Christopher Wren and others, the company reorganized its network by adopting a host of technological and business measures. In doing so, it was forced to work increasingly by designing individual components in light of their effects on the whole network.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sustainable management of water resources requires the identification of procedures to optimize the use and management of resources that are able to deal adequately with the problems of an integrated water service. Taking cue from the classic problem of transport of operations research, this paper proposes a procedure to optimize the allocation of resources for water supply in an area. The transportation problem has been particularized to the case of water resources management considering water intake structures present in a territory as source nodes and utilities in the area as destination nodes. The variables to be determined are the quantity of water resources transferred from each source node to each destination node, in order to achieve a balance between the needs and availability, minimizing the costs of supply consequently necessary. The problem that is obtained, is a constrained non-linear type problem that can be used, for example, to solve local problems of supply, through the redefinition of the distribution system. An application of the model to the province of Croton in southern Italy is shown. The results obtained from the application of the model show the reliability of the methodology in applications similar to that of the case study.</jats:p>",

Some starches have been used in water treatment as coagulant/flocculant/filtration aid, and might be applied as primary coagulant. Here, we show direct filtration with hydraulic rapid mixing, using 2–6 mg L−1 cationic corn starch as primary coagulant, considerably improves roof-harvested rainwater quality, achieving removal efficiencies of up to 71.7% of apparent colour, 78% of turbidity, 1.1 log-unit of total coliform, and 1.6 log-unit of Escherichia coli, meeting guidelines for turbidity, even for potable purposes. Cationic corn starch has proved to be a suitable primary coagulant when filtration is performed in a single-layer sand filter (coefficient of uniformity: 1.8, effective particle size: 0.52 mm), at hydraulic loading rate of 450 m day−1. However, a disinfection unit is required to meet an absence of faecal coliform.</jats:p>",

The Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) has gone through various stages of reform and has evolved from predominantly single entity to a multiplayer industry particularly in the generation sector. This literature review covers the evolution of MESI from the introducing of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs), issues surrounding and implementation of single buyer which had continued until now. The MESI reformed a single buyer functional structure and framework is also included. However, this model does not offer transparent competition. Thus, other alternative electricity market model, pool/hybrid market model could be applied in order to carry on the MESI previous plan towards restructuring.

In this article, the applicability of available standards and methods for establishing the water balance is reviewed on the basis of an evaluation of literature in the field. In principle, establishing the water balance is made straightforward by measuring, estimating, and calculating the components of the water balance. However, water balances are often established that do not cover all components or are based on rough estimates. In most cases, water balances are determined for a whole network, not for zones, and only at long, mostly yearly, intervals, resulting in limited informational value of the findings. The main reasons for this seem to be the effort involved, the limited availability of data, and the lack of adequate methods for determining unmeasured components. This article concludes that there is a need for developing methods and tools to support water utilities in establishing complete, zonal water balances with reasonable effort.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Low priced and attainable information technology has made it possible to connect critical and proprietary information with supply chain partners, because of ever growing size, complexity, 7/24 system ability, evolved production processes etc. need flow of knowledge continuously. The knowledge integrated in the supply chain management (SCM) systems affects both supply chain and organizational performance. But since there is no single entity on performance an effective systematically approach to performance measurement could not be established. Generally in previous studies, organizational performance hasn`t been measured within the terms of SCM but if integral unit endeavor performance can be judged by so the overall performance can be judged by its departments` efforts. So SCOR model is chosen because important supply chain characteristics and their associated interactions aren't ignored. And organizational performance is reciprocal that performance measurement is taken a system for integrating the management of supply chain and knowledge. Therefore the objectives of the study were appeared to be correlation levels and relationships between knowledge sharing, SCM and organizational performance. This study is unique in terms of the dimensions that are being investigated in Turkey. While there are studies on SCM and knowledge sharing, each examined alone, this study tried to undercover the relationships between these two terms.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the first time, different types of diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) anion-exchange resins, widely used in previous studies, were investigated to determine the most effective resin for the purification of microcystins (MCs). MCs were extracted from freeze-dried Microcystis aeruginosa cells that had been harvested from the Bueng Nong Khot reservoir, Khon Kaen, Thailand. The toxins were precipitated with ammonium sulfate and then fractionated using five different anion-exchange chromatography resins, followed by chromatography with a C18 cartridge. The toxins were further identified via liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) analysis, and the yields and purity were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection. DEAE Sephadex A-25 exhibited the best overall performance for MC purification regarding both yield and purity, followed by DEAE cellulose, DEAE Sephacel, DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow and Toyopearl DEAE. Four MC variants, MC-RR, MC-FR, [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-WR, were obtained, and [Dha7]MC-LR was the major variant, with a total yield of 53.08 mg and a purity of 95% using the Sephadex resin. This study indicates that protein precipitation and single-column chromatography using DEAE Sephadex A-25 constitute an effective method for the purification of a wide range of MC variants.</jats:p>",

The water sources  in the study vary from unprotected springs in creek beds to deep confined aquifers.  The frequency analysis of historical coliform detections indicate that aquifer types, depth to water and casing depth are important considerations; whilst maintaining well integrity and the presence of low permeable clay layers above the production zone are the dominant parameters for minimizing coliform contamination of water supply wells. However,  in karst and fractured rock aquifers, pathways for coliform transport exist, as evidenced in the &gt;200 MPN/100 mL level of coliform detection. Data indicate that there is no compelling evidence to support the contention that the wells identified as low risk are contaminated through geological strata and clay barriers. However, data strongly supports the suggestion that coliform detection from sample taps and wellheads stem from the surrounding groundwater and soil-plant sources as a result of failed well integrity, or potentially from coliform bacteria that can persist within biofilms formed on well casings, screens, pump columns and pumps. Coliform sub-typing results show that most coliform bacteria detected in town water supply wells are associated with the soil-water-plant system and are ubiquitous in the environment: Citrobacter spp. (65%), Enterobacter spp. (63%), Pantoea spp. (17%), Serratia spp. (19%), Klebsiella spp. (34%), and Pseudomonas spp. (10%). Overall, 70% of wells harbor detectable thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) with potentially 36% of species of animal origin, including Escherichia coli species found in 12% of wells.</jats:p>"

Modeling the complex systems in green supply chain can be hard in a computational utilization and inventory management of relationships exists. Two of the problems of IoT-enabled system are the lack of stable integrated architecture and autonomous mechanism. This paper proposes the intelligent IoT-enabled system in green supply chain using FCM and fuzzy QFD method. It aims to simulate complex system by linked physical and digital objects with relationships while enhancing decision-making performance efficiency for green inventory management. A case study and experiment evaluation of the proposed FCM approach on green supply chain is presented to provide some indication for work improvement. The experiment compares the total effects performance of the green inventory status as estimated by the two methods using the proposed IoT-enabled FCM and traditional FCM.</p>",

The framework includes three steps: (1) aggregated virtual reservoirs and various subsystems are established to determine the water releases from the entire system; (2) the common water-supply strategy is identified to determine the water releases from individual reservoirs; and (3) the joint operation problem is solved with a multi-objective optimization algorithm and the results are analyzed using a Many-Objective Visual Analytics Tool (MOVAT). A case study of the DaHuoFang-GuanYinGe-ShenWo multi-reservoir system in northeastern China is used to demonstrate the framework. Results show that the establishment of aggregated virtual reservoirs and identification of a common water-supply strategy could make use of the temporal and spatial differences of runoff, exert the effects of underlying hydrological compensation between river basins, and reduce the complexity of the joint operation model for multiple reservoir systems effectively. The MOVAT provides an effective means of solving many-objective problems, which are generally of particular concern to the decision-maker in practice.</jats:p>",

Hence, the managers have an option to select a new group of suppliers and allocate the optimal multi-period demand among the new group of suppliers to maximize their purchase value. In this context, the proposed hybrid model would be beneficial for the managers to operate their supply chain effectively and efficiently. The present research work will be helpful for the managers who are interested to reconfigure their supply chain under the failure of any supply chain partner or in a changing business environment. The model provides flexibility to the managers for evaluation of the different available alternatives to take a decision of optimal demand allocation among the suppliers. The proposed hybrid (fuzzy, TOPSIS and MILP) model provides more objective information for supplier evaluation and demand allocation among suppliers in a supply chain. The managers can use the proposed model to the analysis of other management decision-making problems. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This present research work devises a hybrid algorithm for multi-period demand allocation among the suppliers.

The detailed descriptions of performance management processes and integration practices can serve as inspiring benchmarks, as in the daily groceries supply chain, where the industry standard is especially interesting. They can also indicate practices to avoid, as in the home textiles supply chain. Another managerial take-away is the need to handle each relation, manufacturer-wholesaler and wholesaler-retailer store, with their specific affecting factors in specific ways. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Previous knowledge on performance management process integration is mainly based on manufacturing companies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In business management quantitative modelling is a core competency. It enables structuring various complex problems; reduce systems to their relevant elements and to make objective and clear decisions. This especially applies to production-distribution networks which are formed by multiple independent and globally active companies. Here, individual goals and collective tasks meet so that experienced-based knowledge is no longer satisfactory. A literature review showed that there is no satisfactory concept available for superior network and quantitative operational management in multi-tier business networks. Therefore, in this article we focus quantitative supply chain models as starting point for stipulations among independent network partners. First, we deduce the main elements of quantitative modelling for inter- and intra-organisational production-distribution planning. Thereby, we present an extension of the Two-Stage-Production-Distribution-Problem which can be used as starting point for iterative supply chain coordination. Based on a literature review we introduce a novel pivotal point supply chain management model. The approach induces ongoing alignment of the strategic, tactic and operative tasks. On each level of this hierarchical planning frame specific plans are computed for comparison and adjustment. The advantages of this approach can be found in the reliable objective basis for negotiations and the repeatable combined inter- and intra-organisational management.</jats:p>"

In response, this paper is designed to explore the supply chain risk management (SCRM) practice of automotive industry in Malaysia. In-depth case studies were conducted at two automotive components manufacturers based on three constructs of SCRM framework including the SCRM process, tools used in SCRM and techniques to minimize risk. The case studies revealed that the automotive companies implemented failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA), 5 why analysis, impact-aspect study, and recovery planning to manage their supply chain risks. In addition, brainstorming techniques, experience and expert judgment were mainly used as risk identification and assessment techniques. Most of the risks encountered during operations were dealt by reactive strategies such as back-up suppliers and increasing buffer stocks. Overall, the automotive companies are heading towards more formal and sophisticated SCRM especially with the certification of TS16949 although there are still plenty of rooms for improvements in the risk identification and risk assessment techniques since very limited quantitative techniques were evidenced.</jats:p>"

While fruitful, this focus misses the motivations that prompt firms to take economic action in the first place. Understanding cultural embeddedness provides insight into why individuals and firms behave as they do and how their behavior can influence network structure. Contrary to the belief that firms act solely for profit and growth, we note that cultural contents such as values, social issues and political ideologies explain firms’ motives and guide their economic activities. We explore the role of cultural embeddedness through a grounded study of Country Natural Beef, a sustainability‐oriented agricultural cooperative in the western United States. This supply network demonstrates strongly competing cultural claims among its members as well as a unique institutionalized culture. Cultural interactions at the node and network levels explain the functioning of and changes to the network. Through interviews, analysis of archival information and direct observation of pivotal events over a period of 5 years, we unpack cultural embeddedness and take an incremental step toward a theory of cultural embeddedness in cooperative supply networks.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

DBSF utilization is considered to be an alternative to fossil energy, like coal in China, associated with a reduction of environmental pollution. China has abundant biomass resources and is suitable to develop DBSF. Until now, a number of policies aimed at fostering DBSF industry have been proliferated by policy makers in China. However, considering the seasonality and instability of biomass resources, these inefficiencies could trigger future scarcities of biomass feedstocks, baffling the resilience of biomass supply chains. Therefore, this review paper focuses on DBSF policies and strategies in China, based on the supply chain framework. We analyzed the current developing situation of DBSF industry in China and developed a framework for policy instruments based on the supply chain steps, which can be used to identify and assess the deficiencies of current DBSF industry policies, and we proposed some suggestions. These findings may inform policy development and identify synergies at different steps in the supply chain to enhance the development of DBSF industry.</jats:p>"

Location characteristics and supply-side factors are increasingly important in determining FDI flows. We borrow the concept of supply chain capability (SCC) of countries, developed by Alam and Bagchi (2011), to analyze the relationship between FDI and SCC for a panel of 64 countries for the period 1990 to 2013. We examine for causal rather than associative links between these factors using the Granger-causality methodology. Our results indicate that FDI Granger-causes SCC, but the causal relationship is not bidirectional.

Therefore, this paper aims to examine the relevance of several prominent theories in strategic management for explaining the mediating role of operational capability in the relationship between supply chain practices and business performance. The resource-based view of the firm and neo-institutional theory are reviewed for their applicability to relate supply chain practices and operational capability in explaining sustained business performance. Supply chain practices are insufficient to drive business performance. Firms need to be able simultaneously to increase efficiency through supply chain practices and to be innovative through operational capability. Specifically, operational capability is forwarded as a key firm-specific capability that can result in significant and long-term improvement in organisational sustainability. Operational capability can serve as a critical mediating factor that better transmits the ambitions of supply chain practices onto business performance. As such, this paper provides a conceptual support to urge further research to empirically evaluate the relationship between supply chain practices, operational capability and business performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The precast construction industry is associated with a lot of activities, vast effort, many parties and numerous processes. The parties involved in the precast supply chain including the planning, design, manufacturing, transportation, installation and construction should have efficient communication and access to precise and latest information contributing to the enhanced collaboration, sustainability and improving the integration. The aim of this study is to explore the collaboration tools with proposing the cloud system architecture for the precast supply chain management. The research findings are according to the comprehensive review of the literature on supply chain management, precast construction industry and cloud computing. Findings demonstrates the major problems within the precast supply chain phases comprised of poor planning, ineffective communications among designers and manufacturers, incompetent employees and damage to raw materials, large size and heavy precast components and the poor on-site coordination. These major problems within the precast supply chain phases could contribute to negative consequences on the efficiency, productivity and effectiveness of precast delivery. Therefore, to mitigate and overcome these major problems within the precast construction, the cloud computing implementation as the valuable alternative could be delivered to enhance the efficiencies and effectiveness of the collaboration systems. This research propose and establishes the concepts of valuable collaborative tools, for instance the Cloud Computing Information Systems (CCIS), for assisting the processes, activities, information and networks within the precast supply chain management through increasing the opportunities to attain higher competitive advantages. Initially, it is anticipated that this research will result to the enhanced collaboration in order to deliver more competitive advantages and increase the opportunities for the globalisation of the construction industry. Secondly, it proposes an effective technique to establish innovative visions, enhanced productivity, increased effectiveness, improve integration and sustainability leading to efficient collaboration within the construction industry.</jats:p>"

The study was based on 300 network models with randomly distributed leaks and 35 networks generated through a sensitivity analysis. It was found that the leakage rate and average zone pressure head (AZP) before and after pressure reduction may be used in conjunction with the FAVAD equation to estimate the initial leakage area (A0S) and head-area slope (mS) of any system. In addition, A0S and ms were shown to provide good estimates respectively of the sum of the initial areas and head-area slopes of all the individual leaks in the system. The study found that a dimensionless leakage number may be calculated for any system and used to characterise the pressure-leakage response. Finally, the study showed that it is possible to convert between N1 and the leakage number using a simple equation.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the company faces a situation where, given the location and demand from the set of retail stores, it wishes to decide where to locate the warehouses (or distribution centres) and test centres and the routes to be used in transporting the fresh products from warehouses to stores, returned products from stores to test centres and finally, re-stockable returned products from test centres to warehouses. This is formulated as a binary integer linear programming problem. The problem is solved using LINGO and then, an analysis is performed to determine the sensitivity of the optimal solution to different parameters, including sales volumes, return rates, costs of operation and transportation and the various prices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The location of ground faults in railway electric lines in 2 × 5 kV railway power supply systems is a difficult task. In both 1 × 25 kV and transmission power systems it is common practice to use distance protection relays to clear ground faults and localize their positions. However, in the particular case of this 2 × 25 kV system, due to the widespread use of autotransformers, the relation between the distance and the impedance seen by the distance protection relays is not linear and therefore the location is not accurate enough. This paper presents a simple and economical method to identify the subsection between autotransformers and the conductor (catenary or feeder) where the ground fault is happening. This method is based on the comparison of the angle between the current and the voltage of the positive terminal in each autotransformer. Consequently, after the identification of the subsection and the conductor with the ground defect, only the subsection where the ground fault is present will be quickly removed from service, with the minimum effect on rail traffic. This method has been validated through computer simulations and laboratory tests with positive results.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In future cities, urban water systems (UWSs) should be designed not only for safe provision of services but should also be resilient to emerging or unexpected threats that lead to catastrophic system failure impacts and consequences. Resilience can potentially be built into UWSs by implementing a range of strategies, for example by embedding redundancy and flexibility in system design, or by rehabilitation to increase their ability to maintain acceptable customer service levels during unexpected system failures. In this work, a new resilience analysis is carried out to investigate the performance of a water distribution system (WDS) and an urban drainage system (UDS) during pipe failure scenarios. Using simplified synthetic networks, the effect of implementing adaptation (resilient design) strategies on minimising the loss of system functionality and cost of UWSs is investigated. Study results for the WDS case study show that the design strategy in which flexibility is enhanced ensures that all customers are served during single pipe failure scenarios. The results of the UDS case study indicate that the design strategy incorporating upstream distributed storage tanks minimises flood volume and mean duration of nodal flooding by 50.1% and 46.7%, respectively, even when system functionality is significantly degraded. When costs associated with failure are considered, resilient design strategies could prove to be more cost-effective over the design life of UWSs.</jats:p>",

In contrast, my analysis of the complete record of all trips taken in NYC taxi cabs from 2009 to 2013 shows that drivers tend to respond positively to unanticipated as well as anticipated increases in earnings opportunities. Additionally, using a discrete choice stopping model, the probability of a shift ending is strongly positively related to hours worked but at best weakly related to income earned. I find substantial heterogeneity across drivers in their elasticities, but the estimated elasticities are generally positive and rarely substantially negative. I find that new drivers with smaller elasticities are more likely to exit the industry, whereas drivers who remain quickly learn to be better optimizers (have positive labor supply elasticities that grow with experience). These results are consistent with the neoclassical optimizing model of labor supply and suggest that consideration of gain-loss utility and income reference dependence is not an important factor in the daily labor supply decisions of taxi drivers.</jats:p>",

The most important component when synthesizing nanofibers using the electrospinning technique is a DC high voltage power supply. Some requirements must be fulfilled by the high voltage power supply, i.e., it must be adjustable and its output voltage reaches tens of kilovolts. This paper discusses the design and development of a high voltage power supply using a diode-split transformer (DST)-type high voltage flyback transformer (HVFBT). The DST HVFBT was chosen because of its simplicity, compactness, inexpensiveness, and easiness of finding it. A pulse-width modulation (PWM) circuit with controlling frequency and duty cycle was fed to the DST HVFBT. The high voltage power supply was characterized by the frequency and duty cycle dependences of its output voltage. Experimental results showed that the frequency and duty cycle affect the output voltage. The output voltage could be set from 1 to 18 kV by changing the duty cycle. Therefore, the nanofibers could be synthesized by employing the developed high voltage power supply.</jats:p>"

A key step during the development of the pre-established model is to identify the fluorescence fingerprint, i.e. the number of fluorescent DOM (FDOM) components as well as their excitation and emission spectral features. In practice the samples to use for model development may not be measured immediately after sampling and will instead be stored for a relatively long time, thus raising the question whether the storage would change the intrinsic fingerprints. In this study, two PARAFAC models were separately developed and validated for the same set of surface water DOM samples from an estuary and its river, immediately after sampling and after 9-month storage respectively. The fingerprint did not change after storage, regardless of the change of the intensity of some components. The findings in this study highlighted that DOM samples stored using a simple protocol (i.e. filtration to 0.45 μm pore size without any preservatives and placed at 4 °C in the dark under airtight conditions) for a few months would not change fluorescence fingerprints for PARAFAC and broaden our understanding of the application of PARAFAC to DOM studies.</jats:p>",

However, there is significant variability in the remaining top 25 in comparison to previous editions, which is corroborated by an analysis of the concentration (i.e., diversity) of authors in the discipline that indicates that a greater number of authors and institutions continue to contribute SCM publications. However, this diversity is concentrated primarily among North American institutions as international institutions are not increasing publication productivity in the established journal set. Ultimately, the combined results provide a benchmark of the current status of the SCM discipline and present insights into its continued maturation.</jats:p>",

To begin with, the definition of WECC was elaborated. Combined with hydraulic, hydrologic and water quality data, a one-dimensional water quality model was subsequently applied to simulate the water pollutants (chemical oxygen demand (COD)) in Tieling City. Then, a multi-objective model was applied to explore WECC. Economy, demography, and contaminant were selected as goals, taking into account the constraints of macroeconomic aggregates, water supply, water quality, and population. The results showed WECC could nearly carry all planned gross domestic product (GDP), population in the planning years 2015, 2020, and 2025 with the maximum COD of 30,681.7 t, but not for the condition of maximum COD of 15,709.0 t. That is, COD overload would occur if GDP and population develop as planned. Some measures must be taken to improve WECC in Tieling City, which are valuable for supporting the adjustment and planning for social-economic development.</jats:p>",

Both assessments identified well re-location as the least preferred option, however, this result is very sensitive to the distance from the waterworks to the new well. When bioaugmentation is compared to GAC, the former has a lower impact in 13 impact categories, but if immobilized bacteria are used, the impacts are higher than for GAC in all impact categories.

In previous researches on P-D planning, the demands of the retailers and their inventory levels have less been controlled. This may lead into huge challenges for a P-D plan such as the bullwhip effects. Therefore, to remove this challenge, the purpose of this paper is to integrate a P-D planning and the vendor-managed inventory (VMI) as a strong strategy to manage the bullwhip effects in supply chains. The proposed P-D-VMI aims to minimize the total cost of the manufacturer, the total cost of the retailers, and the total distribution time simultaneously. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper presents a multi-objective non-linear model for a P-D planning in a three-level supply chain including several external suppliers at the first level, a single manufacturer at the second level, and multi-retailer at the third level.

The method of investigation involved systematic random sampling with the use of questionnaires and interviews with the students and teachers and onsite inspection of the sanitation facilities available within the schools. The results revealed that 24% of schools used W/C while 76% of schools used pit toilets, of which 88% were ordinary pit toilets and 12% VIP. The number of toilets within the schools ranged between 0 and 14 revealing a 185:1 student to toilet ratio within the study area, but ranged widely from 83:1 to 510:1 between schools. The study, however, revealed the absence of wash hand basins in 77% of the schools and no soap in 88% of the schools with wash hand basins. Investing in clean water, sanitation and hygiene education in these public schools should become a priority for governments in developing countries and School Sanitation and Hygiene Education program (SSHE) should be adopted and implemented across schools in Nigeria.</jats:p>",

The novel device was calibrated for the measurement of microcystin concentrations in water. Laboratory calibration studies of the passive sampling devises under controlled conditions of temperature, water turbulence, and analyte concentration were conducted in order to establish how variable environmental conditions affect the novel sampler's performance. The chemical uptake of microcystin (MC)-RR, -LR, and -YR into the passive sampler remained linear and integrative throughout the 28-day exposure. The relative standard deviations of mean concentrations obtained using silicone-based sampler ranged from 1.42 to 3.74% for microcystin-LR, -RR, and -YR. The values for reproducibility from triplicate samplers ranged from 3.5 to 7.1% for microcystin-LR, -RR, and -YR. The detection limits on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with PDA detection for microcystins LR, RR, and YR were 24.7, 17.2, and 23.8 μg L−1 respectively, calculated as three times the signal to noise ratio. The rate of accumulation of most of the MC compounds tested was dependent on temperature and flow velocity. Furthermore, the sample matrix, e.g. humic substances, had no significant effect on the concentration of compounds trapped in the acceptor solution and once these MC compounds were trapped in the acceptor phase they did not diffuse back during the deployment period.</jats:p>",

It is highly successful in machining of most ordinary steels, and synthetic biodegradable polyol esters play a significant role as an effective cutting fluid with a very small amount. Recent concern for environmentally friendly manufacturing further encourages the attempts at applying near-dry operations to machining of difficult-to-cut materials. Since titanium alloys are typical difficult-to-cut materials, this paper investigates the cutting performance of various near-dry methods in turning of a titanium alloy from the view point of elongating the tool life. Those near-dry methods include regular MQL and hybrid mist supply operations, where the hybrid mist is a mixture of MQL mist and coolant mist which is atomized water-soluble cutting fluid. The regular MQL operation provided considerably long tool life compared with that of dry machining and the hybrid mist operation showed the possibility of making the tool life longer. The cutting performance was largely influenced by the type of MQL lubricants. In particular, a synthetic polyol ester lubricant having low viscosity indicated the successful cutting performance when it was combined with the coolant mist supply in the hybrid mist application.</jats:p>"

In order to answer research questions the authors have proposed a theoretical framework and derived research hypotheses. The authors identified constructs and items through extant literatures and developed a structured questionnaire which was pretested before using for final survey. The data were collected in two phases and also performed wave analysis to check non-response bias to avoid any significant impact of non-response bias on statistical analysis. The data has been used to conduct exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation which reduces variables into five parsimonious and orthogonal factors. The factor analysis output was further used as an input of regression analysis. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The factor analysis output has further validated the findings from literature review.

This article explores some new and innovative ways that the Australian employment standards enforcement agency – the Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) – has sought to address the problem of employment non-compliance in complex supply chains. In particular, we examine three distinct mechanisms used by the FWO, namely: supply chain litigation, enforceable undertakings and proactive compliance deeds. We argue that these initiatives illustrate the way in which regulatory agencies can better target their resources and maximise the general deterrence of enforcement action by focusing not only on the direct employer, but on those firms which are in a position to influence compliance behaviour more broadly. </jats:p>",

Thus, an approach to remove repetitive readings in supply chain is paramount to minimize massive data storage that could affect query performances.

The global supply chain is a paradigmatic example of economic structures on which the impacts of unexpected events propagate rapidly through the system. Climate change, which affects societies all over the world, is one of the most important factors influencing the efficiency of the present economic networks. During the last decades a large set of studies have been oriented to investigate the direct impacts generated on specific geographical areas or productions.

By comparing two types of counterfeiters—deceptive, so infiltrating a licit (but complicit) distributor, or nondeceptive in an illicit channel—we provide insights into the impact of anticounterfeiting strategies on a brand-name company, a counterfeiter, and consumers. Our analysis highlights that the effectiveness of these strategies depends critically on whether a brand-name company faces a nondeceptive or deceptive counterfeiter. For example, by improving quality, the brand-name company can improve her expected profit against a nondeceptive counterfeiter when the counterfeiter steals an insignificant amount of brand value. However, the same strategy does not work well against the deceptive counterfeiter unless high quality facilitates the seizure of deceptive counterfeits significantly. Similarly, reducing price works well in combating the nondeceptive counterfeiter, but it could be ineffective against the deceptive counterfeiter. Moreover, the strategies that improve the profit of the brand-name company may benefit the counterfeiter inadvertently and even hurt consumer welfare. Therefore, firms and governments should carefully consider a trade-off among different objectives in implementing an anticounterfeiting strategy. </jats:p>",

Silver-coated ceramic pot filters (CPFs) are a relatively common form of household water treatment system (HWTS) representing an effective and sustainable technology for poor communities. Water production seems to be the major limiting factor of the CPF's lifetime and sustainability since low flow rates do not produce an adequate daily volume of treated water. This paper describes a long-term study of CPF flow rates under controlled conditions using three different water sources. The relationship between water characteristics and flow rate was assessed with the intent of identifying the principal parameters that impact CPF water production. The study concluded that turbidity seems to be the principal indicator in determining CPF lifetime in terms of quantity of treated water. There is no evidence that biological activity also contributes to premature failure of CPFs and the data did not indicate that chemical precipitation is responsible for the filter clogging. Manufacturers commonly conduct initial flow rate tests using clear water as a measure of quality assurance. However, the relationship between initial flow rate and average flow rate during the lifetime of the CPF should be further studied.</jats:p>",

Each regional policy shock affects supply via their respective banks (for example, U.K. monetary policy affects credit supply in Mexico via U.K. banks), in turn implying strong real effects, with substantially larger elasticities from monetary rates than QE. Moreover, low foreign monetary policy rates and expansive QE increase disproportionally more the supply of credit to borrowers with higher ex ante loan rates—reach-for-yield—and with substantially higher ex post loan defaults, thus suggesting an international risk-taking channel of monetary policy. All in all, the results suggest that foreign QE increases risk-taking in emerging markets more than it improves the real outcomes of firms.</jats:p>"

An alternative DNA extraction buffer allowed for qPCR detection at lower seed levels than a commercial extraction kit buffer. In addition, the use of a second spin column cycle produced significantly better detection (P = 0.031), and the volume of Tris–EDTA buffer significantly affected crossing threshold values (P = 0.001). The improved extraction procedure was evaluated using 10 L of tap water samples processed by ultrafiltration, centrifugation and immunomagnetic separation. Mean recovery for the sample processing method was determined to be 41% using microscopy and 49% by real-time PCR (P = 0.013).

A self-administered questionnaire survey with measurement in Likert scale was used to collect the required data from the users for comparison. Wilcoxon signed rank tests for single and paired samples were used to analyze the data. Results of the analysis show that Hong Kong port excels in facilities, services, and management while Shenzhen port surpasses in location and costs. The respective advantages are related to the historical development of the two ports and their geographical locations with respect to the common hinterland – the Pearl River Delta region. Ways to enhance collaboration between the two ports include, among others, information sharing to improve visibility, road network and other infrastructure investment to strengthen linkage, and joint venture to develop port-centric logistics. The findings shed light on the relative significance of the factors affecting the choice of ports of freight forwarding and shipping companies and provide an objective empirical basis for comparing the competitiveness between ports. The results can help the two ports in question reposition themselves to leverage further their respective competencies as advocated in the resource-based view theory. Major areas identified for possible collaboration between the two ports to achieve mutual benefits as promoted in the network theory also help strengthen the overall competitiveness of the port network in the long run.</p>",

The multivariate relationship model proposed here is grounded in trade credit, agency and transaction costs theories. This study is based on a technique known as path analysis that uses a system of simple regressions estimated by simultaneous equations. The main results show the following: (i) trade credit and short-term bank loans are supplementary (and not substitute) sources of funds for MSMEs, which demonstrates that trade credit can be used by financial institutions as an indicator of the creditworthiness of the company; (ii) the proportion of credit sales, the days sales outstanding measure and sales growth are positively related to the amount of trade credit demanded, which suggests that trade credit is transferred along the supply chain; and (iii) the supply of trade credit is positively related to the importance that management ascribes to both internal capital and bank credit, which illustrates the strategic use of the supply of trade credit to increase sales. These results have important implications for companies' managers, financial institutions and the government agencies responsible for formulating policies that support and promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The analysis is based on a sample of 681 SCOME appointments that were publicly announced during the 2000–2011 period. We find that the stock market reaction is positive on the day of the announcement. Categorizing the SCOME appointments as new or old and insider or outsider, we find that the market reaction for newly created SCOME positions is positive. The market also reacts more positively when a SCOME is an outsider rather than an insider. The strongest positive reaction is observed when outsiders are hired for newly created SCOME positions. We find evidence of both poor stock price performance and poor operating performance in the period preceding the appointment of new SCOMEs. New SCOME appointments are not followed by an immediate improvement in stock price and operating performance. However, there is no further decline in performance, suggesting that the decline observed in the preappointment period does not continue after the new SCOME is appointed. We also find that the likelihood of a SCOME being an outsider is greater for firms that are smaller, operate in more concentrated industries, and have experienced poor prior performance. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

To investigate urban water resource security, the supply demand pressure of water resources and the urban expansion index were analyzed under different developing scenarios in this paper. Based on the economic data of Urumqi, a typical inland city in the arid area, under the present development scenario from 2011 to 2030, a system dynamics model was constructed to simulate the water resource security. The results show that there will be great influence of urban expansion on water resource security in Urumqi in the future. Water resources are projected to become increasingly scarce if the urban expansion is left unchanged in terms of population, economic growth and water-use efficiency. To find a sustainable method for water resource use, four scenarios of urban expansion were set up based on the sensitive variables. Based on comparison of water consumption under the different scenarios, the harmonize scheme for urban water resource security is the best choice for the development of Urumqi. If the impact of urban expansion on urban water resource security alleviates in the future, the main parameters would have to reach a new standard of water use. Reducing the sewage and increasing the reuse proportion of wastewater are also very important for relieving the stress of water shortage. This research can serve as a reference for water resource allocation and urban planning in arid areas.</jats:p>",

Specifically, operational environments in developing countries constrain the supply chain technology (SCT) used by firms to manage supply chain operations. Hence, it is reasonable to conjecture that firm's operating in these types of environments might rely on and use SCT and the information they provide to manage their supply chain operations differently from firms in less constraining environments. To explore this phenomenon we conducted a grounded theory study collecting interview data from 46 logistics and supply chain managers at 16 firms across India, one of the largest and most dynamic of the developing countries. Our analysis of the data establishes that SCT constraints arise from external, internal, and relationship conditions. Emerging from the data we observed managerial emphasis on a phenomenon whereby management utilizes coping strategies to relax constraints that adversely affect their use of SCT. While our findings also revealed human intervention as a negative externality arising from the use of coping strategies, we found that management were aware of this externality and were actively addressing it as part of their efforts to relax the constraints on SCT.</jats:p>",

A large range of veterinary and human antibiotics were analysed in raw and treated water from the French Seine-Normandy Basin, based on the development of two analytical methodologies using solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clorsulon (an anthelmintic), fluoroquinolones, macrolides, sulfonamides (such as sulfamethoxazole, sulfadiazine), tetracyclines and trimethoprim were detected in raw surface water. Regarding the efficiency of drinking water treatment, an ozone/granular activated carbon combination proved to be effective in removing most antibiotics except danofloxacin and enrofloxacin which have an ionisable character and insufficient ozonation kinetic constant.

The supply chain consists of one manufacturer and one retailer where customer demand depends on the retail price and advertisement expenditure. The authors examine this problem in two game-theoretic models: a cooperative game and a non-cooperative Stackelberg-manufacturer game, respectively. Propositions and insights are developed from the analysis of these models. The original production plan has some robustness in face of the disruptions of demand and production cost in both cooperative and non-cooperative models.

In addition, the cooperative channel achieves higher channel profits and higher social surplus than the non-cooperative model by using a lower retail price and a higher level of advertising efforts to promote demand.</p>",

However,  realisation  of  these  perceived  benefits  is  limited  to  date,  due  to  several barriers hindering 5D BIM implementation:incomplete design and insufficient model object data in the BIM model; a lack of standards to facilitate electronic measurement; legal issues, and  a  lack  of  government  support.

Focusing on wild mushroom picking with commercial value (Lactarius deliciosus (L.) Gray) as an example, the main objective of this paper is to obtain empirical evidence about the impact of meteorological and economic variables on the mushroom supply. A multidisciplinary vector error correction (VEC) model for mushroom supply is estimated. Coefficients for the Error Correction Term (ECT) are all significant, at the 0.01 significance level, both in the model for prices and for collected mushrooms. The value of the ECT coefficient in the equation for prices is −0.086 (t-value: −9.321), and for the collected mushroom equation is 0.499 (t-value: 3.913). The impact of precipitation on price changes is −0.104 (t-value: −1.66), and the impact of temperature on mushroom harvest picking is 0.605 (t-value: 3.07). We find that including climate factors to explain mushroom supply considerably strengthens the explanatory power of the model, and in some cases greatly changes the results.</jats:p>"

We present causal estimates that targeted interventions aimed at methamphetamine input markets (‘precursor control’) can temporarily increase retail street prices, but methamphetamine consumption is weakly responsive to higher drug prices. After the supply interventions, purity‐adjusted prices increased then quickly returned to pre‐treatment levels within 6–12 months, demonstrating the short‐term effects of precursor control. The price elasticity of methamphetamine demand is −0.13 to −0.21 for self‐admitted drug treatment admissions and between −0.24 and −0.28 for hospital inpatient admissions. We find some evidence of a positive cross‐price effect for cocaine, but we do not find robust evidence that increases in methamphetamine prices increased heroin, alcohol, or marijuana drug use.

First, to review the existing critical success factors (CSF) literature in the context of supply chain management (SCM). Second, to analyze the occurrence frequency of every possible CSF in SCM literature. Third, to identify the “vital few” and the “useful many” CSF that are harmonized across the SCM field. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A time-specific and term-sensitive literature review technique is undertaken to generate a list of possible CSF in SCM. The review yielded 55 papers, but only 26 empirical CSF papers were selected for analysis as the reliability and validity of the factors had been rigorously tested. Consequently, a Pareto analysis approach was applied to trace the CSF frequency of occurrence in SCM literature. By performing a Pareto analysis, this present study is able to identify and categorize the “vital few” and “useful many” CSF that are consistent throughout various fields of SCM. The review and results are tabulated and a Pareto diagram has been constructed to provide a summary of findings. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Out of the 26 selected empirical papers, 25 potent CSF in SCM literature have been extracted. From the Pareto analysis, nine CSF represent 80.68 percentage of occurrence which is regarded as the “vital few” CSF in SCM. The remaining 16 CSF represent 19.32 percentage of occurrence and is regarded as the “useful many” CSF in SCM. The nine “vital CSF” are immensely important, because in order to achieve supply chain and operation success, one must recognize the few vital factors that are responsible for the larger impact onto the industry compared to the other 16 “useful many” CSF. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The study offers some sense of assistance to SCM managers in highlighting the vital few CSF that matter most, regardless of their nature of SCM fields. Thus, saving their energy, time, and resources in determining the critical pieces of information. For academicians, this study provides a platform for future SCM CSF research and the results could aid researchers in developing the research instrument. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study is the first attempt to apply Pareto analysis for SCM CSF studies and critically analyzing a wide range of SCM CSF literature.

In this paper a market conceptualization based on agent‐based computational economics is presented that includes transport costs in the negotiations and enables the modeling of supply chains as structures that emerge from market dynamics. It is shown that this conceptualization can capture the market dynamics that are needed to simulate a dynamic supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Green supply chain management and reverse logistics has emerged as a key area of research interest. Recent environmental regulations have also stimulated interest in this field. However, information sharing is a prerequisite to efficient and effective logistics utilisation. Manufacturing organisations in China were argued to be 10-20 years behind their Western counterparts in relation to information sharing in their supply chains (). This barrier needs to be addressed if China is going to maintain and grow its manufacturing position in the world, attempt to address green supply chain issues and their negative externalities. A systematic literature review was undertaken and green supply chain management theoretical framework adopted. The paper explores the perceptions of senior management toward green logistics and information sharing in Chinese electronic manufacturers. Previous research has concentrated on the focal companies (brand owners). This research concentrated on SME organisations further up the supply chain. Semi-structured interviews of eighteen senior managers of electronic manufactures in Jiangsu province China were conducted in 2012. Thematic analysis is applied and the findings contrasted to other research. The paper provides insight to the current status of managers' views on information sharing and green supply chain initiatives. Information platform, skills, investment, and trust emerged as key influences on their willing to engage in information sharing in relation to green supply chains. This research, among others, assists to inform policy for optimal evidence based intervention. Future research directions are also considered.</p>",

In this study, an electrolytic method for the denitrification of groundwater was investigated in a laboratory reactor. We used an ion-exchange membrane, employing a titanium oxide anode and five kinds of cathode for the investigation. The nitrate removal efficiencies with Cu, Pb, Ti/Ir/Ru, Ti/Ir/Ta, and Zn cathodes were 30.0%, 59.9%, 73.8%, 23.3%, and 80.6%, respectively. A cation-selective membrane was employed to separate the electrode compartments, and only the proton produced in the anode side was permitted to the cathode side in order to avoid reversible reactions. In terms of the nitrate removal, good experimental results were obtained by using the membrane reactor equipped with the Zn cathode. The nitrate concentration level dropped from 30 to 6 mg/L, which is below the limit for drinking water. The pH was not affected significantly by the current density and it increased up to 9.0 at 100 mA/cm2. The nitrate removal efficiency showed the highest value with 1 mM of NaCl as an electrolyte. The impression was that membrane electrolysis made it possible to avoid the re-oxidation problem. It appears clear that electrolytic denitrification with an ion-exchange membrane is a very effective process with a mean energy consumption of only between 26.9 and 112.9 kWh/kg-NO3.</jats:p>",

Greater disarticulation of maintenance work makes regulatory oversight more convoluted and expensive to do thoroughly and transparently. Using a Pressure, Disorganisation and Regulatory Failure model, the article highlights how new work arrangements involving increased use of supply chains are developing more quickly than adequate airline, union and regulator responses to the safety problems engendered by those changes. In often heated industrial debates between licensed aircraft maintenance engineers (LAMEs) and airline managers about business needs and safety, we urge that more attention be paid to LAME concerns about outsourcing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply chain outsourcing has posed problems for conventional labour regulation, which focuses on employers contracting directly with workers, particularly employees. These difficulties have been exacerbated by the traditional trifurcated approach to regulation of pay and conditions, work health and safety and workers’ compensation. This paper analyses the parallel interaction of two legal developments within the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry. The first is mandatory contractual tracking mechanisms within state and federal labour laws and the second is the duties imposed by the harmonised Work Health and Safety Acts. Their combined effect has created an innovative, fully enforceable and integrated regulatory framework for the textile, clothing and footwear industry and, it is argued, other supply chains in different industry contexts. This paper highlights how regulatory solutions can address adverse issues for workers at the bottom of contractual networks, such as fissured workplaces and capital fragmentation, by enabling regulators to harness the commercial power of business controllers at the apex to ensure compliance throughout the entire chain. </jats:p>",

A total of 97 water and biofilm samples from the municipal water inlet of the hospital, theatres, theatre sterilization service unit, central sterilization service unit, endoscopy/gastroscopy unit, intensive care unit and the renal unit were collected and examined for the presence of FLA using an amoebal co-culture and molecular techniques. Of the 97 samples, 77 (79.4%), 40 (52%) water and 37 (48.1%) biofilm, contained FLA. The genera Acanthamoeba, Vermamoeba (formerly Hartmanella) and Naegleria were detected by morphology, 18S rRNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and sequence analyses. Further sequence analysis of the five Acanthamoeba-positive isolates revealed a close resemblance with the potentially pathogenic T20 genotype. These results show a potential health risk to immuno-compromised patients and health care workers as some of the species detected are pathogenic and may harbor potential intracellular bacteria responsible for nosocomial infections. To date, this is the first report on the detection of potentially pathogenic amoebae from South African hospital water systems.</jats:p>",

In this study, UTHP was further investigated for the photocatalytic degradation of microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Results showed that three mechanisms could realize MC-LR photocatalytic degradation using TiO2. H2O2 could effectively inhibit recombination and considerably improve the production of radicals and superoxides. From a correlation of the removal rate with the isomerization and decomposition of MC-LR under UV irradiation it was inferred that isomerization was crucial for MC-LR degradation during photocatalysis given the vulnerability of the exposed conjugated double bonds. The photocatalysis of MC-LR was apparently dependent on pH and MC-LR initial concentration. Under the optimum conditions of pH 3.5, 0.05 g/L TiO2, and 0.05 mmol/L H2O2, 100% MC-LR (308 μg/L) could be removed within 60 min. This process was accompanied by a synergistic effect during the initial 10 min.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In the Eastern Pacific, lithogenic input to the ocean is a response of the atmospheric and ocean system variability and their teleconnections over different timescales. Atmospheric (e.g., wind fields, precipitation), hydrological (e.g., fresh water plumes) and oceanic (e.g., currents) conditions determine the transport mode and the amount of lithogenic material transported from the continent to the continental shelf. Here, we present the grain size distribution of a composite record of two laminated sediment cores retrieved in the Peruvian continental shelf, covering the last ~1100 yr at sub-decadal to centennial time-series resolution. We then discuss the paleo-environmental significance and the climatic mechanisms involved. Four grain size modes were identified. Two are linked to aeolian inputs (M3: 53.0 μm and M4: 90.8 μm on average), the third is interpreted as a marker of sediment discharge (M2: 9.4 μm on average), and the last is without an associated origin (M1: ~3 μm). The coarsest components (M3 and M4) dominated during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and Current Warm Period (CWP) periods, suggesting that aeolian transport increased as consequence of wind stress intensification. In contrast, M2 displays an opposite behavior, exhibiting an increase in fluvial terrigenous input during the Little Ice Age (LIA), in response to more humid conditions. Comparison with other South American paleoclimate records indicates that the observed changes are driven by interactions between meridional displacement of the Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and of the South Pacific Sub-tropical High (SPSH) at decadal and centennial time scales.\n                        </jats:p>"

The response of these channels to variations in sediment supply remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the morphodynamic response of a variable‐width channel to changes in sediment supply through laboratory experiments conducted in a straight flume in which we imposed sinusoidal variations in width. We first developed equilibrium conditions under a constant sediment supply and then eliminated the sediment feed to create a degraded, armored bed. This sediment‐starved bed was subjected to two types of sediment supply increases: a return to the initial constant supply, and the introduction of a well‐sorted sediment pulse (analogous to gravel augmentation). Riffles and pools formed in wide and narrow areas, respectively, and the location of and relief between riffles and pools remained the same throughout all experimental runs, regardless of the sediment supply. The primary channel response to changes in supply was adjustment of the overall slope. The sediment pulse evolved primarily through dispersion rather than translation, which contrasts with prior gravel augmentation experiments conducted in constant‐width channels and suggests that width variation and resulting riffle‐pool topography enhances pulse dispersion. Our results indicate that width variation is a primary control on the location and relief of riffles and pools in straight channels, and sediment supply changes are unlikely to affect riffle‐pool morphology when bank geometry is fixed and water discharge is steady.</jats:p>",

In addition to expertise‐based exchanges between interest groups and policy‐makers, can we identify the prevalence of information supply that aims to put pressure on EU policy‐makers? And under what conditions are different modes of information supply likely to occur? My analysis relies on interviews with 143 lobbyists who were active on a set of 78 legislative proposals submitted by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. The results demonstrate that expertise‐based exchanges are dominant in interactions with civil servants, while political information is predominantly communicated to political officials and often the key substance in outside lobbying tactics.</jats:p>",

To remove the effect of resources, López‐Urrutia and Morán analyzed data subsets with narrow ranges of variation in Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and found that temperature is correlated with Chl <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> partitioning among size classes, from which they concluded that temperature is an important variable to explain the variability of phytoplankton size structure. Our analysis, however, shows that resource supply varies widely also within these subsets and, importantly, that it is inversely correlated with temperature. Therefore, the relationship between temperature and size structure reflects instead the effect of resources. When groups of samples with similar resource supply conditions are considered, no correlation between temperature and phytoplankton size structure is observed, which invalidates the conclusion of López‐Urrutia and Morán. Even within restricted ranges of variation for phytoplankton biomass and production, changes in resource supply alone are sufficient to explain the variability of phytoplankton size structure in the sea.</jats:p>",

Customers often respond by seeking larger safety stocks (<jats:italic>hoarding</jats:italic>) and by ordering more than they need to meet demand (<jats:italic>phantom ordering</jats:italic>). Such actions cause still longer delivery times, creating positive feedbacks that intensify scarcity and destabilize supply chains. Hoarding and phantom ordering can be rational when customers compete for limited supply in the presence of uncertainty or capacity constraints. But they may also be behavioral and emotional responses to scarcity. To address this question we extend <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib0125\">Croson et al.’s (2014)</jats:ext-link> experimental study with the Beer Distribution Game. Hoarding and phantom ordering are never rational in the experiment because there is no horizontal competition, randomness, or capacity constraint; further, customer demand is constant and participants have common knowledge of that fact. Nevertheless 22% of participants place orders more than 25 times greater than the known, constant demand. We generalize the ordering heuristic used in prior research to include the possibility of endogenous hoarding and phantom ordering. Estimation results strongly support the hypothesis, with hoarding and phantom ordering particularly strong for the outliers who placed extremely large orders. We discuss psychiatric and neuroanatomical evidence showing that environmental stressors can trigger the impulse to hoard, overwhelming rational decision‐making. We speculate that stressors such as large orders, backlogs or late deliveries trigger hoarding and phantom ordering for some participants even though these behaviors are irrational. We discuss implications for supply chain design and behavioral operations research.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Although synergies between different policy instruments exist, e.g. reducing acidification and climate change by reducing energy consumption, there are also measures whose effects counter each other. Such counter effects arise not only within different environmental policy instruments but also with energy policy instruments. This paper surveys the overlaps in the policy instruments that target the European Union electricity system and characterizes their interactions. A framework for further assessment and analysis of overlaps and co‐effects between policy instruments is presented. The development of policies and their implementation using specific instruments may then be better aligned. A brief discussion on how trade‐offs can be structured is made, as well as some notes on issues to be considered towards policy integration.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are known for having high power generating efficiency among various types of fuel cells and being able to utilize various fuels such as fossil fuels. In the case of applying SOFC to vehicles, improvement of vehicle efficiency can be expected, using fossil fuels. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>However, in the case of using fossil fuels for fuel cells, fuels must be reformed on board using H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and so on. Therefore, in order to utilize SOFCs to vehicles, methods of supplying these gasses on board need to be considered. To solve this problem, one of the promising methods is the anode off-gas recycle (AGR). The AGR is a technology in which SOFC exhaust gas, which contains residual fuels, is partially mixed with supplied fuels into the system prior to entering a fuel reformer, and recirculates these gasses in the system. By introducing AGR to SOFC system, i.e., by utilizing H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>included in the SOFC exhaust,, fuel utilization of the system can be improved and the steam reforming of fuel become possible without mounting water tanks on vehicles. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In addition, in the case of utilizing SOFC to vehicles, complicated responses to precipitous load variations must be considered, unlike stationary systems operated under moderate load variations. For example, in the case of increasing fuel supply in order to increase output power from the system, it could be possible that the output power is temporarily lowered because of decrease of temperature of the SOFC and reformer due to increase of heat requirement for fuel reforming. This behavior is due to transient variation of heat balance in the reformer. Therefore, for the analysis of transient response of SOFC systems, the response of reformer is very important and needs to be paid attention. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Especially, further complicated behavior of reformers is expected in SOFC systems with AGR (AGR SOFC systems) because of off-gas recycle. For instance, in the case of increasing fuel supply to the system in order to increase the output power from the SOFC, possible delay of fuel reforming in the reformer may cause the decrease in the ratio of increase of recycled gas to that of fuel supply. In such a case, the amount of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>in the recycled gas decreases compared to the fuel supply, and the carbon deposition occurs, depending on the ratio of increase of fuel supply. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Hence, in this research, the transient behavior of the fuel reformer in AGR SOFC systems under various fuel supply rate is discussed by numerical simulation. Specifically, the effect of the change ratio of fuel supply and the delay of fuel reforming in the fuel reformer on system response is analyzed, by modeling composition of input gas to the fuel reformer. As a result of numerical simulation, the operating conditions in which the carbon deposition occurs are clarified. In addition, because ratio of increase of fuel supply needs to be limited in order to prevent carbon deposition, mitigation methods for this limitation are also discussed.</jats:p>",

A strong positive trend in nitrate flux from 1980 to 2010 was driven almost entirely by enhanced equatorward winds, negating a weak negative trend associated with increased surface heat flux. Increased upwelling and nitrate flux are consistent with cooler surface temperatures and higher phytoplankton concentrations observed over the same period. Changes in remote ocean forcing, resulting primarily from basin‐scale climate variability (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation), drive considerable interannual fluctuations and may dominate the ecosystem response on interannual to decadal time scales. However, comparison with previously published findings suggests that local wind intensification persists through changing basin‐scale climate regimes. Understanding the different time scales of variability in forcing mechanisms, and their interactions with each other, is necessary to distinguish transient ecosystem impacts from secular trends.</jats:p>",

In the O3 + GAC process, NOM-related parameters showed an average of 52% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal from 2 mg/L DOC influent, 99.3% haloacetic acids (HAAs) removal from 0.097 mg/L HAAs influent, and 100% removal from 0.05 mg/L bromide influent. Taste and odor removal rates were 94–100% for geosmin and 87–100% for 2-MIB. The O3 + H2O2 + GAC process removed an average of 55% DOC, 99.7% HAAs, 100% bromate, 94–100% geosmin, and 93–100% 2-MIB. The GAC process removed 46% DOC, 98.3% HAAs, 100% bromate, 83–100% geosmin, and 81–100% 2-MIB.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers the management of safety stock in a coordinated single‐vendor single‐buyer supply chain under continuous review and Gaussian lead‐time demand. The lead time is supposed controllable, and shortages are not allowed. We follow the present value criterion by considering both inflation and time value of money. Our aim is to present a novel approach to optimizing the safety stock in such system. Under the conditions considered, the safety stock is typically determined according to the value assigned to the safety factor, which is thus treated as a parameter of the model, and not as a decision variable. In this paper, we take a different perspective by putting the order quantity and the safety factor in functional dependence through the adoption of a specific parameter. More precisely, we express the service level as a function of the number of admissible stockouts per time unit and the order quantity. This allows optimizing the safety stock taking into account the constraint on the number of admissible stockouts per time unit. We present both exact and approximated minimization algorithms. Numerical examples are finally shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the approximation algorithm, and to investigate the sensitivity of the model with respect to variations in some fundamental parameters.

Collectively, these expectations and needs form a multi‐faceted view of stakeholder accountability, namely the extent to which a firm justifies behaviors and actions across its extended supply chain to stakeholders. To date, sustainable supply chain management research has largely focused on monitoring as a self‐managed set of narrowly defined evaluative activities employed by firms to provide stakeholder accountability. Nevertheless, evidence is emerging that firms have developed a wide variety of monitoring systems in order to align with stakeholders’ expectations and leverage accountability to stakeholders. Drawing from the accounting literature, we synthesize a model that proposes how firms might address accountability for sustainability issues in their supply chain. At its core, the construct of sustainable evaluation and verification (SEV) captures three interrelated dimensions: inclusivity, scope, and disclosure. These dimensions characterize how supply chain processes might identify key measures, collect and process data, and finally, verify materiality, reliability and accuracy of any data and resulting information. As a result, the concept of monitoring is significantly extended, while also considering how different stakeholders can play diverse, active roles as metrics are established, audits are conducted, and information is validated. Also, several antecedents of SEV systems are explored. Finally, the means by which an SEV system can create a competitive advantage are investigated.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, how these stressors eventually alter cardiac function during T1DM is not fully understood. In the present study, we hypothesized that impaired mitochondrial energy supply and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission is centrally involved in T1DM cardiac dysfunction due to metabolic/redox stress and aimed to determine the mitochondrial sites implicated in these alterations. To this end, we used isolated myocytes and mitochondria from Sham and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM guinea pigs (GPs), untreated or treated with insulin. Relative to controls, T1DM myocytes exhibited higher oxidative stress when challenged with high glucose (HG) combined with β-adrenergic stimulation [via isoprenaline (isoproterenol) (ISO)], leading to contraction/relaxation deficits. T1DM mitochondria had decreased respiration with complex II and IV substrates and markedly lower ADP phosphorylation rates and higher H2O2 emission when challenged with oxidants to mimic the more oxidized redox milieu present in HG + ISO-treated cardiomyocytes. Since in T1DM hearts insulin-sensitivity is preserved and a glucose-to-fatty acid (FA) shift occurs, we next tested whether insulin therapy or acute palmitate (Palm) infusion prevents HG + ISO-induced cardiac dysfunction. We found that insulin rescued proper cardiac redox balance, but not mitochondrial respiration or contractile performance. Conversely, Palm restored redox balance and preserved myocyte function. Thus, stressors such as peaks of HG and adrenergic hyperactivity impair mitochondrial respiration, hampering energy supply while exacerbating ROS emission. Our study suggests that an ideal therapeutic measure to treat metabolically/redox-challenged T1DM hearts should concomitantly correct energetic and redox abnormalities to fully maintain cardiac function.</jats:p>",

While this approach has some history in other disciplines, it is still relatively new among supply chain management researchers. To help supply chain management scholars assess the appropriateness of this type of data collection method, this forward thinking article provides invaluable guidance as derived from the authors' recent experiences with the approach. As such, we share our observations and lessons learned. The conclusion is that the use of survey research firms for empirical data collection can be a viable, alternative approach to self‐administered surveys.

The levels of added P that resulted in critical P concentrations in the soils enabling maximum shoot biomass production were 50 mg/kg P in the Rough soil and 100 mg/kg P in the Barnfield soil, and these additions influenced root morphological changes.

In an earlier study using soil substrate in a pot experiment, we reported significant positive effects of N supply on biomass WUE of tobacco. However, there was a debate that the latter may be due to indirect effects of N supply (hidden drought), most likely because plants supplied with adequate N generally have greater biomass and hence faster depletion of soil water in the root zone. In pot and in field situation, therefore, it is difficult to relate any variation in leaf or biomass WUE to the direct effect of N supply. In this context, the aim of the current study was to re‐examine to what extent N fertilization directly affects biomass WUE and related parameters under non‐limiting water supply in hydroponics. About 2 weeks after the transfer of tobacco seedlings into nutrient solution containing 2 mM N, plants were treated with high‐N or low‐N in the form of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. A marked decrease in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation with low‐N supply compared to high‐N supply was measured already 5 d after onset of treatments (DAO). In contrast, three different experiments clearly showed that stomatal conductance (g<jats:sub>s</jats:sub>) remained almost constant until 5 DAO resulting in significantly lower leaf WUE under low‐N compared to high‐N. Leaf WUE decreased gradually (up to 42% lower leaf WUE) at later stages. Surprisingly, biomass WUE and whole‐plant δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C values were not affected by N supply at any harvest date, which is in contrast to our earlier report where we observed clearly positive effects of N supply on biomass WUE of the same tobacco variety in a pot experiment with soil substrate. Night‐time respiration and transpiration rates (measured by gas exchange and thermal imaging) were significantly higher with high‐N supply than with low‐N supply. The data show that 48.6% and 9.8% of the beneficiary effect of N on daytime leaf WUE were lost when nocturnal stomatal conductance and night‐time respiration of the same leaves were taken into consideration. Thus, we conclude that earlier reports showing positive effects of N supply on biomass WUE and δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C values in soil or field experiments may be due to indirect effect of N supply (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, hidden/mild drought).</jats:p>",

Participants: More than 300 participants representing more than 60 federal, state, local, and private sector agencies and organizations.Results: The exercises showed that agencies could use RRECAP to identify and prioritize their advance preparation to mitigate such attacks with minimal expense. RRECAP also demonstrated the relative utility and limitations of the ability of medical resources to treat patients if responders do not recognize and mitigate the attack rapidly, and the exercise results showed that proper advance preparation would reduce these deficiencies.Conclusions: Using computer simulation prediction of the medical outcomes of food supply attacks to identify optimal remediation activities and quantify the benefits of various measures provides a significant tool to agencies in both the public and private sector as they seek to prepare for such an attack.</jats:p>"

However, most patients do not receive evidence‐based treatments partly because of high treatment delivery costs and lack of specialized therapists. By integrating specialized e‐health tools into BPD‐specific treatments, treatment intensity can be increased, frequency of face‐to‐face sessions and burden for psychotherapists can be reduced, and implementation of new skills and experiences in the everyday life of these patients can be promoted. This bears great potential to increase the availability of evidenced‐based psychotherapy for BPD patients and close the gap between demand and supply. In this article we present such an innovative e‐health tool, priovi, which has been developed for schema therapy. The concept and application of priovi are described and illustrated with a case example.</jats:p>",

Difficulty in renewing repeat medication (forgetting to order, or prescription delays) was the major reason for requests. The majority of medicines were ‘loaned’ in advance of a National Health Service (NHS) prescription.

According to the Resolution No357/05 of CONAMA, were used values and quality standards for raw water abstraction in Class 3 source, which is the condition of Rio Capivara. The following parameters were considered: potential hydrogen (pH), phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrite, Nitrate, thermos-tolerant coliforms and chromatographic to pesticide compounds. Regarding the quality of the water of the basin, the data used in this study proved the incidence of residues of pesticides and animal waste, but there were no events that motivate specific action, except when was used thecarbaryl insecticide. The results showed values close to the permitted by Resolution CONAMA No357/05 and, under these conditions, the raw water intake works within normal limits.

In their most basic form, stock‐flow systems consist of resources that accumulate and flows that change their level. Managing stock‐flow systems is an indispensable part of operations management, including supply chain, inventory, and capacity planning. Previous studies have shown that most people, even experts and well‐educated individuals, make persistent errors when inferring the behavior of accumulation (i.e., stock) over time. However, little is known about what individual characteristics make a decision maker better or worse at understanding stock‐flows. In this paper, we report the results of investigating the relationship between analytical‐intuitive thinking and global‐local processing on performance in a simple stock‐flow problem.</jats:p><jats:p>We find that individuals with an analytical thinking style, rather than an intuitive one, perform significantly better on a stock‐flow problem; whereas individuals with a global, rather than a local, thinking style do not necessarily perform better. However, even individuals who exhibit analytical thinking have a poor understanding of stock‐flow problems. Analytical thinking may be related to understanding stock and flows, but more work is needed to better understand what cognitive abilities are required to solve these problems.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Increases in drying–rewetting cycles led to reductions in soil <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/gcb12956-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:13541013:media:gcb12956:gcb12956-math-0001\" /> levels, potential net nitrification rate, and soil : atmosphere GHG exchange, and increases in <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/gcb12956-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:13541013:media:gcb12956:gcb12956-math-0002\" /> and total soil inorganic N levels. N‐treated soils were more resistant to changes in the frequency of drying–rewetting cycles, and this resistance was stronger for C‐ than for N‐related variables. Both the long‐term N addition and the drying–rewetting treatment altered the functionality of the soil microbial population and its functional diversity. Our results suggest that increasing the frequency of drying–rewetting cycles can affect the ability of soil to cycle C and N and soil : atmosphere <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content> exchange and that the response to this increase is modulated by soil N enrichment.</jats:p>",
