Ninety-two consecutive surgical resections of AVMs with an angiographically demonstrated MCA supply were performed between January 1989 and July 1996. Ten of these cases had a significant lenticulostriate arterial contribution. The cases were graded according to the Spetzler—Martin classification.</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">There were no deaths and 4.3% of cases developed new major neurological deficit by the 3-month follow-up examination. All cases had angiographically confirmed obliteration of the AVM. There were no complications in 16 patients with Spetzler—Martin Grade I AVMs, one case of complications in 40 patients with Grade II AVMs, eight cases of complications in 26 patients with Grade III AVMs, and seven cases of complications in 10 patients with Grade IV and V AVMs. The supply of blood from lenticulostriate branches was associated with complications in eight of the 10 cases. The effect of the presence of a lenticulostriate arterial supply was most apparent in cases of Grade III AVMs: complications were experienced in three of 20 patients whose AVMs were not supplied by the arteries and in five of six patients whose AVMs were fed by the lenticulostriate arteries. This difference is significant (p &lt; 0.0001).</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">The conclusions drawn from this study are that for Grade III AVMs, the presence of a lenticulostriate arterial supply can be considered a factor predictive of an increased risk of surgical complications.</jats:p>",

Within this environment, end users form the demand for the last company in the supply chain, but the demand for upstream companies is formed by the companies in the immediate downstream supply chain link. It has been shown that demand seasonality and forecast error can increase as we proceed up the supply chain. These demand distortions, called the “bullwhip” effect, create inefficiencies for upstream firms. This work seeks to identify the magnitude of the problem by establishing an empirical lower bound on the profitability impact of the bullwhip effect. Results indicate that the importance of the bullwhip effect to a firm differs greatly depending on the specific business environment. Given appropriate conditions, however, eliminating the bullwhip effect can increase product profitability by 10–30%.</jats:p>",

However, immigration's impact on wage inequality has been minor and the effects of women's participation is inconclusive. Second, in evaluating the likelihood that human capital investment will mitigate future inequality, evidence suggests that rising returns to education have increased the proportion of young people attending college, limiting the growth of inequality among high-wage workers. </jats:p>",

In generic terms, sustainable systems are those which can be adapted to changing circumstances. Given the essential nature of utilities there is a clear need to plan and manage their technologies in a sustainable manner. This paper offers an initial theoretical structure for designing and managing adaptive technological infrastructures for utilities in generic terms and suggests how such a framework may apply to water supply systems. In particular, the development of new water recycling technologies and the emergence of ‘complex system’ modelling techniques provide opportunities for the design of water supply systems which are adaptive to changes in the urban social and physical environment in which they are embedded.</jats:p>",

In general, the blood supply to the tibial nerve and its branches came directly from corresponding arteries. Each nutrient artery to the tibial nerve bifurcated on the surface of the lateral plantar nerve fasciculus to create longitudinal vessels that made anastomoses with bifurcating nutrient vessels proximally and distally. This primary longitudinal system supplied intersubfascicular vessels to the medial plantar fasciculus. The last nutrient artery from the posterior tibial artery usually supplied the terminal branching point of the tibial nerve midway through the tarsal tunnel. The lateral and medial plantar nerves received most of the nutrient vessels from their corresponding arteries in shorter intervals. In 65% of cases, the lateral plantar nerve received a nutrient vessel from the medial plantar artery. Potential anatomical areas of vascular compromise in the etiology or surgical release of tarsal tunnel syndrome are discussed. </jats:p>",

The static, aggregate welfare effects of supply controls are well known, but the farm‐level, dynamic effects on dairy investment are not. A theoretical cost‐of‐adjustment model is used to show that supply management reduces the rate of quasi‐fixed input adjustment at the farm level. In fact, when a quasi‐fixed input is complementary to quota licenses, investment or disinvestment can be impaired to such an extent that the input moves away from the long‐run equilibrium. As a result, overinvestment in this input can significantly reduce productivity growth.</jats:p>",

Comparative statics results are consistent with several well‐established trends in the food processing sector. In particular, the analysis demonstrates that increasing concentration in the food processing sector is consistent with decreasing market power. Indeed, we find that when the farm supply curve shifts outward, an increase in concentration can only occur when there is a decrease in market power.</jats:p>",

The conditions for selectivity to occur were investigated, together with the influence of the As4 overpressure on selectivity and on the morphology of the grown layer. It was found that an interruption time of 4 min was too short to allow for complete selective growth to take place, but it was sufficient to allow the formation of a depleted zone of 200–300 nm at the borders of the dielectric mask. Lateral overgrowth of the epitaxial layer was found possible in these partially selective conditions after 60 min of GaAs deposition in the PSE mode. The morphology of the ridges grown at different As4 overpressures was studied. At higher As4 pressures, the epitaxial layer grew without contact with the mask walls and developed independent {210} lateral sidewalls. The shrinkage rate of the top (111) B plane was remarkably fast at the highest As4 overpressure used. Selectivity was, however, more difficult to achieve in these conditions and a high As4 pressure was shown to be able to suppress reevaporation of the polycrystalline deposits on the mask.</jats:p>",

The numerical model involves the finite-volume approach of solving governing equations for mass and momentum, assuming that the buoyancy effects are negligibly small in comparison to the inertial effects. The k-ε two-equation model of turbulence is used to predict the turbulence transport of flow properties. Two typical layouts that provide six individual workstations are studied. The results show that for displacement ventilation and wall jet diffusers, with the exhaust opening placed on the wall opposite to the supply opening, arranging chambers in the central area of the office may be better. When the exhaust opening is placed on the same wall as the supply diffuser, arranging chambers near side walls may be more favourable. The ceiling-mounted four-way diffuser is found to be more suitable for a partitioned office than the wall jet and displacement dif fusers. </jats:p>",
