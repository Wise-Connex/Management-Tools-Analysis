The econometric evidence tor Jamaica shows that this presumption is not valid. The paper begins by reviewing the growth experience of the Jamaican economy. It then analyzes the trends in agricultural production. The remainder of the paper provides the econometric estimates of broad agricultural output to price. The empirical evidence shows that aggregate agricultural output is responsive to price, but it will take lime for agricultural production to materialize. A summary of the published estimates of the supply response for individual crops is also presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dynamic balance between magma supply and vent output at Kilauea volcano is used to estimate both the volume of magma stored within Kilauea volcano and its magma supply rate. Throughout most of 1991 a linear decline in volume flux from the Kupaianaha vent on Kilauea's east rift zone was associated with a parabolic variation in the elevation of Kilauea's summit as vent output initially exceeded then lagged behind the magma supply to the volcano. The correspondence between summit elevation and tilt established with over 30 years of data provided daily estimates of summit elevation in terms of summit tilt. The minimum in the parabolic variation in summit tilt and elevation (or zero elevation change) occurs when the magma supply to the reservoir from below the volcano equals the magma output from the reservoir to the surface, so that the magma supply rate is given by vent flux on that day. The measurements of vent flux and tilt establish that the magma supply rate to Kilauea volcano on June 19, 1991, was 217,000±10,000 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/d (or 0.079±0.004 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr). This is close to the average eruptive rate of 0.08 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/yr between 1958 and 1984. In addition, the predictable response of summit elevation and tilt to each east rift zone eruption near Puu Oo since 1983 shows that summit deformation is also a measure of magma reservoir pressure. Given this, the correlation between the elevation of the Puu Oo lava lake (4 km uprift of Kupaianaha and 18 km from the summit) and summit tilt provides an estimate for magma pressure changes corresponding to summit tilt changes. The ratio of the change in volume to the change in reservoir pressure (<jats:italic>dV</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>dP</jats:italic>) during vent activity may be determined by dividing the ratio of volume erupted to change in summit tilt (<jats:italic>dV</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>d</jats:italic><jats:sub>tilt</jats:sub>) by the ratio of pressure change to change in summit tilt (<jats:italic>dP</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>d</jats:italic><jats:sub>tilt</jats:sub>). This measure of <jats:italic>dV</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>dP</jats:italic>, when combined with laboratory measurements of the bulk modulus of tholeitic melt, provides an estimate of 240±50 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> for the volume of Kilauea's magma reservoir. This estimate is much larger than traditional estimates but consistent with seismic tomographic imaging and geophysical modeling of Kilauea's magma system.</jats:p>",

This is where guest editors from the Editorial Advisory Panel for Building Services Engineering Research and Technology address current developments in building services engineering practice and research. The articles are very short, on one theme of current interest, and do not go through the longer refereeing process for conventional research papers. This is to encourage consultants and contractors to discuss their latest developments in a non-commercial manner. Academics will also be asked to outline current research areas in universities and colleges. Without the constraint of full refereeing there is scope in the articles to provoke interest and to raise issues for discussion. Consequently the Editor of BSER&amp;T is happy to receive and publish letters furthering the discussion of 'Blue Pages' articles. If you have a suggestion for an article or topic you would like to see included in the 'Blue Pages' please inform the Editor, Barry Copping. Comments on the 'Blue Pages' are also welcome. 'Blue Pages' will only succeed if readers of the journal wish the feature to succeed and contribute to its success. </jats:p>",

Off‐farm employment of farmers and their spouses is also found to be significantly influenced by farm experience, off‐farm work experience, farm size, leverage, efficiency, and farm‐specific education. In addition, farm operators and spouses who receive significant income support through government farm programs are less likely to work off the farm.

The evidence indicates that such schemes typically produce variable but limited VFM, reflecting deficiencies both in the quality of the access experiences provided and in the information flow to the public.

The NADPH/NADP ratio increased from 0.9 to 2.0 when 10 mM glucose-6-phosphate was supplied to intact plastids. The subsequent addition of 1 mM NaNO2 caused a rapid decline in this ratio to 1.5. In vitro, a ratio of 1.5 inactivated barley root plastid G6PDH by approximately 50%, suggesting that G6PDH could remain active during NO2- assimilation even at the high NADPH/NADP ratios that would favor a reduction of ferredoxin, the electron donor of NO2- reductase. Root plastid G6PDH was sensitive to reductive inhibition by dithiothreitol (DTT), but even at 50 mM DTT the enzyme remained more than 35% active. In root plastids from barley starved of N for 3 d, G6PDH had a substantially reduced specific activity, had a lower Km for NADP, and was less inhibited by DTT than the enzyme from N-sufficient root plastids, indicating that there was some effect of N starvation on the G6PDH activity in barley root plastids.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The consequences of iron deficiency and iron re‐supply were evaluated during the early stages of growth and development of young maize plantlets grown hydroponically in the absence of iron. Various parameters, such as fresh and dry weights, and the concentration of chlorophylls, iron, copper, manganese, calcium, magnesium and potassium in leaves, were measured at various times during the first 15 d of culture. Ten‐day‐old maize plantlets grown without iron displayed severe alterations, with a 50% decrease in iron and chlorophyll concentrations in leaves, and serious impairments in mitochondria and chloroplast ultrastructure. In contrast, neither leaf nor root growth, nor other mineral concentrations other than iron were significantly affected at this stage of development. In an attempt to characterize proteins potentially involved in iron nutrition or the adaptative response to iron starvation, comparative 2D‐gel electrophoretic analysis of polypeptides was carried out on soluble and membrane fractions prepared from leaves and roots of iron‐deficient and iron‐sufficient 10‐d‐old maize plantlets. Two polypeptides (11 and 17 kDa, pI of about 6.8) from the microsomal fraction of leaves were found to be repressed under iron‐deficient conditions. Some other polypeptides were found to he induced in microsomal fractions either from roots or leaves. Significant variations in the concentration of most of these polypeptides were observed from one experiment to another. It can be concluded from this study that, at this early stage of maize vegetative growth and development, molecular variations induced by iron deficiency do not affect major house‐keeping proteins, but probably affect very specific events depending on low abundance proteins.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> For the application of the latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) to circulatory assist, the muscle is stimulated with co‐ or counterpulsation during the cardiac cycle. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the blood supply to the LDM and its muscular performance during each respective stimulation. The origin of the LDM was connected to a tension gauge, a potentiometer, and 1 kg of weight in series. The LDM was stimulated at a ratio of 1:1 of heart to muscle contraction for 10 min. Copulsatile stimulation made thoracodorsal arterial flow (TDF) pre dominant during cardiac diastole. In counterpulsatile stimulation, TDF occurred predominantly during cardiac systole. Between the 2 patterns of stimulation, no significant differences were observed in the mean TDF rate during 1 cardiac cycle. The maximal force, maximal contrac tion length, and power of the LDM also did not differ significantly. These results suggest that despite the difference of the TDF profile, LDM performance may be com parable between co‐ and counterpulsatile stimulation for the application of the LDM to circulatory assist.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The Sole Source Aquifer Program has helped prevent contamination of many community drinking water supplies. If an aquifer supplies the sole or principal source of a community's drinking water, a local ground water user may petition the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe Drinking Water Act for its designation and protection as a “sole source aquifer.” Since 1974, residents and officials of 65 communities and multi‐community areas have petitioned and received assistance from the EPA to prevent contamination of their local ground water source of drinking water. This designation means that EPA may review federal financially assisted projects to determine if they would contaminate the aquifer and cause a public health hazard. If they could cause contamination, EPA can request that the project be modified or stopped. The significance of this program in terms of population served and funds affected has been substantial, indicating the Sole Source Aquifer Program has been an important local tool for protecting ground water used as a source of drinking water. Information is given on three different examples of sole source aquifer designations protected under this program: the New Jersey Coastal Plain Aquifer System, the Great Miami River Buried Valley Aquifer System (Ohio), and the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer (Idaho), serving populations of 543,000, 921,000, and 275,000, respectively. In all three examples, preventing ground water contamination through the Sole Source Aquifer Program has protected the community drinking water supply.</jats:p>",
