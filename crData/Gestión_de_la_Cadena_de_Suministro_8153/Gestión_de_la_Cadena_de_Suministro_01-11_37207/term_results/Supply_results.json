We argue that this public good character of a large organ pool makes it economically and ethically justifiable to design a market mechanism that boosts the number of donors. Most importantly, such a mechanism has the potential to substantially alleviate the troubling equity and efficiency problems on the demand side while, at the same time, being entirely independent of the allocation algorithm used for the distribution of organs.</jats:p>",

The focus was to develop a synchronized system from source to consumption with continuous flow of information and materials for one of Noramco’s main product lines. System‐wide changes were accomplished using a cross‐functional team with the goal of reducing waste and investment in inventory. Traditional measures of manufacturing efficiency and utilization were compared with proposed measurements of through‐put (T), investment in inventory (I), and operating expense (OE). Although traditional measures showed actual decline, proposed measures showed improvement and increased profitability of 200 per cent for this product line. These new performance measures reflected a change from local to global thinking. Improved capacity management in the system was achieved by sharing information between suppliers and customers.</jats:p>",

The needs include minerals: metals, fuels, industrial and construction materials. There will continue to be considerable demand for virgin mineral resources, even if levels of recycling and efficiency of use are optimal, and rates of population growth and globalisation decrease significantly. This article aims to stimulate debate on strategic issues for minerals supply. While the world has considerable stocks of mineral resources overall, international considerations of the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development are beginning to result in limitations on where mining will be conducted and what types of deposits will be mined. Current and emerging trends favour large mines in parts of the world where mining can be conducted within acceptable limits of environmental and social impact. Finding new deposits that meet such criteria will be all the more challenging given a disturbing global decline in the rate of discovery of major economic resources over the last decade, and the decreasing land area available for exploration and mining.</jats:p><jats:p>To attract responsible exploration and mining, governments of mining nations will need to provide: regional‐scale geo‐scientific datasets as required to attract and guide future generations of exploration; resource access through multiple and sequential land use regimes, and frameworks for dealing with indigenous peoples' issues; and arrangements for consideration of mining proposals and regulation of mines that ensure responsible management of environmental and social issues.</jats:p><jats:p>The minerals industry will need to continue to pursue advances in technologies for exploration, mining, processing, waste management and rehabilitation, and in public reporting of environmental and social performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The topic of this research focuses simultaneously on the perceived trust of companies towards suppliers and customers in supply chains. Initially, it is assumed that lean, responsive, and agile supply chains require satisfactory or high levels of perceived trust of companies towards suppliers and customers. Otherwise, it is assumed that less leanness, less responsiveness, and less agility may dominate the activities in supply chains. Trust often appears to be a requisite or a phenomenon that smoothes the well‐functioning of all activities in supply chains. The outcome of this study is generated and based on the empirical findings from a survey in the Swedish automotive industry. The automotive industry is characterised by its lean, responsive, and agile supply chains due to a keen competitive marketplace. Finds that there are high levels of companies’ perceived trust towards suppliers and customers in the Swedish automotive industry. Concludes in part that the perceived trust towards the suppliers and the perceived trust towards the customers differ from each other. There is also in part an association between the companies’ perceived trust towards both suppliers and customers in the industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many firms have experienced significant benefits from engaging in supplier alliances. However, alliance relationships do not evolve in isolation. Support factors for supplier alliances include purchasing’s accountability for their actions, the use of information technology, the perceived importance of the purchasing and supply management (PSM) function, and the degree of participation in strategic purchasing activities. In addition, PSM engages in cost and price‐related activities associated with supplier alliances, including total cost of ownership, understanding specific supplier costs, target costing, and market monitoring. Empirical results from a survey indicate that significant relationships exist between support factors, cost and price activities, and supplier alliance involvement by the PSM function. The exploratory findings suggest that support factors must be in place and continually improved to facilitate purchasing’s involvement in alliances. PSM involvement in cost and price activities is also strongly related to supplier alliance participation. For purchasing firms to obtain long‐term benefits from alliances with suppliers, purchasing professionals must continually provide valuable input into these relationships through their corporate influence, use of information technology, and participation in various proactive purchasing activities.</jats:p>",

It is observed that high quality‐tendency systems tend to perform better than low quality‐tendency systems on cost savings. High quality‐tendency organizations can be differentiated from medium quality‐tendency organizations in areas such as productivity, sales growth, and earning growth. Medium quality‐tendency systems seem to be differentiated from low quality‐tendency systems on indicators like employee satisfaction, productivity, and sales growth. Our results suggest that organizational performance could be enhanced through improved supply chain quality management.</jats:p>",

Recently, instrumental variables have been widely used to reduce bias from omitted variables in estimates of causal relationships. Intuitively, instrumental variables methods use only a portion of the variability in key variables to estimate the relationships of interest; if the instruments are valid, that portion is unrelated to the omitted variables. We discuss the mechanics of instrumental variables and the qualities that make for a good instrument, devoting particular attention to instruments derived from “natural experiments.”</jats:p>",

The resultant maps and protection zones cover more than 2250 public water supplies, tapping over 160 aquifers, and took almost five years to prepare. An opportunity for the UK water industry to assess their usefulness arose in 1999 when new Government regulations required water companies to conduct risk assessments for the troublesome parasite <jats:italic>Cryptosporidium</jats:italic>, and this paper reviews some results of that exercise. In the light of widespread doubts about the effectiveness of sporadic monitoring alone, in protecting the health of users of private ground‐water supplies, a simple and pragmatic pollution hazard assessment procedure is suggested, employing combined use of sanitary surveys with an aquifer vulnerability flowchart.</jats:p>",

Nutrient supply was enhanced by a granulose fertilizer containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and grazer density was manipulated by exclusion cages. Algal biomass was increased by nutrient enrichment and reduced by grazer presence, but effects were highly variable between sites and seasons. Generally, grazers had stronger effects on algal biomass than nutrient enrichment, but there was no overriding effect of either grazing or nutrients. This indicated a simultaneous top‐down and bottom‐up control of algal biomass. Taxonomic composition of the periphyton was more affected by grazer presence than by nutrients. Internal nutrient ratios of the algae indicated N limitation at two of the sites. At all sites, the content of N and P in the periphytic assemblage was enhanced by the experimental nutrient enrichment, resulting in decreased C:N and C: P ratios. The presence of herbivores also increased periphytic nutrient content (decreased N: P and C: P ratios) in some experiments, suggesting an increase in algal P due to excretion. The effect strength of grazers and nutrients on periphyton was affected by different abiotic characteristics such as light availability, nutrient concentrations, and temperature. However, single environmental characteristics were not sufficient to explain the relative importance of grazing and nutrients.</jats:p>",
