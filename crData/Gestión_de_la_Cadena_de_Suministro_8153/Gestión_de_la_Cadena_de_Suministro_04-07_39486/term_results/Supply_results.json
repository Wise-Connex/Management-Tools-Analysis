A plea is made for the study of negotiation in the supply chain management field, and it concludes that the current narrative, describing a journey from uninformed adversarial buyer‐supplier attitudes towards enlightened co‐operative relations in chains, may be more fictional than factual.</jats:p>",

This paper argues that knowledge redundancy is not about “redundancy” that might suggest a waste or duplication of knowledge. In contrast, knowledge redundancy between adjacent members of the supply chain is critical to superior supply chain performance. The paper examines the tacit and explicit nature of knowledge and knowledge redundancy in supply chains. It develops a conceptual model and a series of propositions that argue that managing knowledge redundancy in the context of supplier‐related factors, firm‐related factors, and interface‐related factors can bring positive supply chain performance outcomes.</jats:p>",

This research focuses on supply chain coordination and its three determinants: namely, responsibility interdependence, uncertainty, and interfunctional conflict. Research propositions were developed to conceptualise how supply chain coordination is driven by its determinants. The propositions were tested by a case study in a fashion firm to examine the differences between the theory and the practice of coordination. Findings showed that the firm carried out only piecemeal coordination in defining and fulfilling customer needs.</jats:p>",

At the lowest active Fe level, leaf absorptance and maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm) were slightly decreased, and non-photochemical quenching was significantly greater. PSII quantum efficiency decreased curvilinearly as active Fe content decreased. On a Chl basis, the xanthophyll cycle pool size, lutein, and beta-carotene increased curvilinearly as active Fe decreased, and neoxanthin increased at the lowest Fe level. Activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase followed a similar trend and increased under Fe deficiency, when expressed on a Chl basis. Antioxidant metabolites also increased in response to Fe limitation. On a Chl basis, ascorbate (AsA), dehydroascorbate (DAsA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) content was greater at the lowest active Fe levels. We did not find a difference in the ratio of AsA to DAsA or GSH to GSSG. In conclusion, both photoprotective mechanisms, xanthophyll cyle-dependent thermal dissipation and the ascorbate-glutatione antioxidant system, are enhanced in response to iron deficiency to cope with excess absorbed light.</jats:p>",

To test this hypothesis a product supply characterization (PSC) model was developed and validated on the European operations of a US$15 billion case study company. The application of the PSC model to the case study company reveals significant value in matching specific product clusters with appropriate supply chain designs and that any mismatch represents supply chain under performance.</jats:p>",

The developed knowledge associated with these changes will not be easily copied by competitors, and as such, provides the basis for a sustainable competitive advantage for those firms that are able to lead the way with the enabling technology of e-commerce in supply chains. However, leadership and change management are identified as key issues requiring further investigation.</p>",

Globalisation of the fashion industry has allowed consumers to gain easier access to the in‐vogue style at an increasingly inexpensive price. This paper explores the future direction of fashion in the industrialised economies through the experience of the Japanese fashion industry from a small manufacturers’ perspective. Empirical findings from a questionnaire survey reveal the fundamental gaps that exist between the theory and the practice, in light of the original premise that quick response (QR) could be the vehicle for a survival strategy of domestic apparel manufacturing in the industrial economies.</jats:p>",

However, the difficulty to obtain timely and accurate demand data from the point‐of‐sales (POS) calls for alternative solutions to be developed. This paper presents a solution that is based on readily available sell‐through data from channel partners, such as distributors, to monitor what happens on the market in product introduction situations. The difficulty with using demand information from distributors rather than the POS is the bullwhip effect that distorts demand as you move upstream in the supply chain. The paper presents how this problem can be overcome by using market mix views of product categories and simple smoothing techniques.</jats:p>",

In October, the trees were sprayed twice with either water or 3% urea, then harvested after natural leaf fall and stored at 2°C. Trees were destructively sampled during winter storage to determine their concentrations of amino acids, protein, and non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). Increasing N supply either via N fertigation during the growing season or with foliar urea applications in the fall increased the concentrations of both free and total amino acids, whereas decreased their C/N ratios. Moreover, as the N supply increased, the proportion of nitrogen stored as free amino acids also increased. However, protein was still the main form of N used for storage. The predominant amino acid in both the free and total amino-acid pools was arginine. Arginin N accounted for an increasing proportion of the total N in both the free and total amino acids as the N supply was increased. However, the proportion of arginine N was higher in the free amino acids than in the total amino acids. A negative relationship was found between total amino acid and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, suggesting that TNC is increasingly used for N assimilation as the supply of N increases. Urea applications decreased the concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose, but had little influence on concentrations of sorbitol and starch. We conclude that protein is the primary form of storage N, and that arginine is the predominant amino acid. Furthermore, the synthesis of amino acids and proteins comes at the expense of non-structural carbohydrates.</jats:p>",

One technique is the integrated supply chain. However, this process has not met with success for all companies, leading some managers to consider the appropriateness of an integrated supply chain. This dearth of success could be attributed to the lack of scholarship to guide managers in their efforts to formulate and then implement their integrated supply chain strategies. In an effort to fill this gap, our paper draws on resource dependency theory and the realities of ever-increasing information technology sophistication as enablers of successful supply chain integration, resulting in the creation of our model to guide managers throughout this process. Through a Web-based survey, 329 responses were collected and analyzed through a structural equation modeling technique using LISREL to confirm the relationships in the model.</p>",

A simple heuristic model was constructed, from which it was concluded that additional volumes of frozen blueberries require more storage facilities and it was also recommended that the location should be based on load‐distance analysis.

In recent years, through numerous press releases and anecdotal references, there have been an increased number of reported strategic alliances. However, there have been no systematic studies of the prevalence and impact of strategic alliances in specific industries and no way to obtain information on the costs and benefits of these formal relationships. This current research addresses these gaps. As part of a long‐term longitudinal research program covering diverse industries, two different industries, one in products (food and beverages) and the other in services (executive recruiting) were studied to determine the extent of penetration and effectiveness of strategic alliances. This paper presents examples of strategic alliances and the survey results describing penetration, types of alliances, business benefits, and expected costs.</jats:p>",

CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation and stomatal conductance increased curvilinearly with increasing active Fe, whereas intercellular CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations decreased linearly. Activities of key Calvin cycle enzymes, Rubisco, NADP-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoribulokinase, stromal fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and a key enzyme in sucrose synthesis, cytosolic FBPase, all increased linearly with increasing active Fe. No difference was found in the activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and sucrose phosphate synthase of leaves between the lowest and the highest treatments, whereas slightly lower activities were observed in the middle Fe treatments. Content of 3-phosphoglycerate increased curvilinearly with increased active Fe, whereas glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate did not change. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch, and total non-structural carbohydrates at both dusk and pre-dawn increased with increasing active Fe. Carbon export from starch breakdown during the night, calculated as the difference between dusk and predawn levels, increased as active Fe increased. In conclusion, Fe limitation reduces the activities of Rubisco and other photosynthetic enzymes, and hence CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation capacity. Fe-deficient grapevines have lower concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates in source leaves, and therefore, are source limited.</jats:p>",

All major crops are identified in the analysis and variations in agro‐climatic and farming systems are accounted for. Peasant farmers, at least in the more commercial Central and Southern zones, do respond positively and significantly to price incentives. Farmers in the Northern zone are least commercial and least responsive to prices, and in fact the model based on profit maximisation does not adequately capture their behaviour. In general, non‐price factors, especially rainfall and market access, are more important than prices in affecting poduction, and which factors are most important varies depending on the crop and region in question. We conclude with suggestions regarding which crops appear most suitable to each agro‐climatic region, and identify the most relevant policy interventions in each case.</jats:p>",

Half of the vines fertigated at each N concentration were sprayed with 3% foliar urea twice in late September while the rest served as controls. Four vines from each treatment combination were destructively sampled during dormancy to determine the levels and forms of N and carbohydrates. Nitrogen fertigation during the summer only slightly increased vine N concentration whereas foliar urea application in the fall significantly increased vine N concentration. In response to foliar urea application, concentrations of both free amino acid-N and protein-N increased, but the ratio of protein N to amino acid N decreased. Arginine was the most abundant amino acid in free amino acids and proteins, and its concentration was linearly correlated with vine N concentration. Concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) decreased slightly in response to N supply from fertigation. Foliar urea application in the fall significantly decreased TNC concentration at each N fertigation level. Starch, glucose and fructose decreased in response to foliar urea applications, but sucrose concentration remained unaffected. Approximately 60% of the carbon decrease in TNC caused by foliar urea application was recovered in proteins and free amino acids. We conclude that free amino acids account for a larger proportion of the N in vines sprayed with foliar urea, but proteins remain as the main form of N storage. In response to foliar urea application, part of the carbon from TNC is incorporated into proteins and free amino acids, leading to a decrease in the carbon stored in TNC and an increase in the carbon stored in proteins and free amino acids.</jats:p>",

These include the possible presence of an arbitrary number of kinks, the vanishing nature of the singular supply of momentum, and the critical nature of the tension in the string. When the linear momentum is supplied by a mass-spring-dashpot system, we are also able to establish an exact expression for the frequency of the resulting vibrations, prove that dissipation cannot be present, show that these vibrations only occur for discrete speeds of axial motion, and establish that Coulomb friction is absent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Changing regulations to lower disinfectant byproducts in drinking water is forcing utilities to switch disinfection from chlorine to monochloramine. It is generally unknown whether this will impact positively or negatively on the microbiological quality of drinking water. A utility in Florida, using water with relatively high organic carbon levels from deep wells in several wellfields, made the decision to change its disinfection regime from chlorine to chloramine in order to meet the new regulations. To assess the impacts of such a change on the microbiology of its water supplies, it undertook a number of studies before and after the change. In particular, the presence of the opportunistic pathogens Legionella and Mycobacterium, and also the composition of drinking-water biofilms, were examined. A preliminary synthesis and summary of these results are presented here. Legionella species were widely distributed in source waters and in the distribution system when chlorine was the disinfectant. In some samples they seemed to be among the dominant biofilm bacteria. Following the change to monochloramine, legionellae were not detected in the distribution system during several months of survey; however, they remained detectable at point of use, although with less species diversity. A variety of mycobacteria (21 types) were widely distributed in the distribution system when chlorine was the disinfectant, but these seemed to increase in dominance after chloramination was instituted. At point of use, only four species of mycobacteria were detected. Other changes occurring with chloramination included (a) an altered biofilm composition, (b) increased numbers of total coliforms and heterotrophs and (c) nitrification of water storage tanks. The results suggested that consideration should be given to the microbiological effects of changing disinfection regimes in drinking-water and distribution system biofilms.</jats:p>",

However, process arcs, which generate macroparticles and target damage, are not avoidable due especially to imperfections in vacuum system hardware and target materials. Arc handling is required for practical application of HPPMS. An experimental power supply capable of peak powers up to 3 MW, peak currents to 3000 A, at discharge voltages reaching 2 kV has been designed and built. It has voltage ring-up capability for pulse by pulse plasma ignition. This power supply technology enables the practical application of a whole range of sputtering processes, based on pulsing magnetrons operating at high peak powers. Power supply performance for typical pulses and for arc handling at peak currents into the kiloamp range is shown with temporal current and voltage characteristics of the discharge for typical pulses and for arcing operation.</jats:p>",

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) study reveals that step-flow-like growth morphology is achieved for the AlN film with the root-mean-square (rms) roughness as small as 0.336 nm. In contrast, the surface morphology of thick AlN film grown directly on sapphire substrate shows rough grainy feature with a large rms value of 28.9 nm. The mechanism leading to superior morphology by introducing IASA process is investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hot wet chemical etching and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. Evidence is presented that their morphological differences are attributed to strain reduction and polarity inversion. The present work provides insight into the AlN epitaxial growth and indicates that IASA is an effective method to realize atomically smooth AlN film. \n  </jats:p>",

Peak immigration of sockeye salmon fry into southern Lake Washington precedes the spring zooplankton bloom by 2–3 months. Zooplankton density, fish diet, and growth were sampled during winter and spring 2001, when a record 52.4 million fry entered the lake. Supplementary information on the distribution and dispersal of fry was collected in 2002 and 2003. We used bioenergetics modeling to estimate the temporal–spatial consumption by fry during early lake rearing. <jats:italic>Cyclops bicuspidatus</jats:italic> were dominant in the diet and zooplankton assemblage but declined from more than 30/L in late February and early March to fewer than 5/L during mid‐March and early April. Fry ate significantly larger <jats:italic>Cyclops</jats:italic> than the average size in the lake; approximately 83% of the food items in the stomachs were larger than 0.8 mm, which was the minimum food item size. Hydroacoustics and midwater trawling surveys during 2002 and 2003 suggested that fry dispersed quickly over the southern half of the lake and used depths of 0–30 m. Under the most realistic scenarios for fry dispersal, feeding, and survival, total consumption of all prey by sockeye salmon fry represented 5% of the average monthly biomass of <jats:italic>Cyclops</jats:italic> during March and early April, when their availability was lowest. Potential bottlenecks in the availability of <jats:italic>Cyclops</jats:italic> only developed in simulations when fry were restricted to feeding in 0–10‐m depths in the southernmost region of the lake. Despite the seemingly adequate food supply for sockeye salmon fry, other planktivores also consume significant fractions of the exploitable prey biomass, and the interannual availability of exploitable zooplankton varies considerably during winter and early spring. Either of these factors could impinge on the localized food supply for sockeye salmon and other species during some years and should be considered in the adaptive management of any enhancement program.</jats:p>",
