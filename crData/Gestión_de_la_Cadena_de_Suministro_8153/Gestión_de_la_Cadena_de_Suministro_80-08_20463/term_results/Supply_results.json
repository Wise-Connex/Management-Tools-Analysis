Historically, per capita water use rates have varied greatly between systems, particularly in semiarid regions where outdoor demands are large. The resulting uncertainty in design capacity estimates can cause either inadequate capacities or premature investment. In order to minimize that uncertainty multiple regression and frequency analyses were made of the various water demand parameters mentioned above for 14 systems in Utah and Colorado. Specifically, demand functions are reported for average month, peak month, and peak day. Peak hour demands were also studied but are reported in a different paper. The independent variables which were significant for monthly and daily demands were price of water and an outdoor use index which includes the effect of variation in landscaped area and accounts for use of supplementary ditch or pressure irrigation systems. The demand functions were developed with data from systems varying in size from very small low density rural systems to Salt Lake City's water system. The correlation coefficients (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) vary from 0.80 to 0.95.</jats:p>",

The present study was designed to correlate metabolic and morphological data and to investigate whether the metabolic adaptive changes in muscle tissue of claudicating legs were also reflected in morphological variables such as capillary supply, fibre type distribution, and fibre area. The activity of cytochro‐me‐c‐oxidase in gastrocnemius muscle was determined and the insulin and glucose uptakes were measured across the leg in the basal state and 10 min following intravenous administration of 25 g glucose. The finding of a reduced relative number of Type II B fibres and a reduced ratio Type II B/II A fibre area, as well as an increased capillary supply to Type II A, indicated that the most extensive morphologic changes in muscle tissue of claudicating legs had occurred in Type II fibres. The increased number of capillaries in contact with Type IIA fibres in muscle tissue from claudicating legs, compared with muscle tissue from control legs, suggested that the most apparent metabolic changes occurred in this fibre type in the adaptation process of these patients. The more pronounced morphologic and metabolic changes in Type II fibres suggest that these fibres are more intensely activated than Type I fibres during physical activity in claudicating legs. The insulin uptake correlated positively with the number of capillaries per fibre, suggesting that the endothelial surface area is one of the determining factors for insulin uptake. The percentage of Type II B fibres reflected to a certain extent the metabolic adaptation in muscle tissue.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>26 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 7 additional patients with lymphosarcoma in leukaemic transformation (LSA) have been studied with respect to the content of myelopoietic stem cell (CFUc) in blood and bone marrow. The methylcellulose culture technique (Iscove et al 1974) was employed in the absence of an exogenous source of colony stimulating factor (CSF). During active disease, CFUc colony formation was absent from patients with ALL, but was present in 2 patients with LSA. 2 therapeutic regimens were employed. Colony formation from bone marrow CFUc was highly variable during remission maintained by either regimen, with no clear relation to clinical stage, number of monocytes or circulating neutrophils. Patients with LSA consistently had high numbers of bone marrow CFUc. CFUc were low or absent from the blood. In conclusion, CFUc are absent from the bone marrow in active ALL, but may be present in active LSA. For the purpose of monitoring children with ALL during therapy, determination of blood or bone marrow CFUc was not found in this study to be helpful.</jats:p>",
