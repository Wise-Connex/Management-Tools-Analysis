This study was undertaken to study the impact of supply chain management on overall organizational effectiveness and to identify problems that affect supply chain management success. The results show that organizations generally considered themselves successful at managing their supply chains. However, while they have achieved significant improvement in organizational performance, they have not reached the order of magnitude of improvements ascribed to supply chain management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>More than ever before, the supply chain presents a significant challenge to firms that must develop a logistics system to help enhance product flow throughout their distribution channels. Of the various types of suppliers, those described as <jats:italic>preferred</jats:italic> should normally be in the best position to respond to the strategic aspirations of large order‐givers. Given the growing importance ascribed to supply chain management and supplier characterization in the literature, this article proposes to examine the actual contribution of various types of suppliers to supply chain integration. Following an empirical study focusing on a large multinational firm and its regular first‐tier suppliers, a detailed statistical analysis was conducted. Cluster analysis revealed the extent of a suppliers' logistics contributions. Overall, the findings suggest three types of contributions, and show that the intensity of a supplier's contribution has little to do with its status as a preferred supplier, depending instead on the sophistication of a supplier's logistics system. The system is characterized by a significant increase in the role of logistics in a firm's structures, through formalization of an organization, reinforcement of communication and information quality and the use of leading‐edge technology. The authors conclude that it may be tempting for a large order‐giver simply to expect supply chain performance from its preferred suppliers, rather than adding this characteristic to the others used as a basis for granting preferred status to some of its suppliers.</jats:p>",

Recent studies suggest that international supply management may be relatively more important to German companies than it currently is to their U.S. counterparts, and indicate that a cross‐national study may lead to important insights as to why this difference might exist. For example, cultural differences between the United States and Germany may lead to different management approaches (Hofstede 1984; Schwartz 1994). Practitioners can often learn valuable lessons by examining these differences and comparing the activities of managers in their country with those of another. Thus, the objective of this study is to compare the international supply management systems of U.S. organizations with those of their German counterparts, and examine the factors that drive and help to shape an organization's international supply management system.</jats:p>",

The research presents evidence that leading‐edge companies actually use such models. This exploratory study provides, for the first time, data on the nature, and use, of the cost drivers on which organizations base their TCO computations. The study suggests a generic model of total cost of ownership is not appropriate. However, the findings of this research suggest a TCO model based on a core set of cost drivers, along with an auxiliary set of cost drivers, is appropriate. The core cost drivers would be present in all, or most, TCO computations. Purchasing managers could use different, specific cost drivers from the auxiliary set to tailor the TCO computation for a particular purchase situation. The authors also suggest that a value‐based, multi‐firm, or supply chain, TCO computation model is needed. Such a TCO model should be similar to a single‐firm TCO model.</jats:p>",

The starting point is the set of principles on which a localization choice is usually based (proximity to the outlet and supply markets, state-related incentives, etc.). However, such a choice cannot be made without taking several additional factors into account – from the unsold goods problem to the cooperation between companies. In contexts characterized by instability, market-driven businesses pursue a double advantage: they assign a central role to market requirements while showing open mindedness and a readiness to react to the many rapid changes in the context. Market instability is reflected in the manufacturing sites, by quickly cancelling out benefits derived from the adopted localization solutions, and thus making it difficult for businesses to make choices, that is, adopting options that remain valid and almost unchanged over the long term.</jats:p>",

After having commented on the particularities of the management of the spare parts supply of a space station, we propose a method based on the minimization of the risk of postponement of a maintenance operation. Finally, an application to the Columbus laboratory of the International Space Station is presented.</jats:p>",

This paper estimates supply elasticities for individual crops as well as for commodity aggregates (cash and food crops) in order to investigate whether this performance is due to a lack of response on the part of farmers or on other factors. The results suggest that farmers often respond as predicted to price incentives, but that structural features of the agricultural sector prevent the improved incentives being translated into high agricultural growth.</jats:p><jats:p>La Tanzanie a, ces quinze derniêres années, parcouru un long chemin en matière de mise en œuvre de réformes axées sur le marché. Pourtant les performances dans le domaine agricole sont loin d’être satisfaisantes. Le présent article évalue les élasticités de l’offre pour chaque culture ainsi que pour les agrégats de denrées (cultures de rente et cultures vivrières) afin de déterminer si cette piètre performance est due à un manque de réaction de la part des agriculteurs ou à d’autres facteurs. L’article semble suggérer que la réaction des agriculteurs aux mesures d’incitation par les prix est souvent conforme aux attentes, mais que certaines caractéristiques structurelles du secteur agricole empêchent ces mesures d’incitation plus efficientes d’engendrer une croissance agricole forte.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the impacts of a secondary market where resellers can buy and sell excess inventories. We develop a two-period model with a single manufacturer and many resellers. At the beginning of the first period resellers order and receive products from the manufacturer, but at the beginning of the second period, they can trade inventories among themselves in the secondary market. We endogenously derive the optimal decisions for the resellers, along with the equilibrium market price of the secondary market. The secondary market creates two interdependent effect—a quantity effect (sales by the manufacturer) and an allocation effect (supply chain performance). The former is indeterminate; i.e., the total sales volume for the manufacturer may increase or decrease, depending on the critical fractile. The latter is always positive; i.e., the secondary market always improves allocative efficiency. The sum of the effects is also unclear—the welfare of the supply chain may or may not increase as a result of the secondary market. Lastly, we study potential strategies for the manufacturer to increase sales in the presence of the secondary market. </jats:p>",

The application of this model is substantiated by a case study of a leading clothing manufacturer in Hong Kong. On the technical side, the findings support the notion of harnessing information technologies (the Web, e‐mail, and electronic data interchange) to integrate business processes across the clothing supply chain. That is, information technologies could facilitate SCM, adding more value to customers. On the managerial side, the study highlights that manufacturers can assume a proactive role in leading changes in a supply chain, and that a fair share of gains from co‐operation must exist if collaboration between supply chain members is to be developed. Additionally, it is important for the members to have a thorough understanding of the impact of EC on inter‐firm relation‐ ship as well as the role they play in a supply chain before they engage in the virtual business world.</jats:p>",

Adopting a bottom–up approach, it attempts to identify the most suitable forecasting method for each of the world’ eight major non–OPEC producers separately. Assuming a short–term forecasting horizon, the study considers supply as an independent variable capable of being forecast fairly accurately, on the basis of historical data. Therefore, the individual countries' average annual production figures for the period 1970–2001 form the basis of the analysis.</jats:p><jats:p>The eight major non–OPEC producers are classified into three groups, based on the difference between actual production and its five–year moving average during the period 1970–2001. Two different moving average (MA) methods, along with the autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) method, are applied to historical data, to draw forecasts of the average supply for each country for 2000 and 2001. The smoothed absolute percentage error (SAPE) is used as the basis for evaluating and comparing the accuracy of various forecasts, and then the most efficient forecasting method is identified.</jats:p><jats:p>Finally, it is shown that the MA and ARIMA methods are capable of producing remarkably close forecasts for supply by major non–OPEC producers. It is also noted that, in view of the numeracy of factors affecting supply, the best forecasting method for each country does not necessarily remain the same from one year to the next, and that further research, covering a longer period, could end up identifying the single best method.</jats:p>",

In order to apply this approach in practice, it may be necessary to approximate the supply functions of other players. We derive bounds on the loss in revenue that occurs in comparison with the exact supply function response, when a generator uses an approximation both for its own supply function and for the supply functions of other players. We also demonstrate the existence of symmetric supply-function equilibria. </jats:p>",

This paper reviews the persistency of notions of `autonomy' and `determinism' in the context of the British nuclear power programme. In the corporatist and technocratic setting of the nationalized British Electricity Supply Industry (ESI), the perceived imperatives of nuclear power technology were often allowed priority in policymaking, to the extent that an appearance of the technology's autonomy and determinism was maintained for 30 years. This had its conveniences: technical rationales disguised more contestable institutional and political interests supporting the programme. At the same time, senior politicians and scientists at times displayed a faith in the technology approximating a belief in its autonomy and deterministic power, particularly during geopolitical or industrial crises. </jats:p><jats:p> ESI privatization was associated with the marginalization of nuclear power in Britain. Once the Government's wider mission to liberalize electricity supply was threatened by unanticipated disclosures regarding the cost of nuclear electricity, it proved willing to abandon its longstanding support for the technology. As institutional and political support for the nuclear programme was removed, the fallacy of its supposed autonomy was exposed. Whilst Langdon Winner accurately identified the preconditions necessary for the introduction of inherently political technologies such as nuclear power, in reality these were ever-present requirements, however hidden by the apparent power of the technology itself. Nevertheless, the persistence of notions of autonomy and determinism reflects a significant aspect of the sociotechnical relations of nuclear power. </jats:p>",

This paper extends M. King Hubbert’s oil production and discovery forecasting model (Hubbert, 1962), using a non–time–series cumulative discovery and production quadratic Hubbert curve and structural shift variables to model technology and regulation changes. The model can be used to determine better world oil supplies. Price is tested, to see how powerful it is for increasing or decreasing oil supply. Using a trend of cumulative production, instead of time, will help to better fix the supply elasticity with respect to price, which is shown to be very inelastic. An interesting question is whether cumulative discovery or production constitutes an I(2) variable. This paper explains that they are not I(2) variables.</jats:p>",

This relationship implies the dominance of the manufacturer over retailers. Recent market trends have shown a shift in power from manufacturers to retailers. Retailers, as a result, may now possess equal or even greater power than a manufacturer in some instances when it comes to retailing. Based on this new market phenomenon, we intend to explore the role of co‐op advertising in a manufacturer‐retailer supply chain through brand name investments, local advertising expenditures, and sharing rules of advertising expenses. Two co‐op advertising models are developed and compared. The first co‐op advertising model is based on the traditional leader‐follower relationship of a manufacturer and a retailer. The second model incorporates partnership into co‐op advertising coordination. Business examples and managerial implications of the models have been discussed. A cooperative bargaining technique is utilized to implement the partnership co‐op advertising model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the early 1980s the state of Illinois formed a state‐wide resource sharing consortium under a state network called ILLINET, founded on an OCLC‐based bibliographic database and a consortium of 18 regional library systems. This consortium successfully supported resource sharing among all types of library for nearly 15 years. In the mid‐1990s, financial and technical developments led to the dissolving of the consortium and the realignment of some of its major academic library members with other academic libraries outside the original group. Thus what was once considered a model for the future of multi‐type library consortia became a dysfunctional and non‐operative organisation. This paper examines the financial, political, and technical factors that led to these changes and assesses the short‐ and long‐term impacts on resource sharing for users of the original consortium. Other similar resource sharing consortia models are examined and compared with the Illinois experience. Possible lessons and implications are discussed and possible outcomes listed.</jats:p>",

This rationalization has not only resulted in the T&amp;C industry of the territory being able to secure competitive advantage in order to gain market share, but also to maintain survival under the rapid changing and competitive global marketplace. The process of integration has further accelerated and deepened after the 1990s with significant changes in the industry structure, production output, trade performance and investments taking place. There are significant opportunities for further strengthening the competitiveness in the T&amp;C industry at both regional and international levels for the Greater China region involving the development of synergistic and complementary effects. These effects will be specially important in the product categories and other related activities across the textile production pipeline in the region. These changes are considered necessary as a response to the challenges and opportunities arising from increasingly liberalized T&amp;C trade and increasing competition in the global market.</jats:p>",

We hypothesised that the development of most supply chain capabilities would be negatively associated with environmental uncertainty and that supply chain capabilities would be positively related to the performance of the individual businesses in the supply chain. These hypotheses were tested using structural equation modelling. The hypotheses were generally supported for the relationships between environmental uncertainty and supply chain capabilities. However, most supply chain capabilities and environmental uncertainty were seen to be negatively related to business performance. We used established constructs for environmental uncertainty and business performance and developed new measures of supply chain capabilities. The main contributions of the paper are to simultaneously test the linkages between the three constructs and to develop new measures of supply chain capabilities.</jats:p>",

Firms in food-related businesses have been increasingly responsive to changing customer demands and competitive pressures and have introduced substantial product and process changes. This research considers firm-internal and supply chain relationship characteristics as the cause of strategic change. Using structural equation modelling, significant relationships between firm resources and strategic change were sought. Multi-group analyses were used to identify moderating effects of supplier and customer collaboration. The results indicate that resources have an effect on product and process changes. Supplier and customer collaboration were not found to have any moderating effects. The results have important implications for both supply chains and firms in terms of strategic change and the benefits of supplier and customer collaboration. </jats:p>",

They also experienced cases in which they doubted the suitability of the requested product. Over half of the respondents reported receiving at least monthly requests from doctors to dispense an emergency supply. Refusals to supply were most commonly because the requested product was a Controlled Drug and therefore disallowed. Most respondents believed that the emergency supply procedures provided an opportunity to exercise professional judgment and were an important “safety net” for patients.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The provisions for the emergency supply of medicines are a common resort of both prescribers and patients and present pharmacists with an opportunity to exercise professional judgment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of on-chip power-rail inductance in generating delta-I power-supply noise is examined in this paper using systematic circuit simulation of the complete integrated-circuit power net. This source of noise is compared to the resistive IR drop in the net, and to the delta-I noise due to both high-inductance- and low-inductance-bonding packages. Results are presented for a typical on-chip power net in 0.18 μm CMOS technology, and it is demonstrated that the inductance of this on-chip power net is the dominant contributor to the full-chip power-supply noise. The simultaneous switching events which produce the triggering current transients for the delta-I noise are taken to arise from core-logic switching; the mitigating, de-coupling role of the capacitance of non-switching gates within the core-logic block is considered. </jats:p>",

Consequently, supply chain integration (SCI) strategies should be evaluated in the light of a company’s market and product strategies. This paper examines the effect of SCI on the relationship between diversification and a firm’s competitive performance. The results of the study can be useful in integrating supply chain strategy into market and product diversification (PD) strategy. By comparing the main and interaction effects of SCI and diversification on performance, the paper shows that SCI strategy modifies the relationship between diversification and performance. Additionally, it is argued that coordinated use of SCI and diversification strategies has a significant effect on firm performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The choice of flexible organizational architecture allows for the continued reconfiguration of the independent modular components of the supply chain so as to achieve optimal leverage of both the firms core competencies as well as their collaborative partners complementary resources.

Findings indicate that the supply of information reflects demand rather well, with only a few existing gaps in online information. Despite this, a number of shortcomings remain concerning online information provision by planning programs. Web sites should emphasize content, but organization, connectivity, and style all play important roles in effective recruitment as well. </jats:p>",

During pregnancy, long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC‐PUFA) are preferentially transferred from mother to fetus across the placenta. This placental transfer is mediated by specific fatty acid binding and transfer proteins. After birth, preterm and full‐term babies are capable of converting linoleic and α‐linolenic acids into AA and DHA, respectively, as demonstrated by studies using stable isotopes, but the activity of this endogenous LC‐PUFA synthesis is very low. Breast milk provides preformed LC‐PUFA, and breast‐fed infants have higher LC‐PUFA levels in plasma and tissue phospholipids than infants fed conventional formulas. Supplementation of formulas with different sources of LC‐PUFA can normalize LC‐PUFA status in the recipient infants relative to reference groups fed human milk. Some, but not all, randomized, double‐masked placebo‐controlled clinical trials in preterm and healthy full‐term infants demonstrated benefits of formula supplementation with DHA and AA for development of visual acuity up to 1 year of age and of complex neural and cognitive functions. From the available data, we conclude that LC‐PUFA are conditionally essential substrates during early life that are related to the quality of growth and development. Therefore, a dietary supply during pregnancy, lactation, and early childhood that avoids the occurrence of LC‐PUFA depletion is desirable, as was recently recommended by an expert consensus workshop of the Child Health Foundation.</jats:p>",
