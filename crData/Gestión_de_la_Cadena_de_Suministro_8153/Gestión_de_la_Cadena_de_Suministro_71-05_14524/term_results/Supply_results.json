The basic study‐strategy has been first to take a preliminary look at the total problem and then to select specific areas in which water‐supply problems appear most imminent. The next step was the initiation of feasibility studies, which have led to more detailed work in the fields of engineering, ecology, economics, and institutional analyses.</jats:p><jats:p>This four‐part discussion, which was presented at the Annual Conference on Jun. 23, 1970, deals, respectively, with important aspects of the water‐supply picture in the Northeast: the changing problems and solutions now before us; the work of the NEWS Study and other studies; the important role of AWWA's Advisory Committee; and the dilemmas facing the New York City metropolitan area.</jats:p>",

The choice of water source is usually controlled by individual economic factors, and climatic, geologic and geographic considerations. This segment of the nation's population lives in the rural and suburban areas of the United States remote from existing community water supply distribution lines.</jats:p><jats:p>The United States Public Health Service has shared, for many years, the concern of the various State Health Departments regarding the sanitary quality of individual water supplies. It has been generally concluded by public health officials, both Federal and State, that safe water supplies are not available to many homes in the United States. The rapid technological advances in industry, agriculture and transportation in recent years have intensified the potential of pollution of the environment, both chemically and biologically. The spread of pollution is accompanied by the increased hazard of water‐borne disease and associated illnesses.</jats:p><jats:p>During the summer of 1969 the Bureau of Water Hygiene<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#fn2\">*</jats:ext-link>, Environmental Health Service, with the cooperation of the Georgia State Health Department, conducted a systematic survey of individual water supplies in 4 counties in the State of Georgia. The results of the survey indicate that more than ⅓ of the water supplies sampled are potentially hazardous to the users, and that there is a definite relationship of the geologic environment and type of water supply to the nature of the contamination.</jats:p>",

The objective of this analysis is to estimate the guaranteed price elasticity of supply of hen eggs over the twelve‐year period 1954 to 1966. Two models are used, a conventional linear form and a Nerlove type lagged model. The independent variables considered are the guaranteed price, the price of feed, and egg yield as a proxy for technology. The non‐lagged equation is the more satisfactory and gives an elasticity value of 1.66, suggesting that flock owners were highly sensitive to changes in the guaranteed price. This sensitivity tended to be obscured by producer eagerness to profit from technological advance, which was the predominant factor affecting the scale of egg production over the period.</jats:p>",
