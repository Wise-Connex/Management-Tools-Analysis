This need must be monitored and matched against the production of graduates at all appropriate levels. The author has assembled extensive data on the latter over the past eight years while at the Southern Regional Education Board in Atlanta, GA (USA) during the period 1965--72 and currently at the University of Missouri-Rolla.

In this paper the author also develops estimates of computer manpower need and compares these estimates of need with estimates on production.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The influence of nitrogen nutrition on the growth and development of Canada thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop., was investigated by growing seedlings in sand culture under controlled conditions. A preliminary experiment showed that seedlings at the cotyledon stage were very susceptible to injury by high salt concentration; a 10 × dilution of Hoagland's solution was required for successful establishment. Nitrate-N at 210 ppm caused severe leaf necrosis and inhibition of shoot and root bud growth, but provision of ammonium-N eliminated these effects.When seedlings were supplied with NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> at levels that ranged from 5.25 to 420 ppm N, shoot dry weight and root bud growth increased up to 210 ppm but decreased at 420 ppm, probably as a result of ammonium toxicity. By clearing roots with lactic acid it was shown that while growth of the root buds increased with the N level, the number of buds initiated was significantly reduced. When plants were grown initially at a low N level, a subsequent increase in the N supply permitted the root buds to escape from inhibition and develop as leafy shoots. This response suggested that under the experimental conditions, bud inhibition was due to internal competition for a limiting N supply. </jats:p>",

Young male rats (about 100 g initial wt.) were fed on one of three diets. Group I (controls) received an adequate 18% lactalbumin diet for 28 days, on which they sustained maximum growth. Group II (protein-depleted) was fed for 14 days on 0.5 lactalbumin diet, which caused loss of weight; this was followed by repletion for 14 days with the control diet. Group III (protein-energy restricted) received a 1% lactalbumin diet at one-half the food intake of group II for 14 days, and this was also followed by 14 days of repletion with the control diet. 3. The controls showed a progressive rise in the daily urinary output of N-τ-methylhistidine, which was proportionally slightly less rapid than the body-weight increase. 4. The protein-depleted group II showed a marked and progressive decrease in N-τ-methylhistidine excretion, which was proportionally greater than the fall in body weight; during repletion, N-τ-methylhistidine output rose in parallel with body-weight increase, but it did not reach the value attained by the control group. 5. Group III, restricted in both dietary protein and energy, showed an initial small increase in daily N-τ-methylhistidine output, which contrasted with the sharp loss of body weight during this period. After 11 days on this restricted diet, group III then underwent a decrease in N-τ-methylhistidine output, which persisted into the first 4 days of the repletion period, after which output of the methylated amino acid became the same as for group II. 6. Creatinine output, used as an additional metabolic measure of muscle metabolism, showed a fairly constant relationship to body weight in groups I and II during depletion and repletion. However, rats with protein-energy deficiency (group III) underwent a marked increase in output of creatinine per unit of body weight, which also persisited into the repletion period before it fell to more normal values relative to body weight. 7. Analysis of the N-τ-methylhistidine content of actin isolated from a group of protein-depleted rats revealed a small (5%) but significance (P less than 0.02) decrease relative to well-nourished controls. 8. Hence, the rate of muscle protein degradation, as indicated by changes in urinary N-τ-methylhistidine output, appears to respond sensitively and in opposite directions to insufficiency of protein of energy in the diet.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant KD46 (ole 2), which is unable to synthesize unsaturated fatty acids, was grown on limiting amounts of different added unsaturated fatty acids. The acyl chain composition of the cellular lipid classes was determined in these cultures at different stages of growth. During growth on added oleic acid, there was no marked change in the mole percentage of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, or phosphatidylserine among the total phospholipids.Cells grown on palmitoleic, oleic, or linoleic acid showed a steady decrease in their total phospholipid levels per cell concomitant with a decrease in growth rate approaching minimal levels at stationary phase. Furthermore, the mole percentage of the supplemented unsaturated fatty acid in the cellular phospholipids also decreased during growth and attained minimal values when growth ceased.At stationary phase the total phospholipid content per cell was similar for cells grown on a wide range of fatty acids or mixtures thereof, whereas the composition of the fatty acids in the cellular phospholipids were strikingly different. The differences in efficiencies for supporting growth of most of the unsaturated fatty acids tested did not seem due to the extent of their incorporation into cellular phospholipids, but rather to differences in the ability of the derived membrane phospholipids to support cellular functions.Palmitoleate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate, arachidonate, eicosapentaenoate, and docosahexaenoate all appeared to contribute to the functionality of cellular membranes in an additive linear manner. Thus, the contribution of these acids to cellular growth can be characterized by a functionality factor that seems independent of the mixtures of acids supporting growth. Use of the functionality concept allows the cumulative influence of many different acids to be summarized quantitatively by a single number rather than resorting to qualitative descriptions of the degree of unsaturation or 'fitness' of the membrane phospholipids. </jats:p>",
