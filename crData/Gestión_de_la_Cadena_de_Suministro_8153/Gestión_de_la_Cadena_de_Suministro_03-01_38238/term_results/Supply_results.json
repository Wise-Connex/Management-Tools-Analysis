      "abstract": "<jats:p>Simulation is a very useful tool for predicting supply chain performance. Because there are no standard simulation elements that represent accurately the activities in a supply chain, there exist a variety of approaches for developing supply chain simulation models. To improve this situation, this paper describes a novel supply chain simulation framework that follows the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. This framework has been used for building powerful simulation models that integrate discrete event simulation and spreadsheets. The simulation models are hierarchical and use submodels that capture activities specific to supply chains. The SCOR framework provides a basis for defining the level of detail in a way as to include as many features as possible, while not making them industry specific. This approach enables the reuse of submodels, which reduces development time. The paper describes the implementation of the simulation models and how the submodels interact during execution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Streamlining supply chains is a high priority for corporations. In a volatile economy, customer satisfaction, market share and revenue growth become dependent on getting the right product to the right place at the right time. As a result, the notion of adaptive supply chains is emerging as the next competitive battlefield. Fulfillment velocity, inventory visibility, and supplier coordination versatility form the three pillars of adaptive supply chains. To support these business objectives, traditional tethered computing models are inadequate. Untethered models, enabled by mobile computing, facilitate the improvement, management and re-design of next generation supply chains. In this chapter, we examine the different ways mobility is morphing supply chain applications. Specifically, we show how mobile technology and infrastructure is transforming the key areas of procurement, supply execution, supply chain visibility and after-sales service management.</jats:p>"

It is commonly used and generally operated at a very high efficiency. Therefore, it would seem that theoretical discussion of performance and experimental observations of internal flow conditions inside the pump should be fully understood by now. However, it appears that neither the basic expressions nor the theoretical design methods are that clear. For example, the most fundamental definition of pump head, which is the most important equation in pump textbooks, is not often well explained. The purpose of this oral presentation is to share preliminary results of on-going studies on the energy transfer in centrifugal pumps.</jats:p>",

He showed that such an effect can be derived in a theoretical model with economies of scale in production and a taste for variety in consumption. In his model, countries grow by producing new varieties of goods, and they are able to export these goods without suffering any deterioration in their terms of trade. This paper analyzes U.S. import demand from different source countries and finds strong evidence of a supply effect of roughly half the magnitude (0.75) of the income elasticity (1.5). Price elasticities for the most part are estimated close to -1, which is typical for the literature. Exclusion of the supply effect leads to overestimation of the income elasticity. Results based on U.S. exports to different destinations are less robust, but largely corroborate these findings.</jats:p>"

In this paper the vision is the seamless. supply chain, and we outline an appropriate established framework, and supporting toolkit. The core of our approach is smooth material flow enabled by a proven set of simplicity rules. This ensures total integration of vision, framework, and toolkit. A case study illustrates the application of the methodology showing the bottom‐line performance improvement resulting from a supply chain process re‐engineering program.</jats:p>",

Specifically, it has been suggested that unless significant infrastructure investment is undertaken now the demand/supply balance situation in eastern Australia will deteriorate quickly as natural gas resources are depleted in the face of strongly growing demand.The purpose of this study is to examine whether and when supplies in eastern Australia are likely to fall short of growing demand.A modelling framework was developed by ABARE to examine these issues at a regional level, building on ABARE’s MARKAL model of the Australian energy system. The modelling framework includes representations of potential sources of natural gas and coal seam methane in Australia by basin, existing and proposed pipeline options and regional gas demands. A number of alternative supply side assumptions were also examined to evaluate their impact on the final results, including annual production rates from various basins and the availability of commercial and non-commercial reserves.</jats:p>"

The ‘new way of thinking’ they can adopt is an internal change that must always respond to market and business logics, but that can and must interact with the other actors of society for the most complex processes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The past two years has been a period characterized by an emphasis on cost cutting, improving the operation of existing assets and a constrained financial market. In such an environment, repowering offers the potential to significantly improve existing power plant assets. A repowering of an existing steam power plant can result in a more than 50% improvement in the heat rate, leading to enormous operating cost savings. However, despite the potential operational and financial benefits of repowering, the experience we have found from first-hand research, is that there are a number of misconceptions regarding repowering economics. It appears that such misconceptions are limiting the extent to which repowering is being considered as a power supply resource option. The two most common misperceptions regarding repowering economics relate to 1) the relative installed cost compared to greenfield construction and 2) the comparative financial returns on a life-cycle basis. In this paper we analyze and discuss these two issues and try and make the case that repowering should be routinely included in power supply planning, along with options such as greenfield construction, power purchase agreements and spot purchasing.</jats:p>",

To apply environmental management, any one of a number of tools may be employed. Environmental impact assessment (EIA), as one of these tools, refers to the assessment of the likely environmental impacts arising from a major project or any other actions that will significantly affect the natural or man-made environment. The ultimate objective of an EIA is to provide decision-makers with an indication of the likely consequences of a proposed project. The South African EIA was developed in such a way as to be applicable tolarge-scale as well as smaller projects. This article focuses on environmental impact assessment (EIA), the legislation governing it, and applying the process to a small case study, while examining the various stages of an EIA and briefly touching on public participation. The main findings are that an EIA can be applied quite successfully to smaller projects and that an effective public participation process will help consultants and developers to identify key issues and alternatives.</jats:p>"

Father taught son, and so life rolled on. This is not so nowadays, capital equipment is much larger and more expensive so it has to be kept working day and (often) at night, and to raise efficiency there are satellite guidance systems (GPS) to locate exactly where in the fields to administer changes in fertilizer regimes following soil and yield assessment. Statistical analyses and data management have become a dominant factor in modern farm management—as has maintaining awareness of global events and regional legislation with respect to production limits and quota systems. In other words, the pace of life has quickened, and knowledge management has become a real need. The acquisition of data has to be fast, and its exchange between workers has to be open to develop an awareness of interlinks between all the pertinent data. We know the world is not ‘ideal’, so in this paper we will look to the factors that might inhibit knowledge transfer, thus delay or deny learning. Further, as each enterprise is but one in a complex web of ‘supply chains’, we will note macro factors that may inhibit better micro performance in multinational companies as they attempt to pursue their global business and exchange their knowledge.

Business complexity describes the diversity and volatility associated with a firm’s product markets. To cope with this complexity, firms deploy inventory buffers. This deployment should decrease inventory turnover.  An extensive manufacturing IT infrastructure can increase a firm’s “sense and respond” capability, reducing the need for buffers, and can thereby improve inventory turnover. As this technology enables enhanced coordination, and as firms’ efforts to reduce buffers within their own organizational boundaries earn diminishing marginal returns, firms attempt to optimize performance across organizational boundaries within the supply chain, i.e., adopt a cooperative supply chain coordination strategy. This supply chain coordination should improve inventory turnover.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes the variability of turbine airfoil oxidation life due to variability in the turbine cooling air portion of the auxiliary air system of a commercial turbofan engine. The variability imposed on the system results from both aerothermal variability in the main gaspath and geometric variability, such as seal clearance and blade effective flow area, within the turbine cooling air system. The probabilistic analysis of the oxidation life is compared to documented lives for in-service turbine blades for two airlines operating the same engine model. Probabilistic results are similar to the field experience for the airline operating in a hotter environment. Historical calibration factors within the lifing system which can potentially cause the probabilistic results to be too conservative are discussed. To demonstrate the importance of including all the blades in an analysis, a model with a single “lumped” blade with an effective area equivalent to all the blades in a turbine stage is shown to over predict the oxidation life of an engine. In addition, regression analysis is used to identify input variables for which a decrease in tolerance would provide a significant increase in life. For the more severe operator, a 10% decrease in the tolerance of the effective flow area of the blade leading edge cooling passage can more than double the minimum oxidation life (5% failed) of a fleet of engines. To offset the economic impact of tightened tolerances, the regression analysis also identifies input variables whose tolerances can be loosened with little impact on blade life.</jats:p>",

Realizing the synergy that exists in these functions, many companies have extended the concept further upstream and downstream to include entities outside the company to include vendors and their vendors and also customers and their customers. Experts predicted that integrated supply chains would enable these firms to compete better. How successful have companies been in integrating their supply chains? How pervasive integration has been in the supply chain? What were the challenges these firms faced in their journeys to achieve integration in their networks? How and when were they able to overcome these obstacles? In seeking to answer these questions, we examine the challenges faced by companies in integrating their supply chain networks using case studies among 14 European companies or European subsidiaries of global companies divided into five supply chains.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the potential welfare effects are examined. The analysis is performed using an extension of the Azzam and Schroeter (1995) model comprising both oligopsony and oligopoly instead of just oligopsony. The model is given empirical content using data on the Dutch cucumber chain and assuming Cournot competition among retailers who have market power on either the consumer/retail or growers/retail market or both. The results show that in case of a cucumber supply shock and market power, consumer prices change more than growers' prices. Moreover, total welfare effects of market power are small but potentially large income distribution effects exist. [EconLit citations: L130, Q130.]  © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Plants were grown at high relative humidity to prevent wilting of the wilty peas. Irrespective of N supply, expanding wilty leaflets had ca 50% less ABA than WT leaflets but similar ethylene evolution rates. Fully expanded wilty leaflets had lower relative water contents (RWC) and were 10–60% smaller in area (according to the node of measurement) than WT leaflets. However, there were no genotypic differences in plant relative leaf expansion rate (RLER). Growth of both genotypes at 0.5 mM N increased the RWC of fully expanded leaflets, but did not alter ethylene evolution or ABA concentration of expanding leaflets. Plants grown at 0.5 mM N showed a 20–30% reduction in RLER, which was similar in magnitude in both wilty and WT peas. Thus,�leaf ABA status did not alter the leaf growth response to N deprivation.</jats:p>"

Many of these analyses focused on identifying either willingness to pay or comparing average service costs and prices paid by customers. This paper performs a welfare analysis of two water supply systems—public and self owned—in rural Tunisia. The paper calculates consumer and producer surplus and compares the performance of the two systems from a social point of view. Results suggest that both systems are inefficient, mainly because of a production level that is low compared with production capacity.</jats:p>",

Total farm production records showed that 221 kg/ha of lamb meat and 127 kg/ha of wool were produced. Pasture production was 15800 kg DM/ha, while 58% of the farm area was used for silage making in late October. Extra inputs required included fertiliser where silage was made, labour for silage feeding in winter, the costs of silage making and feeding out, concentrate feeds during winter, and extra shearing costs. Savings were made in crutching costs and labour costs at lambing due to lambing ease. November lambing systems provide the opportunity to produce heavyweight lambs for slaughter at 9 to 11 months of age but price structures need to account for the increased production costs.

We present an extension of the basic newsvendor model that allows us to quantify the value of the observed demand data and the impact of suboptimal forecasting on the expected costs at the retailer. We demonstrate the approach through an example in which the retailer employs a commonly used forecasting technique, exponential smoothing. The model is also used to quantify the value of information and information sharing for a decoupled supply chain in which both the retailer and the manufacturer must forecast demand. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of e-commerce has prompted many manufacturers to redesign their traditional channel structures by engaging in direct sales. The model conceptualizes the impact of customer acceptance of a direct channel, the degree to which customers accept a direct channel as a substitute for shopping at a traditional store, on supply-chain design. The customer acceptance of a direct channel can be strong enough that an indepent manufacturer would open a direct channel to compete with its own retailers. Here, direct marketing is used for strategic channel control purposes even though it is inefficient on its own and, surprisingly, it can profit the manufacturer even when so direct sales occur. Specifically, we construct a price-setting game between a manufacturer and its independent retailer. Direct marketing, which indirectly increases the flow of profits through the retail channel, helps the manufacturer improve overall profitability by reducing the degree of inefficient price double marginalization. While operated by the manufacturer to constrain the retailer's pricing behavior, the direct channel may not always be detrimental to the retailer because it will be accompanied by a wholesale price reduction. This combination of manufacturer pull and push can benefit the retailer in equilibrium. Finally, we show that the mere threat of introducing the direct channel can increase the manufacturer's negotiated share of cooperative profits even if price efficiency is obtained by using other business practices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examine the impact of point of sale (POS) data sharing on ordering decisions in a multi‐echelon supply chain. In particular, we focus on how exposure to POS data may help reduce the “bullwhip effect,” the tendency of orders to increase in variability as one moves up a supply chain. Theoretical studies have shown that exposure to POS data can lead to a reduction in the bullwhip effect when suppliers have no prior knowledge of the demand distribution. The benefit of sharing POS data in stable industries, where the demand distribution is commonly known, is less clear. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic demand. We find, using a controlled simulation experiment, that sharing POS information does help reduce some components of the bullwhip effect in a stable demand setting, namely the order oscillation of upstream members. We offer one possible explanation for this improvement by examining the relationship between order decisions and demand line information. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Three months following sowing, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seedlings were transplanted into pots with controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) applied at rates of 0, 8, 16, and 24 g/2200 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> soil as a single uniform layer beneath the root system. Seedlings were destructively harvested periodically, and roots were divided into vertical segments above (S1), within (S2), and below (S3) the fertilizer layer. Two months following transplant, the number of active root tips was positively correlated with CRF rate in S1 and negatively correlated with rate in S2 and S3. At 6 months, root penetration into S3 was severely restricted at 16 and 24 g. This was attributed to detrimental changes in soil osmotic potential in S2. Fertilizer improved seedling growth at 8 g after 6 months compared with controls but was inhibitory at 24 g. Photochemical quantum yield was higher in all CRF treatments compared with controls 3 months following transplant, which corresponded with rapid initial CRF nutrient release. Despite improvements in nutrient release technology with CRF, high application rates may result in excessive concentrations of fertilizer nutrients in media, which can restrict root penetration and negatively affect seedling growth. Conservative application rates and improvements in CRF technology will help reduce the potential for adverse effects on seedling development. </jats:p>",

Growth and nitrogen content of new foliage were shown to be largely dependent on seedling nitrogen status at the end of the first year, and only weakly dependent on nutrient supply in the second. An average of 70% of total nitrogen in new foliage was remobilised from storage in the first 63 d after flushing began. The remainder of new-foliage nitrogen was derived by root uptake from the nutrient supply in the second year. There was some response of nitrogen uptake to high nitrogen supply in the second year where seedlings had been nitrogen deficient at the end of the first year. However, it was concluded that the indeterminate growth habit of P. ferruginea did not distinguish its pattern of nitrogen storage and remobilisation from that of determinate conifers. </jats:p>"

Eight adult rabbits were used in the study. In order to exhibit the vascular network by dissection, latex was injected via the abdominal aorta.</jats:p><jats:p>The main vessel which supplies blood to the penis, the penile artery, is a branch of the internal pudendal artery. It divides into two branches which form the deep and dorsal penile arteries at the level of the ischiadic arch. The deep penile artery penetrates the tunica albuginea, and forms the arterial network of corpus cavernosum penis. On the other hand, the dorsal penile artery gives off three small branches for the subischiocavernosus muscle and at the level of the attachment of this muscle sends two small branches for the preputium. The course of both arteries follows the dorsolateral surface of the penis to the glans and ends in an anastomosis. Hence, a caudal branch of the prostatic artery which originates from the umbilical artery joins the blood supply of the penis in the rabbit. After vascularizing the prostate complex, it ends by entering the corpus spongiosus penis at the dorsolateral surface at the level of the ischiadic arch.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper discusses an application of MCDA to integrated water resource planning for the City of Cape Town. As a result of rapid growth in recent years, there has been increasing pressures on limited water resources, leading by the end of 2000 to severe restrictions having to be imposed on consumers. Planners needed thus to develop and to evaluate options both for water supply augmentation and for water demand management. The role of structuring these problems in MCDA terms, in order to facilitate a common understanding between a number of interest groups, is first discussed. Thereafter, the use of simple multiattribute value functions to score the various supply and demand management options in a group setting is described. One advantage of this approach was that when additional alternatives were proposed at a later date, their evaluation could easily be incorporated with the earlier results. The intention during this study was to identify high priority interventions (which may need to be implemented quickly), as well as options that are probably not worth implementing in the short term. It is recognized that at a later stage, the high priority items may need to be ‘packaged’ into a number of alternative policy scenarios, which will be evaluated in more holistic terms. At the time of writing, the results of the analysis described here had been presented as a single proposal to the city council, and have led to more detailed design studies for implementation.

The areas and volumes of glaciers in the whole considered region decreased 15% and 18%, respectively, from the LIA maximum to 1956. This trend of glacier shrinkage continued and accelerated between 1956 and 1990. These latest decreases in area and volume were about 10% in 34 years. The recent shrinkage may be due either to a combination of higher temperatures and lower precipitation during the period 1956–66, or to continuous warming in the high glacierized mountains from 1956 to 1990. As a consequence, glacier runoff from ice wastage between 1956 and 1990 has increased river runoff by 6.2 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> in the four river basins under consideration. Besides, the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) rise estimated from the mean terminus retreat of small glaciers &lt;1 km long is 46 m, which corresponds to a 0.3°C increase of mean temperatures in warm seasons from the LIA to the 1950s.</jats:p>"

The ceramic evidence is viewed in the light of broader political and economic trends that affected production and trade over the course of time. A clear shift from regional self-sufficiency to a heavier reliance upon extra-regional goods, particularly from the Roman provinces of Africa and Spain, is observed. The authors point out that while the ceramic record is a useful indicator of general supply trends, conclusions must be drawn with caution and scholars need to consider what is not apparent in the archaeological record in order to gain a more complete picture of the past.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the literature lacks an integrated methodological framework for examining the impact of emerging SCM trends on decision making relative to the spatial organization of logistical networks. This analysis has three purposes—( a) develop a conceptual framework for analyzing how decisions are made on the spatial organization of logistical networks, ( b) test the proposed framework via case studies, and ( c) develop a preliminary set of guidelines on the essential elements in making strategic logistical network design decisions. An interesting finding in implementing the proposed methodological framework, which was further supported by the limited empirical research, is that decision-making requirements vary substantially among the industrial and service sectors. This variance reflects differences in objectives and the extent of integration and collaboration of business entities along the respective supply chains. </jats:p>",

We quantified N retranslocation in young black spruce [<jats:italic>Picea mariana</jats:italic> (Mill.)

After one growing season (120 d), biomass increased (118%) on the poor soil without N gain demonstrating the significance of internal N reserves for retranslocation to new growth. Nutrient loading improved retranslocation (218%) and new biomass (156%) after planting confirming the advantage of higher preplant N reserves (175%) for later nutrient demand. Enhanced N availability in the rich soil accelerated growth (236%), N uptake (258%), and retranslocation (23%) in seedlings. Retranslocation increased with time reflecting higher N demand as seedlings become larger and suggest the process is driven by sink strength. Nontracer estimates of N retranslocation in seedlings fell short of isotopic determinations because of inability to discriminate between soil and plant derived N in tree components. Although fertilization promoted N uptake (125–258%), <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N recovery in plants averaged 12 to 19% indicating low fertilizer efficiency in young trees. Total reliance of unfertilized plants on internal N reserves for growth on the poor soil affirms the importance of retranslocation to meet plant N demands, and also exemplifies initial short‐term independence on soil N for newly planted seedlings that can be prolonged by nutrient loading.</jats:p>",

In this system, the power is supplied from the floor to the shoes of the patients through coils that are set beneath the floor and the bottom of the shoes. If the patients wear the special shoes, they will be able to move freely on the specially designed floor without an external battery. Direct current (DC)‐DC power efficiency was measured in the experiments, and the results showed that it varies with relative positions between the shoe and the floor coils. The results suggested that three‐layered floor coils would enable the system to meet the demand for providing the required power anywhere on the floor without intermission. DC‐DC power efficiency could be kept over 60% under the practical condition. It can then be concluded that the proposed system has a potential to provide better quality of life for the patients using a TETS.</jats:p>",

Chamberlain and Choung (1995) mention that sugar supplementation results in a higher microbial nitrogen supply (MNS) than starch. On the other hand, the amount of nutrients that ruminants can remove from feeds, may be modified by others feeds eaten the same day (Gill and Powell, 1993). Thus, feeding pattern might also affect microbial-N supply (Chamberlain and Choung, 1995). Therefore, the objective of the present work was to compare maize and sugarcane molasses as energy sources as well as the change of feeding pattern (CFP) on DM intake and MNS.</jats:p>"

Although <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic> is the most widespread infectious agent in humans, its actual population structure has remained hypothetical until now because: (i) its structural genes are poorly polymorphic; (ii) adequate samples and appropriate statistics for population genetic analysis have not been considered. To investigate this structure, we analysed the statistical associations (linkage disequilibrium) between 12 independent <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic> minisatellite‐like loci by high‐throughput genotyping within a model population of 209 isolates representative of the genetic diversity in an area with a very high incidence of tuberculosis. These loci contain variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) of genetic elements named mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs). Highly significant linkage disequilibrium was detected among the MIRU‐VNTR loci in this model. This linkage disequilibrium was also evident when the MIRU‐VNTR types were compared with the IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic> restriction fragment length polymorphism types. These results support a predominant clonal evolution of <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",
