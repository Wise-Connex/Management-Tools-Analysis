A second main result was the mathematical proof that the slope of the long-run timber supply curve is positive along its entire length when establishment costs are fixed and variable. Some calculations were made using a well-established yield function for jack pine in Ontario, and these supported the theoretical conclusions. In contrast, the use of V*/t* as the equivalent annual output incorporates the implicit assumption that the discount rate is zero. For. Sci. 36(1):77-86.</jats:p>",

Instead, the number of unique hospital services is associated with higher utilization rates. The impact of this characteristic of hospital supply, however, is much weaker than the original Roemer effect. The contradiction of these findings with Roemer's Law is apparently a result of a methods effect: use of hospital utilization data which are not derived from actual population experience reveals a relationship which is a statistical artifact. The data also reveal that suburban counties have higher utilization rates than either rural or urban (MSA core) counties. </jats:p>",

The other treatments and no irrigation gave much lower seed yields and a larger range of seed yields. Treatment (c) gave the lowest harvest index. Similar results were obtained with cv. Alfred.

Changes in chloride concentrations during pumping tests of contaminated wells indicated that the main source of salinity was derived from within the water‐table aquifer.

First, demand systems estimates that overlook supply response are as subject to simultaneous equations bias as single <jats:italic>ad hoc</jats:italic> demand equations. Theil shows theoretically that assuming supply curves are perfectly elastic, when in fact they are not will underestimate price responsiveness in demand equations. An empirical example is presented that demonstrates that the price elasticities generally increase when upward‐sloping supplies are assumed.</jats:p><jats:p>Second, the iterative testing procedure presented may provide direction for model building when the true structure of the system is unknown. For example, the results of the Wu‐Hausman test indicate that assuming chicken supply is perfectly elastic in a model of the Japanese livestock industry is justified. The results also indicate that the supplies of Wagyu beef, dairy beef, pork and fish are upward‐sloping and therefore should be modeled as endogenous variables in the demand system.</jats:p><jats:p>Third, the results emphasize the sensitivity of projections of Japanese beef imports to the assumptions underlying the demand system. If perfectly elastic meat supplies are assumed for an analysis of reducing Japanese beef import liberalization, the results will likely underestimate the impacts on beef imports.</jats:p><jats:p>In summary, the supply curves for agricultural products tend to slope upward within the time periods used for traditional policy analysis and demand system estimation, which in turn implies that prices are determined endogenously within the system. Endogenous price determination is contrary to the assumptions that underlie the theoretical foundations and many empirical applications of demand systems. We present a methodology to test for and adjust demand systems for endogeneity. The importance of this adjustment is demonstrated by using an analysis of the liberalization of the Japanese beef market.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Female physicians work fewer hours per week, are slightly less likely to be in patient care, and tend to enter different specialties than male physicians. Female physicians also have higher retirement rates than male physicians, but due to their lower mortality rates, have work lives nearly as long as male physicians. We examined how the changing composition of the physician population will affect the availability of physician services by comparing historical and projected trends for the number of active post-residency physicians with comparable trends for a full-time-equivalent measure of physician supply. The full-time-equivalent measure takes into account the different labor supply behavior of key subpopulations (e.g., women and graduates of US versus foreign medical schools). The results suggest that the changing composition of the physician population will reduce the growth of effective physician supply between 1986 and 2010 but only by four percentage points. </jats:p>",

The board controls growers' square footage through quotas but growers have some discretion over output from varying other inputs.

These voles also made up &gt; 90% of snap-trapped small mammals in the study area. Comparisons of the species composition in the diet during laying with that of animals trapped indicated that bank voles were usually taken approximately in proportion to their relative abundance, whereas field voles were frequently taken more and grey-sided voles less than expected from their relative abundance. However, bank voles predominated in the diet during laying early in the season (snow depth &gt; 40 cm). Later in the season (snow depth ≤ 40 cm) the porportion of field voles and grey-sided voles increased during laying, suggesting increased availability of these species as the snow melted. Breeding density (percentage of nest boxes with ≥ 1 egg) showed a positive correlation whereas laying date showed a negative correlation with food supply in autumn. In contrast, clutch size, number of fledglings per successful nest, and an index of the annual production of fledglings showed positive correlations with food supply in spring. Clutch size declined with season but at different levels in different years, and laying date per se only explained 11% of clutch size variation among years. In contrast, the \"year effect\" (related to food supply) explained 29% of the variation in clutch size. Clutches were even larger at later laying dates (when, however, the food supply was better) in 1984 than in 1985. Nest survival and survival per egg (until fledging) in successful nests varied over the years, but did not covary with the cyclic food supply. However, the lowest nest survival was found in a year when voles declined dramatically over winter. Egg size did not show any variation among years. </jats:p>",

Tissue oxygen supply was assessed by means of PO2 histograms; evaluation of the initial slopes of the hydrogen clearance curves enabled the measurement of capillary blood flow. 2. In a further model, the analysis of hydrogen clearance curves measured in the femoral vein using intravascular needle electrodes in rabbits enabled the distribution of blood flow to be evaluated both under resting conditions and during direct 2 Hz stimulation of the vastus medialis muscle. 3. Increased oxygen consumption, induced by stimulation, caused increases in capillary flow which were not necessarily accompanied by augmentation of femoral artery flow. 4. PO2 histograms provided no evidence of cellular anoxia even at the maximum level of oxygen consumption. 5. A two‐compartment distribution of flow was measured under resting conditions, whereas only one compartment could be resolved during 2 Hz stimulation of the vastus medialis muscle in the rabbit experiments. A clear redistribution of flow was observed in the absence of any increase in total flow. 6.

Much of this energy is supplied by fossil fuels. At present, fossil fuels are economically attractive and their relatively high energy densities make them particularly attractive for transport purposes. However, their supply is finite (particularly in the case of petroleum) and their consumption produces atmospheric pollution. The depletion of fossil fuels or a rapid global warming of the atmosphere may eventually force changes in the way developed countries use energy (Lowe 1989).
