The reconstruction of supply chains, torn apart by the collapse of central planning, is a very important task for national economic recovery in all the transition economies but, as Western experience shows, it could be especially germane to economic development at the local and regional level. Using the results of research carried out in Kazakhstan during late 1995 and 1996, we outline the local supply chains which are beginning to emerge and attitudes towards them. The case is made for increased local policy intervention to promote local supply chain development in Kazakhstan and, by implication, elsewhere in the transition economies.</jats:p>",

I argue that this assumption is not appropriate for many applications because the seller may be able and willing to adjust the supply to the bidding. In this paper I address this shortcoming by analyzing a multi-unit auction game between a monopolistic seller who can produce arbitrary quantities at constant unit cost, and oligopolistic bidders. I establish the existence of a subgame-perfect equilibrium for price discriminating and for uniform price auctions. I also show that bidders have an incentive to misreport their true demand in both auction formats, but they do that in different ways and for different reasons. Furthermore, both auction formats are inefficient, but there is no unambiguous ordering among them. Finally, the more competitive the bidders are, the more likely the seller is to prefer uniform pricing over price discrimination, yet increased competition among bidders may or may not enhance efficiency.</jats:p>"

In the South African library environment, the focus is on rectifying serious inequalities in access to libraries and information and to address the demand for a more equitable distribution of library resources. These aspects, as well as economic factors, compel South African librarians to rethink the traditional ways of resource sharing and the development of library collections. The shift is towards an innovative resource‐sharing policy and subsequent formation of strategic alliances and the delivery of articles on demand as an alternative to the purchasing of journals. This involves the establishment of a library catalogue accessible to all and effective request and delivery mechanisms to meet the requirements posed by conditions in South Africa. The capabilities of advanced technology offer powerful means to meet these new challenges faced by libraries in South Africa.</jats:p>",

Plant shoot biomass, leaf area and canopy diameter increased with applied N concentrations ([N]a) up to 60 mg/liter, but higher levels caused significant depressions in all these parameters. Root biomass and plant height were depressed linearly with increases in [N]a. Regardless of final plant biomass, increases in [N]a significantly favored shoot over root growth, with ratios increasing from 1.9 to 5.4 for 15 to 300 mg/liter, respectively.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Soluble salts in the medium, monitored via leachates, increased with N supply and were identified as a key factor involved in the yield reductions observed at the higher [N]a. Leaf N concentration increased with N supply, stabilizing at [N]a above 120 mg/liter; concentrations of 2.6–2.7% were associated with maximum growth. Calcium and iron concentrations in tissue followed the same response pattern as N, but sulfur (S) decreased significantly in an opposite pattern. Other nutrients did not respond to [N]a. Leaf tissue N:S ratios were more closely correlated with plant growth that either N or S alone, with maximum growth observed at a ratio of approximately 6:1. Higher N:S ratios produced sharp yield depressions.</jats:p>",

This framework is used to compare the variance of demand to the variance of replenishment orders at different echelons of the system (e.g., retailer, wholesaler). Empirical data and experience with management games suggest that, in most industries, inventory management policies can have a destabilizing effect by increasing the volatility of demand as it passes up through the chain (the “bullwhip” effect). Our model helps to explain these observations and indicates mechanisms that can promote stabilization. The analysis results also define sufficient conditions for the existence of stabilization and relate these conditions to the optimality of myopic control policies. </jats:p>",

The increasingly globalised status of the majority of late twentieth century economies ensures that remedial action will ultimately require a degree of international cooperation. Although the formulation of environmentally friendly energy policies, including carbon reduction strategies, can be framed at international and national levels, recent trends are for CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reduction measures to be instigated by regional, or local, authorities.This paper focuses on the city-region of Greater Manchester, U.K., and reviews both existing and potential energy supply options for reducing regional CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, highlighting the benefits and obstacles facing carbon reduction measures implemented at a 'local' scale<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>.

In distributed systems, power and data buses take the place of multiple discrete analog wire bundles found in centralized control systems. Distributed modules interconnected with power and data buses control effectors such as hydraulic actuators or solenoid valves and read sensors to measure pressures, temperatures and speeds.

Interface standardization will benefit engine manufacturers by lowering system cost and enabling inter-changeability of distributed engine control components from different suppliers.

It was found that the CSDS did improve drug availability and utilization rates. Further drug use was more rational in the CSDS in terms of prescribed drugs being dispensed and antibiotics being prescribed and dispensed in full course. In other respects the quality of care in CSDS was similar to non-CSDS facilities and was poor. Low staffing levels probably contributed to this. Of particular concern was the inadequate sterilization practices and sterile injection technique in most health facilities (CSDS &amp; non-CSDS).</jats:p>"

We first characterize how most industrial planning systems work, and we then develop a mathematical model to capture some of the key dynamics in the planning process. Our approach is to use a model for a single production stage as a building block for modeling a network of stages. We show how to analyze the single-stage model to determine the production smoothness and stability for a production stage and the inventory requirements. We also show how to optimize the tradeoff between production capacity and inventory for a single stage. We then can model the multistage supply chain using the single stage as a building block. We illustrate the multistage model with an industrial application, and we conclude with some thoughts on a research agenda. </jats:p>",

In the fetal lambs, myocardial supply and flux of fatty acids were zero. In the newborn lambs, the supply of fatty acids increased tenfold, but there was no flux of fatty acids. Carbohydrates were the major energy source in fetal and newborn lambs, accounting for 89 and 69% of myocardial oxygen consumption, respectively. In the juvenile lambs, the flux of fatty acids was increased threefold. The supply and flux of carbohydrates were decreased (by 31 and 82%, respectively). The supply and flux of ketone bodies gradually increased with age. We show that the myocardium of the lamb in vivo does not switch immediately after birth from carbohydrates to fatty acids.
