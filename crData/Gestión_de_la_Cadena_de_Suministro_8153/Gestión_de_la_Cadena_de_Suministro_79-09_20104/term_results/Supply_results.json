Peak-shaving and seasonal supplies will allow a limit to be set to the sales of non-premium interruptible gas required for load balancing. For the long-term, British Gas is developing the capability to make substitute natural gas from a wide range of oil and coal feedstocks.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The development of the British Gas industry has been characterized over the last twenty years by a series of rapid technological changes. Up to the late 1950s, for a period of some 150 years, the industry had produced gas from coal, having started by carbonizing coal in retorts as a method of producing gas for lighting. This fuel had later found application in the home for cooking, space and water-heating and in some specialized uses in industry. However, the process of carbonization had many drawbacks and in the 1950s the industry was in a period of stagnation, losing out to the electricity period of stagnation, losing out to the electricity industry which was paying progressively less than the gas industry for its coal.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>At that time research, which had begun in the 1930s into ways of producing gas from cheaper coals by hydrogenation of the coal and catalytic synthesis of methane, was intensified. New developments were made with the coal-based processes but the immediate breakthrough was in methods for manufacturing town gas from the products of oil refining, such as light distillate oil, which were then becoming available at relatively cheap prices.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In parallel with these advances on the manufacturing side, aided by the impetus of the Clean Mr Act and the trend towards higher heating standards in the home, the gas industry introduced modern, efficient and re-styled gas fires. With an accompanying growth in central heating installations, the gas industry began to expand rapidly. In the early 1960s the international trade in liquefied pipeline was constructed to distribute this gas to pipeline was constructed to distribute this gas to other parts of the country. This was the beginning of what eventually became the high-pressure transmission system covering the whole of the country.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Then came the second major technological revolution. In the mid-1960s, before the changeover from coal to oil-based manufacturing had been completed, natural gas was found in the Southern Basin of the North Sea. It quickly became evident that the natural gas reserves were considerable and the decision was taken to convert the whole industry and its customers to the direct utilization of natural gas. In 1967 the Government published a White Paper on Fuel Policy (Cmnd. 3438) which argued for a policy of rapid absorption to enable the country to benefit as soon as possible from the advantages of this new indigenous primary fuel. In the event, supplies and sales of gas grew fairly closely in accord with the plan set out in the White Paper and the thermal output plan set out in the White Paper and the thermal output nearly quadrupled in ten years as shown in Figure 1. With the discovery of gas in the Northern Basin of the North Sea, annual supply has now reached about 1900 × 10-9 MJ (18 billion therms) and is expected to grow to over 2200 × 10- MJ (21 billion therms) in the early to mid 1980s, making a five to six-fold increase since the mid 1960s.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The successful introduction of this valuable, indigenous energy source has provided Great Britain with a supply of gaseous fuel which is extremely flexible in use and with a wide range of applications to the consumer. The value of the fuel, however, brings a responsibility to ensure that this large but nevertheless finite non-renewable resource is deployed and depleted to the best advantage of the nation. The strategy that has been developed for balancing the supply and demand for gas to achieve this aim is described in this paper.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>THE MATCHING OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>It has been the policy of British Gas ever since natural gas was first introduced to give first priority in the use of available supplies to premium priority in the use of available supplies to premium markets.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

That is why the status of natural gas reserves, worldwide or indigenous, has been in the forefront of just about every long-range energy planning effort. In the United States, almost 30% of our total energy consumption comes from natural gas. It was only 6 years ago, in 1973, that the \"destination embargoes\" put on Arab oil helped focus the public opinion on our dependence on crude oil imports. That energy crisis, however, was not the first one. The following is a direct quote from the Bulletin of American Association of Petroleum Geologists some years back: \". . . It is therefore evident that the people of the United States should be informed as people of the United States should be informed as fully as possible as to the reserves now left in this country, for without such information we cannot appraise our probably dependence upon foreign supplies of oil, on the expanding use of which so much of modern civilization depends.\" Date of the above quote was 1922. The problem then, as the problem now, was limited supply vs increasing demand. problem now, was limited supply vs increasing demand. Surprisingly as was recently pointed out, the solution proposed then was very similar to a solution proposed now: eliminating waste, conservation, proposed now: eliminating waste, conservation, synthetic crude from coal, development of shale oil reserves. The problems we face in energy today have two dimensions as they had over 50 years ago the supply and the demand. Interestingly, the proposals by government agencies 50 years ago and proposals by government agencies 50 years ago and today both address control of the demand and both yet somehow, directly or indirectly, neglect the supply. The background of what actually has happened between the energy crisis of 1922, 1973, and more recently 1979, is not only informative, but significant as well. No commercial shale, or synthetic crude industry from coal has developed. Control of demand through conservation largely has remained rather ineffective. Coal production has not even increased significantly. The only significant and most observable increase was that of production of crude oil and natural gas. In our country, the rate of production increased from 1.3 million B/D in 1922 to almost 8 million B/D in 1978. Present U.S. reserves recently released jointly by API and AGA put recoverable oil at 27.8 billion bbl and proved gas reserves at 200.3 Tcf as of Dec. 31, 1978.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The phenomenal increase in production and increase in recoverable reserves (in 1922, the reserves were reported to be 5 billion bbl) represent the increase in supply that inevitably occurred between 1922 and the present, not having been even suggested or effectively pursued as a remedy to our recurring energy crises.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>It was the private sector, the oil and gas industry operating under sufficient favorable economic incentives and a free market climate, that made it possible to commit the risk capital, to drill end find the reserves that eventually led to our present oil, gas, and petrochemicals industries. As a producer of oil and gas, the United States (with the exclusion of Alaska) has been the most intensively explored petroleum producing region in the world.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Lumina of blood vessels were recognized by the reaction product that was localized within erythrocytes. The outer capsule was well vascularized, but few or no capillaries were seen in the periaxial space. The inner spindle capsule, which closely invests the axial bundle, was rarely contacted by periaxial capillaries at the equator and juxtequator. Capillaries occurred more frequently adjacent to intrafusal fibers at the polar region and beyond the end of the outer capsule. Shorter diffusion distances and, usually, higher capillary densities were found at the polar region than at the spindle midsection. This suggests that transcapillary exchange at the polar segment is nearer to conditions prevalent in extrafusal muscle than elsewhere in the spindle, provided the inner and outer capsules are not less permeable at the poles than at the midsection. Differences in blood supply among mammalian species appear to be related to receptor size.</jats:p>",

It suggests that both may change in response to taxes, i.e., taxes may be shifted partly through the work/leisure choice and partly through work/training choices, and invites comparison of the sizes of the two effects. If the effects of taxes on human capital investment are large, then analysis of the relative efficiency of alternative tax schemes which exclude these effects may be seriously misleading.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The seventies have seen a burgeoning of an empirical literature on labour-leisure choice grounded in the work on the systems approach to the estimation of demand systems which flowered in the sixties. Working with the Klein-Rubin utility function, Betancourt (1973) extended Lluch’s ELES system (1970, 1973) to include the labour-leisure choice. Abbott and Ashenfelter (1976) analysed United States data on hours worked using both the Klein-Rubin and the indirect addilog utility functions (although, unlike Betancourt, they did not endogenize savings). Kiefer (1977) used a Bayesian approach to the estimation of a 7 commodity plus leisure system which imposed only classical restrictions on a Rotterdam model written in logarithmic differentials. He also explored the use of a quadratic indirect utility function as a second order Taylor approximation to an arbitrary nested indirect utility function in which Box/Cox transformations comprise the inner nests (Kiefer, 1975). Phlips (1978) has used an extended Klein-Rubin utility function, in which the real stock of money appears, to integrate the demand for commodities and leisure with the demand for money. Barnett (1979) has imbedded the commodity and leisure demand problem into a version of the Rotterdam model under relatively weak assumptions about preferences. Finally, recent empirical work using Betancourt’s TELES model on Australian data has been reported by Tulpulé (1978).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Eskimo Point, Northwest Territories, is a predominantly Inuit community of about 900 people, located on the west shore of Hudson Bay. Formerly, its water supply was obtained from nearby small, sometimes polluted, shallow lakes, which freeze to the bottom in winter, necessitating an ice-cutting operation. In 1973, a study was undertaken to investigate alternative methods of improving Eskimo Point's water supply. The recommended solution was the construction of a 6 500 000 gal (29 548 350 L) earth fill reservoir, lined with a hypalon membrane.Further field investigations and detailed design of the facility were carried out in 1974. All long-term delivery items were pre-ordered, and a general contractor was selected through public tender. Utilization of local manpower and equipment was specified.Construction commenced in mid-June of 1975 with the contractor providing on-the-job training to local Inuit, who adapted quickly to the equipment. Within 2 weeks, an all-local labour force was working around the clock constructing the reservoir embankments. Placement of a membrane liner of approximately 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) took 1 week, and was followed by placement of a protective layer of fill over the liner. Through good cooperation among owner, supplier, contractor, and engineer, the reservoir was completed in the fall of 1975 in time to be filled with water from a lake approximately 1 mi (1.6 km) away. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Birdsfoot trefoil (<jats:italic>Lotus corniculatus</jats:italic> L.) has both low rates of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation and low levels of root total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) during midsummer regrowth. These observations suggest that reduced assimilate transport to roots may limit N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation and consequently total plant growth. The objective of this study was to determine how rate of growth, as influenced by N supply, affected the distribution and accumulation of photosynthate during regrowth of trefoil. Nutrient solution supplied to well‐nodulated plants grown in sand was either 0 or 1 mM N (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>). Two and 4 weeks after cutting and the start of N treatments, plants were harvested and analyzed. Supplemental N caused a sharp decrease in acetylene reduction rate and a two‐fold increase in shoot dry weight 4 weeks after cutting. However, neither root dry weight nor TNC were significantly affected by supplemental N. Distribution of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C showed reduced amounts of photosynthate accumulated in N supplemented roots at both 2 and 4 weeks after cutting. These data suggest that shoot growth of trefoil is a dominant sink for photosynthate and that photosynthate accumulation is not readily altered by N source or amount supplied. Numerous significant differences in distribution of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C among classes of metabolites were evident only at the 2‐week harvest. More rapid metabolism of labeled sugars into other growth intermediates in N‐supplemented plants at this stage indicates that available soil N may be very important for rapid regrowth after cutting. Four weeks after cutting, when N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation rates had increased several fold, distribution of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C among various metabolites was not influenced by N source indicating little effect of N source on rate of assimilate metabolism in the plant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seven young females were subjected to 24 weeks of intensive endurance training. Adaptive changes in myofibrillary ATP‐ase activity, capillary supply and mitochondrial content were investigated with light‐ and electron microscopy in needle biopsies from the quadriceps femoris. 1. The average value for the maximal oxygen uptake increased from 45.7 to 57.2 (ml . kg‐1 min‐1) (25.2%, P less than 0.005). 2. The average number of capillaries per muscle fibre increased from 1.39 to 1.79 (28.8%, P less than 0.005). Since no significant change in fibre area was found, this suggests that a considerable number of new capillaries have been formed during the training period. 3. An increased capillary supply of all fibre types was found, being greatest for type I and smallest for type IIB. 4. The relative amount of type I fibres before and after the training period was 57.9 and 56.5% respectively (n.s.), for type IIA fibres 26.4 and 31.5% (P less than 0.005), for type IIB fibres 9.2 and 3.4% (P less than 0.005) and for type IIC fibres 0.4 and 2.2% (P less than 0.005). Thus, in the type II group, significant changes in subtypes take place during the endurance training. The data suggest that type IIAB may represent a transitional state between type IIA and IIB. 5. Correlation of capillary supply, myofibrillar ATP‐ase activity and mitochondrial content (determined semiquantitatively of individual muscle fibres indicators that the capillary supply to a given fibre is more closely related to its mitochondrial content than to the fibre type as determined on the basis of myofibrillar ATP‐ase activity.</jats:p>",
