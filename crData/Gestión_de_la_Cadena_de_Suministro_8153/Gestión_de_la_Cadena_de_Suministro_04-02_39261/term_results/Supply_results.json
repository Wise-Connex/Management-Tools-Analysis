      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper contends that the description of tiering within automotive supply chains is likely to require redefining in light of the development of modular supply and that a natural consequence of modular supply will be the transfer of value‐adding activity throughout the supply chain. Two concepts are presented to illustrate the characteristics that are likely to be required for suppliers to succeed within a modular environment. These concepts are applied to a supply chain currently in the process of accommodating modular supply. The findings suggest that whilst modularity accrues a number of tangible benefits to both the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) buyer and the modular supplier, the skills required to become a modular supplier are likely to result in a number of first‐tier suppliers either exiting the industry or becoming second or third‐tier suppliers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite its infancy, some authors are already suggesting that the writing may be on the wall for supply chain collaboration. It has been reported that supply chain collaboration has proved difficult to implement; there has been an over‐reliance on technology in trying to implement it; a failure to understand when and with whom to collaborate; and fundamentally a lack of trust between trading partners. This paper proposes that a supply chain segmentation approach, based on customer buying behaviour and service needs, is the most appropriate context for collaboration. The paper also proposes the need for a greater understanding of the elements that make up supply chain collaboration, and in particular how the relevant cultural, strategic and implementation elements inter‐relate with each other.</jats:p>",

This requires innovative new stormwater facilities in urban areas. Besides hydraulic requirements for retention and infiltration capacity, the pollutants contained in the runoff water are of primary importance in future stormwater drainage concepts. Different urban surfaces are classified according to their potential for pollutant wash-off and the most crucial substances in view of hazardous effects in the aquatic and terrestrial environment are identified. Source control of hazardous pollutants by choosing alternative materials for the construction of buildings, roads and vehicles is considered to be most sustainable but will only be effective on a longterm perspective. In addition, new facilities for decentralized hydraulic retention combined with barrier systems for the most hazardous substances are proposed allowing for ecologically safe discharge of the stormwater into the local environment. Soil passage and new adsorber systems in the form of different granular adsorbents have been investigated and turned out to represent efficient retention systems which can well be integrated into infiltration and hydraulic retention facilities. It is suggested that the structures for stormwater handling are integrated into local landscaping in the surrounding of buildings in the form of ponds, reed-beds, ditches, etc. creating attractive blue-green environments.</jats:p>",

Two carbohydrates, i.e. glucose and sucrose, in wastewater were respectively acidified by dark fermentation at pH 5.5 with 6–6.6 hours of hydraulic retention in a 3-l fermentor, producing an effluent containing mostly acetate and butyrate, and a methane-free biogas comprising mostly hydrogen. The acidified effluent was then further treated by photo fermentation for hydrogen production. The overall yield based on the substrate consumed was 31–32%, i.e. 17–18% for dark fermentation and 14% for photo fermentation. It was found that under certain dark fermentation conditions, hydrogen-producing sludge was agglutinated into granules, resulting in a higher biomass density and increased volumetric hydrogen production efficiency. DNA-based analysis of microbial communities revealed that the respective predominant bacteria were Clostridium in dark fermentation and Rhodobacter in photo fermentation. Further investigations are warranted, particularly, in areas such as improving reactor design, treating protein and lipid rich wastewaters, and studying sludge granulation mechanisms and controlling factors.</jats:p>",

Pre-coagulation/sedimentation process efficiently removed the suspended solids including organic matter and phosphorus. Comparison of the hybrid MBR and conventional MBR was made in terms of the permeate quality and membrane fouling. As the organic loading to the MBR was significantly reduced by the pre-coagulation/sedimentation, production and accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) may be limited. Therefore, the mixed liquor viscosity in the hybrid MBR was much lower than that in the conventional MBR. These effect caused by pre-coagulation/sedimentation brought a remarkable improvement in both permeate quality and membrane permeability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Disinfection by-products have been regulated in finished drinking waters in the United States since 1979. The original regulations dealt only with trihalomethanes, but more recent rules also address haloacetic acids. Compliance with these regulations has traditionally been based on a running annual average of quarterly measurements of disinfection by-products in the distribution system and on concerns about adverse health effects associated with chronic exposure to these by-products. More recently, concerns have also been focused on short-term exposure and acute reproductive and developmental adverse health effects. Additionally, while compliance has previously been based on disinfection by-product levels in samples collected primarily at locations with average distribution system residence times, forthcoming regulations will base compliance on disinfection by-product levels in samples collected at locations with maximum trihalomethane and haloacetic acid concentrations. Moreover, instead of the maximum contaminant levels applying to the annual average of all distribution system samples, the new rules will require that the annual average of the regulated disinfection by-product concentrations at each monitoring location be less than their respective maximum contaminant levels. This paper reviews the evolution of disinfection by-product regulations in the United States and on the rationale behind these regulations.</jats:p>",

An enhanced primary treatment process based on coarse media filtration is analysed. A high-rate secondary wastewater treatment process has specifically been investigated, consisting of a highly loaded moving bed biofilm reactor directly followed by a coagulation and floc separation step. The objective with this high-rate process is to meet secondary treatment effluent standards at a minimum use of chemicals, minimum sludge production and minimum footprint. It is demonstrated that the biofilm in the bioreactor mainly deals with the soluble organic matter while coagulation deals with the colloidal matter. The bioreactor may, therefore, be designed based on the soluble COD loading only, resulting in a very compact plant when a compact biomass/floc separation reactor (i.e. flotation or direct filtration) is used. The paper reports specifically on the coagulant choice in flotation and filter run time in direct filtration.</jats:p>",

The Internet has also brought about a revolution in supply chain thinking. Progress toward complete inter‐enterprise integration is measured in years and even decades. In this article, we discuss both the visions firms have for using enterprise systems for supply chain management, and the actual reality of current implementation.

Current practices of subjecting the total water demands of urban communities to the levels of treatment required for drinking water are not sustainable indefinitely, and viable alternative strategies for ensuring adequate supplies of potable water are essential. Given the inherent advantages of flexibility and responsiveness associated with decentralization of complex functions and operations, one logical alternative might be the strategic dispersal of flexible advanced treatment and control technologies throughout urban water transport and storage networks. Integration of multiple satellite systems of this type with the critical components of existing systems and infrastructures in densely populated urban environments would facilitate optimal cost-effective applications of highly sophisticated advanced technologies. It would, moreover, do so entirely within the context of water and waste treatment and distribution/collection systems and infrastructures already in place in most densely populated urban regions. Finally, it would provide markedly enhanced “personal water” quality and significant potential for energy recovery.</jats:p>",

The key to finding the correct product is an holistic assessment that takes into account not only the underlying problems but also the individual’s needs, life style and preferences.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Decentralized wastewater management (DWM) may be defined as the collection, treatment, and reuse of wastewater from individual homes, clusters of homes, subdivisions, and isolated commercial facilities at or near the point of waste generation. In some areas, the liquid portion could be transported to a central point for further treatment and reuse. At the time of writing (2002), more than sixty million people in the United States live in homes where individual decentralized systems are used for wastewater management. Further, the U.S. EPA now estimates that about 40 percent of the new homes being built are served with onsite systems. In the early 1970s, with the passage of the Clean Water Act, it was often stated that it was only a matter of time before sewerage facilities would be available to almost all residents of the continental United States. Now, more than 25 years later, it is recognized that complete sewerage of the entire U.S. may never be possible, due to both geographic and economic constraints. Because complete sewerage is unlikely in the foreseeable future, it is clear that DWM systems are needed for the protection of public health and the environment and for the development of long-term strategies for the management of our water resources. The challenges and opportunities for DWM systems in the twenty-first century are discussed in this paper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a preset oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) was employed to regulate oxygen dosing for online sulfide toxicity control during anaerobic treatment of high sulfate wastewater. The experiment was conducted in an upflow anaerobic reactor (UAF), which was operated at a constant influent total organic carbon (TOC) of 6740 mg/L (equivalent to a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 18000 mg/L) but with different influent sulfates of 1000, 3000 and 6000 mg/L. The reactor was initially run without oxygen injection at a natural ORP of about −290 to −300 mV and then was followed by oxygenation to raise ORP by +25 mV above the natural level for each influent sulfate level. With 1000 and 3000 mg/L influent sulfates, the produced sulfide levels did not impose any appreciable toxicity to methanogens even without oxygen injection. However, with 6000 mg/L influent sulfate without oxygen injections, the dissolved sulfide level quickly went up to over 800 mg/L which imposed a significant suppression on methanogenesis. Upon oxygen injection to raise the ORP by +25 mV, the dissolved sulfide was quickly reduced to 160 mg/L. If more oxygen was injected to raise the ORP by +50 mV, then dissolved sulfide further decreased to 12.2 mg/L with a concomitant improvement in methane yield by 45.9%.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With a +25 mV preset ORP increase, it was found that at the 1000 mg/L influent sulfate the supplied oxygen was more than that needed for sulfide oxidation. The excess oxygen could be utilized readily by facultative heterotrophs for organic oxidation, which contributed 13.5% of the total COD removal in the UAF. At the higher sulfate levels of 3000 and 6000 mg/L, the facultative contributions to the total COD removal were only 4.7 and 4.1%, respectively. This study has clearly demonstrated that ORP is a workable and reliable means for regulating oxygen injection to achieve online sulfide toxicity control in a single-stage anaerobic system treating high sulfate wastewater.</jats:p>",

Floc density was determined by measuring floc settling velocity and spherical equivalent floc diameter. The floc density function proposed by Tambo and Watanabe could be applied to PSI. Flocs formed by PSI showed higher floc density than those formed by alum at the same floc size. Floc size distribution after the rapid mixing as also determined. PSI could produce well-grown flocs at the stirring speed of 300 rpm. Stirring at 300 rpm for 7 minutes, residual turbidity after 15 minute sedimentation became lower than rapid mixing at 120 rpm for 5 minutes followed by slow mixing at 40 rpm for 25 minutes. Flocs formed by PSI was much stronger than those formed by alum. Using the data obtained, the design parameters of flocculator by use of PSI were estimated following Tambo and WatanabeÕs procedure. According to the estimation, it was suggested that rapid mixing process alone can make well-grown flocs and slow mixing process, which is essential for the conventional water purification system using aluminium coagulants, can be eliminated by use of PSI.</jats:p>",

Thawed RBC must have the glycerol removed, but the recovered cells have normal survival in humans. Freezing has been used to store RBC of rare phenotypes for more than 40 years. In the 1960s and 1970s, when medical technology and blood use were expanding rapidly and liquid whole blood and RBC storage were limited to 3 weeks, many attempts were made to expand the use of frozen RBC for meeting the needs for a stable blood supply and to have RBC reserves for emergencies. These attempts have largely been abandoned because of the cost of freezing, storing and processing, better management of the larger and longer lived RBC inventory, concerns about the safety of stored RBC that have not received the most up‐to‐date testing and the losses associated with the short shelf life of thawed RBC. New automated frozen RBC processing systems will potentially allow extending the outdate of thawed RBC to 2 weeks, but will not materially effect the costs or losses associated with the use of frozen RBC. RBC freezing will have little effect on the logistics of blood supply.</jats:p>",

The paper discusses the use of IEMPs to manage processes across the supply chain based on a critical literature review and a case study research approach. In order to illustrate different views within an IEMP supply‐chain network, three industry case studies – the chemical, retail and maritime industries – were conducted. Several interviews with both IEMP users and market makers were completed.

These emerging agents pose threats not only to the general human population but also to recipients of blood transfusions. Indeed, the modern era of blood safety perhaps began with the recognition of HIV as an emerging agent transmissible by blood transfusion. Today, emerging infectious agents that pose a threat to the blood supply are not limited to viruses, but include bacterial, protozoan, and prion agents. Preventing the transmission of these new agents by blood transfusion is often problematic, as the available tools may be inadequate. It is certain, however, that new agents will continue to emerge as threats to blood safety and these agents are likely to require novel approaches to prevent their transmission. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we address the problem of choosing the appropriate reverse channel structure for the collection of used products from customers. Specifically, we consider a manufacturer who has three options for collecting such products: (1) she can collect them herself directly from the customers, (2) she can provide suitable incentives to an existing retailer (who already has a distribution channel) to induce the collection, or (3) she can subcontract the collection activity to a third party. Based on our observations in the industry, we model the three options described above as decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. When considering decentralized channels, we find that ceteris paribus, the agent, who is closer to the customer (i.e., the retailer), is the most effective undertaker of product collection activity for the manufacturer. In addition, we show that simple coordination mechanisms can be designed such that the collection effort of the retailer and the supply chain profits are attained at the same level as in a centrally coordinated system. </jats:p>",

The reason for this attention is that a newly developed superconducting magnet can be used to easily generate a high magnetic field, under which even weakly paramagnetic materials can be separated at high efficiency. We have developed a new wastewater treatment process using magnetic gel particles containing immobilized microorganisms and magnetic particles. The magnetic gel particles are separated and recovered from the effluent in water and wastewater treatment processes, and are then recycled to a bioreactor directly or reused after storing. In this research, a novel type of magnetic separator without a filter matrix was designed for the separation and recovery of magnetic gel particles with different magnetic characteristics. No backwashing is required for this new type of separator. By using the separator, polyethylene glycol (PEG) gel particles with 2% magnetite were continuously separated and recovered from the PEG gel particles with 0.04% magnetite at an efficiency of around 90%. The PEG gel particles containing nitrifying bacteria and magnetic particles were available for the oxidation of ammonia solution at a slightly lower nitrification rate than the PEG gel particles with nitrifying bacteria but without magnetite.</jats:p>",

Laboratory jar tests were conducted using the raw sewage and the alum sludge taken from a local sewage treatment works with variations in sludge dosages, aging times and pH conditions. It has been found that adding alum sludge at dosage around 20 mg/l as Al to the sewage can increase the SS removal by more than 20% and the COD removal by at least 15%, compared with the control tests without alum sludge addition. The pH of sewage, adjusted from 5 to 9, had little impact on the SS and COD removal induced by the alum sludge. However, the alum sludge aging time substantially affected the SS and COD removal. Experiment results suggested that sweep flocculation and physical adsorption play the key roles in enhancing both SS and COD removal from the raw sewage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> While every firm in a supply chain bears supply risk (the cost of insufficient supply), some firms may, even with wholesale price contracts, completely avoid inventory risk (the cost of unsold inventory). With a push contract there is a single wholesale price and the retailer, by ordering his entire supply before the selling season, bears all of the supply chain's inventory risk. A pull contract also has a single wholesale price, but the supplier bears the supply chain's inventory risk because only the supplier holds inventory while the retailer replenishes as needed during the season. (Examples include Vendor Managed Inventory with consignment and drop shipping.) An advance-purchase discount has two wholesale prices: a discounted price for inventory purchased before the season, and a regular price for replenishments during the selling season. Advance-purchase discounts allow for intermediate allocations of inventory risk: The retailer bears the risk on inventory ordered before the season while the supplier bears the risk on any production in excess of that amount. This research studies how the allocation of inventory risk (via these three types of wholesale price contracts) impacts supply chain efficiency (the ratio of the supply chain's profit to its maximum profit). It is found that the efficiency of a single wholesale price contract is considerably higher than previously thought as long as firms consider both push and pull contracts. In other words, the literature has exaggerated the value of implementing coordinating contracts (i.e., contracts that achieve 100% efficiency, such as buy-backs or revenue sharing) because coordinating contracts are compared against an inappropriate benchmark (often just a push contract). Furthermore, if firms also consider advance-purchase discounts, which are also simple to administer, then the coordination of the supply chain and the arbitrary allocation of its profit is possible. Several limitations of advance-purchase discounts are discussed. </jats:p>",

This treatment process consumes a large quantity of coagulants, and its optimum pH operation range is rather narrow. This treatment process produces huge amounts of sludge and is hard to operate due to the unstable characteristics of the abrasive slurry of CMP wastewater. The purpose of this research is to establish a pilot plant which consists of chemical pretreatment, ceramic membrane microfiltration, carbon filtration and reverse osmosis system, which will allow the reclamation of the CMP wastewater. Actual CMP wastewater was sampled and treated in the pilot plant. The results of the pilot tests demonstrated the viability of the treatment scheme and provided data for scale-up calculations. Cost per ton of CMP wastewater reclaimed was calculated using the operating data established, and compared with the conventional chemical coagulation and sedimentation process.</jats:p>",

In this study, the performance of the pilot-scale submerged membrane bioreactor coupled with sequencing batch reactor (SM-SBR) was investigated. The reactor was operated in sequencing batch modes with a 3-hour cycles consisting of anoxic and aerobic conditions to treat organics, nitrogen and phosphorus. Despite large fluctuations in influent conditions, COD removal was found to be higher than 95%. Sufficient nitrification was obtained within a few weeks after start-up and during the stable period. Moreover, complete nitrification occurred despite of short aeration time. Total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was up to 85%. The insufficient organic loading caused by the membrane fouling led to the increase of HRT, leading to endogenous respiration and/or deactivation of nitrifying microorganisms. DGGE patterns confirmed the shift in microbial community structure. The ammonia-oxidizers (i.e. Nitrospira) became dominant in the mixed liquor during long-term operations. Nitrification and denitrification processes were greatly affected by the temperature, while organic removal and phosphorus removal efficiencies were relatively stable below 15°C.</jats:p>",

The diffusion approach is applied to two recent cases of implementations of IT supply chain innovations at two aerospace firms, both with complex, global, inter‐firm supply chains. Results indicate that several social and organizational factors do affect the implementation's success. Those factors include users’ perceptions of the innovation, the firm's culture, the types of communication channels used to diffuse knowledge of the innovation and various leadership factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research with a laboratory prototype and at the pilot scale documents that the hydrogen-based hollow-fiber Membrane-Biofilm Reactor (MBfR) is technically and economically feasible for reduction of nitrate and perchlorate. In the MBfR, H2 gas diffuses through the wall of a composite membrane, and an autotrophic biofilm naturally develops on the outside of the membrane, where the bacteria's electron acceptor is an oxidized contaminant (e.g., NO3− or ClO4−) supplied from the water. The hydrogen pressure to the hollow fibers is a key control parameter that can be adjusted rapidly and easily. For denitrification, partial nitrate removal often is acceptable, and the hydrogen pressure can be low to minimize the costs of H2 supply and the concentration of H2 in the effluent. When perchlorate must be reduced, full nitrate removal is essential, since NO3−-N above about 0.2 mg/L slows perchlorate reduction. Perchlorate reduction is sensitive to the hydrogen pressure, which underscores the critical role of H2 pressure for controlling process performance. Given that H2-oxidizing microorganisms have the potential to reduce many oxidized contaminants, we hypothesize that and are beginning to test how well the MBfR reduces bromate, selenate, chlorinated solvents, and other oxidized contaminants.</jats:p>",

We employ a dynamic OLS panel estimator to investigate the relative importance of demand and supply influences on the exchange rates of these countries. Our analysis shows that both supply‐ and demand‐side effects are important for the accession countries, although their overall effect on inflation differentials and competitiveness seems to be small. An additional focus of the paper is the examination of the role that administrated, or regulated, prices and the productivity of the distribution sector play in the real exchange rate dynamics. Using a unique database we show that administrative prices have been a powerful force behind price and real exchange developments for our group of accession countries. The distribution sector is shown to have an independent effect on the internal price ratio over and above that generated by the Balassa–Samuelson effect.</jats:p>",

However, very little data are available on the medium‐ and long‐term trends. This paper describes blood product use in a United Kingdom Hospital Trust in 1999 and combines it with donor information to project the effect of demographic changes on demand and supply over the next 25 years. Overall, 2801 (4%) inpatients received transfusions of blood products. The proportion of inpatients receiving blood products increased with age. Patients aged &gt;70 years used 46% of the total blood product supply, whereas patients aged &lt;30 years used 10%. The estimated total cost associated with blood product use was £2 million during 1999 (2001–2002 prices). The results show that within 20 years, demand for blood products is expected to increase by 20% relative to the supply. The estimates in this study are a valuable aid to better long‐term planning of supplies. As there is a paucity of data concerning blood product use in UK hospitals and blood use varies greatly between hospitals, further studies are required to guide blood product use policy.</jats:p>",

The assessment is based on analyses of sediment trap collections from 10 sites over the spring to fall interval of two years. Temporal and spatial patterns in sediment deposition are demonstrated to be driven by resuspension/redeposition processes. Sediment that had been resuspended and redeposited represented 80 to 96 percent, on average, of the depositing solids collected along the main axis of the lake. About 90 percent of the redeposited sediment was inorganic. Increased resuspension caused by drawdown of the reservoir surface and fall turnover resulted in 10 to 50‐fold increases in deposition rates compared to levels observed when the reservoir was full and strongly thermally stratified. Elevated levels of redeposition from resuspension in the reservoir have been driven by both higher water column concentrations of suspended solids and settling velocities. Recurring longitudinal and lateral gradients in resuspension are delineated, establishing that resuspended solids are transported from the riverine to the lacustrine zone and from near‐shore to pelagic areas. Resuspension is demonstrated to cause increases in inanimate particle (tripton) concentrations. Higher tripton levels have been observed in years with greater drawdown. Water quality impacts of the resuspension phenomenon are considered.</jats:p>",

This paper presents an investigation into sediment transport processes in a short‐duration, high‐discharge event in the Burdekin River, a large sand‐ and gravel‐bed river in the monsoon‐ and cyclone‐influenced, semi‐arid tropics of north Queensland. The Burdekin's discharge is highly variable and strongly seasonal, with a recorded maximum of 40 400 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Sediment was sampled systematically across an 800 m wide, 12 m deep and straight reach using Helley‐Smith bedload and US P‐61 suspended sediment samplers over 16 days of a 29‐day discharge event in February and March 2000 (peak 11 155 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). About 3·7 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> tonnes of suspended sediment and 3 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> tonnes of bedload are estimated to have been transported past the sample site during the flow event. The sediment load was predominantly supply limited. Wash load included clay, silt and very fine sand. The concentration of suspended bed material (including very coarse sand) varied with bedload transport rate, discharge and height above the bed. Bedload transport rate and changes in channel shape were greatest several days after peak discharge. Comparison between these data and sparse published data from other events on this river shows that the control on sediment load varies between supply limited and hydraulically limited transport, and that antecedent weather is an important control on suspended sediment concentration. Neither the empirical relationships widely used to estimate suspended sediment concentrations and bedload (e.g. Ackers &amp; White, 1973) nor observations of sediment transport characteristics in ephemeral streams (e.g. Reid &amp; Frostick, 1987) are directly applicable to this river.</jats:p>",

HNLC waters have mainly been studied using shipboard and lab experiments. Since 1997, remote‐sensing of phytoplankton via SeaWiFS Ocean Color has permitted monitoring of the constancy of this “HNLC condition,” i.e., spatial homogeneity and low temporal variability of chlorophyll over annual cycles. These trends can be exploited, as episodic iron inputs should be conspicuous by subsequent expression as iron‐elevated algal stocks. Subantarctic (SA) waters near New Zealand are HNLC, and the proximity of the arid Australian landmass, and the iron‐rich Subtropical Front, provide natural laboratories to detect episodic atmospheric and oceanic iron supply, respectively. Two approaches were used: Oceanic supply was inferred from episodic increases in chlorophyll concentrations in SA waters, detected using Ocean Color archives. Additional archives were used to confirm the oceanic provenance of iron supply, and identify supply mechanism(s). Atmospheric supply was assessed using data on source areas and loads for dust storms monitored in central Australia. Dust transport and its fate was assessed using air mass forward trajectories and SeaWiFS Ocean Color and Aerosol Optical Depth maps. During 1997–2001, episodic elevated chlorophyll events occurred in SA waters southeast of New Zealand. There was no evidence of these events being mediated by atmospheric iron supply; however, neither wind‐driven lateral advection or vertical mixing alone could account for these episodes. Dust storms, over this period sent plumes either into high iron SubTropical (ST) waters or into SA waters in early spring, when cells are probably light‐ rather than iron‐limited.</jats:p>",

This distributed power supply system can meet the multiple‐quality electric power requirements of customers, and ensures voltage stability and UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) functions as well. Each subsystem of this distributed power supply contributes to the above‐mentioned system performance with its own excellent characteristics. Moreover, the response characteristics of this system are confirmed by simulation with PSIM software, and, using collaborative operation under the EMAP model, the required capacity of SMES to compensate the fluctuation of both PV output and load demand is examined by simulation, using MATLAB/Simulink. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The circuit is fabricated in 0.18‐μm RF CMOS process and it has a phase noise of −95 dBc/Hz at 1‐MHz offset and a very low power consumption of 2.5 mW from a 1.8‐V supply, excluding the output buffers. The effect of supply voltage on the VCO tuning range and the ways to optimize VCO operation in the SONET system are also investigated. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>We collected invertebrate drift samples and stomach contents of native Bonneville cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki utah and nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in Beaver Creek, Idaho, during August 1995 to assess food availability and the potential for competition. Regardless of whether samples came from beaver pond or from high-gradient or low-gradient reaches, aquatic Diptera numerically dominated drifting invertebrates by at least fivefold over all other categories captured in 1-h drift samples. Abundances and drift densities of drifting invertebrates were high in the three reach habitat types sampled: beaver pond (3,152 individuals; 18.9 invertebrates/m3), high-gradient reach (5,216 individuals; 26.5 invertebrates/m3), and low-gradient reach (4,908 individuals; 17.2 invertebrates/m3). Cutthroat trout consumed significantly more invertebrates per individual than did brook trout. However, there was no relationship between fish length and consumption. Diets of both brook and cutthroat trout were dominated by Diptera in beaver ponds and terrestrial invertebrates in the high-gradient reach. In the low-gradient reach, Diptera dominated brook trout diets, whereas both Diptera and terrestrial invertebrates dominated diets of cutthroat trout. Both trout species consistently selected terrestrial invertebrates and Trichoptera in all reach types. Diet overlap between brook and cutthroat trout was 92% in beaver ponds, 75% in the high-gradient reach, and 65% in the low-gradient reach. The high degree of diet overlap suggests the possibility of competition between nonnative brook trout and cutthroat trout if food should become limiting, but we found little evidence that food was limiting during late summer in Beaver Creek.</jats:p>",
