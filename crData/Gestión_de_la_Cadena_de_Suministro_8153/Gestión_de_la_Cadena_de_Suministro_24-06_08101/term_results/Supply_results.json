One of the peculiarities of running a business in the XXI century is the fierce competition between companies, felt at international level. In these conditions, the traditional operations and processes of the supply chain no longer meet the complex requirements of today’s economy, and the implementation of leading-edge solutions is necessary. The use of new technologies in the supply chain can respond quickly to current business demands. Thus, a smart supply chain provides opportunities, creates added value, but also contributes to the creation of a strategic competitive advantage. The aim of this paper is to highlight the supply chain technological transformation possibilities, their benefits, challenges, limits and barriers. The need for knowledge, analysis and implementation of new technologies in supply chains is absolute, dictated by the omnipresent acceleration of change</jats:p>"

Changing hazard situations arise from climate change, digitisation, and changing conditions in the power supply, among other things. Risk and crisis management adapted to the hazard situation can increase the resilience of the piped drinking water supply. Analogous to the risk management system, this article describes a methodology that ranges from hazard analysis with the prioritisation of 57 individual hazards to vulnerability assessment with the help of balance sheet structure models (BSM) and the planning and implementation of measures to increase the resilience of the piped drinking water supply in a targeted manner. The work steps mentioned build on each other and were tested using the case study of a water supply company in Saxony (Germany). As a result, priority hazards are identified, the remaining supply periods and replacement and emergency water requirements are determined as part of the vulnerability assessment, and finally, planning principles for increasing resilience are documented. The methodology focuses primarily on practicable application by water supply companies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>How and why is power used in humanitarian projects? Coordinating organizations, such as UN agencies, carry power and influence over NGOs to advance the interests of beneficiaries. However, coordination can be managed by a single authority or by multiple authorities that share or delegate responsibilities. Furthermore, coordinators may leverage different types of power, including non‐mediated forms like referent and expert power, or mediated forms such as reward, legitimate, or coercive power. This research draws upon 57 interviews regarding organizational behavior with members of international and local non‐governmental organizations (NGOs), UN agencies, and government officials involved in managing Rohingya refugee camps in Southern Bangladesh. The observations suggest that in single‐authority layered projects, referent and expert powers are commonly employed, leading to improvements in quality and delivery performance. Reward power is typically wielded informally and is linked to cost performance. In dual‐layered projects, legitimate power is used to enhance quality and delivery performance. This article's originality lies in its extension of the use of power to multi‐tiered supply chain settings; its contribution is to organizational theory regarding the resolution of principal‐agent issues; and its insights are into the nuanced effects of different types of power based on project types. It offers valuable guidance to policymakers and practitioners, highlighting effective approaches for coordinating inter‐organizational efforts in challenging and unconventional supply chain settings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global movement of inputs, raw materials, products, and the marketing of products requires the use of supply chains. Green logistics refers to the set of policies and measures aimed at reducing the environmental impacts generated by logistics activities. The traditional supply chain has a certain inability to adapt to the rules agreed in Coop 15. The Green Supply Chain deals with the distribution flows of goods with a view to generating low environmental impact. The Green Supply Chain (GSC) involves aspects of reducing negative impacts throughout the logistics chain, from raw material suppliers, production to the distribution of the product to the customer. In this way, this article seeks to identify the factors that generate negative impacts in the traditional Supply Chain, thus helping to decarbonize it, and create a path for the development of the GSC and thus avoid interruptions in the distribution flow due to not meeting environmental targets. The main problem in decarbonizing the Supply Chain is its difficulty in complying with the rules agreed by the nations in COOP 15. To this end, a systematic literature review was carried out based on the available literature. Based on various articles and books, the parameters that define a Green Supply Chain and the factors that generate environmental impacts in conventional chains were identified. As a result, it was possible to verify a positive relationship between the carbon emission reduction factors that are linked to the supply chain performance factors found in the literature. Of the factors relating to the decarbonization of supply chains, some were more clearly related, such as reducing carbon emissions, reducing environmental risks and the ability to operate using new technologies. Future research could build on the limitations of this study.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The major aim of this study was to analyze the effect of supply chain integration and performance of food and beverages manufacturing firms in Kenya.\r\nMethodology: The study adopted a cross-sectional survey. The target population was senior procurement managers from 246 food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya. A sample size of 150 respondents was determined using Krejcie and Morgan (1970). The sample was selected using simple random sampling. Pilot study of 10% of sample size was conducted consisting 15 firms and 13 questionnaires were returned. The researcher used semi-structured and self-administration questionnaires. 135 questionnaires were distributed to respondents but only 119 questionnaires were returned. Data analysis was done through descriptive statistics by use of mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis. Inferential statistics was also done by use of correlation, regression and hypothesis testing. The data obtained was processed using SPSS version 28. Data was presented by use of tables. The reliability results indicates that all the variables meet the threshold of a Cronbach’s alpha value of above 0.7. Validity was also tested using content, construct and criterion.\r\nResults: Supply chain integration and performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya had a significant and positive relationship (R2=.491, p =.000), according to the data. This meant that supply chain integration enhances performance of Kenyan food and beverage manufacturers. Supply chain integration and performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya revealed a positive and statistically significant relationship (R2=.491), according to the study. As a result, supply chain integration accounted for 49.1 percent of the variation in food and beverage manufacturing firm’s performance.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: Process Theory may be used to anchor future studies in the manufacturing sector. The study recommended that managers of companies that manufacture food and beverages develop procedures and policies that link to a superior understanding of the client in order to meet their expectations, even though the existing theory was validated. The study suggests that regulators overseeing the food and beverage industry should develop policies that permit manufacturers to collaborate with third parties, thereby mitigating losses that could affect the productivity of these companies and ultimately the whole economy. According to the report, in order to improve performance, the government should ensure that supply chain integration in Kenyan food and beverage manufacturing companies grows and develops in a more methodical manner. Furthermore, in order to determine how supply chain integration affects the productivity of other manufacturing sectors in the economy, empirical study must be done.</jats:p>"

While automation offers efficiency gains, the interaction between humans and automated systems presents behavioral challenges. This study investigates how decision-makers in SCP processes learn to correct errors when interacting with automated demand forecasting systems versus human planners. Drawing from psychology and behavioral theories, we examine the effects of interaction type (automated system vs. human) on learning, operationalized as performance improvement over time. Further, we analyze whether this relationship is moderated by cognitive psychological traits (positive attitude towards technology, technology anxiety/dependence) and socio-psychological traits (social influence based on subjective norms, social influence based on image) of the human decision-maker. Our article contributes to supply chain management research by introducing automation-human interaction, providing a temporal learning perspective on performance, and integrating cognitive and socio-psychological moderators. Insights are offered on how to facilitate effective human-automation collaboration by managing socio-psychological influences. Limitations and future research opportunities, including cultural contexts and artificial intelligence, are discussed.</jats:p>"

Weather has a significant impact on the demand for various products in many sectors. Firms dealing in those products often face problems in demand management. Hence, managing supply chains under the weather risk is very important and challenging. To improve the performance of supply chains of weather-sensitive products, the main objective of the research is to design new classes of contract that can outperform the widely used supply chain contracts, such as wholesale, buyback, and revenue sharing contracts, and trade credit contracts. To design those new classes of contract, the research investigates: (1) coordination mechanisms of both risk-neutral and risk-averse supply chain members, (2) implementation of weather rebates based on Cooling Degree Days (CDD)/Heating Degree Days (HDD), which are the underlying assets for the temperature-based weather derivatives traded on the financial market, and (3) investigating how weather rebate and financial hedging strategies can be implemented to improve the supply chain performance. The design of new classes of contract involves three aspects: modeling a firm's objective under risk, modeling the payoff from weather derivatives, and designing the supply chain parameters. A firm's objective under risk is measured by using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) approach. The supply chain parameters are designed such that the contracts coordinate with a Pareto-improving solution for both parties involved in the contract.\nThe study has many contributions.

This study assessed the WTP for improved drinking water in the department of Souk-Ahras (Algeria), using contingent valuation survey data of 5,342 households, with a response rate of 10.86% (greater than 10% of each municipality's total number of subscribers). Then, Probit and Tobit models were applied to analyze the determinants of WTP. The results show that the majority of respondents (62.84%) testified that they were not satisfied with the quality of the service provided in terms of quantity and quality of the water distributed. This research revealed that the WTP for an improved water supply service was approximately 16.18 Algerian dinar (DZD)/m3 (approximately 0.11 US$/m3) instead of the current tariff (6.3 DZD/m3–0.04 US$ /m3). With this new water tariff, the average water charge for a household is around 1.37% of the average monthly income.</jats:p>",

The findings highlight that geopolitical risks, such as political instability, conflicts, terrorism, and trade disputes, can disrupt maritime supply chains in numerous ways. These disruptions can be apparent as port closures, commotions like shipping routes, increased insurance expenses, and heightened security dealings. Such disruptions have extensive significance including amplified costs, abridged reliability, supply chain blockages, and a negative influence on international trade streams. The novelty of the study is that it takes a regional approach, inspecting how geopolitical risk influences the maritime supply chain in different geographical areas.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Disruptions can start at one supplier in the supply network and ripple through, impacting other suppliers and firms, known as cascading disruptions. This research analyzes the effect of supply network modularity on cascading disruptions. Modularity measures the degree to which a supply network can be divided into self‐contained sub‐networks and has different effects on supply network resilience. A highly modular supply network prevents cascading disruptions from spreading through the whole network because of the lack of bridges between modules (lack of inter‐module connectivity). Hence, the size of cascading disruptions—measured by the number of suppliers impacted by a cascading disruption—in highly modular supply networks tends to be smaller than the size of cascading disruptions in less modular supply networks. However, the high level of internal connectivity within a module (excessive intra‐module connectivity) acts as an incubator for cascading disruptions. This means a small disruption in a modular network may impact fewer suppliers (i.e., smaller cascading size) but with higher severity measured by service level. Finally, building upon the theoretical concept of nexus suppliers, this research proposes a new predictive model to identify the operational nexus suppliers whose disruptions would considerably impact focal firms' operations. The model's accuracy is empirically tested on real‐world global supply networks involving 2598 unique firms and suppliers across 51 countries and 111 industries. The model identifies nexus suppliers with 95% accuracy, allowing managers and policymakers to plan for mitigation strategies proactively.</jats:p>",

The efforts carried out by this farmer group include the procurement of tea ingredients, the provision of production facilities, the cultivation and maintenance of tea plants, the processing of agricultural products and trade in general. Processed organic tea products, such as green, black, yellow, and roasted, are produced.   Farmer groups have uncertain orders that can only be fulfilled partially, which can still affect customer satisfaction. In total, there are 95.39% of uncertain orders that can be fulfilled in the period August 2021 – March 2022. This is related to production planning with actual production caused by uncertain or regular supply of raw materials. If the collection of raw material supply is still carried out, it causes cost losses in collecting raw materials. The Tegal Subur Aktif Farmer Group has never measured its supply chain performance. If measurement is not carried out, supply chain performance may develop slowly. This study aims to measure the organic tea supply chain's performance and determine which indicators need improvement. This research uses the Supply Chain Operation References (SCOR) and Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the barriers and opportunities faced by women in supply chain leadership, a field traditionally dominated by men. Through in-depth interviews and thematic analysis, it uncovers the pervasive cultural and societal biases that undermine women's perceived competence and suitability for leadership roles. These biases, often rooted in deep-seated stereotypes, influence hiring and promotion decisions, creating significant obstacles for women. Structural and organizational barriers, such as the lack of formal diversity policies, flexible working arrangements, and adequate mentorship, further hinder women's career progression. The dual burden of professional and domestic responsibilities also disproportionately affects women, limiting their availability for work-related travel and extended hours, which are often required in supply chain roles. Despite these challenges, the study identifies several pathways to promote gender diversity in supply chain leadership. Organizational commitment to diversity and inclusion, flexible working policies, and comprehensive mentorship programs are crucial in supporting women's advancement. Education and professional development opportunities are essential in equipping women with the necessary skills for leadership roles. Additionally, fostering an inclusive corporate culture that values diverse perspectives and addresses discrimination is vital for creating a supportive environment. Broader societal and policy-level changes, such as government and industry initiatives promoting gender diversity, are also necessary. The integration of emerging areas like sustainability, entrepreneurship, emotional intelligence, marketing, and supplier relationship management offers new opportunities for women to contribute to the industry's evolution. By addressing these barriers and leveraging the identified opportunities, it is possible to create a more inclusive and equitable supply chain industry, benefiting both the industry and society.</jats:p>"

This research aims to design risk mitigation strategies, especially demand risk, in the rice farming supply chain in Tana Paser District, Paser Regency, East Kalimantan. Monte Carlo simulation was utilized to predict the average rice demand and conduct sensitivity analysis. Three financial scheme strategies were compared: soft tolling, hard tolling, and contract farming, to assess the best strategy that provides maximum profits for agricultural supply chain actors. From the simulation results, the average predicted value for rice demand was 2.78 tonnes. The optimal quantities of q1 (processed material), q2 (raw material), and q3 (seeds) obtained from sensitivity analysis were 2.2 tons, 2 tons, and 2 tons, respectively. The soft tolling strategy provides maximum profits for all agricultural supply chain players, with a total profit of IDR 17,471,000.00, considering that implementing this strategy involves all supply chain stakeholders in determining the contract decision (q).</jats:p>",

The findings reveal that high-context cultures favor indirect communication and nuanced information exchange, which can lead to misunderstandings with partners from low-context cultures who prefer direct and explicit communication. Trust-building practices vary significantly, with high uncertainty avoidance cultures emphasizing formal agreements and procedural rigor, while low uncertainty avoidance cultures prioritize personal relationships and demonstrated reliability. Negotiation strategies also diverge, reflecting the underlying values of collectivism versus individualism, impacting the tactics and outcomes of supply chain negotiations. Conflict resolution approaches differ, with high power distance cultures favoring hierarchical and mediated solutions, and low power distance cultures preferring direct and egalitarian methods. The study highlights the need for adaptability to cultural changes and the development of cultural intelligence as essential competencies for managing cross-cultural supply chains. Additionally, cultural differences in risk management approaches and governance mechanisms affect the coordination and resilience of supply chains, while varying ethical standards influenced by cultural norms necessitate culturally sensitive strategies for promoting corporate social responsibility. The insights gained from this research underscore the importance of understanding and leveraging cultural differences to build stronger, more productive supply chain relationships, contributing to the broader literature on culture and supply chain management and offering practical implications for enhancing global supply chain collaboration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the impact of information sharing on supply chain resilience by exploring the experiences and insights of supply chain professionals through qualitative research. Information sharing has become increasingly recognized as a vital component in enhancing the ability of supply chains to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disruptions. Through semi-structured interviews with 22 supply chain professionals across various industries, the study delves into the mechanisms through which information sharing influences supply chain resilience, the challenges faced, and the role of enabling factors such as technology and organizational culture. The findings reveal that effective information sharing enhances supply chain visibility, coordination, and adaptability. Enhanced visibility allows supply chain partners to monitor real-time operational data, facilitating early detection of potential disruptions. Improved coordination enables better alignment of activities, reducing inefficiencies and mitigating the bullwhip effect. Adaptability is bolstered through the timely exchange of information, allowing for rapid adjustments to changing conditions. However, the study also identifies significant barriers to effective information sharing, including concerns about data security, competitive advantage, and trust among partners.

Cultural norms and values deeply influence both intra-organizational dynamics and inter-organizational relationships within global supply chains. Organizational culture emerges as a pivotal determinant of supply chain integration success. Cultures characterized by transparency, trust, inclusivity, and a commitment to continuous improvement create environments conducive to effective cross-border collaboration. Conversely, organizations with conflicting or ambiguous cultural norms face challenges in aligning goals, fostering mutual understanding, and maintaining open communication channels with international partners. The study underscores the transformative role of digital technologies in enhancing supply chain management practices. Technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things improve supply chain visibility, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making processes, strengthening resilience against disruptions. The adoption and integration of these technologies depend on organizational readiness, technological capabilities, and cultural acceptance within supply chain networks. Cultural factors influence the adoption pace, implementation strategies, and utilization patterns of digital technologies, emphasizing the need for strategic alignment between technological investments and cultural norms to maximize their potential benefits. Furthermore, sustainability considerations are critical in shaping cultural values and priorities within supply chain networks. Organizations increasingly recognize the importance of environmental sustainability, ethical sourcing practices, and corporate social responsibility in shaping their reputations, stakeholder relationships, and long-term business goals. Cultural factors significantly influence organizations' approaches to sustainability, guiding their strategic decisions and operational practices.</jats:p>"

This phenomenon often recurs and peaks beyond dry goods capacity limits, especially the availability of papaya fruit which often exceeds capacity by more than 50%. Therefore, this research aims to identify the optimal forecasting method for papaya fruit to overcome the problem of excessive stock. In this research, four forecasting approaches were tested, namely Trend Analysis, Single Average Exponential, Double Average Exponential, and Holt's Winter Method. Forecasting calculations were carried out using a manual approach and supported by Minitab 18 software. The research results showed that the Holt's Winter method with a multiplicative approach produced the lowest Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), namely 16%.  The Holt's Winter method with a multiplicative approach has proven to be effective in producing accurate forecasts. By implementing this recommended forecasting method, it is hoped that companies can be more efficient in managing inventory and reduce the impact of losses due to excess stock.</jats:p>"

Through semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers, marketing executives, and cultural experts across diverse industries and regions, this study investigates how cultural values impact supply chain operations and consumer engagement strategies. Key findings highlight that collectivist cultures prioritize consensus-building and long-term relationships, fostering trust and collaboration among supply chain partners. In contrast, individualist cultures emphasize efficiency and accountability but may face challenges in relationship building. Risk management practices vary with cultural orientations towards uncertainty, influencing the adoption of structured versus flexible approaches to mitigate disruptions. In terms of marketing implications, the study underscores the importance of cultural sensitivity in crafting effective strategies. High-context cultures require marketing messages that resonate emotionally through implicit communication and cultural symbolism, while low-context cultures prefer clear, direct messaging focusing on product benefits. The study concludes by advocating for cultural competence as a strategic imperative for global businesses, enabling them to leverage cultural diversity for innovation and competitive advantage. It emphasizes the need for continuous adaptation to cultural nuances and market dynamics to foster inclusive collaboration and achieve sustainable growth in a globalized economy.</jats:p>"

When assessing the role corporations play in a more sustainable future, many turn their focus to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors that help define and measure sustainable business. Given the wide variety of topics encompassed in ESG, companies often identify which are material, or prioritised by company stakeholders. Quantitative and qualitative information for material ESG topics is often reported using a standard or framework such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures; Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures; Sustainability Accounting Standards Board; the Global Reporting Initiative and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), along with other region-specific standards. One reporting challenge includes extending ESG strategies and data collection to a company’s value chain. By including ESG-related requirements in service contracts or pre-qualification metrics, expectations can be clearly communicated and data aggregation becomes simpler. Engaging with vendors on the importance of material topics and providing educational tools and opportunities is necessary for accurate data collection. Benchmarking companies against their peers allows organisations to make informed decisions to continue or halt business relationships. Every company’s approach to ESG will look different, but protecting the business’s reputation and customer expectations is critical to continuous operations. Outcomes: understanding different components of ESG. Recognition of the types of reporting disclosure frameworks. Best practices with contractors and suppliers.

Using semi-structured interviews with supply chain managers and executives from diverse industries, the research explores the multifaceted nature of power, identifying key sources such as economic leverage, expertise, resource control, and network centrality. Findings reveal that power dynamics significantly shape decision-making by determining negotiation outcomes, governance structures, and operational efficiencies. Economic power, often exercised by larger firms, enables them to dominate negotiations and impose favorable terms, creating pressures on smaller partners and potentially leading to conflicts. Expertise and resource control allow firms with specialized knowledge or unique inputs to influence product development and process innovation, further dictating supply chain configurations. The study differentiates between coercive and non-coercive power strategies, showing that while coercive power enforces compliance, it can erode trust and collaboration. Non-coercive power, on the other hand, promotes positive relationships through incentives and collaborative approaches, fostering trust and alignment of supply chain objectives. Governance structures imposed by dominant firms often reflect their strategic priorities but can burden less powerful partners, highlighting the need for balanced oversight. Power also plays a crucial role in risk management, resilience, sustainability, and innovation within supply chains, with digitalization introducing new dimensions of influence. The research underscores the importance of balanced and equitable power dynamics to enhance cooperation, resilience, and innovation in supply chains. These insights provide valuable implications for practitioners and scholars in developing more effective and adaptive supply chain strategies.</jats:p>"

Implementation of supply chain management is necessary, especially in the procurement of materials. However, there is a need to measure performance during the implementation. Results of measurement can show the extent to which the project operates and use it as a benchmark to determine the end impact of a project. This study’s purpose is to measure of supply chain performance with the supply chain operation reference (SCOR) method and use the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Compile data using an observation with scoring form based on standards adoption, categories, and SCOR metrics through key performance indicators (KPI) and structured interviews with the contractor to validate. Limited to the study is the supply chain of ready-mix concrete materials. The AHP method give the weight of the output value of the KPI. The results of the KPI measurements from the contractor’s perspective are that one indicator is still at a low value, which is a cycle time for fulfilling orders. An overall result of 84.83 from the measurement KPI suggests a “good” performance category.</jats:p>",

Employing a multilayer network model, this study represents economic interdependence among Indonesian regions, utilizing the InterRegional Input-Output (IRIO) table. Through the application of various metrics, such as degree and strength distribution, assortativity coefficient, and global and local rich club coefficient, to the multilayer IRIO network, we uncover the organizational patterns of economic exchanges between provinces and economic sectors within Indonesia. Our findings demonstrate that a multilayer network approach reveals the heterogeneous and complex structure of the national economy at the regional level. By analyzing the assortativity pattern and global rich-club coefficient, we illustrate that the IRIO network exhibits a hierarchical organization, where significant provincial-sector nodes are interconnected and form dense rich clubs, extending from a few structural cores to peripheral regions. Additionally, we identify distinct connectivity patterns of non-rich nodes based on their incoming and outgoing relations. The insights gained from this study have implications for the macro-control of regional development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>The low uptake of low-carbon heating systems across Europe has prompted authorities to consider more ambitious measures, including a complete ban on the installation of new fossil fuel boilers. In this analysis, we simulate the impacts of introducing a ban on gas boilers under 11,664 scenarios covering major uncertainties. Taking France as a case study, we find that heat pump adoption shifts gas use from heating demand to electricity generation, which is a more efficient use of low-carbon biogas from a whole-system perspective. Heat pump adoption therefore provides a hedge against short supply of low-carbon gas. We additionally find that widespread heat pump adoption is more effectively achieved through a ban on new gas boilers than through incentives under uncertainty. We therefore demonstrate that a ban is critical to meet carbon neutrality, while achieving a reduction in total system cost in over 75\\% of scenarios. Finally, we show that the implementation of the ban, when coupled with the existing subsidy framework, mitigates inequalities among owner-occupied households but generate adverse affect for those in privately rented homes.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: The aim of the study was to assess the supply chain resilience and firm performance in Cameroon.\r\nMethodology: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries.\r\nFindings: The study showed a strong positive correlation between a company's ability to effectively manage disruptions and its overall performance. Supply chain resilience refers to an organization's capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disruptions in its supply chain. Studies indicate that firms with resilient supply chains are better equipped to navigate challenges such as natural disasters, geopolitical unrest, and economic fluctuations. Key findings suggest that resilient supply chains contribute to improved financial performance, operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage. Companies that invest in building resilience through strategies like redundancy in sourcing, flexible manufacturing processes, and robust risk management systems tend to experience fewer disruptions and recover more quickly when faced with unforeseen events. Furthermore, resilient supply chains enable firms to maintain continuity in product availability, meet customer demands during turbulent times, and adapt swiftly to changing market conditions. This adaptability not only enhances overall performance but also strengthens relationships with stakeholders, including suppliers, customers, and investors.\r\nImplications to Theory, Practice and Policy: Resource-based view (RBV), contingency theory and dynamic capabilities theory may be used to anchor future studies on assessing the supply chain resilience and firm performance in Cameroon. Organizations can enhance their supply chain resilience and performance by implementing practical recommendations derived from current research. Advocating for industry-wide standards, interoperability protocols, and regulatory frameworks is essential to support the widespread adoption of emerging technologies in supply chain operations.         </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The demand for ‘energy transition’ metals is expected to surge in the coming years. Despite increasing investments in mining, there remains an inadequacy in meeting the supply-demand equilibrium. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon; for instance, mining ventures entail substantial capital investments, protracted lead times, and arduous permit acquisition processes. Furthermore, over the past decade, mining enterprises have focused on restoring their financial standings amidst low commodity prices, resulting in a prevailing sense of caution in decision-making throughout the remainder of the decade. Therefore, the sector is opening up new opportunities for fresh investors, innovative business models, and emerging players in anticipation of the forthcoming super-cycle. The energy transition brings with it unique challenges and opportunities. Projections indicate a rise in raw material prices, an abundance of potential projects globally, and a rapid growth in the demand for metals coupled with government backing to address energy security concerns. However, as long as investor confidence remains subdued, costs stay high, and the permitting process progresses slowly; it is difficult for mining companies to initiate further investments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This article delves into the role of metals and minerals in the energy transition, highlighting the material-intensive nature of the net-zero economy. It elucidates, drawing from a cash flow analysis spanning the past two decades, the persisting reluctance of mining companies to invest and the resultant potential threats to supply-demand dynamics. Moreover, it examines the emergence of new entrants in the mining industry, such as EV manufacturers, driven by the necessity to secure their supply chains. Other potential entrants, driven by other motivations, include oil and gas companies. Indeed, oil and gas (O&amp;G) companies seek diversification from their core business. The challenges associated with entering the mining industry stem from the limited synergies between the sectors, divergent stakeholders, and the trend of numerous oil majors diversifying into new energy sectors, culminating in a progressively intricate array of business models. However, integrating the two would establish a ‘natural resources entity’ able to facilitate investments in metals crucial for accelerating the transition.</jats:p>",

In this context, structural health monitoring is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of hydraulic infrastructure. Currently, most health monitoring systems for hydraulic infrastructure rely on commercial software or algorithms that only run on desktop computers. This study developed for the first time a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model specifically for early detection of structural damage in water supply canals and deployed it as a tiny machine learning (TinyML) application on a low-power microcontroller unit (MCU). The model uses damage images of the supply canals that we collected as input and the damage types as output. With data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset, the deployed model is only 7.57 KB in size and demonstrates an accuracy of 94.17 ± 1.67% and a precision of 94.47 ± 1.46%, outperforming other commonly used CNN models in terms of performance and energy efficiency. Moreover, each inference consumes only 5610.18 μJ of energy, allowing a standard 225 mAh button cell to run continuously for nearly 11 years and perform approximately 4,945,055 inferences.

Health is also related to the basic survival and development of citizens. The right to health is an important fundamental right of citizens, and the basic medical security right is an important part of it. The basic medical security right is the right to guarantee citizens' basic access to medical care and the right to basic medical services, and is closely related to the right to life, the right to health and the right to social security. The State's obligation to supply for the basic medical security right mainly consists of the material supply obligation and the procedural supply obligation: the material supply obligation may be specific to the supply of medical insurance, medical assistance and medical facilities; and the procedural supply obligation consists of the supply of medical service and medical relief. The State's obligation to supply for the basic medical security right in practice in China mainly faces such practical problems as inadequate legal norms and low hierarchy of legislation, large differences in supply among regions, and low level of supply.\r\nIn this context, the State's obligation to supply for the basic medical security right should be further improved by, among other things, establishing the legal system of supply governed by the Constitution, formulating scientific supply standards, and developing diversified relief channels. At the same time, in terms of the leading and consistent internal logic, change the logic of legislative thinking from emphasizing the medical security administration in “drafts for comments” to the structured and typified basic medical insurance legal relations, establishing the system of medical security law, and thus promote the rule of law of the basic medical security right.</jats:p>",

Methods: A qualitative analysis of 38 studies revealed weaknesses in SCRFs, which include the entity proposing the framework, the stimulus being responded to, the adaptation of activities to the stimulus that is responded to, objectives, and response evaluation criteria. Results: The analysis reveals that while these frameworks have been designed for specific situations involving single SC processes, they demonstrate weaknesses by failing to meet two requirements: (1) the stimulus being responded to is different from changes in demand, and (2) the response is generated by a process distinct from manufacturing. Conclusions: Further, SCRF research that incorporates these weaknesses will promote the fragmented development of the SCR concept. Conversely, a robust SCRF can be successfully utilized in various SCRs, facilitating the comparison and evaluation of responses of different SCs to the same stimulus.</jats:p>"

This paper selects the relevant data of China's consumer price index CPI, broad money and quasi-money supply M2 and gross domestic product GDP from 2003 to 2022 as the corresponding variable indicators, constructs the multiple linear regression model, and conducts the significance test for the model through statistical inference test, econometrics test, and other methods and makes relevant corrections to the model, and then arrives at the optimal model. The analysis shows that there is a close relationship between inflation and money supply, and inflation is an important factor driving China's economic growth, while changes in money supply have a relatively small impact on China's economic growth, and in the long run, inflation has a significant negative impact on economic growth, while money supply has a significant positive impact on economic growth.</jats:p>"

The location of this research was 170 Kpspams  throughout the East Java region with reasonable functioning classifications. Kpspams in the East Java region was chosen as the research location because East Java is the province with the highest Kpspams functional status nationally. The time required to collect data is approximately 2 (two) months. The population in this study were Kpspams administrators throughout the East Java region who had an excellent functioning classification totaling 1016. The sampling technique used a probability sampling technique, a proportional random sampling method based on the same proportion for each group, so the sample determined in this study was 170 Kpspams members—East Java region. The research results show that the social capital variable was not able to significantly increase the value of each indicator of the management performance variable but technology adaptation has a significant positive effect on management performance as a consideration in improving management performance and sustainability of Kpspams in East Java Province. The contribution of this research is expected to be an input to overcome a problem that is being faced, especially in the aspect of program success at Kpspams in East Java Province and its development. The advice that can be given in this research is the development of several previous studies with distinctive characteristics not found in previous research, namely giving rise to a new dimension in the form of technological adaptation as a variable in the Kpspams research object.</jats:p>"

The paper goes on to explain the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework for mapping and analysis of end-to-end value stream activities. This tool helps to identify, measure and develop a comprehensive action plan at the point of occurrence effectively targeting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This can be done only in collaboration with network partners with clear scorecard-based evaluation and monitoring. Using examples from the automotive industry and a case study from a healthcare pharmaceutical drug producer, it weaves the concepts of LCA, value stream mapping and scorecard seamlessly into something which the reader may find it easy and simple to implement. The paper also touches upon the challenges one needs to be cognisant of in implementing changes in the network to achieve sustainable supply chain operations, with a firm belief that the journey towards nature-positive is not only the need of the hour but is also possible practically. We owe it to not just future generations but also to ourselves within our lifetime.</jats:p>"

In this study, digital transformation risks are identified and prioritized using a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method under uncertainty. Additionally, appropriate risk mitigation strategies for the top-ranked risks are presented, and potential relationships among them are addressed. Initially, potential risks in digital transformation were identified based on expert opinions. A fuzzy hierarchical and analytic network process was then applied to determine the importance of evaluation criteria and the final ranking of potential risks, respectively. Efficient risk mitigation strategies were proposed, and interrelationships among them were assessed using interpretive structural modeling and a matrices impacts croisés multiplication appliquée à un classement (MICMAC) analysis. The results indicate that information technology risk, supply chain management risk, and financial risks are the top three risks in the identified ranking. Furthermore, implementing an integrated data strategy and proposing comprehensive business agreements with supply chain players are considered the most impactful strategies for risks with top ranks.</jats:p>"

The main focus is on determining a suitable system architecture. Based on the literature, promising humidification and cooling strategies for cathode gas preconditioning are identified and evaluated. System configurations with membrane and spray humidification as well as intercooling between compressor stages and wet compression are calculated using a thermodynamic cycle calculation model. By analysing the design parameter spaces of the cathode air supply systems, the different configurations are compared in terms of their influence on key system parameters such as specific fuel and parasitic power consumption or heat exchanger size to find the most promising architecture. Further, the operating limits of the systems at different operating pressures and temperatures are determined. The second area of focus is the identification of a suitable system design point. It is discussed that the most critical operating points of the individual components are located at different flight conditions. Therefore, off-design performance is taken into account in order to design the entire system. A model based on the constant mass flow method is introduced to calculate steady state operating points for the system using membrane humidification. It can be seen that the turbo components have their design point at top of climb operating point, while the heat exchanger has to be designed for the maximum waste heat at take-off and the humidifier for the most critical operating point in terms of membrane water content at cruise.</jats:p>",

There are various risks involved in the process of developing mangrove carbon sink projects as they will have a significant impact on the successful development of these projects. From the perspective of the supply entities, this article divides the entire life cycle of mangrove carbon sink projects into five stages: (1) decision stage, (2) design stage, (3) construction stage, (4) verification and filing stage, and (5) operation and maintenance stage. With the goal of achieving project success a risk measurement and evaluation model is hereby established, and the impact paths and coefficients of 61 risk factors in the entire life cycle of mangrove carbon sink projects are obtained. The research results indicate that: (a) different life cycle stages exhibit different risk impact paths and coefficients, with the design stage and the operation and maintenance stage bearing the greatest impact of risk in the project; (b) for mangrove carbon sink projects, policy risks, technical risks, and market risks are the three major types of risks that require special attention; (c) about 1/4 of all the risk factors belong to the category of first level risk. These research results can provide a theoretical basis for the effective implementation of risk management plans for mangrove carbon sink projects, so as to ensure greater project effectiveness, promote the development of mangrove carbon sink projects, and ultimately contribute to the realization of the goal of carbon neutrality.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is an approach used by firms to ensure that their business can be highly effective, and profitable and that operations run smoothly. This involves managing the movement of raw materials inwards and finished goods outwards. Logistics is a key component of this. It also involves managing the flow of products between companies, which can involve the movement of products between a manufacturer, a wholesaler, and a retailer. Supply chain management is therefore the integration of these flows between companies. Several innovative techniques can be used to optimize supply chain operations, particularly given recent advances in information technology. The function of logistics is known as activities that are related to the flow of products between companies, such as the transportation and warehousing of goods. Activities that take place within companies, such as inventory management and materials handling, are not considered to be logistical activities but part of the supply chain. The level of interest in supply chain management has risen quite dramatically over the last few years. This is partly due to advances in information technology, which have enabled closer integration of the supply chain. As well as increasing competition between companies, on both a national and an international level, has led to an increasing emphasis on the need for companies to concentrate on their core competencies, and to look to outside suppliers to provide other goods and services. This has led to the increased use of external suppliers.</jats:p>"

The analysis technique used in this research is linear regression with annual time series data of 20 observation units. This simultaneous model has never been studied by previous researchers. The results of this research analysis provide information that every change in savings interest negatively affects the M2 Money supply by 78.60% and a significant, positive effect between the Exchange Rate and Money in circulation by 78.40%. Meanwhile, simultaneous changes in savings interest and exchange rates have a significant effect on changes in money supply in Indonesia and the influence is substantial at 91.20%. Therefore, the conclusion of this research is, that partially and simultaneously the proposed model exhibits a significant influence between savings interest and the exchange rate on the amount of money circulating in Indonesia. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention to the current macroeconomic conditions concerning these two factors, especially the stability of the exchange rate, to ensure that it does not increase the money supply and inflation which may reduce people’s purchasing power in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Selecting the most efficient method for distributing power and capacity is a critical issue when developing hybrid systems from scratch. The main objective of this study is to determine how a backup system affects the performance of a microgrid system. The study focuses on power and hydrogen production using renewable energy resources, particularly solar and wind. Based on photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs), and their combinations, including battery storage systems (BSSs) and hydrogen technologies, two renewable energy systems were examined. The proposed location for this study is the northwestern coast of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To simulate the optimal size of system components and determine their cost-effective configuration, the study utilized the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software (Version 3.16.2). The results showed that, when considering the minimum cost of energy (COE), the integration of WTs, PVs, a battery bank, an electrolyzer, and a hydrogen tank brought the cost of energy to almost 0.60 USD/kWh in the system A. However, without a battery bank, the COE increased to 0.72 USD/kWh in the same location because of the capital cost of system components. In addition, the results showed that the operational life of the fuel cell decreased significantly in system B due to the high hours of operation, which will add additional costs. These results imply that long-term energy storage in off-grid energy systems can be economically benefited by using hydrogen with a backup system.</jats:p>"

Fisheries, which is also an agricultural subsector, has great potential in developing the country's economy, which is shown by the increasing number of fisheries production from year to year. The increase in the production of fishery products, both raw and processed materials, must be balanced with an effective and efficient distribution system method to ensure the quality of the fish remains in good condition. Good distribution management of fish products by controlling product temperatures that remain low throughout the distribution process is known as cold supply chain management. This requires cold supply chain management to be handled well because it has a controlling effect on fisheries logistics costs. Some of the facts above are the background for this research through analysis of the logistics cost structure, including the obstacles faced by the cold chain supply chain for caught fish and the cold chain business prospects and obstacles faced by this industry. Analysis of the distribution process also involves a review of the refrigerated transport fleet.

However, this complex system is marred by numerous challenges, including transparency, traceability, and trust issues. In response to these challenges, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution. This abstract delves into the application of blockchain technology in agri-supply chain management, highlighting its potential to revolutionize the industry. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger, provides an innovative framework for addressing several persistent issues within the agri-supply chain. It enables seamless and transparent tracking of products from farm to fork, ensuring that critical information related to production, transportation, and storage is securely recorded and readily accessible. Furthermore, the technology promotes trust and integrity by reducing the risk of fraud and the tampering of records, thus increasing overall supply chain reliability.

In this regard, one of the suggested ways to compensate part of the shortages of water demand for drinking and sanitation in the city of Mashhad is the plan to transfer water from the Chechehe and Qaretikan dams by constructing structures downstream of these dams and transferring the water to the water transfer tunnel of the Dosti Dam and then to the city of Mashhad. For this purpose, in this study, first, the changes in water allocation from these two dams were evaluated by taking into account drinking, agricultural, ecological needs and the water treaty between Iran and Turkmenistan using the WEAP water allocation model. Then, in the second stage, the assessment of meeting the above-mentioned needs was investigated using the Water supply percentage index. According to the results, the transfer of water due to the threshold of limit transferable volume, is practical and possible. However, it should be noted that no additional loading should be considered during the wet periods as compared to the existing conditions in order to ensure a stable supply of drinking water in Mashhad through two dams.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Supply chains are complex ecosystems, so quickly assessing the short and long-term impacts of events in such an ecosystem is a formidable challenge. We all know that the faster these assessments can be made, the better chance we have of responding and making decisions that will mitigate risk and supply disruptions. For instance, the case study about P&amp;G rapidly adjusting its plans to respond to hurricanes1 is a classic example of why it is critical to make fast assessments amid disruption. While we intuitively understand the value of rapid decision making, it is difficult to quantify and provide a return on investment (ROI) analysis supporting investments in digital twins and concurrent planning. Why? Disruptions typically affect a limited number of sectors and enterprises, their durations vary, geographical impact varies and other events could be happening at the same time. All of this makes it difficult to assess a before, during and after. And then along came COVID-19. The pandemic’s impact was global, across all sectors and almost all enterprises, with a duration of well over a year, with a clear start and relatively clear end. This paper discusses the power of digital twins combined with concurrent supply chain orchestration in risk assessment and decision making as well as the impact on key financial results.</jats:p>"

Tough international trade environment characterized by complex supply chain and inventory issues as well as unpredictable demand for goods necessitates powerful analytics tools. Using the latest technologies - machine learning, predictive analytics, and big data - data science generates data-driven decisions for more accurate, efficient, and prompt SCM decision-making.  The study intends to study the current trends and evaluate the influence of data science in SCM decision-making processes. It also delves into the difficulties and advantages with the utilization of data science during these procedures. This study uses a synthesis approach by systematically going through a literature review to gather data from different academic journals and industry publications. According to the results of the thematic analysis, the themes will emerge, so the whole complexity and depth of data science applications in SCM will be properly revealed. Data science changes the business decision-making in a way that was impossible before with the advent of new information from the huge and complex data sources. Data analytics not only smoothens but also upgrades long-term trend forecasting and market readiness in SCM. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the influence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and industry 4.0 technologies of SCM with an accent on how they are associated to increase efficiency and sustainability in the operations. </jats:p>"

However, the complexity of coordinating multiple transport options, varying cargo priorities, and dynamic constraints poses significant challenges. This research presents a novel methodological approach to optimizing multimodal goods transportation in supply chains. The proposed strategy involves a two-step classification process. First, goods are categorized based on their importance, considering factors such as value, criticality, and demand volatility. Next, the urgency and priority of each good is determined, accounting for delivery time sensitivity and other operational requirements. This classification scheme forms the foundation for a comprehensive optimization model. The optimization model is formulated\nusing the DOCPLEX modeling framework and solved employing the CPLEX solver. The model incorporates a range of constraints, including transport capacity, cost, and emissions, to identify the most efficient multimodal routing plan.This research contributes to the development of a structured, datadriven\ndecision-making tool for supply chain managers to enhance the resilience and sustainability of their multimodal transportation networks. The proposed approach offers a flexible framework for addressing the complexities of multimodal transportation, and its potential applications are far-reaching\nacross various industries and regions.</jats:p>"

A systematic literature search identified 27 tools that were then categorized into a typology based on dimensions of sustainability, geographical applicability, and accessibility. In-depth analysis was conducted on six tools: Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture (SAFA), Sustainability Monitoring and Assessment RouTine (SMART), Response-Inducing Sustainability Evaluation (RISE) 3.0 version, Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment (SALCAsustain), MOnitoring Tool for Integrated Farm Sustainability (MOTIFS), and Technology Impact and Policy Impact CALculations (TIPICAL). Assessment focused on the relevance of covered sustainability dimensions to the dairy sector, level of supply chain coverage, type of indicators, accessibility, and practicability. The review identified tools which integrate multiple sustainability aspects in a comprehensive way (SAFA and SMART) and tools offering accurate quantification of the impact on sustainability dimensions of the production system (SALCAsustain, RISE, MOTIFS, TIPICAL). Only two tools extend assessment past the farm gate (SAFA, SMART). Future users should select tools based on the specific objectives of measuring sustainability in dairy systems. This review contributes to the literature by addressing various aspects of sustainability assessment tools, by addressing the need for an integrated and comprehensive view, and by considering the entire dairy supply chain.</jats:p>"

Today, our world faces many problems, such as population growth, rapid and unbalanced urbanization, environmental pollution, and especially climate change, which make the concept of sustainability topical. The increase in agricultural production in line with the principle of sustainability and the guarantee of equitable distribution are among the strategic goals of many countries. The agricultural sector is both necessary and ancient, as it meets people's necessities for food, clothing, and shelter. Each country is mainly responsible for achieving its citizens' healthy, reliable, and accessible food needs and is supported to varying degrees, including food security and food safety. The equilibrium between population growth and increase in production mentioned in Malthus' \"Population Theory\" at the end of the 18th century has not yet been experienced in total production. But there is certainly a problem of distribution and sharing. Although technology is an important factor in the theory that has not yet been realized, it would not be wrong to say that the increase in nutrients has not reached the desired speed, despite the rapid growth of the world's population today. The problems that will arise when natural resources are exhausted in the future will be the world's acid test. With this study, an evaluation has been made on the changes and effects that have occurred in recent years on the agri-food supply chain. Especially the breaks in the agri-food supply chain, and the results of these breaks have been revealed with statistical data. In this regard, an evaluation has been made on the Grain Corridor, which Turkiye has played especially in the Ukraine-Russia war in recent years, and it has been revealed how a deterioration in the agriculture-food supply chain affects food security in the World. The document analysis method was used to investigate the research question of significant events influencing SFS (Sustainable Food System) today.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a fuzzy integration multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to solve SCM issues. To navigate this complexity, a multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) framework is employed, integrating MCDM methods with fuzzy logic to effectively address subjective environmental criteria. This innovative approach not only enhances supply-chain management (SCM) but also emphasizes the necessity for ongoing innovation in tackling contemporary supply-chain challenges. It serves as a cornerstone for sustainable supplier selection practices and optimizing SCM processes. In this study, a hybrid fuzzy MCDM method is proposed for supplier selection. The method addresses supplier selection by utilizing evaluations from expert decision-makers based on predetermined criteria. This comprehensive approach ensures that all relevant factors are considered, promoting sustainable and efficient supply-chain management.</jats:p>"

This paper discusses job displacement in the face of advancing technology; technological advancement has always rendered certain jobs obsolete, but it has also always generated new jobs and industries in their place. For example, Henry Ford’s Model T created the demand that led to an explosion of growth in the hospitality industry as cars became affordable. While AI is an extremely powerful tool, the fact is that humans possess certain indispensable attributes that robots and AI cannot match. Human attributes such as flexibility, soft skills, understanding of context and a moral compass, among others, are characteristics that are not likely to be offered by machines any time soon. People also have played a key role in a number of critical supply chain situations, such as major disruptions. To be used to their full potential, tools like AI will require human guidance and ingenuity — meaning that rather than job replacement, these technologies will enable job augmentation. AI is surely poised to fundamentally alter human work and jobs, but it is not likely to replace them outright.</jats:p>"

It will also be important to know that traditional SCM systems have various inherent problems, including not having enough information about the system, complicated tracking of products, and the fact that fraudulent activities easily compromise most systems. The modern solution for SCM seems to be based on blockchain technology that provides an operational walls-built ledger, significantly increasing transparency and traceability rates within the supply chain processes. Consequently, this paper considers the role of SCM in incorporating blockchain technology to address potential issues such as scalability and conformity to legal frameworks. Examples from Walmart's food supply chain management and Maersk and IBM's TradeLens give a concrete realization of blockchain's benefits in supply chain clarity and functioning. Future trends of blockchain for SCM, particularly multichain and integration with other emerging technologies, reveal that the field is set to expand toward offering increased resolution and reliability to the supply chain.</jats:p>"

The accurate prediction of solar irradiance is crucial for determining the quantity of solar panels and the power capacity of photovoltaic power generation (PVPG) systems for mobile sprinkler machines. In this study, a prediction method is proposed to forecast the solar irradiance of typical irrigation areas. The impact of the meteorological parameters on the solar irradiance is studied, and four different parameter combinations are formed and considered as input to the prediction model. Based on meteorological data provided by ten typical radiation stations uniformly distributed nationwide, an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model optimized using the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is developed to predict the solar radiation. The prediction accuracy and stability of the proposed method are then evaluated for different input parameters through training and testing. The differences between the prediction performances of models trained based on single-station data and mixed data from multiple stations are also compared. The obtained results show that the proposed model achieves the highest prediction accuracy when the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, sunshine hours ratio, relative humidity, wind speed, and extraterrestrial radiation are used as the input parameters. The prediction effectiveness is also verified based on measured data. The WOA-XGBoost model has higher prediction accuracy than the XGBoost model, with predicted values falling within acceptable ranges. The model developed using mixed data of multiple stations can be applied for forecasting solar irradiance in different regions. This study provides a foundation for the optimization of the configuration of PVPG systems for mobile sprinkler machines.</jats:p>"

Firstly, the basic conclusion is that the “supply-side reform policy” can reduce the labor income share of enterprises in the “six major industries”. The correctness of the benchmark regression results was verified through a series of robustness tests. The results of the main regression were validated based on three different heterogeneity analysis perspectives: firm ownership, firm region, and government intervention. Secondly, two mediation mechanisms were examined, and the results showed that increasing operating income can positively enhance the “supply-side structural reform” in reducing the labor share of income in all enterprises, while increasing R&amp;D investment can negatively enhance the effect of the “supply-side structural reform” on the reduction of the labor share of income in all enterprises. The heterogeneity of the two intermediary effects indicates that state-owned enterprises and private enterprises have different performances. The research results of this article indicate that the “supply-side reform policy” can effectively reduce the labor income share of target enterprises, reduce the proportion of excess employees, and enhance the vitality of target enterprises. The policy suggestion is to continue promoting supply-side structural reform, a policy which is in line with the requirements of the high-quality and sustainable development of Chinese enterprises.</jats:p>"

To the best of our knowledge, currently, neither national nor foreign literature contains any conceptual systematization of conflicts that occur during the hiring process. Such systematization would combine conflict factors at the intersection of economic, sociological, and conflict theories. The article proposes a categorization that is based on the prominent conflict theories while taking into consideration potential employment conflicts within the labor market. The proposed categorization groups market participants (supply and demand sides) and sorts conflicts by type (systemic and non-systemic conflicts). Four primary sources of conflict are identified, including market mechanisms and salary expectations (systemic conflicts), company values and human capital (non-systemic conflicts). Systemic factors of conflicts such as supply/ demand matching and wage expectations are determined by market mechanisms. These economic factors are determined by objective and predictable processes, but sociological theories of conflict are typically excluded from the aforementioned context, which can result in a biased portrayal of macroeconomic processes. In addition, the policy of a particular company and a job seeker’s expectations for a specific job position are nonsystemic, they depend on such types of factors as company values and human capital.This categorization enables early identification of the source of conflict and potential reduction of its destructive effects.</jats:p>",

This work aims to give empirical backing to the current debate over money supply, inflation, and the relationship between these factors and economic growth. More research has been done recently on the relationship between money supply and economic growth than on any other topic in the field of monetary economics. A price increase that, over time, results in a decline in buying power is known as inflation. This study looks at how inflation and the money supply affected economic development between 1974–1975 and 2022–2023. When establishing if there is long-term co-integration among variables when the bound test has been applied, the ARDL co-integration approach is employed in the study to ascertain the link between the variables. GDP is the dependent variable, and the independent variables are broad money (M2) and consumer price inflation (CPI), respectively. The notion that inflation is always a monetary event needs to be revisited and reevaluated, particularly in light of the distinct dynamics of inflation in developing economies. The research indicates a positive correlation between CPI and economic growth. The data indicates that CPI has a significant influence on economic growth in emerging nations like Nepal.</jats:p>"

The RFHI methodology includes segregating flow data into different periods, identifying key parameters, assessing flow alterations, and developing an index from 0 to 1. Results indicate moderate alterations in the flow regime, with RFHI of 0.379 and 0.328 for different periods. Geomorphological analysis revealed variations in river sinuosity, peaking at 1.232 in 1999 before reducing to 1.206 by 2018, and braid-channel ratio decreasing from 1.864 in 1999 to 1.508 in 2018. Channel width narrowed in 1999 to 0.082 km and slightly expanded to 0.093 km by 2018. The channel area reduced from 6.418 km² in 1993 to 5.632 km² in 2018, with the bar area significantly decreasing and bar density dropping from 3.28 to 0.83, indicating changes in the channel belt. Construction phases showed increased fluvial bars and channel multiplicity and decreased channel area and width. Post-Hathnikund barrage, withdrawals during lean seasons left the channel dry, as seen in 2003, 2008, and 2013. These findings emphasize integrated river basin management to harmonize development with ecological impacts.</jats:p>",

Combining the usage of human analysts and machine learning algorithms can accomplish this. To accurately anticipate retailer volume and allot resources, a novel methodology for optimizing supply chain management at CBEC is proposed in this paper. The framework improves efficiency and profitability by using fuzzy logic and auction theory to make strategic decisions. Thanks to this creative strategy, managers can now make more informed decisions, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of CBEC’s supply chain. The results of this paper reveal that our proposed method is superior to previous comparable methods, with RMSE and MAE values of 22.31 and 18.76, respectively. This approach offers a promising solution to the challenges faced by e-commerce businesses, and can help them achieve greater success in the dynamic and complex world of online commerce.</jats:p>"

The mounting concerns about climate change, fossil fuel depletion, and energy security have heightened the focus on renewable energy. The shift to a global energy system that heavily relies on renewable sources, while promising, faces significant barriers that call for coordinated global efforts and innovative solutions. This article examines the technological advancements in renewable energy, evaluates their economic implications, and explores future trends and policy impacts. The core argument of this work is that, despite notable technological advancements, a significant breakthrough and a conducive investment environment are yet to be realised to enable the complete substitution of fossil fuels with renewable energy. It analyses current capacities, technological challenges, economic considerations, and various policies influencing the implementation of renewable energy projects. By conducting a comprehensive examination of the intermittency of energy production, limitations of energy storage, and the need for infrastructure modernisation, the economic implications of investing in renewable energy are assessed, alongside the potential of existing technologies to provide a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. The article underscores the crucial role of increased investment, ongoing innovation, and global collaboration in overcoming existing challenges and ensuring a sustainable transition to renewable energy sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Return on assets (ROA) is a critical metric in assessing a company’s sustainability, especially in light of supply chain disruptions. Within the renewable energy sector, such disruptions often lead to a decline in ROA. Through the utilization of a within-between random model, this study uncovers the necessity for distinct strategies both prior to and during supply chain disruptions to maintain a high ROA. Pre-disruption, emphasis should be placed on securing additional funding for research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives and expanding market reach. However, amid disruptions, sustaining a high ROA demands a strategic pivot. Specifically, renewable energy firms should scale back expansion efforts, redirect cash toward R&amp;D, and exercise caution when venturing into new international markets, particularly in the absence of substantial government subsidies. Notably, this paper focuses solely on large-scale listed companies, overlooking potential innovative strategies employed by smaller-scale companies—an area ripe for future investigation. Despite this limitation, our findings offer valuable insights into enhancing sustainable performance within the renewable energy sector.</jats:p>"

It is shown that circuits with separate channels for transmitting information and energy do not deteriorate the metrological characteristics of the information-measuring measuring system and do not impose any restrictions on the structure of its transmitting part associated with its energy consumption. For circuits with combined channels, with phase or spectral channel multiplexing methods, due to the mutual influence of optical radiation transmitting energy and information on each other, a deterioration in the signal-to-noise ratio of the information-measuring part of the sensor occurs due to the effects of continuum generation and stimulated Raman scattering only in in case where the optical radiation power is significant. If the compaction of the channels is temporary, the mutual influence of the channels can be neglected.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\n\nShoppers face high beef prices at the supermarket, but those prices are not a reflection of what Canadian farmers and ranchers earn from their cow-calf herds. In the past 30 years, the average beef producer’s operating margin has never reached $50,000, despite the fact that the average beef farm’s asset base stands at more than $2 million.\nBetter access to export markets, including the U.S., South Asia and North Africa, would help to remedy the producers poor returns. Export prices would need to cover production costs, the largest of which is feed for the producers’ cattle herds, accounting for 77 per cent of the average ranch’s cash costs.\nAs of July 2023, Alberta’s herd consisted of 1.77 million beef and dairy cows. With demand for livestock-derived food expected to jump by 38 per cent in the next 30 years, Canadian cattle ranchers need to take advantage of this global increase through freer trade. Canadian beef can remain competitive globally if the supply chain accesses world markets beyond the U.S., especially in developing countries where consumer incomes are increasing. The industry also needs investments in research, farm extension and supply chain co-ordination from national and provincial self-funded producer groups.\nProducers must look outward to global trade but be ready to capture new innovations at home. The dominant economies of scale are available to beef processors and finding savings is difficult for farmers and ranchers. However, there is potential for the supply chain to see savings from new technology, which is why investment in continuing support for ranch-level production research is necessary. Producers also need to focus on national co-ordination aimed at protecting trade access and responding to trends in consumer demand for beef.\nAny new industry policies must also consider key factors that currently affect market demand and expansion including: changing consumer preferences globally, the welfare of animals raised for slaughter and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on supply chain sustainability. As some of the output and byproducts of the grain production sector provide feed for cattle, policies meant to support the grain sector may be indirectly influencing the beef sector significantly — for good and bad.\nInfrastructure required for worker safety, animal welfare improvements or improved food safety also adds to the cost of the beef supply. Protectionist trends and increased tariffs pose a threat to the supply chain because they too can create new costs. This is why access to foreign markets is crucial for producers, along with continued investment in research, sector-wide co-ordination to support market access and reviewing crop support to ensure livestock producers are compensated if grain policy changes harm them.\n\n\n\nAlthough live animals and much processed Canadian beef are exported to the U.S., fostering good trade relations in Asia and Africa is vital, given the growth in incomes and consumer demand for beef that is predicted for those regions.\nFree trade is the basis of good agriculture policy and any move towards protectionist policies and higher tariffs is the biggest threat for new costs in the supply chain. Canada’s beef sector requires low-cost access to foreign markets, making free trade policy the single most important policy focus for the sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Inadequate supply of transport infrastructure is often seen as a barrier to a sustainable future for cities globally. Such barriers often perpetuate significant inequalities in who can and who cannot benefit from sustainable transport opportunities, and as a result there is momentum for transformative urban planning to promote sustainable transportation equity. This study introduces a new set of two-dimensional indicators, merging elements of supply and demand, to identify barriers and imbalances in sustainable transport equity. The accessibility indicators, which are generated for bus, rail, and cycle infrastructure, consider the proximity of administrative areas to good quality transport infrastructure, as well as mode-specific demand, to clearly identify areas where the supply of infrastructure is inadequate to support local populations. We present a policy case study for Liverpool City Region, which demonstrates how these indicators can be used in an analytical framework to support transformative urban planning in long-term. In particular, the indicators reveal policy priority areas where demand for sustainable transport is greater than supply, as well as neighbourhoods where multiple transport inequalities are intersecting spatially, highlighting the need for specific types of infrastructure investment to promote sustainable transport equity (e.g. more frequent services, additional cycle paths). Our framework lays the foundations for improved decision-making in urban systems, through development of mode-specific sustainable transport indicators at small area levels, which harmonise elements of supply and demand for the first time.</p>"

Geopolitical events of recent years in the form of international conflicts, political changes, European economic sanctions and even natural disasters have a significant impact on global transport networks, causing various challenges and obstacles. The purpose of the article is to analyze the impact of such geopolitical risks on global supply chains, identify the main problems faced by companies, and develop strategies to overcome them. The article highlights the results of a complex study, which includes the analysis of academic sources, international reports, economic indicators, technological trends and regional features. It found that disruptions in supply chains due to geopolitical risks can have serious consequences, from increased costs and delivery delays to production shutdowns. The study points to the need to implement flexible and adaptive management strategies for intercontinental logistics systems that allow a quick response to changes in the geopolitical space. The key area of research is effective management of global supply chains in conditions of geopolitical uncertainty, which requires the integration of various approaches and technologies. The obtained results provide a valuable tool for strategic planning and decision-making in the field of transnational logistics restructuring, helping commercial companies to prepare and adapt to potential geopolitical changes.</jats:p>"

Digital transformation means using new technologies that lead to increased efficiency, creativity and innovation and can solve environmental challenges, such as reducing air, water and soil pollution, saving natural resources, protecting biodiversity and solving greenhouse effect reduction. Slow Green performance is an index that measures the degree of adherence of businesses to environmental activities and preserves resources for future generations. Organizations and companies are trying to move their production activities towards green production. Advertising activities are also organized through green marketing and combined green marketing. Given the importance of green performance, this article explains what aspects of the green supply chain are affected by digital transformation. This article is based on articles collected from the reliable hub research site and interviews with several experts in digital and green management. The present article, which is qualitative, cites numerous articles and the qualitative analysis method with MAXQDA software and explains how digital transformation makes the green supply chain more efficient. The results showed that digital transformation has the greatest impact on green production, followed by green materials and green consumption.</jats:p>",

However, the bond performance and failure mechanisms at the interface between EGC and existing concrete remain unclear. To elucidate the bond performance of EGC to existing concrete, direct shear tests were conducted on 15 sets of EGC–existing concrete bond specimens. This study explored the effects of existing concrete strength, interface roughness, and EGC strength on the bond performance and mechanisms. Additionally, a direct shear bond mechanical model was established to predict the interface bond strength. The results indicate that, with comparable compressive strength, the preparation of EGC can reduce the total carbon emissions by up to 127% compared to ECC. The failure mode of EGC-existing concrete bond specimens was mainly adhesive failure (except for specimen C30-III-G95), which can be categorized into serrated interfacial failure and alternating crack paths. The change in interface roughness was the primary factor leading to the transition between failure paths. The changes in interface roughness and EGC strength significantly influenced the bond performance. Under their combined effect, the interface bond strength of specimen C50-III-G95 increased by 345% compared to C50-I-G45. In contrast, the improvement in existing concrete strength had a relatively smaller effect on the increase in interface bond strength. Based on the experimental results and the bonding mechanism under direct shear stress, a direct shear bond mechanical model correlating existing concrete strength, interface roughness, and EGC strength was established. The model predictions showed good consistency with the experimental results. This study provides theoretical support and experimental data for the engineering application of EGC.</jats:p>"

The problems include 3% product returns from cooking oil shipments to distributors under the brands Sania cooking oil, Fortune cooking oil, Sovia cooking oil, and Siip cooking oil. In addition, there are fluctuations in demand, an increase in demand of 170% with a demand of 20,774 tons and a decrease in demand of 59% with a demand of 7,225 tons at an average monthly production of 12,195 tons. This research aims to design Supply Chain Resilience with a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) approach. This QFD approach uses a 3-level HOQ. HOQ 1 assesses the relationship between customer needs and potential risks, resulting in risk prioritization. HOQ 2 assesses the relationship between potential risks and risk causes, resulting in the prioritization of risk causes. HOQ 3 assesses the relationship between risk causes and resilience measures, resulting in the prioritization of resilience measures. From the research results, 20 resilience measures were obtained and the 5 highest ranks were obtained as priority resilience measures, namely insurance, marketing quick response, product quality, customer relations, preventive maintenance and repair. The results of the resilience measure design are expected to be used as risk mitigation for the company.\r\n </jats:p>"

The focus on this document will be twofold: Firstly, the current critical lack of qualified deck and engineer officers and how this can be rectified. The lack of domestic training has recently been identified by both Maritime Industry Australia Ltd and Australian Resources &amp; Energy Employer Association as being at a crisis point. Secondly, the lack of an Australian strategic fleet (including a viable Australian International Shipping Register (AISR)) and the consequent vulnerability of our critical maritime export and import supply chains.

Considered strategies for supply chains, through which better customer service will lead to increased supplies and reduced costs, will bring benefits to all supply chain stakeholders. An illustrative example of a long-term project in the supply chain is provided - the project of the ship acquisition. The ship's life cycle is specified from the standpoint of various participants involved in fleet renewal (replenishment) project. Analyzing each phase of the shipping company's life cycle, risks are examined for each phase of the life cycle, including strategic, economic, commercial, credit, informational, ecological. Alternative supply chain strategies are identified. Taking into account the main objectives of supply chain management, a hybrid strategy can be identified that uses both lean and flexible supply chains. When implementing such a strategy, it is possible to reduce the total order fulfillment time; ensure reliability, correct frequency of delivery, quality and flexibility of delivery; optimize inventory levels throughout the supply chain and minimize total costs. Phases of the life cycle of a supply chain management project are highlighted, as the relationships and obligations between various stakeholders require the construction of a flexible supply chain. Such a supply chain involves solving a series of tasks to meet the requirements of stakeholders and customers; before the project reaches the completion phase. The preparation and implementation of individual projects, taking into account the life cycle stage, are carried out based on the selection of supply chain development strategies.This need is realized with the help of formalized methods for selecting projects that most correspond to the company's development strategy and the stage of its life cycle. Depending on the goals of the management, the strategies for further development implemented through individual projects will be different. Based on what development strategy the company sets for itself, this will be the main list of projects that have the greatest value for the company. This research holds both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, it contributes to the development of the theory of supply chain management, project management, and strategic management, particularly in the domain of project planning and execution. Practically, it serves as a decision-making tool in the development and implementation of strategies through projects within the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Vertical integration of suppliers typically benefits consumers by avoiding the issues associated with successive monopolies, where prices may be excessively high. The separation of long-distance and local services by the Department of Justice may seem counterintuitive, potentially driven by concerns over AT&amp;T's size rather than economic rationale. This paper suggests that integrated monopolies have more willingness to build demand rigidity due to an absence of the free-riding problem, leading to higher prices. The implications extend to regulated firms and social media, highlighting the complexity of antitrust actions and their economic consequences on market dynamics and consumer welfare.</jats:p>"

The combination of the virtual world and the real world has always been a hot topic that human society has always been concerned about. This paper focuses on the different stages of private investment in the development of virtual reality technology and the changes in valuation through these stages as well as some advantages and disadvantages of these valuation methods for the VR industry. This paper focuses on the four stages of development experienced by the VR industry, what products are available in these four stages and some of the contributions made by these products. These four stages correspond to the private investment, valuation analysis of the four stages, this paper discusses with three valuation methods (PEG valuation method, market present rate valuation method, and price-to-sales (PS) valuation method). The enterprise value and market capitalization of some well-known VR companies outside China are unfolded, pointing out that for such a high-risk and high-growth industry as VR, sometimes there may be no equivalence.

As traditional manufacturing declines, the role of the service sector has become increasingly vital in both high-income and developing economies, especially given its growing share in global GDP. The article begins by analyzing the core characteristics of service trade, such as intangibility and heterogeneity, along with its unique trade patterns in the global market. Subsequently, using a case study approach, the paper discusses in detail the application of supply chain management in the service industry, highlighting how digital transformation and global networks enable services to operate across borders and regions, enhancing delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction. Taking Accenture as an example, it demonstrates how strategic integration and technology implementation can optimize the global service supply chain. Lastly, the paper identifies current research limitations and offers future research directions, emphasizing the potential value of cross-cultural management and environmental sustainability in service supply chain management. The findings reveal that the effective management of service supply chains is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in a globalized market. Service providers must adapt to digital innovations and leverage global partnerships to ensure service consistency and adaptability across various markets. The conclusion highlights the necessity of integrating environmental sustainability and cross-cultural management into supply chain practices to foster corporate social responsibility and improve global service delivery. This study offers a foundation for future research directions, emphasizing the potential value of these integrations in enhancing the overall efficiency and impact of service supply chains. </jats:p>"

The article contradicts criticism of the extraterritorial effects of the acts, underlining a legislative purpose as part of the national business law regarding fair competition and consumer protection besides the purpose of improving life conditions. The acts are part of an international socially responsible business law. The CSDDD is introducing a new specific civil liability provision. It also brings significant advancements in conflict-of-law principles by introducing mandatory liability norms that apply regardless of jurisdiction. Implementing due diligence obligations in complex international supply chains poses challenges for companies, requiring robust risk management systems and ongoing adjustments. This strict regulation must be balanced with the practical feasibility of Corporate Social Responsibility duties, and a reasonable allocation of responsibilities must take place without risking that the effect of the legislation will stay behind formalistic compliance requirements. The concept of organizational responsibility plays a core role in this balancing process.</jats:p>"

This finding allows us to condition on the stock of houses and estimate the corresponding Inner Ring demand curve using ordinary least squares. In the Middle and Outer Rings—where the supply curve for houses has positive elasticity—we use instrumental variables to estimate the demand curve for houses. For all three locations, we obtain theoretically reasonable point estimates of standard demand elasticities, although the degree of uncertainty surrounding the Outer Ring estimates is relatively large. Averaging across the three regions of Sydney, the price elasticity of demand for houses is −1.3, cross-price elasticity with units is 1.1, and income elasticity is 2.1. Based on our elasticity estimates, only in the Outer Ring are any of the direct burdens of stamp duty born by buyers (about 40 percent).</jats:p>"

This study compares supply-leading versus demand-following financial evolution assumptions using panel co-integration analysis and vector error correction models. To fully understand financial progress, the research integrates multiple variables. A complex and intricate link is shown by empirical evidence. Short-term supply-leading features include GDP to stock market capitalization and private sector credit. However, monetary liability growth follows demand. The long-term relationship between economic growth and private-sector loans is negative. This study shows that the causal relationship depends on the financial development index used. Additionally, the study distinguishes between transitory changes and lasting equilibrium connections. The study also found a dynamic association between financial development and economic growth as an economy matures. The supply-leading concept states that supply drives the stock market in early development. However, as the economy grows, a demand-following pattern arises, supporting the contradiction. This study offers a deep knowledge of the complex relationship between financial development and economic growth in Europe. The research uses powerful econometric tools and financial development indicators to demonstrate the importance of nuanced understanding for good policy making.\r\nSupply-leading,Keywords: Economic Growth, Financial Development, Demand-following,  Panel Cointegration, Vector Error Correction Model, Panel Causality</jats:p>"

In this article, three different solutions, namely, hydrogen, batteries, and carbon capture and storage, are discussed with respect to resources, energy, and financial demand.

This study, employs a questionnaire distributed to employees across three manufacturing organizations in South Africa, aiming to explore these concepts. The questionnaire draws its theoretical framework from the McArthur foundation’s butterfly model. Findings reveal awareness of circular economy and sustainable sourcing among senior employees as opposed to line workers, underscoring the need to access knowledge in this domain. Additionally, there's a clear emphasis on the cross-functional nature of circular economy activities, highlighting the necessity for departmental collaboration. However, integration obstacles persist, including a lack of initial costs and resistance to change. Addressing these challenges is crucial for a smoother transition to sustainability. The study also indicates a growing emphasis on social and environmental factors in supplier selection, alongside cost-effectiveness. This study also finds that educational initiatives must be accessible to employees at all levels, and cross-functional collaboration remains essential for holistic integration. Ultimately, organizations must recognize the ongoing nature of incorporating circular economy principles and continuously spread knowledge while navigating change management and process transformation challenges for a sustainable future in supply chain operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, the concurrent occurrences of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have led to global disruptions in supply chains and a surge in commodity prices. Major advanced economies have experienced an increase in inflation rates and a decline in economic activity. Against this economic backdrop, this paper aims to address the strained condition of supply chains by employing the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) alongside commodity price indices. Furthermore, it seeks to examine how fluctuations in these variables affect Japan’s macroeconomic landscape through local projection and structural Vector Autoregression (VAR). In the local projection analysis, it has been observed that the strain on supply chains induces sustained increases in consumer and producer prices, further contributing to long-term declines in production. Within the structural VAR model framework, the identification of structural shocks is conducted through sign restrictions, affirming the significance of supply chain shocks and energy and food price shocks as crucial factors contributing to recent price increases. This confirmation is supported by variance decomposition and historical decomposition analyses. </jats:p>",

Of particular concern is the challenge of attracting suitable talent to sustain its fast growth and developing future leaders to ensure that cross-border interactions remain culturally safe and respectful. Whilst it is agreed that much work has begun in establishing technical Halal competence within supply chains (Abd Rahman, Abd Mubin, Yusof, &amp; Kamarulzaman, 2021; Hashim &amp; Shariff, 2016), there remains a dearth of discussion around the design and development of a leadership framework to ensure its ongoing sustainability. In this respect, current knowledge around leadership in the Halal diaspora appears to consist of narrow definitions drawn from dominant Western-centric understandings of effective leadership (Weir, 2010). However, since these definitions are disconnected from their cultural contexts and cross-border implications, they can result in incongruities in their application, particularly in an Asian context (Harsanto &amp; Roelfsema, 2015). The increasingly complex trading environment in this area would suggest that more focused research is needed to develop meaningful, respectful and relevant Halal sectorial leadership competency frameworks that successfully integrate the necessary socio-political values and cross-cultural complexities inherent in modern supply chains.</jats:p>"

Through a case study of a CBT destination in Kok Sathon, Thailand, a mixed-method research approach was utilized, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. The study incorporated a literature review, field surveys, interviews with 35 key informants, and questionnaires administered to 400 tourists. The findings reveal that waste in the CBT management process manifested in nine categories: non-participation/non-community involvement; lack of identity/storytelling; unclear communication; overproduction/over-processing; waiting/delay; transportation/motion; non-organization and management; defects; and tourism marketing. Following the implementation of improvements, a reduction in staff activities was observed by 33.33% and service process time by 5.61%. The research not only provides empirical evidence of waste in CBT supply chain management but also demonstrates the impact of applying lean principles to address inefficiencies. Furthermore, it offers insights into optimizing tourism resources in CBT operations and serves as a guide for enhancing efficiency in service organizations. This work introduces a new framework that challenges traditional compartmentalized problem-solving methods in tourism and emphasizes the importance of every step in the process—from inception to conclusion—to enhance understanding of the root causes of issues and facilitate necessary changes. These reductions in waste are directly aligned with the values desired by tourists, indicating a successful alignment of operational improvements with tourist expectations.</jats:p>"

The objective is to identify the empirical evidence regarding the extent and characteristics of this endogeneity specifically concerning variables such as monetary base, credit, demand deposit, and industrial production index.\r\nDesign/ Methodology/ Approach: The study utilizes Rwandan data from January 2012 to December 2022, the study used data provided by the National Bank of Rwanda and the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda. The study employs descriptive analysis which involves examining descriptive statistics for each variable to understand the data's characteristics and assess the dispersion of the data points from their mean, time series analysis, cointegration testing, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modelling, and Vector error correction model (VECM), were also be used in the research.\r\nFindings:  This research reveals that in Rwanda, the monetary base and overall monetary aggregates are primarily influenced by the extent of lending by commercial banks and demand deposits. It identifies a short-term causal relationship wherein the monetary base affects bank loans and the money supply. However, in the short term, the quantity of deposits, money supply, and the monetary base appear to have no direct impact on the volume of loans extended by commercial banks. The models validate that monetary indicators are chiefly influenced by the industrial production index, bank deposits, and the volume of loans issued by commercial banks\r\nResearch Limitation/Implications: Establishing clear causality between money supply and economic variables such as output and inflation is challenging due to the potential for bidirectional causality. The money supply can influence these variables, and vice versa, making it difficult to identify the direction and magnitude of causal relationships.\r\nPractical Implications: The study's emphasis on the pivotal role played by commercial banks and their lending activities in the creation of money in Rwanda provides valuable insights into the country's banking sector dynamics.\r\nSocial Implications: This knowledge can be used to design policies that promote financial inclusion, ensuring banks' activities contribute to wider economic goals.\r\nOriginality/ Value: The use of a range of analytical techniques, including descriptive analysis, time series analysis, cointegration testing, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) modelling, and Vector error correction model (VECM), adds rigour to the analysis and enhances the robustness of the findings.</jats:p>"

However, the water source supplied is not functioning properly. Public-private partnership innovation through four East Java Regency/City Regional Drinking Water Companies (PDAM) with the Umbulan Drinking Water Supply System (SPAM) is a solution to overcome water limitations. This research examined the role of Public-Private Partnerships from the perspective of disruptive innovation, a new collaborative form in Indonesia. This type of qualitative descriptive research involves community members and informants from government organizations related to PT Meta Adhya Tirta Umbulan. Research findings showed that Umbulan SPAM, as a new technological innovation used by local drinking water companies, had not provided meaningful results because the quality of human resources still needs to be improved. They had still not been able to adopt innovations that were implemented based on the amount of water wasted and the purpose of its distribution, and the company operates by its values to achieve its vision and goals and consistently complied with applicable regulations and standard operating procedures (SOP) to maintain appropriate standards. In the face of various difficulties, change is inevitable. As a collaborative tool, public-private partnerships are a byproduct of transformation. The capacity to survive in today's technologically transformed environment is essential for survival and adapting to change. </jats:p>"

This paper focuses on the military industrial supply chain to demonstrate the development of risk assessment and supplier resilience models considering one-off disruption events such as the COVID-19 disruption. Methods: We establish relevant resilience-based categories through a literature review, supported by the experiences of supply chain experts within the military industry. We quantify the severity of the identified resilience categories, their detectability, and their occurrence probabilities. The failure modes and effects analysis technique is used to evaluate the risk priorities for the resilience categories to develop a risk assessment model. The risk assessment model is then extended to a supplier resilience model by incorporating specific rare disruption factors, which can act as a scenario planning tool. Results: It is found that (i) the top four resilience sub-categories are financial, topical data, business continuity planning, and supply chain mapping, while cost reduction strategies and green material usage are the least important; (ii) the main areas requiring focus are topical data, supply chain depth awareness, business continuity management, and internal risk management; and (iii) suppliers have least resilience in the areas of ‘topical information’ and ‘business continuity strategy’. Conclusions: The tool developed can help military industrial supply chains identify the main areas to enhance resilience from multiple perspectives of severity, occurrence probability, detectability, and suppliers.</jats:p>"

Bangladesh heavily relies on the alluvial aquifers of the Bengal Basin as a source of irrigation and drinking water. Due to the flat topography, arsenic within an aquifer is not easily flushed out of the system. Additionally, continuous, unregulated pumping causes arsenic from deeper aquifers to migrate to shallower levels. This study simulates groundwater and contaminant transport in the alluvial aquifers of the Bengal Basin by comparison between two scenarios prior to human intervention with different sea levels, employing a combination of MODFLOW, MODPATH and MT3DMS. The simulations demonstrate that the hydraulic gradient and flow rates were higher during periods of considerably lower sea levels than they are at present. Additionally, it would require 5,600 years for the Holocene aquifer and 3,300 years for the Last Glacial Period aquifer to flush arsenic to the Bangladesh standard concentrations in drinking water in a 100-m-thick contaminated aquifer. This implies that if the sea level continues to rise with climate change, it will be difficult to remove arsenic from the alluvial aquifers in the Bengal Basin by natural flushing, which means artificial interventions need to be done for the interest of nation's health.</jats:p>",

This article presents a model for optimizing biomass supply chains using a linear programming framework integrated with a geographic information system (GIS). Based on a given type of biomass resource, its calorific value, price, distance from the power plant, and transportation costs, the model identifies the optimal source of biomass, allowing it to cover the demand for the required total energy value with the lowest possible costs. The case study includes the Połaniec power plant in southeastern Poland and potential sources of forest biomass and agricultural straw within 100 km of the plant. The impact of constraints on the availability and cost of biomass was analyzed in the following scenarios: (1) all forest and agriculture biomass is available, (2) forest area in Natura 2000 network is excluded, and (3) firewood and forests with dominated ecological and social function are excluded. Unit costs of biomass varied depending on biomass availability and energy demands. The lowest unit costs of biomass (3.19 EUR/MJ) were for energy demand at the level of 1 TJ yearly for all kinds of biomass and the highest (4.91 EUR/MJ) for ecological and social constraints and energy demand 4 TJ. As energy demand increased, unit costs increased, and the ability to meet this demand with just one type of biomass decreased. The energy biomass sector can utilize the model to benefit both biomass producers and their final buyers.</jats:p>"

Simplifying public procurement and reducing procurement administrative costs for the public and private sectors can deliver substantial benefits at the national and European levels. However, the complexity and diversity of public procurement processes, as well as the huge expenditure at hand, implement automatic systems tailored to specific procurement needs necessary. This paper shows how artificial intelligence, and in particular machine learning techniques, can be used to modernize public procurement. It presents implemented systems and showcases pilot projects. The results of an extensive evaluation are also reported.\nThe paper also argues that public procurement should be used more strategically by public administrations. This means aligning procurement actions with overall business objectives and using procurement to leverage supplier innovation and create a competitive advantage. Such advanced objectives are seldom achieved through the lowest price model. The paper also contains several recommendations for both the supply and demand sides to help realize the full potential of public procurement. On the supply side, recommendations relate to a better understanding of how artificial intelligence can be used in procurement activities, working with AI systems, and creating AI systems. On the demand side, recommendations involve the careful planning of how and when to use AI in procurement activities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Noise pollution is one of the consequences of urbanization that can cause environmental disturbances in urban areas. Urban ecosystems provide noise reduction services through Urban Green infrastructures (UGIs). Many studies have been conducted to evaluate and model traffic noise, but none have addressed the flow, supply, and demand of noise reduction ecosystem services. The main purpose of this paper is to present a new methodology for estimating flow, supply, and demand for noise reduction in Hamadan city that has not been mentioned in any paper so far. UGIs were classified into six main categories: agricultural lands, gardens, parks, abandoned lands, single trees, and street trees. A total of 57 sampling stations for sound measurement were made in August 2018. The current map of noise pollution (flow) was created using the Kriging method. The amount of supply was measured up to a distance of 50 meters from the main roads based on two approaches (the distance effect and the sound barrier effect). To quantify the demand, the current sound intensity level in the noise-sensitive land uses was compared with standards. Zonal statistics was used for spatial analysis of supply-demand in the urban neighborhood as a working unit. Results showed that at distances of 5m, 10m, 15m, and 20m, the average noise reduction was found to be 1.61, 2.83, 3.92, and 5.33 dB, respectively. Sound barriers at distances of 5m and 10m resulted in an average sound reduction of 1.61 and 2.83 dB, respectively. Individual trees, strip trees, abandoned lands, parks, and gardens led to a decrease in traffic noise by 0.3, 1, 0.1, 3.5, and 4.5 dB, respectively. The clustering analysis revealed a significant spatial clustering of noise pollution in Hamedan. The results and new methodology of this research can be used in similar areas to estimate the supply and demand of noise reduction and also for decision-makers to take management actions to increase supply and meet the demand for noise reduction service.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Providing electricity needs from renewable energy sources is an important issue in the energy policies of countries. Especially changes in energy usage rates make it necessary to use renewable energy resources to be sustainable. The electricity usage rate must be estimated accurately to make reliable decisions in strategic planning and future investments in renewable energy. This study aims to accurately estimate the renewable energy production rate to meet Türkiye's electricity needs from renewable energy sources. For this purpose, well-known Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AB), and Gradient Boosting (GB) were utilized. In obtaining forecast data, 15 variables were considered under the oil resources, environmental parameters, and economic factors which are the main parameters affecting renewable energy usage rates. The RF algorithm performed best with the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE, 0.084%), mean absolute error (MAE, 0.035), root mean square error (RMSE, 0.063), and mean squared error (MSE, 0.004) values in the test dataset. The R<sup>2</sup> value of this model is 0.996% and the MAPE value is calculated lower than 10%. The AB model, on the other hand, has the highest error values in the test data set, but still provides an acceptable prediction accuracy. The R<sup>2</sup> value was 0.792% and the MAPE value (0.371%) of this model was calculated to be in the range of 20%&lt;MAPE ≤ 50%. This study, with its proposed forecasting models, makes significant contributions to energy policies to develop appropriate policies only for planning the amount of electricity usage needed in the future. In this context, this study emphasizes that renewable energy-based electricity generation transformation should be considered as an important strategic goal in terms of both environmental sustainability and energy security.</p>"

For practitioners in the indirect categories, the sheer number of suppliers that must be interacted with is sometimes daunting. Finding the keys to building successful buyer–supplier relationships is often reduced to a formulaic transactional process. To be truly successful, you must become well versed in how your own personal traits become key in building relationships with suppliers. Suppliers that provide goods and services, considered indirect purchases, are not always transactional relationships. While these suppliers do not provide raw materials for your company’s production, they supply the infrastructure that supports the whole company and helps bring those finished products or services to market. With that in mind, it is integral to the success of your company that you have good relationships with these suppliers, built on the foundation of trust. In building that trust, the practitioner must become comfortable with the aspects of transparency, integrity and being their authentic self when working with the representatives of their suppliers. While there are risks and pitfalls that must be kept in mind, the personal traits that you present to your suppliers could very well be the key to your success or failure in your role as a procurement professional.</jats:p>"

What emerged in the discourse was how central to everyday practices was the need for business leaders to network and ‘dance a political tango’ to ensure quality in service provision. Illuminated was how the leaders pushed back against governmental and economic structures by using models of brokerage to compensate for economic and staffing deficiencies. This is essential for the ongoing improvement and performance of home care in the Australian social arena of caring for our most vulnerable consumers.</jats:p>",

The impact unpredictable events have on supply chains remains a relatively underexplored area that requires further research and analysis. Current studies primarily concentrate on singular events, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on supply chains. This research aims to identify the main challenges in supply chain management resulting from unforeseen events and the actions taken in supply chains in response to them. The research is based on individual in-depth interviews conducted with a purposive sample of experts in supply chain management using a partially structured interview questionnaire. The research results were analysed using Nvivo v. 17.1, software for qualitative data analysis. A hybrid approach was employed for data coding. The research indicates several problems and the main remedial actions in supply chains in response to unforeseen events. Unforeseen events in the supply chain affect almost all supply chain operations: procurement, planning (including inventory planning and maintenance of company resources and production lines), logistics management (including transportation), and order management. The research indicated that cooperation, integration, and information exchange within the supply chain are crucial for effective responses to unforeseen events. Furthermore, the research highlighted the positive impact of unforeseen events on supply chain innovation. Moreover, there is an observed prevalence of intuitive management, particularly when responding to unexpected events. The research findings can serve as a basis for further discussions and studies on the potential impact and consequences of future unexpected events on supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

Existing studies consider the consequences of territorial control without answering a critical question: what motivates rebel territorial control in the first place? Territorial control requires careful explanation. While it confers important benefits it is also costly to achieve and exposes rebels to state attack. This paper argues that benefits exceed costs when territorial control provides rebels with a reliable source of organizational supply. High-value lootable natural resources—resources available in abundance that are easy to extract and transport for sale—represent key components of a rebel's supply chain. To test the theory's implications, we introduce new cross- and sub-national time-series data on territorial control in sub-Saharan Africa and couple it with a new dataset of local natural resource values. We use an instrumental variable approach to address core endogeneity concerns. Results both substantiate our theoretical approach and provide evidence running contrary to existing arguments. These findings demonstrate that valuable natural resources, logistical supply constraints, and, more broadly, rebel military strategy, are critically important and need to be incorporated into work on civil war, territorial control, and rebel governance.</jats:p>",

Methodologically, we mobilize spatial econometric techniques to take into account the spatial interdependence between the various countries involved in the analysis. Results from the SDM (Spatial Durbin Spatial) model reveal that the number of bank branches has a positive and significant influence on credit supply. In addition, bank size has a positive effect on credit supply. Nevertheless, inflation hurts the credit supply. Considering spatial effects has also shown us that the supply of credit from one country to another also depends on the volume of credit it receives from other countries. In terms of economic policy implications, banks in the zone need to promote the strategy of geographic expansion of their bank branches. Similarly, monetary authorities need to make efforts to keep inflation rates at moderate, stable levels, and encourage the emergence of large banks. </jats:p>"

Through numerical simulation, this paper analyzes the relationship between pricing and the overall profit of the supply chain, compares the difference of the overall profit of supply chain under two different pricing strategies, centralized pricing and decentralized pricing, and analyzes the influence of information sharing degree on the overall profit of the supply chain. The results show that the overall profit of the supply chain under centralized pricing decisions is significantly higher than that under decentralized pricing decisions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the development of new construction technology, increasing attention is being paid to 3D printing due to its construction efficiency as well as its sustainability. Numerous researchers have determined its benefits in cost reduction, resource savings, safety assurance, etc. Although various advantages have been identified, there are limitations and challenges in technology implementation. Especially since it is a new construction method, 3D printing construction projects will have a very different supply chain compared to traditional projects. As part of a research programme investigating the 3D printing construction supply chain in a New Zealand context, this study systematically analysed the research about 3D printing adoption and supply chain challenges in the construction sector. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was adopted as the guideline for literature selection. PRISMA is designed to assist researchers in reporting the review research focus and methodology, and examining the findings from published literature. NVivo was then adopted to code and analyse the selected publications to gather the data necessary for our study. The literature was analysed from the perspectives of the research focus, research methods, and findings. Studies about 3D printing implementation, benefits and barriers, as well as its significance are also analysed. As a result, this research found existing research gaps, including the fragmented situation of management-related research in the 3D printing construction sector, insufficient research in top management for 3D printing construction implementation, and changes to supply chain management practices in 3D printing construction projects. A decision support system demo for supply chain management is drafted in this paper, which requires further study. The research outcome highlighted the existing studies in 3D printing construction implementation and supply chain, and initiated a research topic on supply chain decision making. The result contributes to the theoretical and practical development of 3D printing technology in the construction industry. This review paper also inspires future studies on supply chain frameworks and theoretical models.</jats:p>"

The use of slow-release Mo sources could potentially reduce leaching losses from soils and increase crop yields. In this study, we assessed mechanochemistry as a green method to produce slow-release Mo sources. Molybdenum compounds (MoO3 or (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) were mechanochemically (MC) treated with ZnO to synthesize compounds with a Mo content of 1–36%. Reduced Mo solubility after MC treatment, compared to the initial Mo source, was obtained with the MoO3 source and these composites were used for co-compaction with macronutrient fertilizers. Macronutrient pellets with 0.2% Mo were compacted using the 4% Mo and 36% Mo (characterized as ZnMoO4) compounds. A column dissolution test showed that the 4% Mo compound in a macronutrient carrier (DAP and MAP) only released around 40% of the total Mo compared to 80% for a non-MC treated control over 72 h. Column leaching using two soils revealed that the release behavior of Mo was strongly related to the pH of the leachate, which was affected by both the soil pH and the macronutrient carrier. More Mo was released when the MC-treated compound was co-compacted with diammonium phosphate (DAP) compared to monoammonium phosphate (MAP). The MC-treated compound with 4% Mo showed significantly less leaching than the control without ball milling when co-compacted with both MAP and DAP. In a pot trial with simulated leaching, the uptake of Mo was greater for the MC-treated 4% Mo compound co-compacted into DAP than for the other Mo sources. Overall, our results indicate that MC-treated MoO3-ZnO could be used as a slow-release Mo source in high-rainfall areas.</p>"

However, several challenges such as rapid urbanization and the gap between housing supply and demand are facing this goal. This study attributes the housing supply gap to KSA’s reductionist approach to the housing supply value chain (HSVC) and proposes adopting Industry 4.0 technologies. The study explores the challenges and prospects of integrating these technologies for sustainable housing delivery across the HSVC. Through action research, data were gathered via random sampling and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 24, incorporating a principal component analysis (PCA). The findings from the analysis identify key challenges such as data management infrastructure, construction industry regulations, uncertain housing delivery policies, and resistance to change. Despite these challenges, there is a strong potential for adopting Industry 4.0 technologies to achieve sustainable housing delivery. This study offers a blueprint for policymakers and housing industry leaders to develop a comprehensive strategy for adopting 4IR technologies in housing delivery, enhancing collaboration and driving progress towards Saudi Arabia’s sustainable housing goals.</jats:p>"

Grain merchants and market speculators are involved in their distribution across the country. Their low production outputs with imports restriction made their supply grossly inadequate to meet the demand. This paper examined selected grains output in Nigeria from 2010 to 2022, analysed grain supply chain and examined the implications of the activities of grains merchants on grains hoarding. The study used secondary data on output of maize, millet, sorghum, soybean, groundnut and cowpea. Data was presented using table and graph with the aid of Stata software. Conceptual analysis was adopted for the demonstration of grains supply flow. In 1,000 metric tonnes, output of millet reduced from 5,170 in 2010 to 2,000 in 2022. That of maize increased from 7,677 in 2010 to 12,745 in 2021; sorghum’s output reduced from 7,141 to 7,000 while that of soybean increased from 142 in 2010 to 680 in 2022. Outputs of millet and sorghum dipped between 2011 and 2013. Grain merchants and speculators hoard grains and sell at higher prices to households and feeds industry due to yearly excess demand over supply. Households buy grains and livestock products at higher prices, households in turn makes labour available to farmers at higher prices with concurrent general price increases. This affects food and feed availability. The paper recommended that Government should purchase grains directly from farmers. Industrial users should also be encouraged to be off-takers of grains through contract farming</jats:p>"

A data-driven approach, such as using a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, can provide insights. By recognizing and addressing customer psychological anxiety, CSR can provide better support, which leads to higher customer satisfaction. When customers feel understood and supported, they are more likely to have a positive perception of the company and its supply chain services.\r\nSubjects and methods- The study aims to use the LDA method to explore consumer psychology anxiety and its attributes for CSR in supply chain management. The corpus is collected from the Web of Science core collection with keywords “CSR” and “supply chain management”, and 965 articles related to the field from1990-2022. LDA is a natural language processing technique that uncovers thematic structures in textual data. By applying LDA to customer feedback, businesses can identify anxiety attributes. Steps include data collection, preprocessing, LDA model training, topic interpretation, and deriving business insights.\r\nResults- The study used the Python program to run LDA, after putting in the text data, the study identify number of 11 topics according to the value of topic coherence, then identified topics based on the most representative words or phrases within each topic combined CSR and supply chain related knowledge and fit the service quality model to find the customer psychological anxiety attributes, the results reveal that customer tend to be anxiety about the aspects of reliability and assurance for CSR in supply chain management, more concern about the environmental and social aspects responsibility. \r\nConclusions- The study revealed customer psychological anxiety about CSR initiatives and strategies within their supply chain management. The results show that consumers feel most anxiety about the aspects of reliability and assurance of supply chain management. They are concerned about the environment and social responsibility that the supply chain enterprise is taking, especially in the food supply chain field. By addressing these concerns, organizations can enhance customer satisfaction, build stronger relationships, and improve their overall CSR performance. The findings of this study also contribute to the field by providing valuable guidance, further research can add other text mining methods like structural topic modelling, or add deeper quantitative research in the field and develop of a new customer-CSR service quality model in the service industry. </jats:p>"

Recently, there has been a push by graduate medical education to counter resident burnout, as demonstrated by resident wellness initiatives becoming a requirement for residency programs in the United States (2). At our institution, a source of burnout was the time it took to gather supplies for critical bedside procedures, which was addressed by instituting a central supply closet.</jats:p> <jats:p><jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold>: A checklist was made of the supplies needed for four common bedside procedures: central venous access, arterial line placement, thoracostomy tube placement, and incision and drainage. 9 surgery residents were individually timed to locate the equipment required for each individual procedure with the supply closet and without. A survey was used to evaluate resident satisfaction in the number of locations to search, timeliness, and ability to provide quality patient care before and after the supply closet. This survey was done on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very dissatisfied, and 5 being very satisfied.

Specifically, it examines the impact of digital collaboration, intelligence optimization, agility, and responsiveness, as well as end-to-end transparency across the entire supply chain for sustainability.\nStudy Design/Methodology/Approach - A quantitative research design combined with a deductive method was employed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 125 respondents in Pakistan's manufacturing sector between May 2, 2024, and May 20, 2024. The survey utilized a five-point Likert scale, and statistical techniques such as regression analysis and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were used to analyze the collected data.\nFindings- The study found a strong relationship between digital transformation and sustainable supply chain performance. Key factors included digital collaboration, which improved communication and cooperation, and AI/ML-driven optimization, which enhanced demand planning, inventory control, and process efficiency. End-to-end transparency fostered trust and accountability across the supply chain. While agility positively influenced sustainable performance, other factors were not statistically significant, indicating potential additional influences.\nPractical Implications- The findings suggest that manufacturing practitioners should adopt digital tools to improve their supply chain operations. Policymakers are encouraged to implement supportive policies and legislation to promote digitalization. The results imply that digital collaboration, intelligent optimization, and full transparency can significantly enhance sustainable supply chain performance, thereby contributing to social welfare, environmental sustainability, and economic growth.\nOriginality/Novelty - This study is original in its focus on the relationship between digital transformation and sustainable supply chain performance within the context of Pakistan’s manufacturing sector. It highlights the importance of digital collaboration, AI-driven optimization, and transparency in achieving sustainability goals, offering new insights into the drivers of sustainable supply chain practices.</jats:p>"

As per the data of DWSSM (2019) even though the basic level water supply coverage of Nepal is 87.22% among the water supply schemes providing service to the people only 28.13% of the schemes are fully functional. The lack of functionality questions the investment of different agencies as projects do not operate throughout project life and the public are facing the problem of not getting safe and reliable water. The main aim of this study was to assess the post-construction status of these projects in relation to their sustainable management. For this, six water supply projects completed over the last five years have been studied. During the study, the data was collected from the structured questionnaire, focal group discussion, Key informants’ interviews and field observations. These water supply projects were evaluated based on five main criteria namely economic, technical, social, institutional, and environmental factors. From the study it is observed that the sustainability score of Syaude Lifting WSP is 62.82%, Serokhola WSP is 66.74%, Lumre WSP is 64.25%, Sudame WSP is 54.97%, Bhachok WSP is 63.74% and Chisapani WSP is 76.90%. The economic and technical aspect of sustainability is found poor in all of these water supply projects. The major problem faced by the community is the lack of financial resources and technical capacity-building programs in the construction stage which have ultimately hampered the project's sustainability. Post-construction training, technical and capacity-building training, support policies and programs are important requirements for the sustainable development of rural water supply systems.</jats:p>"

This research aims to evaluate the performance of XYZ Company's Distribution Center (DC) supply chain using the well-established Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. SCOR provides a validated set of performance indicators, which will be further weighted using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to reflect their relative importance to XYZ Company's specific goals. The Snorm De Boer method will then be employed to normalize the final score for each indicator.  A traffic light system will visually represent performance gaps, highlighting areas requiring immediate improvement. This research will analyze data from 27 key metrics across 2022 and 2023, providing a holistic picture of DC performance. While preliminary results indicate an overall \"average\" to \"good\" performance (69.54 and 70.08, respectively), further analysis will identify specific areas for improvement based on SCOR Best Practices. This research will ultimately propose practical solutions to enhance XYZ Company's overall supply chain efficiency and effectiveness.</jats:p>"

We used the theory‐based viable system model to diagnose the proposed holistic model of SSC. The results show that especially the low‐tier SC members require supporting frameworks to develop and maintain the capacity for sustainable interactions with nature and society. These supportive frameworks should be provided by the regulatory bodies, society, and nature representatives to surpass the limited SC profit‐oriented incentives and structures. The implications of the proposed models are aimed at developing supportive SC sustainable policies and improving the capacities of SC members to coexist with local social and natural environments. Regulators, society, and the natural environment representatives can apply the proposed models to establish new policies for sustainable interactions between SC members and other societal stakeholders.</jats:p>"

Notably, Beetaloo wells have exhibited initial production rates over 30 days (IP30), spanning from 1.1 to 5.2 mmcf/day, and there is an evident trend of increasing frac stages with each new well as operators continuously optimise stimulation. This research paper presents comprehensive Beetaloo modelling results, encompassing well type curves, a comparative analysis with the renowned Marcellus shale play in the United States (frequently used as a reference point for Beetaloo), production forecasts, economic assessments, and an examination of potential commercialisation pathways. Based on our modelling findings, Beetaloo’s estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) per well ranges from 7 to 14 bcf, with deeper wells into the Velkerri B Shale demonstrating relatively higher productivity. We anticipate that, with full-scale development, Beetaloo could attain peak production rates of 1 bcf/day, supported by a peak annual drilling rate averaging 50–60 wells. Overall, the Beetaloo Basin possesses the potential to recover close to 8 tcf of low reservoir CO2 gas, opening doors to the possibility of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports reaching up to 4.5 mtpa and domestic gas supplies of around 94 mmcf/day, limited to the existing infrastructure capacity connecting to the east coast gas markets.

In this case, the size and position of the graphic display cannot be accurately determined. Aiming at these problems, we propose a new automatic typesetting algorithm for graphic languages. Use the constant method to calculate the display size of buffered images in graphic design. The ant colony algorithm is used to solve the optimal solution, so that the optimal display position of the graphics in the graphic design can be obtained. Graphics are powerful. For example, excellent graphics such as the presentation of forms, the expression and transmission of information, often make people feel relaxed and empathetic, shorten the distance between each other, and make communication smoother. As a result, graphic languages have become an important part of modern graphic design and are used more and more frequently.

The results show that the campaigns portray European corporations as perpetrators, people in producing countries as mere victims, and NGOs as heroic liberators. NGOs reproduce postcolonial trajectories by advocating a supply chain law in the Global North as the central solution to problems in the Global South. While rescue politics is thus the defining feature of NGO campaigns, there is no evidence of the strategic use of pseudo-causal narratives that are empirically inaccurate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy supply is responsible of more than 80% of anthropogenic carbon emissions whose rapid accumulation in the atmosphere is in turn responsible of unsustainable global warming (overshoot of 1.5 °C) to avoid which carbon neutrality should be achieved in a few decades. \"Accelerating\" the (supposed) decarbonization of energy supply in sectors different of power generation is commonly considered a necessary step to reach such a goal. Nevertheless, this article points out that (at least in principle) this kind of \"acceleration\" (e.g. through indis- criminate targets and stringent policy provisions, including over-subsidies for RES producers) might not be desirable. In fact, the allocation of renewables (among different uses, different abatement carriers and over time) is by no means a trivial choice. To explain why, we focus on thermal and transport sectors and analyse the main energy carriers of abatement (electrifi- cation, biomethane and hydrogen), looking for intertemporal and interspatial optimization of renewables allocation, by estimating the LSCOA (levelized social cost of abatement), and by accounting for uncertainty about energy prices and renewable costs. The principal conclusion is that, before electricity supply is fully decarbonised, only greenfield biomethane should be allocated to thermal and transport uses, in the meantime \"accelerating\" the allocation of elec- tric renewables to power generation. Only when this latter is almost completely decarbonised, policies should promote deep green (now really) electrification of thermal (not \"hard to abate\") and transport (light-duty) uses. Otherwise, the risk is to significantly slow down the entire process of energy supply decarbonization, and even to undermine the achievement of the climate targets. Finally, regarding green hydrogen, it should be allocated to the so-called \"hard to abate\" uses (including heavy transport) and to improve (as storage option) electric renewable competitiveness</jats:p>",

However, supply chains could be hesitant to utilize a common ERP vendor for fear of intellectual capital loss, increased costs, and IT incapability with existing IT architecture. Relational view theory argues that information sharing and process integration advantages are achieved when supply chain partners share assets, knowledge, and capabilities through relation-specific investments, complementary resources, and knowledge sharing processes. We find evidence that common ERP vendor (CERPV) use is associated with greater supplier and customer efficiency, performance, and partnership strength. Our study directly examines the impact of CERPV use within a supply chain, adding to the limited accounting information systems’ evidence on the role of interorganizational ERP system investments on efficiency.</jats:p>",

Moreover, a power grid drop causes a sudden interruption of the services managed by a server. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) provide backup power when the regular power grid source drops. UPSs can only maintain a server for a short time. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a blackout manager who can correctly shut down the server activities. Moreover, the manager must be able to restore the servers' status when the electrical grid power returns to its normal state. This paper proposes a possible UPS power manager able to manage servers during a prolonged electrical blackout. The UPS power manager identifies the blackout and keeps the servers safe by saving their state and shutting them down properly. Following the power grid restoration, the UPS power manager restarts the servers and restores their state.

In such a context, a comprehensive assessment and forecast of load-bearing capacity needs to be developed. This capacity depends on many complex factors, such as hydrology, hydraulics, and environment, leading to applying a modelling approach. This study aims to propose a hybrid modelling approach to evaluate and predict the river water environmental capacity (RWEC) in a basin. Big data technology with Python is applied to process modelling results and RWEC forecasts. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model predicts RWEC on each reach of the river channel network. The {RWECP, i, P = Nitrate, BOD, Phosphate, i = hourly} data set and related factors form a time series of data used for the LSTM forecasting model. Forecast results are evaluated through the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The results show that the average level over all 24 reaches for 7 forecast days: RMSENitrate = 22.16 (kg/day), RMSEBOD = 38.92 (kg/day), and RMSEPhosphate = 0.79 (kg/day). This is an acceptable result for a complex system and 7-day forecast. The results of the study help significantly with pollution control.</jats:p>",

The comprehensive analysis of profitability, liquidity, efficiency, and stability parameters indicated a consensus that supply chain concentration plays a significant role in positively influencing the financial performance, operational efficiency, and overall resilience of manufacturing companies. These findings underscored the multifaceted benefits of supply chain concentration in the manufacturing sector. However, the analysis of risk exposure and vulnerability to disruptions parameters highlighted another consensus that supply chain concentration in manufacturing firms also introduced amplified strategic and operational risks. This emphasized the importance of adopting a balanced approach that combines the efficiency benefits of concentration with robust risk management strategies to ensure resilience and minimize the financial impact of disruptions. To address the implications of supply chain concentration, a proposed action plan outlined three strategies for enhancing the financial performance of manufacturing firms: Supply Chain Diversification Strategy, Financial Performance Assessment, and Supply Chain Risk Mitigation Strategy. Each strategy spanned a six-month timeline and required specific resources and processes to achieve their respective goals.</jats:p>"

Blockchain technology holds immense potential to transform supply chain processes, but the challenge lies in identifying the most suitable blockchain characteristics to meet the various performance indicators of a supply chain. To overcome this challenge, this study aims to prioritize the most critical blockchain characteristics in a supply chain. The study adopts a two-stage Quality Function Deployment (QFD) methodology to rank blockchain characteristics based on supply chain and software requirements. The methodology evaluates the supply chain performance indicators using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model and software needs using the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) software quality characteristics. After determining the problematic SCOR and ISO software-related metrics, the study utilizes the QFD Stage 1 to obtain the weights of ISO software characteristics and employs the Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) to determine the most crucial blockchain characteristics for QFD Stage 2. The results of this study show that the top priorities for blockchain characteristics in a supply chain are smart contract functionality, privacy, transaction per second, tokenization, security, permissioned network, scalability, cost, modularity, and licensing, in order of importance.</jats:p>"

The growing food demand due to the increasing population is a significant issue. Post-harvest losses (PHL) of maize relate to losses that happen laterally in the whole grain logistics network, after harvest to final consumption. The study was conducted in the district Vehari to assess the different types of post-harvest losses and identify the underlying factors responsible for such losses in the maize supply chain. For this purpose, data were collected from 210 respondents by using purposive samplingtechnique. The sample size includes 120 growers, 30 village traders, 30 commission agents cum wholesaler and 30 retailers. Structured questionnaires were used to gather data from major supply chain actors. The study findings revealed that the average losses at the grower’s level, village traders, commission agent cum wholesaler and retailer were 12.21, 2.36, 3.21 and 1.01 percent of the total production respectively. It is recommended that the implementation of modern storage facilities, drying using advanced technologies, training programs for the supply chain actors, financial innovations, and efficient transportation systems will result in significant reduction of post-harvest losses (PHL) in maize production and thus contribute to food security.</jats:p>"

This study investigates the impact of the invasion on stock prices, profitability and sentiments of agribusinesses along the food supply chain by using an event study, financial data, and a sentiment analysis of annual reports. Overall, the findings show that firms in the food value chain were negatively impacted, with regional and sector‐specific differences. Agribusiness firms in Europe and Japan were more negatively impacted by the war than those in the United States. Stock prices of Brewers, Packaged Food and Meats, Soft drinks, and Tobacco firms were negatively impacted by the invasion, while other sectors experienced no or little impact on stock prices. Fertilizers and Agrochemicals firms overall achieved a higher profitability in 2022 compared to previous years. [EconLit Citations: G01, G12, E44, Q01].</jats:p>"

The fossil fuel-based transportation system in India that gives rise to air pollution has a worse impact on people. To overcome these problems, a sustainability assessment framework is introduced in this study. Ethanol, a member of the biofuel family, is one of the cleanest and most sustainable forms of energy sources. The purpose of this research is to develop a sustainability assessment framework to investigate the environmental feasibility of a supply chain system that provides an end-to-end solution and how it would benefit the transportation sector. A second-generation (2G) ethanol-based supply chain is envisaged, and agro-waste such as corncobs and paddy straw are considered in this study. The assessment is carried out using a heuristic-based method, known as particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, within the framework of circular economy. The results show that the biomass collection in the proposed area produces 2.5 tons of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> per hectare area on average, which is much lower in comparison to 996.6 tons of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> per hectare in the Middle East, the main source of fossil fuel.

Since primary metals are extremely rare in Migration-period contexts, the source(s) of these metals is a central question with the potential to yield new insights into resource acquisition, international contacts and supply and exchange networks in fifth- to early sixth-century Sweden. Using a combination of lead isotope and trace element analyses, we assess the provenance of 19 artefacts of lead, copper and brass, including ingots, rods and casting waste. While the origin of the copper could not be determined with certainty, the results of the brass and lead were intriguing. Three lead melts stem from Swedish lead ore, and represent the earliest direct archaeological evidence for lead extraction in Sweden. By contrast, the brass was imported over long distances. We propose that it reached Helgö as part of a routinized trade with the Byzantine Empire, potentially the eastern Mediterranean region, with one ingot having probable origins in Asia. The results thus indicate both the local exploitation of available ores and far-reaching contacts, which may have extended as far as the Silk Road.</jats:p>",

Particularly in instances where analytical methodologies cannot provide definitive data for food control questions under study, the certificate-based approach of a traceability chain may offer a way of regulatory control for state authorities. Given the rising importance of organic produce and the high share of eggs among the organic produce in the European Union as well as the new EU regulation on organic products and labelling that came into force in 2022, we analyze here how the control of egg production type and marketing standards can be represented within a blockchain-based traceability chain such as to maximize the traceability in compliance with the current relevant EU regulations. Intended for the use by the official food control authorities, a traceability chain for organically produced eggs in the EU would need to be implemented as a permissioned blockchain, since only select entities are allowed to participate. By combining a proof of authority consensus mechanism with issuance of soulbound tokens, we effectively suggest a ‘proof of soulbound authority’ consensus process. The soulbound tokens are issued throughout the administrative chain from the European Commission down to the official food control authorities in individual member states that ultimately certify the control bodies for organic produce. Despite the general limitation of not providing unambiguous proof of the organic status of individual products, the concept discussed here offers advantages with respect to allocation of authority at EU level and therefore might have positive effects beyond the traceability chain.</jats:p>"

Водоснабжение. Наружные сети и сооружения». Приводится краткий обзор имеющихся данных о химических закономерностях процессов окисления железа и сероводорода и факторах, оказывающих влияние на их протекание. На основании данных натурных испытаний, а также опыта длительной эксплуатации водопроводных очистных сооружений в городах Новом Уренгое и Ноябрьске предложена формула для расчета дозы перекиси водорода при очистке природных подземных вод от железа.

A brief overview of the available data on the chemical regularities of the iron and hydrogen sulfide oxidation processes, and the factors affecting their behavior is provided. Based on data of the field tests, as well as on the experience of long-term operation of the water treatment facilities in the cities of Novy Urengoy and Noyabrsk, a formula is proposed for calculating the dose of hydrogen peroxide while removing iron from natural groundwater. Recommendations are given for estimating the demand for this oxidizer while removing hydrogen sulfide from natural groundwater. This technology provides for the drinking water of standard quality. The conclusion is drawn that the use of hydrogen peroxide as a chemical is promising for drinking water supply owing to its working efficiency at low pH values, alkalinity, water temperature; process independence from the silicon, carbon dioxide, oxygen concentrations, as well as low cost, low energy intensity and serviceability of the required equipment.

This study assesses the current situation and outlook of the local industrial potato processing sector and the alignment of the industry’s variety requirements with the priorities set by breeders. Currently, potato processing companies in the three countries use both varieties selected locally from public international germplasm and varieties introduced by Dutch seed companies, and their suitability for processing is discussed as well. Overall, the processing industry pays high attention to traits affecting processing efficiency and consumers’ acceptance while breeders, in spite of being aware of the characteristics required for processing varieties, are more focused on traits related to production and disease resistance. As the processing sector develops further, breeders will have to pay increased attention to the progressively stricter requirements of the industry, striking the right balance between farmers’ and processors’ variety requirements.  While their opinions on the farmers’ acceptability of processing varieties diverge, breeders and industry agree about the challenges represented by the limited access to quality seed and poor business linkages between value chain actors in securing the supply of varieties suitable for processing. Based on these findings, it is recommended to pay more attention to both the development of dual-purpose varieties and the strengthening of the potato value chain through the improvement of business linkages between seed producers, farmers, and processing companies.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Port State Control system aims to ensure that all ships are subject to regular inspections, with particular attention to the ships of insufficient quality. To this end, during the inspection, priority is given to ships that are considered risky. Thetis database is an information system that contributes to the implementation of the Port State Control within the EU (European Unit). It contains data on inspections performed in the EU ports and the Paris Memorandum area. The Paris Memorandum has 27 member states and covers the waters of European coastal states and the North Atlantic basin from North America to Europe. The main goal of the Paris MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) is to eliminate substandard ships through a harmonized Port State Control system. Namely, inspections should ensure that ships meet international safety standards, are safe for the environment, and provide adequate living and working conditions for workers. The primary responsibility for ensuring these standards rests with the ship owner/shipper while the responsibility for ensuring such compliance rests with the flag state. The aim of this analysis is to determine the number of inspections performed in the ports of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Italy, to identify the cause of ship detentions and the most common deficiencies of offshore supply vessels, MODU (Mobile Offshore Drilling Units) and FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) Units. In the observed period, the impact of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was significant, resulting in the decline in the numbers of inspections performed in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, the number of inspections increased, but it still has not reached its pre-pandemic level. During the period that was the subject of research, port state inspections in the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Italy revealed 241 deficiencies. Five areas with the largest number of deficiencies are: Certificate &amp;amp; Documentation, Safety of Navigation, Fire Safety, ISM, and Life-saving appliances, which follow the trend of the lack in the areas of the Paris Memorandum. The greatest increase in deficiencies was recorded in the areas of Labor Conditions-Health protection, Certificate &amp;amp; Documents (Crew Certificate, Documents), Emergency System and Fire safety area, which led to an increase in the number of offshore supply ships retention during the first half of 2022.</jats:p>",

However, investigations that examine the resilience of construction supply chains to incidents of disruptions are limited. This study aims at examining the resilience of construction supply chains to disruption triggered by Covid-19 in Abuja. The study adopted a survey approach, and data was obtained from structured questionnaires administered online to 90 stakeholders and 70 participants involved in different aspects of construction responded. The study found that contractual disputes and scarcity of materials ranked highest as the effects of disruption and that construction practitioners adapted to the disruptions majorly by reducing the number of material requisitions or by integrating equipment to cater for the shortage of workers. The study argues that members of construction supply chains responded to disruption triggered by Covid-19 with changes and adapted the way they worked or operated as acts of resilience.</jats:p>"

Efficient distribution of goods and precise estimation of customer wants are essential for cost reduction. In order to improve supply chain efficiency in the context of cross-border e-commerce, this article combines machine learning approaches with the Internet of Things. The suggested approach consists of two main stages. Order prediction is done in the first step to determine how many orders each merchant is expected to get in the future. In the second phase, allocation operations are conducted and resources required for each retailer are supplied depending on their needs and inventory, taking into account each store’s inventory as well as the anticipated sales level. This suggested approach makes use of a weighted mixture of neural networks to anticipate sales orders. The Capuchin Search Algorithm (CapSA) is used in this weighted combination to concurrently enhance the learning and ensemble performance of models. This indicates that an effort is made to reduce the local error of the learning model at the model level via model weight adjustments and neural network configuration. To guarantee more accurate output from the ensemble model, the best weight for each individual component is found at the ensemble model level using the CapSA method. This method yields the ensemble model’s final output in the form of weighted averages by choosing suitable weight values. With a Root Mean Squared Error of 2.27, the suggested technique has successfully predicted sales based on the acquired findings, showing a minimum decrease of 2.4 in comparison to the comparing methodologies. Additionally, the suggested method’s strong performance is shown by the fact that it was able to minimize the Mean Absolute Percentage Error by 14.67 when compared to other comparison approaches.</jats:p>"

Delivery of parts to tier 1 and OEM on time is the most important part of supply chain management, together with the delivery of on-quality and on-cost control to maintain the competitiveness of the supply chain. There are many suppliers to produce many automotive parts for tier 1. Therefore, the simulation approach properly predicts and prevents the process from getting into trouble during the actual production time. Production process quality control is critical to ensure that the good quality of the parts purchased can be delivered on time. Rubber parts are used widely in automotive, motorcycles, trucks, and other types of vehicles, with small sizes but in huge quantities to support general OEM brands and specific parts. The rubber part manufacturing process is complex and uncertain with compression moulding and rubber curing conditions. Therefore, good conditions can predict the production process's capability to commission and deliver on schedule.A neuro-fuzzy system is adopted and developed to deal with the uncertain process capability under multi-criteria decision-making.The methodology development can be used in the actual rubber part manufacturing supply chain environment and can predict uncertain problems that might occur in the subcontractor factories.The prediction of the production process capability of the rubber part supply chain might be more effective on the real-time monitoring control system and can be tracking location part progress for further planning both success or rescheduling.The platform can be applied to audit and test the actual industrial supply chain, and problem and research questions are brought about from the real supply chain in the local country.The methodology development was originally created for the particular supply chain in rubber automotive parts that can replace the existing system to obtain a more efficient performance evaluation process.</jats:p>",

Methods: the paper uses mathematical modeling methods based on the theory of electrical circuits. The MATLAB software package was used as a modeling tool. Results: expressions are obtained for calculating the maximum transmitted power depending on the length of the substation zone. The dependence of the transmitted power on the minimum voltage on the current collector, the equivalent resistance of traction substations for DC sections, is analyzed. For alternating current sections, the dependence of the transmitted power on the power factor of the traction load is analyzed. The conclusion is made about the relevance of increasing the power factor of an alternating current electric rolling stock.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urbanization confronts the dual challenges of water scarcity and environmental degradation, prompting the exploration of diverse water sources for mitigating these impacts. Inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) has emerged as a solution to balance urban water demand and supply in areas with local water shortages. While IBWT can deliver high-quality water over long distances, it is costly, often contributing significantly to carbon emissions. Reclaimed water use (RWU) presents a promising alternative to address this dilemma. In this paper, a valley region of Chongqing municipality in Southwest China, which is confronted with water and environmental risks resulting from rapid urbanization, was explored and discussed as a case study to assess the potential impact of RWU on reducing carbon emissions as compared to IBWT. A method of accumulative accounting was adapted to calculate and sum up carbon emission intensities at various stages, revealing that the operational carbon emission intensities of IBWT and RWU are 0.7447 KgCO2/m3 and 0.1880 KgCO2/m3, respectively. This indicates that RWU substitution can reduce carbon emissions by 0.5567 KgCO2/m3 or 75%. This paper further elucidates the mechanism behind carbon emission reduction, highlighting the energy-saving benefits of using reclaimed water locally without recourse to extensive transportation or elevation changes. Additionally, this result presents three scenarios of reclaimed water use, including urban miscellaneous water, river flow replenishment, and agricultural irrigation in relation to their substitution effects and environmental impacts. Estimates of carbon emission reductions from reclaimed water use were projected at the planned scale, with the maximum potential of reclaimed water utilization predicted. Finally, this paper proposes an enhanced strategy to identify and prioritize factors affecting reclaimed water utilization and the effect of carbon emission reduction. This paper aims to facilitate the establishment of a robust legal, institutional, and managerial framework while fostering interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation mechanisms in valley urban areas. The methodology employed can be universally applied to other regions grappling with severe water stress, thereby facilitating endeavors toward carbon reduction and contributing significantly to the attainment of water sustainability.</jats:p>"

This paper contributes to the literature by examining the development of technological collaboration agreements between supply chain partners as an influence factor that may impact the environmental commitment of SMEs. Specifically, we study whether the type of partner within the supply chain impacts a firm’s spending or its investment decision toward SP. To that end, we propose an analysis model that considers supplier and customer relationships separately, and the SP measure to be taken distinguishing between expenses and investments. Additionally, empirical research comprising descriptive statistics and econometrics using the regression technique has been conducted on a sample of 1808 Spanish industrial firms. Our results confirm that there are significant differences between SMEs and large companies when developing SP, and that these SP in SMEs depend on the chosen partner and measure. Finally, we offer our main conclusions, as well as relevant recommendations for managers, public administrators, suppliers, and customers, who are essential players in the I4.0 revolution and are under social pressure to promote sustainable development.</jats:p>"

In the chapter, per capita income, carbon tax, and CO2 emissions series were used. The focus of the study is to obtain results with higher accuracy by taking advantage of the power of Fourier-based unit root and cointegration tests. For this reason, as a method, in addition to the traditional unit root tests, Fourier KPSS stationarity test and Fourier ADL cointegration test were applied to the series. The Fourier KPSS stationarity test showed that all series had unit roots at level, and the Fourier ADL cointegration test showed the existence of a long-term relationship between the series. The findings indicate that a 1% increase in carbon taxes in Norway could reduce carbon emissions by 0.046% in the long term. In other words, carbon taxes implemented in Norway have been found to have a very limited effect on reducing CO2 emissions.</jats:p>",

To help meet this challenge, we highlight a recent study by Xiaolin Lin and Xuequnin Wang that reveals two levers for increasing the effectiveness of social commerce.1 First, in the lead up to the sale, businesses need to develop a social media environment where consumers find it easy to seek information related to the product or service. Second, after the sale, businesses should make it easy for consumers to share information with other consumers.

This involves not only the choice of the operating fuel but also its storage and processing conditions. Previous studies suggest that using liquid hydrogen (LH2) can offer longer endurance for air vehicles and an effective engine cooling due to its high specific heat value compared to high-pressure systems. This work is part of the LIQORNE (LIQuid hydrogen for airbORNE application) project, which investigates a hydrogen aircraft fuel system with a direct cryogenic LH2 supply. In this regard, a system model has been developed, focusing on continuously feeding LH2 into the engine and recovering redundant fuel and engine heat for gasification and hydrogen expansion improvement. This approach helps to control the risk of icing and boil-off in the system components and allows for a more lightweight and compact system. By implementing continuous fuel circulation and incorporating a flow control valve near the engine injection, it is realistic to verify and achieve shorter full-throttle response times. The potential of this architecture lies in its efficiency and flexibility, as it uses LH2 not only as a combustion fuel but also utilizes the redundant fuel for cooling, tank pressure control, and heating for optimal expansion before injection. To provide initial approximations of the system’s behavior, this paper describes a simulation model created with Simscape software for a small twin-engine medium-haul aircraft. This model focuses on component dimensions, including tank, pipes, and pump in terms of their thermodynamic behavior. The fuel properties are based on the thermophysical database CoolProp, enabling accurate calculations of phase proportion, temperature, and pressure based on real gas parameters. Through validation against previous state-of-the-art studies, the model is expected to yield initial dimensions of the system volume. Consequently, a comparison of system weight between liquid and pressure-driven architectures can be conducted, along with an assessment of potential efficiency improvements. It will also verify the feasibility of boil-off regulation by the fuel system alone. Due to the parametric model design, various study cases can be applied to find the optimum operating point and adapt to different applications.</jats:p>",

Irrigation at flowering + seed filling stage and full irrigation had the highest essential oil content (3.6%) and plant height (16.71 cm), respectively. On all planting dates, irrigation enhanced the total chlorophyll and carotenoids content, relative water content, umbel number plant−1, seed number umbel−1, 1,000-seed weight, and seed yield but reduced the proline content and water-use efficiency (WUE). The highest chlorophyll content (1.54 mg g−1 fresh weight (FW)), carotenoids content (0.35 mg g−1 FW), umbel number plant−1 (18.03), seed number umbel−1 (21.16), 1,000-seed weight (4.12 g), seed yield (1002.7 kg ha−1), and essential oil yield (22.13 kg ha−1) were obtained on 19 January and irrigation at the flowering + seed filling stages. The greatest amount of WUE (0.53 kg m−3) was measured on 9 January under no irrigation condition. Therefore, to produce cumin under similar climatic conditions, early planting of cumin in early January, along with two irrigations at the flowering and seed filling stages, is recommended.</jats:p>",

Simulation analysis is conducted to investigate the transmission of emission reduction and revenue risks caused by internal and external contingent risk factors. The study reveals that under conditions of market demand uncertainty, the risk transmission effect is unaffected by the risk aversion characteristics of members in the low-carbon supply chain. While the risk-aversion characteristics of suppliers can decrease their own profit risk, they have a negative effect on the profit risk of manufacturers and the emission reduction risk of supply chain nodes. There exists a critical threshold for the impact of the risk-aversion degree of suppliers on their own emission reduction risk transmission effect. When this threshold is exceeded, the emission reduction risk decreases with increasing risk aversion intensity of suppliers, and vice versa. The risk aversion characteristics of manufacturers can weaken the negative effect of supplier risk aversion on the fluctuation risk of manufacturer profits, but they exacerbate the emission reduction risk transmission effect of manufacturers under asymmetric information influence. The findings have important theoretical and practical implications for supply chain risk management.</jats:p>"

Thus, manufacturers are compelled to seek ways of lowering the costs of their services in order to satisfy customers and survive the competition in their respective industries. This research paper investigates a multi-product problem in a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and several retailers. The main objective of this research is to develop and present a multi-product optimization model in which retailers receive their orders through discrete delivery and surplus manufactured goods are stored in the manufacturer’s warehouse. The objective function of the mathematical model in the economic dimension includes the minimization of the total supply chain costs and the maximization of profit. The retailers in this model place new orders when their inventory level drops to zero, and the manufacturer responds to the retailers’ orders at the same time as it begins processing each product. After delivering the last set of orders, the manufacturer stores surplus items in its warehouse in case the retailers place new orders. This optimization problem is modeled using mixed integer nonlinear programming, while numerical scenarios are coded using the MATLAB software which helps estimate the total cost within a short time. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effects of a number of factors on the total cost, including problem parameters, demand and production rates, the production quantity, and the number of times the manufacturing machines are operated at each production cycle.</jats:p>"

Supply chain sustainability is put at risk by security issues in blockchain technology that affect everything from infrastructure to management. For sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), these elements are deemed crucial. To address this, the purpose of this research is to examine the impact of blockchain security factors on SSCM among United Kingdom manufacturing firms. Based on the resource-based view (RBV) theory and the Technology–Organisation–Environment (TOE) framework, the research hypotheses and framework were developed. To achieve the research objectives, a hybrid approach that combines structural equation modelling and artificial neural networks (ANNs) was adopted to perform the analysis. The research findings indicate that privacy, network, confidentiality, and managerial factors are vital to promoting SSCM. Furthermore, the ANN analysis highlights that managerial (trust management) and supplier privacy factors are the most important constructs. Unlike prior research that theoretically assumed that all relationships are linear, this has been a novel study that has successfully validated that there exists a nonlinear relationship between the RBV theory and the TOE framework. Based on the outcomes, the study’s contributions, its practical implications, and future research avenues are discussed.</jats:p>"

An understanding of dynamic interactions between people and water, known as sociohydrology, regionally could provide approaches to addressing local water mismanagement and water access inequity. In semi-arid California, local water agencies, primarily agricultural irrigation districts, are at the intersection of rethinking approaches to balance freshwater demands. More than 150 years of complex water governance and management have defined San Joaquin Valley irrigation districts and the region’s water access inequities and sociohydrologic instability. Older irrigation districts have higher surface water allocations and less groundwater dependence. About 60% of irrigation districts with pre-1914 water rights have twice the crop water demand in surface water allocations. In contrast, 86% of irrigation districts depend on groundwater, of which 12% rely exclusively on groundwater to supply irrigation demands. This study found that disadvantaged communities within irrigation districts do not have increased water access or better environmental conditions than those outside irrigation district boundaries, which underscores the need for inclusive water management structures to address the multifaceted water and environmental inequities. Groundwater overdependence across irrigation districts shows that imbalanced surface water allocations and inflexible crops could imperil agriculture and impact agricultural disadvantaged communities, especially under California’s SGMA and prolonged drought events. It is imperative that underserved communities are prioritized communities in achieving equitable water rebalance in California in addition to developing and implementing essential infrastructure and policy changes.</jats:p>"

The National Bureau of Statistics of China showed that the country's investment in property development fell by 8.5% year-on-year, while domestic lending dropped by 11.5% and the use of foreign capital fell by 43%. Upon this, the development of supply chain finance can alleviate the pressure on enterprise funds and stabilize the real estate market. However, risk in supply chain finance is the biggest obstacle to the development of supply chain finance and current researches on risk assessment of supply chain finance face problems such as imprecise classification, slow assessment speed, a small number of samples, and data that is easily tampered with. Therefore, this study integrated graph convolutional neural networks into the smart contracts of the contract layer of blockchain. This integration established a novel intelligent perception model for supply chain finance risk. Based on a consortium chain with the government and enterprises as nodes, the model was established, including risk monitoring, assessment, and categorized early warnings. In the risk assessment part, we compared the graph convolutional neural network with multilayer perceptron and support vector machine finding that the accuracy rate of the graphic convolutional neural network is 94%, which is higher than the above models. The intelligent risk-perception model proposed in this paper operates faster than expert judgment assessments used by banks. It also provides accurate risk levels and quantifies the probability of enterprises being classified as high-risk, offering technical support to regulatory authorities in controlling supply chain financial risk.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, droughts are becoming longer, more frequent and more severe, and their impacts are multidimensional. The impacts of droughts typically extend beyond the water balance as they accumulate over time, and can lead to regime shifts in land use. Here, we assess the effects of temporal changes in water supply and demand on vegetation productivity and land cover change over multiple time scales in continental Chile, which has experienced an extreme drought over the last 20 years. Across most of continental Chile, we found a persistent decreasing trend in water supply and an increasing trend in water demand since 1981, trends that intensify over longer time scales. This long-term decrease in water availability has led to a decrease in vegetation productivity, especially in central and southern Chile. Our models suggest that increasing drought severity has led to shifts in land use towards more drought-tolerant land cover types, such as shrublands. We also found evidence that shifts in land cover types may reveal how human perceptions of prolonged drought can indirectly lead to large-scale changes in land use. Our results suggest that long-term climate change may lead to regime shifts in land cover, which may be mitigated by context-specific adaptation strategies.</jats:p>"

EVCS is equipped with devices that directly interact with electric vehicles (EVs) during charging; this device is called Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). Both EVSE and EV require protocols to communicate with each other aimed at exchanging information such as readiness for charging between EVSE and EV. The communication protocol used in this research is the SAE J1772 protocol. This study focuses on designing a hardware prototype of EVSE based on the principles of the J1772 AC Type 1 connector as the transmission medium to electric vehicles (EVs). The design of EVSE communication simulation uses the Falstad Circuit Simulator platform, and the PCB layout design uses the EasyEDA platform. The hardware prototype of EVSE is controlled using a Raspberry Pi 3B mini PC as the core management, then integrated with the initial terminal block, power supply block, PZEM-004T sensor module, J1772 communication block, 2-channel solid-state relay (SSR) module, and J1772 terminal.</jats:p>"

The application of CTI is widely limited to the reactive field of cybersecurity. The evolving cyber threat landscape requires a shift to an anticipatory and adaptable approach that addresses the complex and changing cybersecurity environment. CTI has the potential to support this shift to proactive threat handling towards a more resilient cybersecurity posture. This research is part of a project that aims to enhance the use of CTI for satellite cyber supply chain resilience through gamification. Cybersecurity games are established tools to raise security awareness and train security staff in red and blue team exercises. However, there is a lack of research on how gamification and serious games can be used to improve the application of CTI and enable training for security staff, even though existing literature points out the beneficial effects of gamification. Building on the gamification approach in cybersecurity, the research focuses on creating a gamified experience that simulates a cyber-attack derived from real-world examples and the utilisation of CTI to handle the simulated cyber-attack. The scenario addresses the need for informed decision-making throughout a cyber-attack by focusing on the utilisation of CTI in the context of satellite cyber supply chain security as the domain of application. This paper takes stock of the recent developments in CTI towards improving cyber resilience and presents gamification for cybersecurity and CTI to highlight the benefits of the approach. Further, it discusses the potential of gamification as an effective tool for CTI and describes the approach that is used to build a gamification solution inspired by real-world events. This paper contributes to the nascent research on gamification of CTI to strengthen cyber resilience in the context of increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber threats, especially against space systems.</jats:p>"

The country has a particular demand for skilled labourers, especially at the semi-skilled level, in various sectors. However, many young people find it challenging to acquire the skills employers demand. To approach the issue of youth employability, it is essential to distinguish two sides of the question. On the one hand, the demand side of the labour market, and, on the other, the supply side of the workforce. It is significant that, in quantitative terms, the vocational education and training (VET) system does not yet play a decisive role here. To understand whether the VET system can solve the problem of high youth unemployment, the concept of ‘employability’ is introduced. A critical analysis of the VET system in terms of the concept of employability follows. Based on the analysis, this paper concludes that the VET system in India requires reform and proposes possible policy interventions to address this.</jats:p>",

Edible oil, a crucial ingredient for cooking and food preparation, is utilized by people from all social classes. Vegetable oils, particularly sunflower, soybean, peanut, and others, are the main source of edible oils, which have less unsaturated fatty acids compared to animal oils. The production and consumption of edible oils have substantial environmental impacts, necessitating increased research to address these implications. Sunflower, a valuable oilseed crop, is grown worldwide due to its short growing season and adaptability to various climates and soil types. Sunflower seeds have high oil and protein content, making them popular for their health benefits.

Three oil supply settings, upstream, inlet and outlet of the contact region, are compared. Results show that upstream oil supply led to a lower critical speed at which the added oil loses any effect compared to the inlet oil supply and outlet oil supply. The effect of oil supply rates on friction reduction varies among the oil supply settings and ring rotational speeds. In conclusion, the most effective oil supply setting positions the injector at the outlet of the contact region, outperforming placement at the entrance of the contact region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Red Sea, a vital trading route for India, is disrupted by the ongoing conflict between the Houthi rebels and Israel. This study aims to investigate how the dispute affects India’s supply chain in several different industries. The possible repercussions include restricted access to raw materials, delays and higher prices in maritime transportation, and concerns of energy scrutiny from disruptions in gas and oil. To lessen the impact on the economy we examine alternate trade routes and assess the potential effects on investors’ confidence. This study aims to examine and assess the diverse repercussions of the Red Sea War on the Indian supply chain offering insights on strategic planning, policy decisions and risk mitigation measures for the Indian government, businesses and stakeholders.\nThe Red Sea crisis has had a multifaceted impact on different sectors of the Indian economy. In the healthcare sector, a huge number of medical supplies and prescription drugs which are transported via sea have seen a spike in the shipping cost due to rerouting which has disrupted the medical supply chain. On the other hand, there is no direct impact on the consumer sector; however, the increased freight prices and geopolitical concerns impact the wholesale price index which is expected to hike and influence the food grain prices and exports of basmati rice in particular owing to the well-established domestic supply chain. The FMCG industry is comparatively protected from the adverse effects of the crisis in contrast to industries such as agricultural and maritime foods. \nThis crucial route, particularly affecting goods moving between Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, historically used for nearly half of India's exports and a third of imports, is now deemed unsafe. Ships are being rerouted around Africa's Cape of Good Hope, leading to a 30% increase in transit times and a surge in shipping costs. Indian companies are feeling the heat – Arvind Ltd. faces lost revenue due to order backlogs, while exporters like Euro Fruits grapple with quadrupled freight costs and declining grape quality. The auto industry is also impacted, with companies like MG Motor India experiencing delays and rising logistics expenses.\nIndia’s energy, resources and industrial sectors have all been severely disrupted by the Red Sea crisis with critical exports including chemicals and petroleum products being heavily impacted. Since the Suez Canal handles a significant amount of India’s import of crude oil, rerouting owing to continual conflicts presents logistical difficulties and possible inflationary pressures. The government is actively engaging in efforts to mitigate these impacts by looking into alternative shipping lanes and providing assistance to affected exports. The possibility of delays and financial costs is still a major issue for businesses navigating obstacles relating to insurance premiums and logistical difficulties.\nTo navigate these challenges, the Indian government is exploring a multi-pronged approach. Financial support in the form of direct subsidies, soft loans, and government-backed cargo insurance could help businesses offset increased costs and mitigate risks associated with delays and rerouting. Additionally, India is looking to diversify its trade routes by exploring alternative sources for crude oil and LNG imports, along with utilizing ports outside the conflict zone. Long-term solutions are also being considered, such as investing in the Northern Sea Route and expanding land transport infrastructure. Renewed focus on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) project could offer a comprehensive network connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe. By implementing these strategies, India can build a more resilient supply chain and minimize the long-term impact of the Red Sea conflict on its trade.</jats:p>"

Past related studies have primarily focused on balancing ES supply and demand and supply clustering, with less attention focused on the drivers of demand clustering and their spatial evolution. This study explored the spatiotemporal supply–demand dynamics in four crucial ecosystem services (ESs) in the Sichuan-Yunnan ecological buffer area region between 2005 and 2019, namely water yield, net primary production, soil conservation, and habitat quality. Self-organizing maps and geographical detectors were used to classify supply–demand ES bundles as their main drivers, respectively. The main results of the study included: (1) A decline in habitat quality, whereas net primary productivity, water yield, and soil conservation increased. However, there were increasing demands for habitat quality, water yield, and net primary productivity, despite the decrease in demand for soil conservation. (2) Demand for habitat quality was met by supply, whereas there were deficits in soil conservation, water yield, and net primary productivity, which contributed to the demand in the east exceeding that elsewhere. (3) The proportion of ES bundle 2 increased, whereas those of the remaining ES bundles declined. Similarly, the areas of ES demand bundles (ESDBs) 1 and 4 decreased, whereas those of 2 and 3 increased. While the spatial extent of the ESBs remained relatively stable, those of the ESDBs in the northern regions increased. Key factors influencing the spatial distribution of ES supply include human activities, population density, and precipitation, whereas land use, population density, and the human activity index primarily affect demand distribution. The results of this study can act as a reference for comprehensive regional ecosystem management.</jats:p>"

Utilizing the Stackelberg game framework, we investigate the impact of a retailer’s capital position and financing strategies on supply chain dynamics in which a supplier considers establishing a direct sales channel. We find that the retailer’s equilibrium financing strategy is impacted by demand volatility and the initial working capital. The supplier’s encroachment decision hinges on the entry cost when neither trade credit financing nor bank credit financing is available. When both types of credit are available, the choice of financing is a complex interplay involving initial working capital, entry cost, and demand volatility. Notably, the supplier’s decision to encroach may shift from a binary stance of either encroaching or not encroaching, or it may oscillate from encroachment to non-encroachment and back to encroachment, particularly with an increase in demand volatility when the entry cost is moderate. The novelty of this study lies in its integration of supplier channel decisions with retailer operational decisions and financing strategies, examining how the capital position and financing strategies impact channel decisions. This study provides managerial insights into the interplay between supplier’s channel dynamics and retailer’s financial considerations, shedding light on unexplored aspects of channel management. In future studies, some assumptions in this study can be modified to obtain more managerial insights.</jats:p>"

About 24.46% of the secondary materials derived from e-waste are utilized by e-waste-generated industries. However, the overall cyclical use rate is only 0.07%. This does not imply that the majority of industrial e-waste is not properly recycled. Rather, it suggests that more secondary materials obtained through downcycling, entering other industries.

In India, the prevalence of PD is increasing, necessitating greater attention to the availability and distribution of appropriate medication. This comprehensive study aims to assess the demand and supply dynamics of PD medication in Roorkee, Uttarakhand. After recording the sales per week of various drugs, brands, dosage forms, and strengths available in Roorkee, it was determined that SINEMET (Carbidopa + Levodopa) is widely accessible in the region, with STALEVO, MIRAPEX (Pramipexole), and ARTANE (Trihexyphenidyl) being the other prominent brands available in local medical stores. These medications are primarily in tablet form. Sales data from different stores indicated that SINEMET (Carbidopa + Levodopa 25/250 mg) is the most popular drug in the Roorkee area for treating PD. In terms of drug type analysis, levodopa-based decarboxylase inhibitors, particularly the combination of Levodopa and Carbidopa, currently hold a dominant position in the PD drug market in the region</jats:p>"

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Si on physiological traits and nodulation efficiency in <italic>Trifolium incarnatum</italic> L. subjected to N-deprivation.\nMethods\n Si was supplied (1.7 mM) to N-deprived plants inoculated with <italic>Rhizobium leguminosarum</italic> bv <italic>trifolii</italic> and plant physiological traits and nodule ionomic and molecular traits were monitored over 25 days.\nResults\n Si supply promoted shoot biomass, the quantity of both Si and N in roots and shoots, and the number, biomass and density of nodules and their nitrogenase abundance which contribute to better dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) fixation. Ionomic analysis of nodules revealed that Si supply increased the amount of several macroelements (potassium, phosphorus and sulfur) and microelements (copper, zinc and molybdenum) known to improve nodulation efficiency and N<sub>2</sub> fixation. Finally, comparative proteomic analysis (+ Si <italic>versus</italic> -Si) of nodules highlighted that Si modulated the proteome of both symbionts with 989 and 212 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) in the infected host root cells and their symbiont bacteria, respectively.

Using a conceptual framework based on regulatory theory, feminist insights, and semi-autonomous social fields, this article examines the law-practice gap for regulating just wages within the apparel supply chain, responses, and how workers fight wage theft and carve out pathways to demand just wage standards. Drawing from the case of Sri Lanka, the article discusses how alternative forms of worker voice seek to fill in the implementation gaps.

ArcGIS with Google Earth Pro was used to calculate the rooftop area of the selected building, and RWH from each category of public buildings was evaluated by considering rooftop areas, monthly rainfall, and runoff coefficient. The result shows that the highest amount of rainwater was harvested from the City Administration building in August (197.1 m3), whereas the lowest was collected from the Health Center building in December (1.8 m3). Additionally, the contribution of RWH from individual public buildings for each month was evaluated, and its values ranged from 0.073 to 1.8%. The comparison shows that Wachemo University, Nigist Eleni Comprehensive Hospital, a technical and vocational institute, and teacher training center buildings, could have a significant potential for rainwater storage, ranging from 1.56 to 28.41%. This implies that, besides saving a noteworthy volume of potable water, the excess rainwater can be stored and utilized for the later dry months. As a result, it is recommended that rooftop RWH in Hosaena be the best source of the city's water supply system to reduce the current water supply shortage.</jats:p>",

Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) facilitate P availability but this trait varies among different fungal species and isolates. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (i) colonization with EMF boosts plant growth under P-limited conditions and that (ii) the poplars show P homeostasis because increased P uptake is used for growth and not for P accumulation in the tissues. We used two P treatments (high phosphate [HP]: 64 μM Pi, low phosphate [LP]: 0.64 μM Pi in the nutrient solution) and four fungal treatments (Paxillus involutus MAJ, Paxillus involutus NAU, Laccaria bicolor dikaryon LBD, Laccaria bicolor monokaryon LBM) in addition to non-inoculated poplar plants (NI) to measure growth, biomass, gas exchange and P contents. High phosphate (HP) stimulated growth compared with LP conditions. Poplars colonized with MAJ, NAU and NI showed higher growth and biomass production than those with LBD or LBM. Photosynthesis rates of poplars with lower biomass production were similar to or higher than those of plants with higher growth rates. The tissue concentrations of P were higher under HP than LP conditions and rarely affected by ectomycorrhizal colonization. Under LP, the plants produced 44% greater biomass per unit of P than under HP. At a given P supply, the tissue concentration was stable irrespective of the growth rate indicating P homeostasis. Laccaria bicolor caused growth inhibition, irrespective of P availability. These results suggest that in young poplars distinct species-specific ectomycorrhizal traits overshadowed potential growth benefits.</jats:p>",

Therefore, non-renewable resources will be exhausted if alternative energy is not fully developed, leading to an energy crisis in the near future. In this paper, a mathematical model has been proposed for the design of the biomass supply chain of field residues that includes several fields where residue is transferred to hubs after collecting the residue in the hub, the residue is transferred to reactors. In reactors, the residue is converted into gas, which is transferred to condenser and transformers, converted into electricity and sent to demand points through the network. In this paper, the criteria of stability and disturbance were considered, which have been less discussed in related research, and the purpose of the proposed model was to maximize the profit from the sale of energy, including the selling price minus the costs. Genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm have been used to solve the model. Then, to prove the complexity of the problem, different and random examples have been presented in different dimensions of the problem. Also, the efficiency of the algorithm in small and large dimensions was proved by comparing GA and SA due to the low deviation of the solutions and the methods used have provided acceptable results suitable for all decision-makers. Also, the effectiveness of the algorithm in small and large dimensions is proven by comparing the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, and the genetic algorithm's values are better, considering the deviation of 2.9%.and have provided solution methods suitable for all decision makers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to the study of topical issues related to management consulting in corporate governance. Management consulting plays an important role in the corporate governance system, helping companies to achieve their strategic goals and optimize their operations through innovative approaches and solutions. It has been determined that management consultants are becoming key figures in helping companies develop strategies, optimize processes and solve complex management problems. In the context of globalization and rapid technological transformation of business, management consulting is becoming an integral component for companies seeking to remain competitive and adapt to new market realities. The author characterizes that the development of management consulting is not only diverse, but also takes two main forms. On the one hand, (and this has developed historically), consulting is a method of improving the existing forms of management and business, because initially the consulting process was a process of imitating the experience of the most successful managers. On the other hand, consulting is becoming an independent profession. The article analyzes risk management in a corporate enterprise, which includes identification, assessment and mitigation of risks that may affect the organization's goals, operations or stakeholders. It is highlighted that corporate governance is the systems, processes and principles by which a business is managed, regulated and controlled. The importance of effective governance increases linearly with the size of the business and the number of shareholders.  It is noted that foreign investors often look for companies with effective management, transparent and accountable business. For small and medium-sized enterprises seeking to expand their operations and enter foreign markets, having a sound corporate governance practice can be a significant advantage. For foreign investors, it demonstrates the reliability of the business, reduces the potential risks associated with investments, and can create more favorable conditions for investment. It is proved that the creation of reliable mechanisms is necessary to control the financial integrity and operational efficiency of the enterprise.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to predict the demand for medicines using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) time series models while comparatively analysing their performance for medicine demand prediction to optimize the flow of supplies in the health system. Using data generated in Rwanda public health supply chain, in our study focused on predicting the demand of the top five medicines, identified as highly supplied (amoxicillin, penicillin v, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and metronidazole). We evaluated the models’ outputs by root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination, R-squared (R2). In comparison to ARIMA, the deep learning LSTM model revealed superior performance with better accuracy and lower error rates in predicting the demand for medicines. Our results revealed that the LSTM model has an RMSE value of 2.0 for the training set and 2.043 for the test set, with R2 values of 0.952 and 0.912, respectively. ARIMA has an RMSE value of 9.35 for the training set and 8.926 for the test set as well as R2 value of 0.24 and 0.16 for the training and test sets, respectively. Based on these findings, we recommend that the LSTM time series model should be used for demand prediction in the management of medicines and their flow within health supply chain due to its remarkable performance for prediction task when applied to the dataset of our study.</jats:p>"

In this model, the most prioritizes that is considered in the environmental condition to the medical waste supply chain. A numerical experiment is done in this paper which it results suggests two things, first, the cost of medical waste processing is much greater than its revenue, and second, the waste processing through incineration is not favorable.

Such organizations join a growing number of businesses cutting across various Industries that have undergone operational restructuring to enhance efficiency and to streamline operations. The study specifically sought to determine the influence of just-in-time on supply chain performance, The study was guided by lean theory. A descriptive cross-sectional research design was adopted in the study. The target population was 95 employees comprising procurement officers, finance officers, production officers, quality assurance officers, operations officers, director of audit services, logistics, and firm engineers from 11 sugar manufacturing firms in western Kenya. The survey utilized a census approach, specifically targeting all 95 employees. The research employed primary data sources, with primary data gathered by administering closed-ended questionnaires. Descriptive statistics was employed to analyze the data, displayed as tables, pie charts, and bar graphs. In this study, inferential statistics was employed to examine hypotheses and to evaluate data. Concisely, the researcher utilized Pearson correlation and linear regression models to demonstrate the association between lean production techniques and the supply chain performance of sugar manufacturing enterprises in western Kenya. A pilot study was undertaken using a sugar manufacturing firm in the Ramisi Sugar factory in Kwale County and involved respondents drawn from the firm. The findings from the pilot study were crucial in determining the reliability and validity of the instruments. An increased Cronbach's Alpha coefficient indicated a higher level of internal consistency, improving the research instruments' reliability. Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 27. On hypothesis testing, H01: Just In Time has no significant impact on supply chain performance in Sugar manufacturing factories in Western Kenya was rejected with a significance value of 0.001 is less than the predetermined significance limit of 0.05. The research revealed that an increase in just-in-time results in a measurable enhancement of 0.078 in supply chain performance, according to the study ((85) = 7.312, </jats:p>"

To tackle the financial issues facing the marketplace, we should use the chain of custody finance model, but we also need to thoroughly understand the risks associated with it and how to manage them. False trade orders and insufficient control over core businesses are difficulties that the present logistics finance risk management must deal with. The World Wide Web, big data, and block chain technologies are all blooming, opening new avenues for risk management in block chain finance. As a result, the goal of this essay is to examine the features of supply chain finance based on the technology of block chain, examine the risks associated with financing supply chains, and debate how to use block chain innovation for supply chain banking risk management.[4] Risk Financing: To assist organizations in transferring or reducing supply chain risks, financial institutions offer risk financing solutions including insurance &amp; alternative risk transfer methods. The creation of novel risk financing products, evaluation of their performance, and comprehension of the effects on the resilience of supply chains can all be the subject of research. Financial institutions provide supply chain financing options like factoring, discounted invoices, and supply link finance programmed that help businesses manage their working capital, improve cash flow, and lower the risk of supplier failure to pay or insolvency. The effects of different financing choices on supplier relationships, supply chain stability, and overall risk reduction may be studied. Financial institutions collaborate with businesses to detect and classify different supply chain risks. An extensive investigation of the supply network environment, encompassing suppliers, transportation, logistics, and market dynamics, is required in this phase. Data gathering techniques used may include questionnaires, interviews, &amp; site visits. In the above rank one is axis, and the last one is Punjab national bank. Financial Institution in Supply Chain Risk Management In the above rank one is axis, and the last one is Punjab national bank.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of DH and reduced heat transfer temperature in the building on space heating and the possibility of reducing the heat transfer temperature (down to 60 °C) in the DH network by looking at different scenarios and the heat demand of buildings. Three alternatives were analysed: the installation of a temperature-lowering module (mixing unit) in the thermal chamber and the retro-fitting of existing piping and heating appliances, where the temperature of the DH fluid is lowered up to 60 °C and the temperature of the radiators is lowered to 60/40/20. The possibility of lowering the DH heat transfer temperature without upgrading the network by installing heat pumps individually in the buildings or in the heat chamber is examined. An hourly data analysis of a 2-year heating system model for a typical building showed that lowering the DHW temperature to 60 °C and leaving the existing area of heating appliances in the building will not meet the heat demand of the buildings.</jats:p>",

Each model helps to explore the different mode of behaviours. Production, inventory, workforce, information systems, shipments and customer orders are the dynamic variables which change over the period of time and all are interacting in the multi-stock complex 3PL logistic firm model. Model structures and interactions among of different variables not only give the model understanding but also reveal the policies to make the system better behaved. Feedback notion is other significant property for system dynamics models. Using the factory information, its dynamics is modelled step by step and its behavior is analyzed at each stage to gain the real-life wisdom. As we keep on adding the stocks and rates to improve the model of factory dynamics, each step highlights the model insight and understanding. Model validation is done after building the model while using different tests. Plausible policies are suggested on the basis of parametric changes and structural changes of the model that set the guidelines for policy formulation.

One big change we've seen is that supply chains are becoming more flexible and adaptable, thanks to new digital technologies and the way people shop online. E-commerce has really shaken things up in traditional supply chain practices like buying goods, keeping track of inventory, and getting products to customers. We've also explored how technologies like data analytics, artificial intelligence, and blockchain are helping businesses improve their supply chains, making them more efficient and transparent, especially in the world of e-commerce.</jats:p>"

Identifying vulnerable components, especially multiple pipe failure combinations, is crucial for effective management and ensuring high reliability. Hydraulic simulations are commonly used for analysing the criticality of WDN, but are time-consuming and highly data-reliant, limiting the number of testable combinations. To address these limitations and constraints, a graph-based method is proposed to quantify the impact magnitude of multiple pipe failure scenarios on performance, enabling the identification of critical combinations. The proposed graph-based approach utilizes structural and topological characteristics of WDNs as well as spatial demand distribution to replicate hydraulic behaviour. The accuracy of the approach is assessed by testing it on three case studies with various pipe failure combinations, and the results are compared with hydraulic analyses. The results demonstrate a strong correlation (Spearman coefficient &amp;gt; 0.75) between graph-based ranking and state-of-the-art hydraulic-based ranking. Additionally, the method exhibits a significant computational gain factor of greater than 30 compared with the hydraulic-based method, rendering it valuable for actively exploring a wide range of critical pipe failure combinations and devising countermeasures. Furthermore, a hybrid-based method that integrates both the graph and hydraulic-based methods is proposed for enhanced accuracy and robust assessments.</jats:p>",

The quality for agricultural reuse is related to the physicochemical parameters and indicators of water quality. The bacteriological characteristics including total and fecal coliforms, fecal enterococci, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were also considered. The results revealed that SAR and SSP values were excellent for irrigation. A Wilcox diagram showed that most of the samples fell in the field of C3-S1 indicating high salinity and low sodium water. The physicochemical results indicated that most of parameters are in conformity with standards except ammonia NH4+ and total nitrogen that are higher than the permissible limit of USEPA and FAO. The average concentrations of heavy metals are low compared with the FAO recommendations. However, the bacteriological analyses confirmed the existence of germs indicating a fecal contamination exceeding the WHO regulations but an absence of pathogenic germs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the pivotal aspects of a company lies in its supply chain. The company must effectively and efficiently manage their supply chains to support production quality, achieve organizational goals, and ensure customer satisfaction. This research aims to determine the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the crumb rubber processing industry and provide suggestions for improving its supply chain performance. Supply chain performance measurement was conducted using the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model in conjunction with the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to determine the weights of the KPIs. The research found that the overall supply chain performance score for the crumb rubber company was 84.92, categorizing it as \"Good.\" However, among the 26 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) identified, three indicators (i.e. production of defective products, consumer complaints, and returns of defective products) fell into the \"Poor\" category. Hence, it is crucial for crumb rubber industry stakeholders to address these three criteria to enhance supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

The supply chain process starts after customer demand. Most often customers are not in the same destinations and orders do not arrive one by one. Hence service providers should manage the ordering process effectively to serve in time. If the orders are widespread and there is a limited service provider the service route should plan carefully and precisely. In this study, service routing is constituted under three main scenarios for the most visited destinations of the old town city of Mardin, Turkey. 3D visual representations of specified regions visual representations were taken from Google Earth. Calculations between chosen touristic attractions and a total length made on Google Earth. The study is novel for being an ex-ante of the tourism supply chain utilizing a digital map, in a very tough area of an old city. The scenario-based approach is used as a method of deciding the route for the service supply chain.</jats:p>"

This is particularly crucial in the pharmaceutical industry, where product authenticity and traceability are paramount. Blockchain plays a pivotal role in preventing product loss and counterfeiting, while simultaneously enhancing transparency and efficiency throughout the supply chain. The research introduces a step-by-step approach to implementing a proof-of-concept (PoC) for Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) through blockchain technology. This PoC involves simulating a supply chain process to assess feasibility and measure key performance indicators. Engaging stakeholders and gathering feedback is integral to refining the blockchain-based SCRM system. The study rigorously evaluates the performance of the SCRM blockchain across various test scenarios, featuring differing numbers of organizations and clients. Multiple fabric networks are employed to assess the system’s scalability and performance under diverse conditions. The results of these comprehensive tests inform practical deployment decisions and highlight areas for potential optimization and further development. So this research provides valuable insights into the application of blockchain in pharmaceutical supply chains, offering a roadmap for implementation and improving supply chain security, efficiency, and transparency.</jats:p>"

First, the typical adjustable flexible resources, air conditioners, and electric vehicles in urban distribution networks are modeled, and their adjustment ability is evaluated. Second, on the basis of the evaluation results, the optimal power supply recovery path is solved to ensure the power supply of essential loads in the distribution network. Last, the IEEE 33‐bus system proves that this method can quickly find the optimal path of power supply recovery and effectively reduce the power loss rate of essential loads, thus improving the toughness of urban distribution networks.</jats:p>",

Enhancing both product quality and sales in e-commerce platform transactions has long been a focal point of research. To address this issue, this paper constructs Stackelberg game models under different power structures and compares their impacts on pricing decisions and profits within e-commerce supply chains. Numerical simulations are used to explore the optimal combination strategy for the interaction of product quality and marketing efforts in the e-commerce supply chain. The results show that: (1) Under a centralized decision-making model, product quality and marketing efforts reach their optimal values, maximizing benefits for the supply chain system. (2) Under different power structures, the relationship between the profits of the supplier and the e-commerce platform self-operator is closely linked to the cost coefficients of product quality and marketing efforts. (3) Through the mechanism of “cost-sharing + compensation contract”, the supplier can reduce wholesale price, and the e-commerce platform self-operator can subsidize a portion of the sales to the supplier, thereby maximizing the profits of both parties and achieving a win–win situation. The research in this paper aids suppliers in improving product quality and e-commerce platform self-operators in enhancing their marketing efforts, providing theoretical support for optimizing supply-chain decision making on e-commerce platforms.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the design of a sustainable perishable product supply chain network (SPPSCN), considering the factors of economics cost, environmental impacts, and social responsibility. The proposed model is a comprehensive production–location–inventory problem optimization framework that addresses multiple objectives, echelons, products, and periods. To solve this complex problem, we introduce three hybrid metaheuristic algorithms: bat algorithm (BA), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA), and cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, all hybrid with variable neighbourhood search (VNS). Sensitivity to input parameters is accounted for using the Taguchi method to tune these parameters. Additionally, we evaluate and compare these approaches among themselves and benchmark their results against a reference method, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) with VNS. The quality of the Pareto frontier is evaluated by six metrics for test problems. The results highlight the superior performance of the bat algorithm with variable neighbourhood search. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of key model parameters on the optimal objectives. It is observed that an increase in demand has a nearly linear effect on the corresponding objectives. Moreover, the impact of extending raw material shelf life and product shelf life on these objectives is limited to a certain range. Beyond a certain threshold, the influence becomes insignificant.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of a grid-connected solar PV/Li-ion battery microgrid (μG) system aimed at maintaining a constant power supply to selected lecture halls at a university in the Western Cape, South Africa. The microgrid design, modelling, and simulations, conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, include the solar PV, Li-ion battery, energy consumption of the lecture halls (load profile), boost converter, bidirectional converter, and grid. Using the detailed design, modelling, and simulation, the study evaluates the economic and environmental impacts of integrating μGs, focusing on enhancing energy reliability, reducing operational costs, and mitigating CO2 emissions. The results indicate that integrating the microgrid resulted in a significant 51% reduction in energy cost and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 530 kgCO2e per hour. In Cases 2 and 4, where the battery supplied power, the annual battery degradation costs are 6.08% and 14.9% of the initial cost, respectively. The μG ensures an uninterrupted power supply and improves the overall reliability of the university’s energy infrastructure. It promotes environmental sustainability goals of zero emissions and maintains continuous academic activities during grid outages. Furthermore, it fosters a conducive learning environment, supports innovation and creativity in sustainable energy technologies, and sets a standard for other higher education institutions to integrate renewable energy-powered μGs.</jats:p>"

Traditional housing supply mechanisms often struggle with inefficiencies related to funding, policy constraints, and market dynamics. This article explored the potential of group economics as an innovative approach to enhance housing supply in South Florida, specifically through a case study in Miami. Group economics, rooted in cooperative behavior and mutual aid, emphasizes collective action and resource pooling to address housing challenges. The study employs a qualitative strategy that involves document analysis to provide a detailed examination of three specific projects: Liberty City Community Land Trust (CLT), Little Havana Cooperative Housing, and the Overtown Collective Self-Build Project. The data were gathered from policy documents, statistical reports, and existing literature on these projects. Findings indicate that the Liberty City CLT model successfully provided long-term affordable housing through land leases, enhancing community stability and engagement despite funding challenges. The Little Havana Cooperative Housing project demonstrated significant cost savings and improved quality of life for residents through shared amenities and democratic governance, though it faced complexities in decision-making processes. The Overtown Collective Self-Build Project achieved substantial cost reductions and skill development among participants, fostering strong community bonds, albeit requiring significant time investment. Comparative analysis revealed that while all three models effectively increased housing affordability and supply, each had unique strengths and scalability challenges. The CLT model ensured long-term affordability, the cooperative housing model provided immediate cost savings and enhanced amenities, and the self-build project promoted self-sufficiency and skill acquisition. This study underscores the potential of group economics to provide sustainable and community-focused housing solutions. It advocates for addressing the urgent need for affordable housing in urban centers like Miami.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research investigates the impact of Total Quality Management (TQM) on Supply Chain Management (SCM) in five-star hotels in Saudi Arabia, focusing on how integrating TQM principles can enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction within the hospitality sector. The study emphasizes the convergence of TQM and SCM, highlighting continuous improvement, a culture of quality, and customer satisfaction as key impacts of TQM on SCM. TQM encourages organizations to evaluate and enhance processes continuously, leading to more streamlined and efficient supply chains. The integration of TQM principles into SCM processes aims to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction, improved product quality, reduced costs, and increased operational efficiency. Several challenges in implementing TQM in Saudi five-star hotels are identified, including communication barriers, resistance to change, and resource constraints. The study proposes a comprehensive strategy for successful TQM and SCM integration, emphasizing leadership commitment, employee involvement, and the use of advanced technologies for real-time data sharing and performance monitoring. The findings are significant for hotel managers and decision-makers, providing evidence-based recommendations for implementing TQM principles to optimize supply chain processes. By adopting TQM practices, five-star hotels in Saudi Arabia can enhance their operational performance, achieve cost optimization, and ensure high levels of customer satisfaction, ultimately gaining a competitive advantage in the dynamic hospitality industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article analyses the case of cavitation in centrifugal pumps of the 1st lift pumping station (PS-1) of the water supply system of one of the cities of Ukraine, supplied with water from a reservoir on the Dnipro River. In the classical scheme of a water supply system from a surface source, the operating mode of water treatment facilities should be uniform throughout the day, considering the water treatment’s physical and chemical processes. According to this, the operating mode of PS-1, which supplies ‘raw’ water to the water treatment plant, is considered uniform throughout the day. However, one caveat is that fast filters are washed with drinking water from clean water reservoirs. Its replenishment occurs due to the accelerated operation of the water treatment plant, and, at this time, PS-1 should increase the water supply to the water treatment plant. However, if the influx of water from the water intake structures is fixed, it occurs when the centrifugal pumps PS-1, operating under the bay, begin to capture some air. A two-phase flow of water forms in the pumps, which breaks away from the impeller blades, and cavitation occurs, destroying this impeller.\nIt was necessary to establish the cause of cavitation and develop measures to eliminate it during the further operation of pumps at PS-1. The reasons for cavitation may be the following: failure of the operating point according to the Q–H characteristic at both low and high water flow rates; water flow breaks away from the blades with the formation of cavities and two-phase flow; violation of the requirement of the permissible cavitation reserve – the minimum pressure at the pump inlet if the pump is installed above the water level in the tank; violation of the requirement that there must always be more water at the pump inlet than at the outlet when installing the pump under the bay. The main reason for pump cavitation at PS-1 is the discrepancy between the water inflow from the water intake structures and the water supply regime to the water treatment facilities. The influx of water to PS-1 from the water intake structures is fixed, and the water use at the water treatment plant is uneven, as it depends on the technological process of water purification.\nThe need to coordinate the modes of water supply into the suction pipeline of the pump and the mode of water supply to the pressure pipeline becomes urgent. In this case, there will be no cavitation.\nKeywords: water supply system, operating mode of facilities, 1st lift pumping station, cavitation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the effort to limit global warming to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level, decarbonization of supply chains is crucial. Companies will need to reduce not only their direct and indirect emissions (scope 1 and 2) but also their indirect emissions (scope 3). In some sectors, the upstream scope 3 emissions can actually be larger than the companies’ direct emissions. Therefore, a systematic literature review was carried out to understand how previous research in the field of supply chain management (SCM) approached energy efficiency and energy management in the upstream supply chain. The results indicate that only a few studies have addressed energy efficiency within SCM, and the majority assess energy solely as total energy use, without exploring opportunities to reduce final energy use among upstream suppliers. Moreover, results show that there is a lack of standards and methods to assess suppliers’ energy use, making it difficult for suppliers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, to overcome barriers to implementing energy management. In conclusion, even though energy efficiency is a cost-effective means to reduce CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions, only a limited number of studies in the field of SCM have integrated energy efficiency, revealing a vast knowledge gap in this field.</jats:p>"

However, in the fierce market competition, many enterprises ignore the importance of supply chain in the process of operation, which leads to the frequent bankruptcy of enterprises. To solve this problem, the research focuses on the supply chain performance evaluation of cross-border e-commerce enterprises, and proposes an improved error inverse propagation algorithm supply chain performance evaluation model. The results show that the model has improved the service capability of cross-border e-commerce, the performance of suppliers and the supply chain. The average relative error of the artificial neural network algorithm and the error reverse propagation algorithm is 3.26% and 10.23% respectively, while the average relative error of the expected output and actual output of the artificial neural network algorithm is 2.11%, and the average relative error of the expected output value and actual output of the error reverse propagation algorithm is 6.78%. It can be seen that the artificial neural network algorithm can effectively improve the performance level of the supply chain, and under this algorithm, the objectivity of the weights and the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction results are guaranteed. Therefore, this study has important scientific value and practical significance for understanding and improving the supply chain management of cross-border e-commerce enterprises.</jats:p>",

Test results show that the volumetric efficiency will be affected by the coupling of multiple factors simultaneously, showing complex nonlinearity. A simulation model whose accuracy was verified by test data was established for analyzing the influencing factors of supply performance. With the increase in speed, the variation of volumetric efficiency has a linear relationship with the change of radial clearance and a quadratic parabola relationship with the change of axial clearance. In the range of working speed, the influence of radial clearance on volumetric efficiency is more significant, while the influence of axial clearance on volumetric efficiency will be gradually enhanced with increasing speed. The radial tolerance range should be as small as possible to ensure the consistency of the urea pump’s volumetric efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Several features of automotive procurement distinguish it from the prototypical supply chain in the academic literature: pass-through pricing that reimburses suppliers for raw material costs, market frictions that prohibit cost transparency and imbue suppliers with pricing power, and contractual commitments that span multiple production periods. In this context, we formalize a procurement model by considering an automaker that buys components from an upstream supplier to assemble cars over several production periods in an environment where period demands and raw material costs are both stochastic. Our paper clarifies how information asymmetry and market factors that amplify or weaken this asymmetry affect the firms’ procurement protocol preferences. Then, using proprietary contract and supplier data from BMW, we empirically validate this model and show that it reflects BMW’s reality: the factors that should theoretically go into automotive procurement decisions do so. Our analysis also reveals that existing contracting protocols in this context are not optimal for procurement under asymmetric information, and so we propose an alternative contracting method. We calibrate our model and estimate an automaker’s performance improvement from this optimal contract over the status quo. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Vishal Gaur, operations management. </jats:p><jats:p> Supplemental Material: The data files and online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4880 . </jats:p>",

Moreover, organizations often possess resources such as staff, various vehicles, and medical facilities, which can mitigate human casualties and address needs across affected areas. However, despite the importance of managing disasters within organizational networks, there remains a research gap in the development of mathematical models for such scenarios, specifically incorporating operations centers/field offices and external stakeholders as relief centers. Addressing this gap, this study examines an optimization model for both before and after disaster planning in a humanitarian supply chain and logistical framework within an organization. The affected areas are defined as regional branches, operational units, major transportation hubs, operations centers/field offices, external stakeholders, and medical facilities. A mixed-integer nonlinear model is formulated to minimize overall costs, considering factors such as penalty costs for untreated injuries and demand, delays in rescue and relief item distribution operations, and waiting costs for the injured in emergency medical vehicles and air ambulances. The model is implemented using GAMS software 47.1.0 for various test problems across different scales, with the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm proposed for larger-scale scenarios. Numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model and to validate the metaheuristic approach. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the model’s performance under different conditions, and key managerial insights and implications are discussed.</jats:p>"

Today, it is highly relevant and concerns both ordinary citizens and all possible business representatives. With each new year, more and more people are beginning to pay attention to the problems related to environmental pollution and climate change. They are global, existential challenges for humanity, and therefore require high-quality ideas, fast, effective and truly complex counteractions that can improve the current state of affairs. The gradual deterioration of the ecological situation in the world is leading to a rise in interest to these problems and the search of possible variants that can minimise the negative anthropogenic impact on the environment. One of the most effective solutions today is the decarbonisation of companies' activity, and therefore, scientists and researchers need to continue to study and analyse this complex question, to look for possible prospects for their development in the direction of «green» initiatives.</jats:p>"

This study examined the ecosystem services supply and demand of the Kilombero Valley Floodplain in Southeastern Tanzania. The supply-demand budget index was calculated using land use data from 1990, 2010, and 2016 and an expert-based matrix model examined the dynamic change of supply and demand for the 17 ecosystem services (7 regulating, 8 provisioning, and 2 cultural). The spatial analytic features of ArcGIS 10.2 were utilized to build ecosystem services evaluation matrices and regionally explicit supply, demand, and supply-demand budget maps. The study found that between 1990 and 2016, the supply of ecosystem services within the Kilombero Valley floodplain decreased substantially while the demand for ecosystem services increased spatially towards the core low-lying area of the valley. Furthermore, the average ecosystem service supply-demand budget index declined from 1.8 in 1990 to 1.6 in 2016, with few exceptions of food production, pollination, and freshwater supply, where ecosystem service supply exceeds demand. The decline is linked to deforestation, agricultural expansion, agropastoralists immigration, and encroachment to the wetland area. Thus, this study recommends that the government should create effective land use plans for each ward and village in the Kilombero District, establish afforestation programs, local irrigation schemes for smallholder farmers, and enforce environmental by-laws to ensure sustainable ecological management in the Kilombero Valley Floodplain and its ecosystems.</jats:p>"

Supply chain vulnerabilities are the fundamental elements that leave the business subject to disruption. It is necessary to identify the vulnerabilities in the supply chain before attempting to improve its resilience. This study proposes to identify the primary causes of organizational vulnerability in the supply chain of construction projects based on these problems. The study focuses on medium-sized and large construction companies that work on building projects in Aceh Province between 2018 and 2022. This study used a data collection technique by distributing questionnaires to contractor companies involved in construction projects. The primary data collection was analyzed using descriptive analysis and the Relative Importance Index (RII) method. The results obtained show that management vulnerability is the main vulnerable factor in the organization of the supply chain of construction projects, with the highest index being delayed in information and decision-making with an RII value of 0.9118. The findings of this study may be useful to contractor firms in managing the construction project supply chain.</jats:p>",

By using stock price crashes as an indicator of risk factors, our study reveals that stock price crash risk can be transmitted from major customers to suppliers with a delay of up to two weeks. We show that the information opacity of suppliers is a factor that potentially contributes to the delayed crash contagion. We also find that the contagion effect becomes more pronounced as the importance of customers increases. Moreover, customer operational incidents have a more pronounced contagion effect on suppliers compared to customer financial incidents. Additionally, we find that suppliers tend to take strategic measures following the stock price crashes of their major customers, including diversifying their customer base, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving product quality. However, among these actions, only the improvement of operational efficiency effectively mitigates the adverse impact of customer stock price crashes on suppliers. Overall, our findings provide new insight into the distribution of risk factors across SC networks, highlighting the critical role of operational improvements in bolstering the resilience of firms to SC risks. </jats:p>",

Here, we assess the role of plant-based food supply (PFS) in fulfilling dietary needs for energy and 17 nutrients in China from 1997 to 2016. We estimate per nutrient the coverage (supply/demand) and source diversity (exponentiated Shannon entropy of sources). Coverage was insufficient (supply/demand&lt;1) for selenium, calcium, riboflavin, and vitamin A. Source diversity was below 4 for vitamins A and C. From 1997 to 2016, coverage and source diversity improved little for these nutrients. Transformations like reducing avoidable nutrient losses, repurposing feed to food consumption via reducing red meat intake, and reallocating domestic crop use increased coverage by at least 18%, but hardly improved source diversity. The above PFS transformations enable the fulfilment of all nutrient needs except selenium, providing opportunities for more sustainable and healthy diets in China.</p>"

Water is supplied from water sources located at a great distance from the fire site. In this case, there are used three schemes of water delivery: by delivery, pumping from pump to pump of fire trucks, pumping with the use of intermediate tanks (tanker trucks, various kinds of tanks). The first two schemes are costly due to the use of a large number of vehicles. The third scheme has a number of advantages: it reduces the use of tank trucks, which are scarce in fire extinguishing, and simplifies the management of the pumping process. But, before laying the main pressure fire hoses from the water source to the fire site, it is necessary to perform the calculation of this line. It includes determination of the type and quantity of necessary fire-technical equipment, assessment of the impact of the terrain on the conditions of fire hoses laying, etc. When making such calculations, the ratios from the fire manager’s handbooks are used. The article gives examples of discrepancy between the performed calculations and real examples of laying pump-hose lines. Such comparison is made on the example of using the complex of equipment «Geyser 10000» when laying a hose-pipe line with the length of 10 km and using PANRC when supplying water at a distance of more than 1 km. Analysis of the results of such comparison showed that calculated values of the length of pump-hose lines are considerably less than the real result of assembling such a line. It is established that the main reason for such discrepancy is outdated data on the value of hydraulic resistance of fire hoses. Reference literature provides values of hydraulic resistance for fire hoses made of materials and technologies of the 50s–70s. Modern fire hoses are made of polymeric materials. For these, hydraulic resistance data are not available for some hose diameters. It is recommended to revise the reference data on hydraulic resistance of fire hoses.</jats:p>",

Among various erosion estimation models, the RUSLE equation stands out for its consistency and minimal data requirements. The present study aims to utilize geographic information systems (GIS) software to quantify and map soil loss in the Isser watershed in northern Algeria employing the RUSLE model to strategically plan development measures and prioritize actions to safeguard high-risk erosion areas. Implementing the RUSLE-GIS approach involves integrating multiple datasets, including precipitation, soil erodibility, topography, vegetation cover, and anti-erosion practices. By combining these factors, a comprehensive map depicting erosion rates is generated. The findings categorize potential soil erosion into six groups, ranging from very low to extremely high. They indicate that 61.5% of the Isser Basin faces erosion, varying from moderate to very high (&amp;gt;20 t ha−1 year−1). In addition, 25% of the total surface experiences erosion levels classified as high to very high (&amp;gt;50 t ha−1 year−1). This underscores the urgent need for anti-erosive measures. These measures aim to safeguard the basin's soils, extend the lifespan of existing dam reservoirs (Koudiet Acerdoune and Beni Amran), and preserve their water potential.</jats:p>",

This concept becomes particularly relevant during periods of crisis when businesses need to organize their activities to minimize costs associated with the movement and storage of goods from the initial source to the final consumer [1]. The article establishes that logistics is one of the key components of successful business operations in modern conditions, and its significance cannot be overstated as it encompasses all processes related to the management of material, information, and financial flows from the supplier to the final consumer. It is proven that logistics gains special importance during crises such as economic recessions, natural disasters, wars, or global pandemics. Under such conditions, effective management of logistic business processes becomes not just a potential development strategy but a necessity for every enterprise, as logistics is a key element ensuring the efficiency and competitiveness of companies. Therefore, crisis management in business holds one of the priority positions in the enterprise development strategy. The purpose of this article is to study the theoretical and practical aspects of optimizing business processes in logistics under conditions of crisis management. The main focus is on determining the impact of key factors in the development of logistic activities on the financial and economic state of the enterprise during crises. Moreover, the article demonstrates how the optimization of business processes affects the efficiency of enterprise operations using examples from large companies. In this context, several negative factors affecting the economic state of the enterprise in crisis conditions are identified, and ways to improve such processes are proposed, which will not only help to overcome the negative manifestations of crises but also improve the financial state of the enterprise as a whole.</jats:p>"

This activity includes many factors that may be in conflict in nature, so that if the necessary checks are not carried out when choosing a location, this can affect the life of the organization in the long term. The purpose of this research is to investigate the problem of location of facilities in the supply chain distribution sector and to develop a new mathematical model for this problem. One of the important limitations of this mathematical model is the capacity limitations. Also, this issue is investigated for multi-product and multi-period distribution planning.

To tackle these problems, a new PBFT technique known as trace-PBFT (t-PBFT) is being contemplated for adoption in the food supply chain. The PBFT algorithm, short for Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, serves as the fundamental algorithm. The linkages throughout the supply chain may be categorized into three primary groups. As a response to the continuing discussion over the amount of data, the status of each node is continuously updated in real time. This metric is utilized to evaluate the dependability of the principal node and to analyze the overall performance of the nodes. To minimize the amount of data transmitted between nodes, we optimized the consensus process of the first algorithm. The distinct attributes of offering collaborative food technology were considered throughout this procedure. Experimental evidence indicates that the t-PBFT approach outperforms the PBFT algorithm in terms of throughput, request delay, and information overhead. An architectural paradigm is proposed by integrating the t-PBFT algorithm with a federated network. This model was developed in response to the distinct demands of the food supply chain. This model effectively captures data at each stage of the food supply chain to ensure information tracking while preserving the safety of the food technology flow process.</jats:p>"

The available approaches to assessing the level of digital transformation of enterprises, which is a necessary tool for further development strategy, were analyzed. It was determined that existing studies and scientific publications on the formation of systems for evaluating the level of digital development need some refinement, taking into account the specifics of the enterprises to which they are applied. A unique approach to forming an assessment of the level of digital transformation of aviation enterprises was proposed, according to which it is proposed to apply an integral assessment that takes into account indices of digital activity, maturity and interaction. The advantage of this approach is taking into account the specific processes inherent in aviation industry enterprises and forming a tool that allows you to assess the possibility of functioning of various aviation market subjects in a single information field. Special attention was paid to the method of calculating indicators that are part of the indices of digital activity, maturity and interaction. Thus, the assessment of the level of digital transformation of aviation enterprises will allow in the future to develop a joint strategy for the formation of a digital space in which the subjects of the aviation market will function.</jats:p>"

However, other hazards are associated with this, including global disputes, geopolitical tensions, trade battles, natural catastrophes, terrorist threats, and security breaches, all of which can disrupt the supply chain. These hazards highlight the need for robust supply chain risk management (SCRM) strategies to ensure the seamless distribution of products and services in the face of adversity. To address these challenges, this study examines the impact of customer relationships (CR) on supply chain risk management in the CPEC logistics sector. A survey conducted across various transportation and logistics firms' sites obtained data from 500 staff members. After removing 50 partial replies, 450 total responses were considered. The information also includes reactions for operational supply chain risk management (OSCRM), organization performance (OP), strategic supply chain risk management (SSCRM), and customer relationship (CR). To evaluate the respondents of the survey questionnaire using the Likert scale. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is utilized to validate the hypothesis, which is used for statistical analysis, validation of structural models, and measurement models. The measurement model established the measure's validity and reliability, while other approaches demonstrated discriminant validity. The structural model is employed to identify the significant relationships between CR and SCRM in the logistics sector. The findings emphasize CR's importance in managing the supply chain's inherent constraints, contributing to CPEC's sustainability. Overall, this research attempts to enhance understanding of the complex relationship between CR and SCRM in the dynamic world of global logistics. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2024-010-06-010 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

This study conducted a thorough analysis of 15 prominent oil and gas companies across Europe, Asia and America over a span of 10 years. The study employed a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative content analysis of annual reports with quantitative analysis of variance to assess the companies’ commitment to sustainability practices in response to different institutional pressures. The findings uncovered notable variations in the prioritisation of economic, social, environmental and stakeholder sustainability across different continents. The study also highlighted various institutional pressures that impact these companies, including regulatory demands, Paris Agreement objectives and non-governmental organisation expectations. Notably, these companies displayed different levels of responsiveness to these pressures, which impacted their SCM and sustainability strategies. This research also highlights the intricate relationship between institutional pressures and sustainability within the oil and gas industry. This implies that companies should develop strong sustainability strategies that align with external pressures to improve their competitive advantage. For policymakers, the study suggests the development of more robust regulatory frameworks that consider the varying sustainability practices across different regions. Furthermore, it promotes the need for additional research to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies in real-world applications, establishing a foundation for well-informed policy choices that support a sustainable future in the oil and gas industry. </jats:p>"

In the first seconds of cooling, the tone of the muscular blood vessels begins to increase and their blood filling decreases, the skin color lightens, and in the cooled area of the body, acute soreness develops. After a few tens of seconds of cooling, spasm in the blood vessels reaches maximum level and their filling with blood decreases to a minimum, the skin turns white, and the soreness becomes severe. These changes persist at their peak for a few minutes, after which they begin to disappear, despite the persisting hypothermia. However, after 10–15 minutes of cooling, hyperemia develops in the hypothermia zone; as a result, the soreness disappears and the skin reddens. Notably, in the norm, sudden cooling of tissues causes irritation of the temperature receptors found in them. The resulting excitation of temperature receptors causes reflex spasm of blood vessels, which has an adaptive value, as it developed for temperature homeostasis of warm-blooded organisms. Acute pain accompanying cold spasm of blood vessels has been found to be due to mechanical squeezing of pain receptors located under the muscular layer in the wall of blood vessels. Conversely, the presence of ethyl alcohol in the blood or, in severe cases, alcohol intoxication changes the dynamics of blood supply in tissues at their sudden cooling: during cooling, blood vessels expand and overflow with blood without the initial phase of spasm and occurrence of pain. Moreover, hyperemia persists throughout and after the cooling period. That is, alcohol intoxication is manifested by the immediate development of hyperemia and skin redness in the cooled area of the body without the initial spasm of blood vessels and appearance of soreness and pallor of the skin in the area of cooling.</jats:p>"

In the heterogeneous substitute product coexistence environment, it is valuable to explore the motivation behind CSR implementation as well as the advantages and differences associated with different members’ CSR implementations. In this study, we consider that the manufacturer produces both green products and ordinary products that are substitutes for each other and construct a CSR-absence scenario (Model N), a retailer implementing CSR scenario (Model R), and a manufacturer implementing CSR scenario (Model M). Applying a game-theory-based method, we obtain the optimal pricing, green decision, and supply chain profit under different scenarios. We analyze the effects of consumers’ green preference, green product function coefficient, and CSR level on decision making and performance. Through comparison and numerical analysis, we find the following: (1) Although the CSR behaviors of the manufacturer and the retailer squeeze the market demand space of the ordinary products, the greenness of the green product increases, and the retail price decreases. This not only enhances the consumer surplus of green products but also increases the profit and social welfare of the supply chain system. (2) The eco-friendliness of green products, product demand, and social welfare levels are the highest when the retailer implements CSR, followed by when the manufacturer implements CSR, and are the lowest in the CSR-absence scenario. In addition, the following retailer can enhance both its and the manufacturer’s profits through implementing CSR within a reasonable range.

Qualitypower supply and electricity demand have long been a challenge for India's steel sector. In this study, the authors suggested a hybrid renewable energy-based decarbonization approach for the steel sector. Utilizing hydrogen in the production of steel lowers costs, boosts efficiency, and eliminates harmful emissions, aligning with sustainability and economic goals by substituting carbon-based fuels with a clean-burning energy source.

It introduces a novel teaching approach termed “Just-in-Time Teaching (JITT) cloud teaching,” which integrates “real-time teaching” with the Internet of Things-based “cloud teaching model” specifically for accounting education. First, the current status of accounting education in secondary vocational schools is investigated through a questionnaire survey. Subsequently, adjustments are made to the traditional teaching model, considering the limitations in teaching media creation channels and challenges in teaching activities. The teaching content of accounting education is designed in terms of mind maps, curriculum type, and problem design. The findings indicate: (1) Almost half of the surveyed teachers have heard of but never used the JITT cloud teaching, and the proportion is the largest. Some teachers have used but disapprove of JITT cloud teaching. (2) The proportion of students using website learning resources is 43.81%, while the proportion using mobile learning applications is 38.34%. (3) There is a significant difference between the traditional teaching mode and the JITT teaching mode in terms of “classroom teaching” and “sense of responsibility”. The average values under the JITT teaching mode have significantly improved compared to the traditional one. (4) The experimental group has a higher proportion of students scoring 90–100, which is 58%, significantly higher than the control group. The above research results indicate that there are still many possibilities for the practical application of the JITT teaching method in the future Moreover, applying the JITT cloud teaching model contributes to enhancing teaching quality and supports students’ learning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to enhance competitiveness, companies must prioritize product customization, high quality, cost reduction, and distribution speed. To achieve these goals, it is essential to focus on supply chain management. Supply chain management is defined as the integrated process of obtaining materials and services, transforming them into intermediate and final products, and delivering them to customers. This involves activities such as purchasing and outsourcing, in addition to other functions that are crucial for the relationship between suppliers and distributors. The primary objectives of supply chain management (SCM) are the timely delivery of products to consumers, cost reduction, and the improvement of outcomes across the entire supply chain (as opposed to a single company). Additionally, SCM facilitates the reduction of time, the centralization of planning and distribution activities, and the optimization of resources. Given the current circumstances, the application of SCM is particularly advantageous, as it enables the management of the flow of goods or products in a supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The firm is trying to get ahead of its competitors in different industries through LSCM in today’s cutthroat competition environment. By reducing waste, removing risks and increasing efficiency and cost-effectiveness, it enhances its operational performance. This research explores food depots’ problems in the food industry and how they can apply LSCM to minimise wastage, reduce lead time, improve cost-effectiveness, enhance efficiency and achieve better operational performance within a framework of constant improvement. As such, an ideal environment, as well as proper care for these perishable items, is crucial since any deviation may lead to contamination that ultimately results in reduced productivity and increased cost. Thus, this research provides insight into the extent to which deployment of lean supply chain management can help ensure optimal utilisation of resources in terms of achieving maximum productivity levels with minimal costs involved during the process while improving operational performances for the food depots. In sum, Lean Supply Chain Management offers a systematised approach towards daily activities at a food depot with an efficient distribution system, hence minimum expenditure mitigating unnecessary wastage, thus achieving topmost production rates.</jats:p>"

Integrated pump station adopts a dual-mode water supply system which has adjustable water storage capacity and can utilize the pressure of inlet water effectively; hence, it is a new type of solution in optimizing the operation of urban water supply systems. In order to solve the problem of insufficient water supply pressure during peak hours in the railway station and municipal party committee area of S city, the author constructed a pipe network hydraulic model, conducted a systematic analysis of the water supply pipe network, and optimized the design of integrated pump stations (IPSs) using NSGA-III combined with EPANET. Finally, the hydraulic model of the pipe network is used to verify the feasibility of the scheme. The results show that under the premise of ensuring a safe water supply, energy conservation, and water age optimization can be achieved simultaneously, and the fluctuation intensity of the total water supply from the water plants is effectively reduced.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The per capita net availability of pulses in India has been increased from 15.5 kg per year in 2018-19 to 19.6 kg in 2021-22. Efforts made to bridge the gap between demand and supply of pulses in the country has resulted in reducing the gap to some extent in recent years and still country is depended on import to meet the growing demand of the pulses such as pigeon pea, lentils and peas. Few studies predicted the demand and supply of pulses as a whole in the country and no studies analyzed the pulse wise demand supply gap in India. Hence, the present study was proposed to predict the demand and supply of major pulses such as chickpea (Gram/Chana), pigeon pea (Tur/Arhar), black gram (urd bean), mung bean (Green gram) and lentil (Masur) in India for a period, 2024-2030. Methods: The present study has been used the crop data on area, production and yield of major pulses including chickpea (Gram/Chana), pigeon pea (Tur/Arhar), black gram (urd bean), mung bean (Green gram) and lentil (Masur) for a period of 29 years (1985-2024) collected from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Government of India, New Delhi. Household consumption expenditure data was collected from the National Sample Survey office for 2011-12 from the Government of India. The supply projection was estimated by using linear regression model and demand projections were done by using behaviouristic approach. Result: Decadal trend in area, production and yield of pulses from 1970-2010 showed mixed trends of increase and decrease, whereas in 2010-2020, chickpea, pigeon pea, mung bean and black gram showed positive trend in area, production and yield but lentil alone showed negative trend in production. Import dependency of the pulses in the total availability has reduced to 8.92 per cent in 2021-22 from 19.42 per cent in 2009-10. Import dependency of the pulses in the total availability has reduced to 8.92 per cent in 2021-22 from 19.42 per cent in 2009-10. The availability of pulses has grown at a rate of 3.73 per cent from 2009 to 2021. Chick Pea, Tur, Mung bean, Urd bean and Lentils together contributed on an average 88.7 per cent to the total pulses production and 83.73 per cent of pulses availability from 2013 to 2021. Production of these five pulses has increased to 23.04 million tonnes in 2020-21 from 17.3 million tonnes from 2013-14. Gram is the single pulse contributed more than 40 per cent of the pulse production of the country in the above period. Demand supply projection showed a net surplus of 0.81-3.89 mt in the case of pulses and 5.64 -7.63 mt in the case of gram and 0.89 to 1.91 mt in Urd and 0.68 to 1.57 mt in Mung bean during 2024-2030. But in the case of pigeon pea and lentil there may be a net deficit in the range of 3-2.42 and 1.13-1.04 mt, respectively, during 2024-2030. Efforts should be made to bridge the gap in demand and supply of pigeon pea and lentil by the way of bringing new areas under pulses and developing the technologies suitable for the clusters.\n</jats:p>"

In growing firms, SCF enhances risk‐taking capacity and reduces equity costs, while in declining firms, it stabilizes supply chains and increases customer concentration. In mature firms, SCF leads to strategic inertia. Economic tests suggest SCF aids firms in establishing unique competitive advantages at various stages of their life cycles.</jats:p>",

Water automation is the management and tracking of water use and control of water in different places. This automated water supply management system for urban areas can be used to uniformly distribute water for their daily consumption and monitor water storage tanks to reduce water losses by estimating water consumption and water level. All these operating steps are linked by a programmable interface controller (PIC) with delay communication via the GSM module and facilitate process control. When designing a water supply system for any facility, it is first necessary to determine how much water and what quality must be supplied to this facility. To solve this problem, it is necessary to take into account as fully as possible all possible water consumers and establish their requirements for the quantity and quality of supplied water.The article explores the issues of automation and control of the water supply system in a residential complex. Modern technologies and approaches to automating the processes of control and distribution of water in residential buildings and complexes are considered. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of smart systems to monitor and manage water consumption, ensuring optimal consumption, reducing losses and improving efficiency. Automation of water supply not only helps save resources, but also increases convenience and safety for residents. The article also discusses examples of successful implementation of automated systems in various residential complexes and prospects for their development in the future.</jats:p>"

This study gathered 132 valid responses and the proposed model was evaluated using SmartPLS 4.0. Through partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM), the findings showed that core resources (natural resources and cultural heritage attraction) have substantial positive associations with destination marketing efforts. Supporting resources (tourism infrastructure and quality of tourism services) were found to be significantly and positively associated with DC. Interestingly, this study has revealed the absence of significant relationships between destination marketing efforts and ecotourism DC. These findings enable tourism practitioners to better understand the impacts of resources on sustainable development of ecotourism competitiveness, specifically from suppliers’ perspectives.

The beef self-sufficiency policy is one of the flagship policies aimed at enhancing beef supply in Indonesia. This study aims to assess the impact of the beef self-sufficiency policy on beef supply in Indonesia. The study used time series data from 1990 to 2019, sourced from BPS, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Trade, BI, and FAO. The analysis method employed an econometric approach through a simultaneous equation system model and estimated using the Two Stage Least Square (2SLS) method. The research findings showed that the beef self-sufficiency policy has a positive and significant effect on domestic beef production (p-value &lt; 0.15) and beef demand (p-value &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the beef self-sufficiency policy has a negative and significant effect on the import of fattening cattle (p-value &lt; 0.05). The results showed that the beef self-sufficiency policy through the artificial insemination program had an impact on increased calf population by 3.819%, cattle population by 1.202%, and domestic beef production by 2.528%. These programs also showed an impact on the decreased import of fattening cattle by 13.727% and the import of beef by 24.972%. It can be concluded that the beef self-sufficiency policy has significant impacts on the beef supply in Indonesia.</jats:p>",

One of the product variants of coconut shell briquettes is shisha briquettes. This research aims to investigate the conceptual design of a sustainable supply chain by identifying key stakeholders and understanding the role of each stakeholder and the underlying processes that affect sustainability. The initial step of this research is to conduct an entity system requirements analysis using a use-case diagram to identify key stakeholders. The next step is to identify critical processes using BPMN 2.0 in accordance with established sustainability requirements. Based on the results of the requirements analysis through the entity system and use case diagram, five stakeholders were identified: industry, coconut shell farmers, end consumers, training institutions, and sustainability assessment institutions. According to the results of the business model analysis using BPMN 2.0 with the Indonesian Bioenergy Sustainability Indicator (IBSI), there are three main activities in the raw material procurement process: the selection of coconut shell farmers, facilities owned by farmers, and farmer skills training. Meanwhile, in terms of the production system, there are three main activities, namely production planning, production implementation, and labor training.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, the impacts of urbanization on the hydrological cycle have led to an increase in the frequency and magnitude of urban flooding events, and this is also amplified by the effects of climate change. Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) provide a revolutionary change in this field, improving the sustainability and resilience of cities. This research explores the integration of different SuDS with the aim of significantly reducing both the flow volume and celerity of floods in a residual urban catchment area of the metropolitan city of Querétaro (Mèxico), where extreme rainfall frequently occurs. This catchment is a representative suburb of urban pressure and environmental degradation problems. Currently, managing storm water under climate uncertainty through a multi-disciplinary approach is a major concern in this urban area. A 1D–2D coupling model of shallow water equations, the finite volume method, an unstructured meshing method, and a hybrid parallel computing application defined the optimal configuration of SuDS at catchment scale to reduce the flood vulnerability in Querétaro. Specifically, in this paper, we explore the management issues of the proposed SuDS configuration that acts as a water resource system with multiple purposes. A generic simulation model called MODSIM was applied to simulate the designed urban drainage system under a balanced IPCC future climate scenario in terms of reliability, resilience and vulnerability against water scarcity. The proposed hierarchical Reliability–Resilience–Vulnerability approach appears to be effective in evaluating the system performance, showing that the complete satisfaction of non-essential water uses in Querétaro can be assured at a 65% rate of reliability for a large range of reservoir storage conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nowadays the issue of reducing environmental pollution is on the agenda of all countries. Among the areas that have huge negative consequences for nature, logistics and supply chains take their place. Today, there are many concepts and scientific currents that recognize the need to account for the environmental component in urban logistics. Environmental aspects are used when evaluating the efficiency of investment projects, developing new models of vehicles, calculating taxes and insurance payments, and when searching for the best delivery schemes.  The goal of the work. Taking into account the world experience in research on the chosen topic, the purpose of this study is to consolidate the world's successful experience in environmentally friendly urban delivery and assess their applicability in Ukraine.  Technologies and methods that allow reducing the negative impact of motor vehicles on the environment include:  The technology of off-peak delivery, which allows you to improve the speed mode of the car. With off-peak delivery, the probability of traffic jams is minimized, which makes the speed of movement the maximum permissible in the city (and, accordingly, the most environmentally friendly). Although night delivery is currently not possible in Ukraine due to the curfew, late and early delivery is still available, allowing you to successfully bypass traffic jams.  Use of consolidation centers. The economic idea of consolidation of freight transportation is to use the effect of scale - the greater the carrying capacity of the vehicle, the lower the specific costs for transportation of a unit of production. Currently, the construction of the consolidation center is being evaluated from the point of view of the impact of the supply chain on the environment. At the same time, the existence of a consolidation center near or within the city allows to organize delivery by vehicles with zero or low level of environmental pollution.  Use of Parcel Delivery Lockers. Delivery lockers are usually installed in places where the maximum flow of residents is concentrated, which makes it possible to create additional comfort for users due to the possibility of choosing the point closest to their own home or place of work. This method eliminates up to two thirds of harmful emissions into the air. The number of post machines and the area covered by them increases year by year, which allows us to talk about the success of this technology. According to the results of 2022, such major players of express delivery as \"Nova Poshta\" (now “Nova”), \"Ukrposhta\" and \"Meest\" will continue to work with post delivery lockers in Ukraine.  Use of more environmentally friendly types of transport. The use of hybrid, electric or non-motorized vehicles is increasingly used in last-mile logistics. Electric vehicles, mopeds, two- or three-wheeled bicycles with a large trunk or cargo body can be considered environmentally friendly types of urban logistics. Such vehicles have practically zero emissions of harmful substances, they are much more maneuverable and do not require a lot of space for unloading, loading and parking.  Implementation of zones with low (zero) air pollution. Zones with zero or low emissions have long been used in developed countries. There are no generally accepted technologies for calculating the territory that requires restrictions on the movement of transport, as well as for calculating the cost of such movement. Usually it depends on the will of the local authorities, the wishes of the residents and the well-being of the region.  Prohibition on the use of motor vehicles. Some local authorities introduce a complete ban on the use of motor vehicles within certain parts of the city. Usually these are historical centers with dense buildings and a large number of tourists. Sometimes such drastic measures are combined with night delivery technology. If this is not possible, the only alternative is delivery by small, usually two- or three-wheeled, zero-emission vehicles.  Improvement of traffic management. Competently designed organization of road traffic can reduce the pressure on the environment. The use of an intelligent transport system in smart cities allows you to perform important tasks like detection of transport accidents; automated control of the ramp, traffic lights and parking, etc. Improvement of road conditions. This refers to the quality of the road surface, markings, cleanliness of the road surface, etc. Improvement of road conditions indirectly affects the improvement of environment of the region.  Summing up the results of the research, successful global practices in environmental friendly urban logistics are highlighted, which are applied and have prospects for application in Ukraine. It was concluded that there is a huge potential of using world experience in urban logistics of Ukraine. This will bring Ukrainian logistics and urban supply chains to a new level, increasing the level of health and general satisfaction of the citizens.</jats:p>"

Logistics supply chain management (SCM) is a logistics management system centered around the core products or business of the supply chain, as well as a logistics management system organized around the core logistics business. As an important part of logistics SCM, logistics control requires real‐time monitoring and adjustment of transportation, warehousing, distribution, and other links. Mobile communication technology can provide real‐time positioning, tracking, monitoring, and data transmission functions, which provides strong technical support for logistics control. It can also optimize logistics scheduling and improve logistics efficiency and accuracy, thereby reducing transportation costs and improving logistics quality and efficiency. This article aimed to explore the relationship between mobile communication technology and logistics SCM and control, and to use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for research. The research results indicated that under the same other conditions, 38 and 37 people rated the X system as liked by companies A and B, accounting for 95% and 92.5% respectively; only 4 and 1 people rated the Y system as liked, accounting for 10% and 2.5% respectively; the likes and dislikes of the X system were much higher than those of the Y system. This indicated a positive relationship between mobile communication technology and logistics SCM and control systems.

Since no stray current collection devices are installed at subway depots, some of the stray current leaking from the mainline will converge at the depot, seriously corroding the structural reinforcement and buried metal of the station, thereby jeopardizing the normal operation of subway trains and passenger safety. In this paper, a field-circuit coupling method is proposed to analyze the current leakage and distribution law of the subway mainline and depot. It is found that the failure of the gauge block at the mainline will trigger the maximum leakage of rail current. Additionally, it is observed that the stray current distribution at the depot is mainly influenced by the operating status of the one-way conduction device (OWCD) and the change of rail potential. These results validate the applicability and effectiveness of the field-circuit coupling method proposed in this paper and provide new technical support for the study of stray current leakage distribution in subways.</jats:p>"

Generalisation and comparative analysis of the personal scientific contribution of Russian scientists to the development of scientific, practical and educational knowledge on pharmaceutical provision of the population of the Russian Federation, expressed in the frequency of mentioning their names in the abstracts of candidate and doctoral dissertations on organizational aspects of pharmaceutical science and practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Preservation and multiplication of scientific knowledge is impossible without an objective assessment of the contribution of predecessor scientists in the development of a particular field of science. This approach provides a full-fledged characteristic of a certain scientific direction, and also serves as a recognition of the merits of scientists who have put their talents and efforts to establish in the world community of domestic pharmacy, as an independent scientific and practical sphere of public life. For the first time, a study of the array of personalities of predecessor scientists by scientific generation, scientific status and gender was conducted. The general characteristics of the array of predecessor scientists’ surnames were calculated according to five indicators. The results indicate an increased attention of dissertators to the works of their predecessors. A comparative analysis of the frequency of mentioning, ranks and places in the ranking of predecessor scientists was carried out, which made it possible to form lists of Top-20 surnames of scientists for three time periods that actively shaped scientific knowledge on drug supply. Generalisation of data for all time periods allowed us to establish a list of Top-10 scientists who have made and continue to make the greatest contribution to the scientific support of the improvement of the Russian drug supply system. CONCLUSION. The importance of preserving and multiplying the continuity of domestic pharmaceutical knowledge for the next generations of research scientists is demonstrated. It was found that scientists from the Top-10 list belong to different scientific generations, but at the same time, there is a constant scientific interest shown by young researchers in the works of their predecessors.</jats:p>",

By constructing a mathematical model under Steinkelberg game, this paper analyzes the model without freight insurance and the model with freight insurance borne by different parts of the supply chain to explore the changes of the optimal variables of each party. The results show that: with the increase of the residual value of returned goods, the optimal retail price and the optimal return volume will increase, while the optimal wholesale price and the optimal demand will decrease. Under the model of freight insurance shared by the platform and the manufacturer, with the increase of freight insurance shared by the manufacturer and the platform, the optimal selling price increases, the optimal demand and the optimal return volume decrease, and when the cost of freight insurance borne by the manufacturer exceeds half, the wholesale price increases. Under the model of buyer bearing freight insurance, when consumers have high price sensitivity, the higher the cost of consumer bearing freight insurance, the lower the maximum selling price.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hydrogen may become one of the most valuable energy carriers in the 21st century. A big step to this is the safe, compact, and cost-effective storage of hydrogen provided by hydrogen storage systems (HSS). One of the operating system elements of the hydrogen storage and supply system is its fire safety subsystem. The effectiveness of such a subsystem’s functioning depends on a conditional probability that this subsystem correctly recognises the actual state of the hydrogen storage and supply system. We carry out the formalisation of the operation of the fire safety subsystem of the hydrogen storage and supply system in the form of a graph of its states. The study considers three modes of operation of such a subsystem: control, testing, and self-control. We build a weight matrix of the fire safety subsystem states. Its elements include the intensity of transitions from one state to another, the recovery intensity, and the completeness of control and testing. The study shows that the roots of the system of Kolmogorov equations determine the efficiency of the functioning of the fire safety subsystem of the hydrogen storage and supply system. We represent this system of equations in matrix form, with the main matrix having a size of 8×7. Next, we obtain expressions for the roots of such a system of comparisons and construct an expression for the efficiency of the fire safety subsystem’s functioning of the hydrogen storage and supply system. This expression applies to all three modes of operation of such a fire safety subsystem. The considered typical modes of operation of the fire safety subsystem of the hydrogen storage and supply system are control mode, control mode with self-control, and control and testing mode. For each of these modes, we obtain expressions that describe their effectiveness. It is necessary to note that the magnitudes of recovery intensities, in contrast to transition intensities, can vary. We further provide an example of choosing the intensities of restoration of the subsystem during its control using the acceptance criterion for the probability of finding the subsystem in a state corresponding to the fire-hazardous state of the hydrogen storage and supply system.\nKeywords: fire safety, efficiency, hydrogen storage and supply system.</jats:p>",

In the course of the study, functional and organizational models of a generalized river transport enterprise were developed for the system of extraction and supply of non-metallic building materials, as well as several organizational models of the following functional subsystems included in it: pre-production, extraction and production of non-metallic building materials, supply management, planning, logistics. Special attention is paid to the study of the pre-production stage of the logistic process of extraction and production of these materials. A systematic approach has made it possible to show that currently the weakest link in the supply of non-metallic building materials by river transport is the backward technical base of production and transshipment of non-metallic building materials. This is due to the fact that the modernization of mining equipment is hampered, on the one hand, by the practical absence of its production by domestic enterprises, and, on the other hand, by sanctions restrictions on foreign supplies. This affects the cost and quality of non-metallic construction materials supplied; environmental processes accompanying the extraction process. Additionally, the weak development of digital technologies in interaction with customers has an impact on supply management in general, and the lack of a scientifically based inventory management system in the process of year-round production and supply affects the level of service and cost of supplies.</jats:p>"

Актуальность данной статьи связана с тем, что эффективное функционирование сельских производственных, коммунально-бытовых и административных объектов в агропромышленном комплексе (АПК) тесно связано с надежностью систем энергообеспечения. В свете развития цифровых технологий и роботизации в сельском хозяйстве, а также всеобщей цифровизации, все сельские потребители нуждаются в качественном электроснабжении и доставке электроэнергии. Цель данной статьи заключается в исследовании актуальных вопросов развития электроснабжения АПК. Методология. В качестве основных методов исследования был использован анализ и синтез. Объектом исследования является электроснабжение. Предметом исследования выступило развитие электроснабжения АПК. Результаты. Сокращение числа сельского населения и изменение структуры потребителей в сельских районах создают проблемы для электросетевых компаний, обслуживающих сельское электроснабжение, так как они сталкиваются с уменьшением доходов и увеличением расходов на обслуживание сетей. В результате стоимость электроэнергии для сельских потребителей увеличивается. В связи с этим возникает потребность в разработке новых решений для снижения затрат и применения новых методов и средств электроснабжения для сельских потребителей. Подключение микрогенерации, в том числе на базе возобновляемых источников энергии, к сельским электрическим сетям требует проведения исследований для оптимального конфигурирования электрических сетей и разработки режимов работы маломасштабных сетей. Актуальны также вопросы использования передвижных энергетических платформ в сельскохозяйственной инфраструктуре. Заключение.

The relevance of this article is related to the fact that the efective functioning of rural production, utility and administrative facilities in the agro-industrial complex (AIC) is closely related to the reliability of power supply systems. In light of the development of digital technologies and robotisation in agriculture, as well as universal digitalisation, all rural consumers need quality power supply and delivery.The purpose of this article is to study the topical issues of the development of power supply in the agro-industrial complex. Methodology. Analysis and synthesis were used as the main research methods. The object of the study is electricity supply. The subject of the study was the development of electricity supply in the agro-industrial complex. Results.The reduction in the number of rural population and the changing structure of consumers in rural areas create problems for electric grid companies serving rural electricity supply, as they face a decrease in income and an increase in network maintenance costs. As a result, the cost of electricity for rural consumers is increasing. In this regard, there is a need to develop new solutions to reduce costs and apply new methods and means of electricity supply for rural consumers. The connection of microgeneration, including on the basis of renewable energy sources, to rural electric networks requires research for optimal confguration of electric networks and the development of operating modes for small-scale networks. The use of mobile energy platforms in agricultural infrastructure is also relevant. Conclusion. In the course of work, it was revealed that the introduction of new technologies in the agroindustrial complex requires the development of necessary regulatory legal acts.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers of these critical products were unable to keep up with the growing demands as the situation evolved. Most face shields, a common type of PPE, include a headband component to provide the appropriate fit for the user and curvature for the clear face shield attachment. To mitigate this shortage in the local region, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNSY) generated a computer-aided design (CAD) file for the headband component and asked the University of New Hampshire (UNH) to manufacture it with all available 3D printers, including printers housed off-campus. Despite using the same part file, the headbands exhibited inconsistencies, particularly in part quality and performance. These variations in manufactured products can be attributed to the different machines, locations, materials, printing parameters, and personnel utilized in their production. This disparity in part quality resulted in the scrapping of approximately 5% of the 2000+ headbands printed at UNH, an unacceptable manufacturing metric. To address quality concerns, the 3D printer operators manually altered the original part file’s cross-sectional area in CAD software through a trial-and-error approach until the printed parts from each printer met the quality specification. This process of manual adjustment hindered the fast setup times and low costs attributed to distributed manufacturing resulted in essential PPE being scrapped.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Ideally, using smart manufacturing, the part file geometry could be updated automatically, without further user inputs, based on the material properties used in the 3D printing. This could be accomplished by the implementation of an analytical model into a script for the CAD software that would calculate and update the part dimensions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, a case study to support distributed additive manufacturing for a simplified PPE headband during a global supply chain crisis, e.g., pandemic, is presented. Headbands were printed using four different material filaments and the original part file from PNSY to collect preliminary data. A finite element model was created to predict the force-displacement curves exhibited by headband parts produced using the different materials. An analytical model was derived to determine the geometry modifications required to achieve the desired part quality, i.e., force-displacement curve. Experimental validation was conducted and revealed good agreement with the analytical model predictions. In future work, these updates to the part geometry will be completed autonomously, using cyber manufacturing, by implementing the analytical model into CAD software via a script. This analytical model allows for distributed manufacturing to get past the hindrances of 3D printing manufacturing variances, advancing towards Industry 4.0.</jats:p>",

AI affects several activities in the Initiation phase of the innovation process, supporting the SCF provider’s commercial activities and contributing to assessing the buyer’s creditworthiness, detecting fraud, or proposing the right SCF solution. In the Implementation phase, AI supports assessing the supplier’s credit rating, categorizing and onboarding suppliers, and fastening the administrative tasks. Formulating 9 propositions, this study supports the theory related to the SCF by providing empirical evidence about the role of AI in the SCF innovation process and also identifying the resulting benefits and challenges for all the actors involved.</jats:p>",

This issue could be analyzed regarding the collaboration that exists between the involved parties, particularly in the negotiation process. The present study aims to develop an optimization model of the negotiation process between supplier (farmers) and collector (buyer) in gambier supply chain. In a decentralized supply chain setting, the linear programming is applied to develop the optimization planning model for both players. Optimized models were built to align the order level of buyers and the supply quantity of suppliers. The proposed negotiation process is applied iteratively to align the order and supply quantity. The developed models have been verified through computational testing using both real and estimated data. Practical implication of the research results can assist the related actors in the gambier supply chain.</jats:p>",

The present study aimed to perform a comparative analysis of conventional water treatment and UF. The treatment methods were compared considering the quality of the treated water and the cost of implementing a water treatment plant (WTP) and operating the systems, with a risk assessment of the influence of the deterioration of water quality on costs. Data were obtained from the operations of a conventional WTP in the municipality of Lages, Brazil, and a pilot plant employing UF. In the conventional and UF systems, treated water had turbidity of 1.90 and 0.19 NTU, an apparent color of 2.12 and 0.28 mg L−1 Pt/Co, and pH of 6.94 and 7.04, respectively. Average total cost (ATC) was $0.0496/m3 in the conventional system and $0.0596/m3 in the UF system. Chemical inputs and sludge treatment were the main variables that affected the ATC in conventional treatment, whereas energy and plant costs were the main components affecting the ATC in the UF system. A 30% reduction in water quality increased the ATC by 2.6% for the conventional and 1.5% for the UF system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global demand for organic produce has surged, with notable growth among Thai consumers. However, within Thailand's organic agricultural sectors, supply chain obscurity has impeded the understanding and resolution of emerging challenges associated with meeting this rising demand. Public interest has traditionally centered on mainstream economic sectors, resulting in inadequate attention to the sustainable organic farming supply chains. This study aims to explore the complexities of current sustainable organic supply chain configurations in Thailand, addressing gaps that lead to suboptimal planning and non-sustainable practices. Utilizing the Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) framework, this research collected data from key stakeholders through in-depth interviews. Participants included representatives from each stage of the supply chain, providing comprehensive insights into the operational dynamics. The analysis identified several critical challenges within the supply chain, including insufficient collaborative planning, reduced productivity, inaccurate demand forecasting, ineffective budgetary planning, and inadequate cold chain management. These challenges highlight the fragmented nature of the current supply chain and the need for strategic improvements. To address these shortcomings, the study suggests integrating technological advancements in demand planning, operations, and budgeting, fostering collaboration among supply chain members, and forming strategic partnerships with cold chain management service providers. These recommendations aim to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of Thailand's organic produce supply chain, ensuring it can meet increasing global and domestic demands effectively.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, the Chinese government should shift from using standard passive investments to high-quality active investments for its social guarantees, such as education. Based on panel data of 274 cities from 2010 to 2019, this study conducted the first examination of the impact of tax structure and government debt on the relative power of the local education supply (LES) in China. The study found that, first, in general, increases in the tax structure—represented by the proportion of personal income tax to budgetary revenue strengthen the relative power of LES, which is more sensitive in the southern region with a more developed market economy system. And the impact of government debt—represented by the urban investment debt ratio on the relative power of LES is initially negative and then positive. Second, the study revealed that the tax structure can stimulate the relative power of LES through the intermediary channel of an increase in the urban consumption rate; however, the mechanism of promoting the relative power of LES by encouraging localities to attract more floating populations is not obvious. Third, excessive investment in local governance adjusts the positive effect of local debt on the relative power of LES. Therefore, the government should pay attention to the promotion of personal income tax status, standardize their debt risk management, improve the efficiency of governance, and emphasize the pull of urban consumption, so as to enhance the ability to support livelihood and fully mobilize initiatives for local education development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agrotechnical science, advanced domestic and foreign practice have proven that the increase in the yield of basic agricultural sciences from fertilizers is directly dependent on the unevenness of their application. In other words, a 1 % decrease in the unevenness of fertilizer application gives a 1 % increase in yield, and vice versa. Application of fertilizers by machines with centrifugal working bodies is allowed at a wind speed of no more than 4 m/s. High-quality application of fertilizers with justified doses has a positive effect on increasing the yield, improving its quality indicators (the sugar content of sugar beets increases; the brewing properties of barley, gluten in wheat and starchiness of potatoes increase). A three-tier centrifugal working body was developed, which consists of a lower disk bolted to the flange. On the basis of the calculations, the task was set: feed the fertilizers to the disks in such a way that the angle of the spreading sector at the lower disk was equal to 120—158 and was located symmetrically relative to the axis of the machine; Fertilizer supply to the upper disk should be carried out in such a way as to obtain two sectors of spreading, located respectively to the left and to the right of the sector formed by the lower disk. The angle of each sector from the upper disk should be equal to 60—75°.\r\nThe supply of fertilizers in the experimental installation was carried out through the grease pipe to the lower disc. Catchers in the amount of 16 pieces were placed around the disk, each of them covered a sector of 15 degrees.\r\nThe experiments that were carried out with two-tier centrifugal working bodies, which have a double supply of fertilizers, allow us to draw the following conclusions:\r\n\r\nThe two-tier centrifugal disk is simple in design;\r\nThis working body improves the uniformity of fertilizer placement along the width of the grip;\r\nDue to the improved distribution, the effective width of capture is close in value to the total width of capture;\r\n\r\n4. By feeding to the upper disk, you can scatter fertilizers to one or both sides of the line of movement of the spreader, which is convenient when working in the garden and when processing the border strips of the field.</jats:p>"

In addition to the commonly used flood cooling, high-pressure cutting fluid supply offers great potential for further increasing tool life and process reliability. Although the positive effect of high-pressure cooling has been confirmed in a large number of studies, the relevant cutting fluid setting parameters such as nozzle cross-section area and supply pressure, and their influence on the process results have so far been insufficiently investigated. Against this background, a prototype tool holder was designed and additively manufactured in this work. The tool holder allows to vary the nozzle cross-section area without changing the cooling channels and the inclination of the nozzles. Experimental results revealed the optimal cross-section area of the rake face nozzle for the investigated process. It was also shown that although flank face cooling is necessary for the turning process, improper setting of the flank face nozzles can lead to a reduction in tool life.</jats:p>",

Social capital is categorized into three categories: structural capital, relational capital, and cognitive capital. The authors seek to understand which of the three dimensions of social capital influences environmental performance within the meat supply chain. The study was based on data collected using surveys from 85 abattoirs and 164 traders from four counties in Kenya: Nairobi, Kiambu, Machakos, and Kajiado. Statistical analysis was conducted using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The results also indicated a positive and significant relationship between structural social capital and environmental performance, while relational and cognitive capital had positive but insignificant relationships. The findings highlighted the disparities in the effect of social capital on environmental performance between formal and informal agri-food supply chains. To our knowledge, this finding presents a distinct contribution to social capital and environmental performance studies in informal buyer-supplier relationships in agri-foods. The study is one of the first to examine social capital and environmental performance in an informal agri-food supply chain with a focus on trader-abattoir relationships. The informal supply chain is an important context in which to examine the effects of social capital.</jats:p>",

The functionalities of blockchain technologies are compared with the traditional approach to supply chain management to emphasize the impact they can have on managing intra-supply chain relationships and the organizational structure of companies involved in supply channels. Design/methodology/approach: To conduct this study, a conceptual study was carried out, starting from an analysis of the main characteristics of blockchain technologies, to build an AS-IS scenario compared with the TO-BE scenario resulting from the implementation of these technologies within supply chains. To conduct this study, conceptual categories of the viable system approach and process management perspective were utilized. The conceptual analysis was performed using a matrix representation, which correlates material, informational, and financial flows with the dimensions of traceability, transparency, and efficiency, before and after the implementation of blockchains in managing supply chain transactions. Findings: The study highlighted how the principles underlying blockchain can lead to overcoming the traditional indispensable search for trust among supply chain operators. Therefore, through these results, it is possible to hypothesize an improvement in the resilience conditions of companies operating in block–supply chains. Originality/value: This study contributes to investigating the relationship between blockchain and operational consonance among operators in managing interorganizational processes to improve conditions of efficiency, traceability, and transparency, which are functional in the resilience of companies involved in the supply chain compared to the changing dynamics of the context. Research implications: Trustless logic in the implementation of blockchain technologies leads to the configuration of a new concept of trust, connected to the entire supply chain system, as a result of the improvement in the security, visibility, and efficiency conditions of transactions. The increased visibility and transparency developed in block–supply chains prompt all actors involved in the supply chains to rethink information management, given the reduction in informational asymmetries and, thus, the optimization of transaction costs.</jats:p>"

The origin of minerals is assessed by a saturation index approach and the Gibbs diagram. Also, mineral correlation process and ion exchange mechanism are detected by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The PCA results indicate that the groundwater quality in the Ain Larbi study area primarily results from weathering and geochemical alteration of rock. The saturation index and Gibbs diagram support these findings. The WA-WQI was calculated for each station based on physicochemical parameters. During the wet season, three out of five classes of WQI were observed in the present study, including excellent (25%), good (70%), and poor (5%). In the dry season, the classes excellent (25%), good (30%), and poor (45%) were represented. The present situation demonstrates how hydrogeological regimes and water–rock interactions affect groundwater ion concentrations. Our results contribute to identifying drinking water requirements in the Ain Larbi region, promoting sustainable water management.</jats:p>",

The findings indicate that, as supply chain risks intensify, firms are inclined to opt for geographically closer suppliers. Heterogeneity studies suggest that the effect of supply chain risks on the selection of geographically proximate suppliers is more pronounced within firms characterised by intense competition, low supplier concentration, low switching costs and in non‐state‐owned enterprises. Further analysis identifies that the supply chain risks, which drive strategies for firms to utilise a geographically proximate supplier distribution, stem from various sources. Each of these sources varies in its impact on a firm's strategies. Tests of economic consequences reveal that, in scenarios of heightened supply chain risks, firms' strategic geographic adjustments in supplier selection can favourably impact their supply chain management efficiency and operational risk.</jats:p>",

The stem thickness of this vegetation affects its resistance to flow and subsequently influences flow characteristics. To explore the impact of stem thickness on river flow in curved channels, we developed a Reynolds stress model based on real river flow conditions and vegetation data. The flow characteristics were analyzed in terms of flow velocity, Reynolds stress and turbulence intensity by varying the stem thickness of the vegetation in the vegetated area. The results of the study reveal that: (1) Water velocity in the vegetated area is significantly reduced compared to the non-vegetated area, with a greater reduction observed for thicker stems. Increasing the vegetation diameter by 3 mm resulted in a velocity decrease of 2.31–26.55%. (2) Thicker vegetation stems lead to more intense energy exchange in water flow. A 3 mm increase in vegetation diameter increased Reynolds stress by 91.81–139.70%. (3) Turbulent kinetic energy in the vegetated area is significantly higher than in the non-vegetated area, with greater turbulence intensity observed for thicker vegetation stems. Increasing the vegetation diameter by 3 mm resulted in a turbulent kinetic energy increase of 115.19–218.55%.</jats:p>",

Challenges include intense competition, logistical and transportation complexities requiring robust infrastructure like warehouses and efficient supply chain management, as well as operational inefficiencies and distribution costs. To address these issues, a model is applied to make strategic decisions, such as determining the necessary number of facilities to minimize total supply chain network operational costs and infrastructure for retail distribution. The outcome is a model that introduces a novel approach to enhancing supply chain efficiency and effectiveness from production to distribution stages, thereby reducing system costs, including ordering costs and inventory handling. Costs and loss costs resulting from remaining products produced can be minimized by considering networks, multiple suppliers, multiple warehouses, Distribution Centers (DC), multiple retailers, and multiple products, factoring in the distances between facilities in the network. Subsequently, comprehensive testing of inspection, distribution, and retail parameters is conducted, with a focus on specific periods and product types. When applying this model, certain characteristics need to be considered regarding the importance of selecting efficient suppliers of goods, such as procurement, performance improvement, and the number of supply chains and supply chain systems. This research introduces novelty in production methods that can lead to increased customer satisfaction, sales, market share, profit margins, more effective brand advertising, and revenue streams. In this process, the research undergoes a training, testing, and validation process in forming a strategic multi-retail distribution network model, spanning a total of 52 epochs.

The object of study is a mobile wind turbine with a vertical axis of rotation. Theoretical studies have identified key factors influencing turbine modes and performance, which has led to the selection of optimal placement options. The proposed system took into account the power supply needs of troops in the field, with special attention to the energy-consuming equipment of field military shooting ranges as the main consumers. A comparative analysis has established the superiority of a mobile wind turbine with a vertical axis over traditional wind generators with a horizontal axis. The developed turbine design provides full coverage of the airflow regardless of direction, with an optimal blade angle of 60°. Theoretical studies included studying the airflow around the blade at different angles of attack, which provides insight into drag and lift. The basis for the development was the designed model of a mobile wind turbine, protected by a patent, characterized by mobility, sectionality and the ability to adapt to various environmental conditions. Its simple and compact design, combined with a vertical axis of rotation, ensures an uninterrupted power supply, especially at remote military installations and border areas. This research led to the development of a model for calculating the parameters of a mobile wind turbine suitable for powering troops in the field. The study demonstrates the potential of mobile wind power plants to significantly enhance energy reliability at military shooting ranges.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oilseeds are one of the most important determinants of India’s agricultural economy, next only to cereals and pulses. The self-sufficiently in oilseed obtained during the early 1990s could not be sustained sufficiently. Despite, being the fourth largest oilseed crop-producing nation in the world, India is also one of the largest importers of vegetable oils. This study appraises the relationship between price and non-price factors to understand the behaviour of major oilseeds (mustard/rapeseed and groundnut) cultivated in India from 1997-98 to 2019-2020. Supply response is the responsiveness of supply, which can be identified using production response to different determining factors. Mustard/rapeseed and groundnut are the oilseeds that are mainly produced in India. This study specifically attempted to quantify the relationship between oilseed production and different factors, such as annual rainfall, annual temperature, yield, and revenue difference for both crops. The findings suggested that yield and revenue difference of mustard with wheat are the most determining factors for mustard production, whereas annual rainfall, the temperature during the growing season, and revenue difference between groundnut with rice and soyabean are the most significant determinants of groundnut’s production response. Crop equivalent productivity further validated that groundnut competed and outperformed the two promising crops (soybean and paddy). The trend analysis (1997-98 to 2019-2020) also indicated that wheat was the dominant crop over mustard from 1997-98 to 2013-14. Afterwards, i.e., from 2014-15 to 2019-20, mustard surpassed wheat productivity (on equivalent terms) and outperformed cereal.\n </jats:p>"

Amidst these sociopolitical factors, the global trade landscape is undergoing a seismic shift. This paper examines the complex web of these sociopolitical aspects, their impact on SCM strategies, and their implications for GSCs. The systematic literature review approach is used for this research, which entails the following steps: selecting and assessing pertinent sources, summarizing and synthesizing the literature, examining challenges and opportunities, articulating conclusions, and pinpointing prospective directions for future research. The findings of this study reveal that these sociopolitical factors have significant impacts on multiple facets of SCM, such as sourcing strategies, supplier relationships, risk management, and overall supply chain resilience. In addition, the study presents a roadmap for businesses to effectively navigate these difficulties, which involves diversifying supply chain networks, integrating corporate sustainability strategies, and implementing environmental, social, and governance factors into business operations. The originality of this research lies in its integrated and holistic approach to the integration of sociopolitical factors into SCM theory and practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A large body of literature underscores the impact of contract management on supply chain performance from diverse contexts. Although the concept of contract cost management and supply chain performance has extensively been researched from the Kenyan context, most of the studies have zeroed in on manufacturing supply chains. Therefore, the study seeks to establish the relationship between contract cost management and supply chain performance of county referral hospitals in Kenya. The study is anchored on transactional cost economies theory. The study employed a descriptive research design and mainly concentrated on the forty-seven county referral hospitals in Kenya. In order to meet the research objective, the respondents were chosen based on the sample frame. The heads of department in each of these departments: procurement, finance, and stores were employed as a unit of observation across the referral hospitals. The pilot study targeted 10 respondents which is 10% of the final study sample size of who were randomly selected in each of the firms. The primary data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire that had both open and closed ended questions, designed to obtain definite responses. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 28) was used to analyze the data and present the variables through coding and summarizing the responses of all the respondents and the analyzed data was presented in form of tables. The Cronbach’s Alpha value was greater than 0.7 which indicated that the questionnaire met the minimum acceptable threshold. The study findings showed that contract cost management significantly influence the supply chain performance of county referral hospitals in Kenya. The study concluded that performance was predicted to improve for every unit increase in these practices. The study further recommends that county referral hospitals should implement electronic document management systems for contract documentation, streamlining processes, and improving overall efficiency. Some recommendations included through choosing right software, systems configuration, document importation, user training, and need identification.  </jats:p>"

This study aimed to use bibliometric analysis to map the SCM knowledge domain within MiC. Through the use of keywords related to “supply chain” and “MiC”, 196 relevant papers were extracted from the Web of Science database. These papers were subjected to co-citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and time span analysis to elucidate the historical evolution, multidisciplinary domains, and future directions in planning and control within SCM-MiC. The research identified two milestones in SCM-MiC’s historical trajectory, enhancing our understanding of its foundations. Moreover, 11 clusters were identified, illustrating the multidisciplinary nature of SCM-MiC. Dividing the literature into seven stages of the supply chain, the research outlined four research directions aligned with project complexity and technological development, highlighting current hotspots and gaps of the strategic planning and control. These directions bridge the construction management and information technology domains, guiding future SCM-MiC research within complex project management.</jats:p>"

This study constructs a network model to measure the vulnerability and identify key influencing factors in the LED lighting industry supply chain based on the entropy-CRITIC–ISM method. By reviewing literature and using expert interviews, an indicator system for measuring the vulnerability of the LED lighting industry supply chain was constructed. The relative weights of each evaluation indicator were determined using the entropy-CRITIC method, identifying the main factors influencing supply chain vulnerability. Based on the ISM model, the structure of the vulnerability of the LED lighting industry supply chain is revealed and presented in a hierarchical-directed topological graph. The results indicate that the ratio of key equipment suppliers from overseas, the spatial aggregation degree of the supply chain, the growth rate of LED lighting industry manufacturers, and the international market share of LED lighting industry products are deep-seated factors influencing the vulnerability of the LED lighting industry supply chain. The conclusions provide a quantitative method for objectively understanding the vulnerability of the LED lighting industry supply chain and offer specific policy references for filling the gaps and strengthening the industrial basic capabilities of the LED lighting industry</jats:p>",

Heating the water is considered the major preventive measure against Legionella contamination. Our study aimed to understand better the relationships between hot water temperatures and Legionella spp. occurrence within such systems. We utilized routine monitoring data from public and apartment buildings, comprising 292,937 data sets. We employed the analysis of variance, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and relative probability of occurrence to quantitatively assess statistical relationships. In the case of supply flow (SF) and return flow (RF), i.e. near the water heater, water temperature strongly regulates Legionella spp. growth. Below calculated tipping points (SF: 56 °C, RF: 53 °C), the relative probability of Legionella spp. occurrence is 18.7 and 7.5 times higher, respectively. For peripheral samples, the relationship between temperature and Legionella spp. occurrence is less pronounced. Additionally, statistical relationships between central and peripheral temperatures, as well as between central temperatures and peripheral Legionella spp. concentrations within one system, were weak or zero, respectively. Thus, the central temperature regime of hot water systems alone is insufficient to control the occurrence of Legionella spp. in the periphery.</jats:p>",

However, they generate waste that is harmful to public health and the environment. As a result, the management of this healthcare waste is becoming increasingly important in the field of public health and the environment. One of the most problematic places is, poor management of these issues that can put healthcare workers, medical waste workers, patients and their families, and the entire population at risk. On the other hand, poor treatment or inadequate disposal of this waste can also cause risks. From now on, the rational elimination of this pollution is one of the essential conditions for respecting hygiene rules, not only inside establishments, but also in the general environment. In this unfavorable context, we are trying through this contribution to achieve adequate management using reverse logistics practices with the main objective of resolving healthcare waste management problems while taking into account the reality of things in situ. For this purpose, an approach guided by data, carried out directly in the field, by direct contact with the different categories of health personnel interviewed, through findings, observations, audits, questionnaire and knowledge of the causes was used. This approach is based on the audit of compliance with the supply chain in the management of hospital waste in the different departments of the Constantine University Hospital (Algeria). As a result of the research it is shown that the situation is very poor given that the logistics chain is completely faulty or no step is respected. Thus, the least respected stage is storage, where no service exceeds 25 %, this is due to the fact that no clinic has an intermediate waste storage area. And the most respected is treatment stage that does not exceed 75 %. This allowed to detect the inadequacies recorded at the level of the study establishment, and even improvements are suggested for sustainable management of healthcare waste at the level of Algerian health establishments.</jats:p>"

This method first adopts the scenario analysis method to analyze the photovoltaic uncertainty, introduces the micro-phasor measurement units (µPMU) with real-time, synchronization, accuracy, and comprehensive measurement data, and builds the fault data set through the scenario of each fault type occurring in each node of the smart distribution network. By constructing the load loss risk index of the autonomous operation domain under the photovoltaic scenario and the seamless switching ability index under the fault state, the autonomous operation domain evaluation and screening method based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is proposed. Combined with the evaluation index system, the autonomous operation domain scenario under the fault state is evaluated.

However, in the process of circulating green agricultural products, the output and demand are uncertain, and the cooperation of various entities in the supply chain is unstable, which leads to the risk of interruptions to the supply chain, and then leads to ineffective supply chain operations for green agricultural products. Therefore, under the background of double uncertainty of output and demand, combined with CVaR theory and considering the risk avoidance degree of farmers, a Stackelberg game model of a “firm + farmer” two-level green agricultural product supply chain was constructed, and the supply coordination mechanism was studied. The results show that a benefit-sharing contract can effectively coordinate the supply chain of green agricultural products under the double uncertainty of output and demand and obtain optimal greenness, agricultural input, order quantity, and optimal inventory factors under centralized decision making. The optimal production decisions of farmers and the optimal pricing decisions of companies are obtained under decentralized decision making. The benefit-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain, and the overall incomes of farmers, companies, and the supply chain improved after the coordination. The research results can enrich the relevant research on coordinating green agricultural products supply chains under the uncertainty of output and demand and provide a reference for ensuring the effective and stable operation of supply chains.</jats:p>"

This field has garnered significant attention due to its potential to reshape decision-making processes within supply chains. At the same time, the practical side of supply chain operations remains intensely competitive in today’s business landscape. Furthermore, the current academic research aims to outline effective strategies for achieving sustainability across supply chains, particularly in the manufacturing sector. In response to these challenges, this research has conducted an integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach to evaluate sustainable supply chain performance from the triple bottom line perspective, including financial, environmental, and social performance.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The initial stage involves selecting the crucial criteria (short-term and long-term) and alternatives for sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) from experts and conducting an in-depth literature review. Initially, there were 17 criteria, but after a pilot test with co-authors and online discussions with experts, the number of criteria was subsequently reduced to 9. In the second phase, the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was applied to rank and prioritize the criteria. The third and final stage examined the causal relationship between the identified criteria, utilizing the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Based on BWM analysis results, the top three criteria in terms of prominence are: (1) return on investment (ROI), (2) product quality, and (3) manufacturing lead time. Out of the three alternatives, financial performance (FP) is the most crucial dimension for SSCP, followed by environmental performance (ENP) and social performance (SP). On the other hand, the DEMATEL approach showed that work health and safety (short-term criterion), asset utilization (long-term criterion), energy consumption (long-term criterion), waste disposal (long-term criterion), manufacturing lead time (short-term criterion), and on-time delivery (short-term criterion) are categorized within the cause group, while criteria such as return on investment (ROI) (long-term criterion), customer-service level (short-term criterion), and product quality (long-term criterion) fall into the effect group.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed study has certain drawbacks that pave the way for future research directions. First, it is worth noting the need for a larger sample size to ensure the reliability of results, the potential inclusion of additional criteria to enhance the assessment of sustainability performance, and the consideration of a qualitative approach to gain deeper insights into the outcomes. In addition, fuzziness in qualitative subjective perception could be imperative when collecting data to ensure its reliability, as translating experts’ perceptions into exact numerical values can be challenging because human perceptions often carry elements of uncertainty or vagueness. Therefore, fuzzy integrated MCDM frameworks are better suited for future research to handle the uncertainties involved in human perceptions, making it a more appropriate approach for decision-making in scenarios where traditional MCDM methods may prove insufficient.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed framework will enable decision-makers to gain deeper insights into how various decision criteria impact SSCP, thus providing a comprehensive evaluation of SSCP that considers multiple dimensions, such as financial, environmental, and social performance within the manufacturing sector.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed study is the first empirical study to integrate both BWM and DEMATEL approaches to evaluate sustainable supply chain performance in the manufacturing context.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The obtained results include: analysis of existing industrial flow meters that could be used in development; proposed structural and functional diagrams of the device; experimental investigations into the accuracy of the developed device. Based on the analysis of parameters of the most common flow meters for development, the Bronkhorst F-201CV-100-AAD-22-V regulator was selected. Based on the selected regulator, a device was developed with a 32-bit ARM architecture. This architecture provides for the use of floating-point calculations, easy reprogramming of the device, and fast indication of values displayed on the indicator. The device features galvanic isolation between the control bus and the UART port of the microcontroller. The device allows for regulation, measurement, and indication of the flow rate of working gas into the anode block and hollow cathode during testing of Hall thrusters. Using the device allows for recommendations regarding the design of onboard systems for supplying working fluid to electric rocket propulsion systems. Based on the presented development and conducted research, laboratory prototypes of the devices were manufactured. The measurement error throughout the entire range of working gas flow rates does not exceed 0.7%. The overall error of the stand control and measurement system for working gas flow rates is up to 3%.

The findings demonstrate that SCMPs have a major favorable impact on competitive advantage (CA). In particular, information quality (IQ), customer relationship management (CRM), and strategic supplier partnerships (SSP) all significantly improve competitive advantage (CA), information sharing (ISh) not significantly on competitive advantage (CA). Furthermore, investigates the association between SCMPs and CA in Pakistani manufacturing enterprises, as well as the moderating effect of big data analytics (BDA). The findings validate H1, H2, and H3 and demonstrate the beneficial effects of Supplier Strategic Partnership (SSP), customer relationship management (CRM), and information quality (IQ) on competitive advantage (CA). This study is to look at how big data analytics (BDA) may be able to moderate the relationship between supply chain management practices (SCMPs) and competitive advantage (CA) in Pakistani manufacturing companies. The findings demonstrate that SCMPs significantly improve CA. Information quality (IQ), customer relationship management (CRM), and strategic supplier partnerships (SSP) in particular significantly improve competitive advantage (CA). Information sharing (ISh), on the other hand, had no effect on competitive advantage (CA).  Some flaw in the way the firms under investigation handle big data analytics (BDA). It emphasizes that for big data analytics (BDA) systems to produce the intended outcomes, managers must integrate them with other business systems and capabilities.</jats:p>"

Australia has identified six priority offshore wind areas, with two officially announced, three in the proposal stage, and one under assessment. Establishing a reliable and resilient supply chain is paramount to developing Australia’s offshore wind farms. This paper focuses on offshore wind development in Tasmania, an island State of Australia. The purpose of the paper is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the offshore wind supply chain. Key variables integrated into the evaluation model encompass the offshore wind targets, the installed power capacity of individual turbines, international supply chain constraints, port capacity, vessel availability, and workforce considerations. This paper firstly assesses the demand for components of Tasmanian offshore wind projects based on the baseline and ambitious targets. Subsequently, it examines the corresponding demands and requirements for ports, vessels, and workforce. The paper also discusses the supply chain for Tasmanian offshore wind farm development and concludes with the opportunities and challenges for the future development of Tasmania’s offshore wind industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At the current stage of transformational transformations, the problems of transformation of the national economy are extremely relevant. And these questions are especially relevant in the conditions of rapid development of the digital economy. According to estimates by Forbes experts, 67% of the leaders of companies from the Global 2000 list chose digital transformation as a priority goal of their corporate strategy in 2018. According to a study by analysts International Data Corporation, the total global spending on digital technologies will grow by 16.8% annually and amounted to 2.1 trillion dollars in 2019. Research by Huawei and Oxford Economics has shown that intelligent network interaction will trigger the growth of the digital economy, which will reach 23 trillion dollars by 2025. This increase will be 78.3% compared to 2017 (12.9 trillion dollars). By 2025, the share of the digital economy is planned to increase by 7.2 percentage points, or from 17.1 to 24.3% of global GDP. According to the calculations of The Boston Consulting Group experts, the volume of the digital economy by 2035 will amount to 16 trillion dollars USA. In view of this, the purpose of this study is to determine the trends and key directions of digital transformation research in the era of Industry 5.0 based on bibliometric analysis using the VOSviewer software. The article carries out a bibliometric analysis of the relationship between the terms “digital transformation”, “digitalization”,”Industry 4.0”, “Industry 5.0”. It has been established that currently the problems of the digital transformation of the economy in the context of the implementation of the digital strategy of the European Union are gaining special relevance. Digital transformation is a key component of the overall strategy to transform the global economy. Correctly selected digital technologies combined with employee competencies, processes and operations will allow companies to quickly adapt to crisis situations, use promising opportunities to modernize work processes, meet new and constantly changing customer needs, stimulate growth and implement innovative and management solutions. The concept of digital transformation of the national economy in the context of Industry 5.0 should involve the use of digital tools and platforms to transform traditional business processes, improve interaction with customers, introduce innovative technologies and form a digital ecosystem. The main components of the digital transformation of critical infrastructure include: digital technologies (cloud computing, artificial intelligence, big data analytics and the Internet of Things (IoT); organizational changes (restructuring of processes to increase their flexibility, introduction of new methodologies (DevOps, Agile), formation of a digital culture); customer orientation and integration of digital channels. For effective digital transformation of the economy on a practical level, it is advisable to pay attention to such main aspects as: having a clear vision and strategy that meets business goals; involving different groups of stakeholders and ensuring the interest of the entire organization; constant monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of digital transformation initiatives; an adaptive and iterative approach that allows you to navigate the changing digital landscape. It has been proven that the priority direction of research in the future should be the substantiation of the theoretical and methodological provisions of the formation of the digital ecosystem.</jats:p>"

These findings reveal significant long-term relationships between the variables studied. In the long run, inflation in Indonesia is largely determined by corruption, interest rates, and the money supply. Apart from that, this significant influence is also found in short-term estimation results with different relationships. A decrease in CPI (high corruption) increases the inflation rate significantly, and vice versa. This demonstrates how crucial it is to set up strategies and policies to keep the inflation rate stable for a sustainable economy that doesn't just rely on financial tools but also lessens the likelihood of government-caused corruption and sources of income.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Relevance. Today oil production by installations of electric centrifugal pumps is one of the leading methods of mechanized oil production. The mechanized operation of hard-to-recover oil objects is complicated by the high viscosity of reservoir oil, the formation of wax-deposits in the wellbore. This leads to an increase in hydraulic resistances due to a decrease in the flow section of pipes and other pumping equipment components, a decrease in the productivity of wells and the efficiency of pumping production. In this regard, an urgent task is to develop and improve methods and devices for preventing deposits of wax-deposits in wells. Object. Downhole pumping unit for dosing reagent (inhibitor of wax-deposits) into the well, which is a combination of two technical devices – a pump dosing the reagent and a jet pump. Aim. To analyze the influence of the design parameters of the dosing unit on the efficiency of its operation (reagent consumption, liquid cavitation coefficient in the jet pump). Methods. Mathematical modeling of the operation of a downhole dosing unit for the supply of reagent, based on the application of the laws of conservation of mass and quantity of motion, as well as Bernoulli's law for a moving flow in a jet pump. Results. Based on the simulation results, the nature of the influence of the design parameters of the developed installation on the reagent consumption is established. It is established that the maximum flow rate of the reagent is achieved with a mixing chamber diameter of about 22 mm; an increase in diameter relative to the specified value leads to a decrease in the degree of local pressure reduction, a decrease in the diameter of the mixing chamber – a drop in flow due to an increase in the flow rate in the chamber and an increase in hydraulic resistance. It was found that an increase in the supply of electric centrifugal pumps in the considered range of 100–200 m3 per day has practically no effect on the reagent consumption when the mixing chamber diameter is more than 30 mm. It was found that at confuser length values exceeding 210 mm, the cavitation coefficient, regardless of the mixing chamber diameter, exceeds one, which indicates a smooth and uniform pressure reduction in the device body. In general, it is shown that by regulating the design parameters of a downhole metering unit, it is possible to ensure the required reagent consumption at a known electric centrifugal pump supply (well flow rate).</jats:p>"

Due to the negative health effects linked with arsenic exposure, the quality of drinking water and rice samples must be continually monitored. This research was carried out in Baguio City, a small urban center in the Philippines. Following microwave digestion, arsenic in rice and water samples were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. The results showed that the National Food Authority (NFA) rice samples had arsenic content below the detection limit, indicating that this commercially available rice does not pose any health risk to Filipino consumers in terms of arsenic exposure. The arsenic value in other rice samples ranged from 8 μg/L to 27 μg/L, with the lowest and highest values found in organic brown rice and white rice varieties, respectively. Despite detectable arsenic in all 20 rice samples, all values were less than the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 150 μg/L. Despite higher arsenic content in mixed rice than in white and organic colored rice, the mean differences are not significant, as proven by the Kruskal Wallis Test. All drinking water samples bought from water refilling stations had no detectable arsenic, while eight of the 18 (44%) of the spring water samples showed detectable amounts but are far below MCL of arsenic in drinking water. The findings suggest that the amount of arsenic in rice and spring water samples are too low to pose health risks over a short period of time.</jats:p>",

Results show that organizational readiness and top management support significantly impact supply chain management performance and the success of accounting information systems in Pekanbaru, Indonesia. However, accounting information system success does not mediate the relationship between organizational readiness, top management support, and supply chain management performance. This indicates that other factors might serve as critical mediators. To improve supply chain management performance, MSMEs should enhance organizational readiness and secure top management support.

The objective of this research was to identify the regions with the greatest deficiencies in the distribution of water supply in the urban area of ​​the city of Santo Estevão and the consequences of this problem for the population. The field of study covered three neighborhoods in the city of Santo Estevão (Alto do Porrão, Mutirão, and Pau de Vela). GPS, Cartography, and Geographic Information Systems were used to demarcate points relating to the spatial distribution of water and create thematic maps. Data and information related to water supply were collected in institutions and public bodies, such as the City Hall of Santo Estevão, EMBASA, Superintendency of Statistics and Information, and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, in addition to the application of forms. It was found that some residents do not store water in water tanks correctly, which can cause the proliferation of disease vectors, such as the Aedes Aegypti mosquito.</jats:p>"

Thus, it examines the urban territory at macro-, meso- and micro scales; physical-spatial variables indicating risk levels and possible public spaces to implement the system; and socio-spatial variables regarding the population, risk perception and participation in management to strengthen urban resilience. Normative tools and the Geographic Information System are used to spatialize and systematize quantitative and qualitative information.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results and discussion:</jats:bold> The EWaSS is an alternative for safe water supply in a post-disaster situation that would provide immediate and autonomous operation during the first 72 h of the emergency.

This article is devoted to problematic issues related to the enterprise management system and the study of its features. It was determined that management is a purposeful and constant process of influence of the subject of management on the object of management, this process is aimed at changing the state of the object and / or subjects according to pre-thought-out and developed plans. Control functions and system functions are also considered. The main problems of management during the implementation of the process of adjusting the functioning of the enterprise, which are caused by objective and subjective reasons, are characterized. These include constant changes in the economic situation and the obvious aggravation of competition between business entities in the market of resources, the market of finished products and sales markets. The enterprise management system was studied. It is considered as a set of principles, techniques and mechanisms for processing and passing information, making management decisions, organizing planning, motivating, stimulating and controlling activities. It was determined that the enterprise management system is a management structure, as well as all possible external and internal relationships between its structural elements and their dynamic interaction, which enables the system to adapt to the changing conditions of the external environment and be flexible. It is considered that the purpose of the management system is the formation of the managed work of the enterprise through the creation and implementation of a set of management influences for the successful functioning of the management object in the changing conditions of the external environment. It was determined that the important characteristics of the management system are its structure, size and complexity. The management structure is an ordered set of permanently interconnected elements that ensure the functioning and development of the organization as a whole. It is noted that the management process is implemented through the main functions: planning, organization, motivation and control.</jats:p>"

The main objective of this study is to assess the extent to which environmental, social, and governance practices influence supply chain performance. To measure supply chain performance, the authors consider various indicators, including supply chain management score, monitoring score, and partnership termination scores. These metrics allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of supply chain processes over our sample period of ten years. To analyze the relationships between ESG scores and supply chain performance, the authors use partial least square (PLS) regression modeling.</jats:p>",

Thus, industrial SCs must be resilient and sustainable to swiftly respond to disturbances, decrease vulnerability to potential weaknesses, and mitigate the effects of adverse disruptions such as COVID-19. The aim of this research is to understand the interdependencies among the factors facilitating the development of a resilient and sustainable supply chain within the context of the Indian automotive industry in the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study proposes an integrated framework to recognize and analyze the enablers of supply chain resilience (SCR) in a typical automobile sector while maintaining sustainability. To this end, a detailed literature search was conducted to identify a complete set of enablers while ensuring the sustainability of SCs. Total interpretive structural modeling (TISM) and fuzzy cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (fuzzy MICMAC) methodologies are integrated to analyze the identified enablers. The fuzzy MICMAC model is used to evaluate the interrelationships between enablers of a resilient and sustainable SC based on their driving powers and dependencies. Trust and commitment among players and information sharing are the most influential drivers in establishing a more robust and sustainable SC in post-COVID-19 situations. The proposed paradigm highlights the major techniques that SC leaders should use to improve SCR performance and sustain SC operations during unexpected disruptions.</jats:p>"

Sampling after farmers was carried out using the snowball sampling method with a total of 69 respondents. The data used are primary data and secondary data. Descriptive analysis techniques are used to analyze the red chili supply chain. While the efficiency of the red chili supply chain is analyzed using supply chain efficiency indicators with the Performance Measurement System (PMS) approach which includes production costs, profit and return on investment. The results of this study indicate that the red chili supply chain in Sanden District is formed by three chains with 5 actors namely farmers, auction markets, collectors, retailers, and consumers. Chain 1 is the most efficient in terms of profit and return on investment (ROI). Chains 2 and 3 are the most efficient in terms of production cost indicators. These results can be used by actors to choose the supply chain that provides the highest profit.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nitrogen (N) management is a key component to maintaining high productivity of northern highbush blueberry (<jats:italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</jats:italic> L.) and nitrogen is often supplied by applying ammonium-based fertilizers. It can also be supplied through mineralization of soil organic matter (SOM), although the amount released by SOM is difficult to predict and not always considered in the development and implementation of N fertility programs. Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to estimate the timing and magnitude of net N mineralization from SOM throughout the growing season, identify soil properties that can be measured commercially and used to predict net N mineralization across a range of SOM, and determine whether N requirements for maximizing yield and fruit quality of blueberry vary across soils with different amounts of SOM. The laboratory experiment was conducted for 6 months using soil samples collected from 10 representative commercial blueberry fields in northwest Washington. The soils contained 2% to 42% soil organic carbon (SOC). The mean net N mineralization rates were fastest during the first 3 to 4 months of incubation, corresponding to the period during which N uptake reaches its maximum in blueberry. Results indicated that the soil total N may be a useful predictor of the N supply from SOM (6.34 ± 1.13 kg⋅ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> increase in net N mineralization with each 0.1% increase in total N), but there was substantial variability in the N supply that could not by explained by the total N (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001; r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.433). The field experiment was conducted from 2019 to 2021 and included four mature, regionally representative, commercial fields of ‘Duke’ blueberry. The fields contained 3% to 28% SOC and were each fertilized with low, medium (control), or high N rates, corresponding to 33 to 50, 67 to 84, or 102 to 118 kg⋅ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N per year, respectively. Although soil inorganic N levels suggested that N mineralization was substantial at sites with higher SOM, sites with lower SOM did not require more fertilizer N than those with higher SOM. Under the conditions of this experiment, even the lowest N rates were sufficient to sustain production for at least 3 years at each site. The findings of this study indicate that SOM may be an important contributor to N fertility in managed blueberry systems, and that yield and fruit quality can be maintained across various N fertilizer rates, including at rates &lt;50 kg⋅ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N. However, the long-term impacts of reducing N application rates remain unclear, and future research should monitor long-term changes in plant health and soil fertility associated with reduced N applications across diverse soils and production systems.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the optimization variables of the problem are transformed from three variables of offloading decision, energy harvesting time, and UAV location to two variables of offloading decision and UAV location by means of the derived closed expression, and then the transformed optimization problem is decomposed into the offloading decision optimization sub-problem and the UAV location optimization sub-problem to be solved alternately and iteratively. The genetic algorithm is employed to tackle the optimization sub-problem of offloading decisions, and the successive convex approximation algorithm is applied to the drone positioning optimization sub-problem.

Meanwhile, water resources are facing increasing pressure due to environmental pollution. In relation to SDG goal 6, which mandates the availability of clean water as a basic need for all, this research aims to develop a policy scenario for a sustainable clean water supply in Bengkulu City. The method used is an integration of interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and system dynamics (SD). The simulation shows that the average total water demand in 2030 under existing conditions reached 800,577 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/month (9.61 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year); under 50% service coverage conditions, it became 914,865 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/month (10.98 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year); and under 75% service coverage conditions there was an increase in total water demand to 1.32 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/month (15.88 million m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year). In addition, to fulfill water availability in 2030, the following policy scenarios were simulated: (i) business as usual scenario, a shortfall in water availability; (ii) pessimistic scenario, water availability can meet service coverage by 43%; (iii) moderate scenario, water availability can meet service coverage by 50%; and (iv) optimistic scenario, water availability can meet service coverage by 75%. Some policy directions for the sustainability of clean water supply in Bengkulu City are integrated water resources management with community involvement, additional clean water infrastructure, and reduced water loss through regular checking of water distribution pipes.</jats:p>",

This study aims to investigate, firstly, the proportion of Türkiye's faith heritage offerings within the broader realm of cultural tourism, and secondly, to delve into the specific utilization of faith heritage sites with varying characteristics within faith tourism through the tour catalogs of travel agencies in the case of Mersin which designated as the starting point of Turkey's faith tourism corridor. To achieve this objective, the content of tour catalogs from 29 Istanbul-based Group A travel agencies was meticulously analyzed. The findings reveal a rather low ratio of faith tours to cultural tours, standing at a mere 4.8%. Notably, the Southeastern Anatolia Region emerged as the area where religious heritage sites are most frequently incorporated into cultural tours. Furthermore, the study identified Christianity, Judaism, and Islam as the faiths whose heritage sites are most commonly featured in faith tours. Interestingly, it was observed that cultural heritage sites are extensively integrated into the itineraries of faith-based tours. Finally, the analysis disclosed a limited use of Mersin's religious heritage sites within the examined tour products.</jats:p>"

Methods: Supermarkets were audited with a seven-day high- (HED) and low-emulsifier diet (LED) meal plan developed. The emulsifier content of food was sought from food manufacturers, compared to acceptable daily intake (ADI), and doses were provided in trials. Nutritional composition analysis was completed. Healthy adults ate these diets for seven days in a randomized single-blinded cross-over feeding study to assess palatability, tolerability, satiety, food variety, dietary adherence, blinding and the ease of following the meal plan via visual analogue scale. Results: A database of 1680 foods was created. There was no difference in nutritional content between the HED and LED, except HED had a higher ultra-processed food content (p &lt; 0.001). The HED contained 41 emulsifiers, with 53% of the products able to be quantified for emulsifiers (2.8 g/d), which did not exceed the ADI, was similar to that in observational studies, and was exceeded by doses used in experimental studies. In ten participants, diets were rated similarly in palatability—HED mean 62 (5% CI 37–86) mm vs. LED 68 (54–82) mm—in tolerability—HED 41 (20–61) mm vs. LED 55 (37–73) mm—and in satiety HED 57 (32–81) mm vs. LED 49 (24–73) mm. The combined diets were easy to follow (82 (67–97) mm) with good variety (65 (47–81)) and excellent adherence. Conclusion: Nutritionally well-matched HED and LED were successfully developed, palatable and well tolerated.</jats:p>"

The development of Internet technology, while expanding financing channels, has also seen an increasing severity in issues such as information fraud and data breaches, which has further aggravated the trust crisis in supply chain finance. This paper integrates blockchain technology into the industrial internet platform and analyzes the applicability of both in empowering supply chain financial trust. Then a supply chain financial trust framework, which emphasizes information sharing, data security, and trust circulation, is proposed. Furthermore, combined with the theories of Funk-SVD and entropy value, this paper designs a global trust evaluation mechanism that facilitates the trust circulation in supply chain finance and proposes a recommendation algorithm for global trust. With the testing conducted using the Epinions dataset, it is found that the algorithm proposed in this paper has a strong data dimensionality reduction and concentration ability, especially for large sample data, it can obtain more accurate evaluation values with less space occupation, thus enhancing the trust circulation ability of supply chain finance. Finally, the paper puts forward specific policy recommendations for the implementation of the supply chain finance information mechanism, aiming to better improve the financing accessibility of enterprises in supply chain, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.</jats:p>"

The booster ring at TLS injects\n  electrons into the storage ring, which then circulates the electrons\n  to produce synchrotron radiation for various experiments. The Taiwan\n  Light Source (TLS) has been in service for more than 20 years, and\n  some of the power supplies used in the facility are old and hard to\n  maintain repair and the component are phase-out. The upgrade is\n  specifically aimed at replacing the power supply for the BTS\n  (Booster to Storage ring) transmission line with a new\n  machine. During the regular shunt down time, dipole magnet power\n  supply replacements were completed. The main reason for using the\n  Chroma 62075H-30E power supply is commonality, for this machine is\n  widely used in Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), and the output current of\n  the power supply is paralleled to a dipole magnet. Therefore, a\n  total of 17 power supplies are used in this upgrade planned to be\n  executed. This novel generation upgrade design is important because\n  the power supply for the BTS transmission line is critical for the\n  operation of the facility, as it is responsible for maintaining the\n  electron beam at a stable energy level as it is injected from the\n  booster ring into the storage ring. A more reliable and efficient\n  power supply can help improve the stability and quality of the\n  electron beam, leading to better experimental results and more\n  efficient use of the facility. Overall, this novel generation\n  upgrade design is part of the ongoing effort to modernize and\n  improve the infrastructure of the TLS, ensuring that it remains a\n  state-of-the-art research facility for years to come.</jats:p>",

The sensor-based irrigation scheduling was carried out on the basis of the depletion of total available soil moisture (TASM). The drip irrigation treatments consist of I1 (full irrigation), I2 (20% depletion of TASM), and I3 (40% depletion of TASM). The results revealed that the highest amount of water applied under I1 was recorded at 484.4 mm, while I2 (387.5 mm) and I3 (290.7 mm) during the growing season of sunflower. The results revealed that for kernel diameter and seed weight, I1 and I2 were statistically non-significant to each other while I1 and I3 were statistically significant to each other. The highest water productivity recorded for I2, followed by I3. The overall findings revealed that an average CWSI value of 0.85 for the sunflower crop falls within the range of lower and upper baselines. The response of physico-chemical properties of sunflower seeds showed a high correlation with the draught condition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology is vital for China to achieve its carbon neutrality goal. However, the high cost of CCUS projects, multiple processes, and insufficient policy support make it difficult for firms to invest independently. As an innovative way to achieve waste resource utilization, industrial symbiosis can effectively break through this dilemma. Based on the real options theory, this study establishes decision models for independent investment in a carbon capture and storage project by a coal-fired power plant (CFPP) and independent investment in an enhanced oil recovery project by an oil company. Then, from the perspective of industrial symbiosis, the decision models of cooperative investment in a CCUS project by a CFPP and an oil company are constructed. The models consider the supply–demand relationship of CO2, the correlation between carbon and oil prices, and technological uncertainty. The differential equation method is used to solve the models to obtain the investment thresholds and option values. Finally, all models are applied to a CCUS project in Guangdong Province, China, for simulation analyses. Based on the simulation results of the CCUS project in Guangdong Province, our major findings are as follows: (1) Industrial symbiosis can effectively promote the development of CCUS projects. Compared with the independent investment mode, industrial symbiosis reduces the investment threshold of the project by at least 25.42% and increases the option value by at least 12.94%. (2) It is more likely to trigger the project’s investment when CO2 supply and demand are balanced. The CCUS project’s investment threshold increases with the imbalance between CO2 supply and demand. (3) Stable carbon and oil prices can promote the project’s investment, and increasing the positive correlation coefficient of the prices will increase the project’s investment threshold.</jats:p>"

In contrast to classic Boolean algebraic models, which have long dominated cognitive psychology, quantum cognition proposes a new framework influenced by quantum mechanics' algebraic structure. This deviation derives from the understanding that natural notions, based on prototypes, are more closely related to convex sets than to the rigid rules of Boolean algebra. Drawing on the fundamental work of luminaries such as John von Neumann, quantum cognition reveals a unique probability theory based on ortho-algebras, challenging traditional probabilistic reasoning based on Boolean algebras. This change opens up solutions to complex challenges in rationality, logical thinking, and probabilistic reasoning, ushering in a new era of cognitive modelling.

After the climate changes, consumers were the main affected party, with a loss of 21,74%, represented by the average decrease in Consumer Surplus of – R$ 1.264,95 thousand/year.\n \nResearch Implications: Since 1999, with the climate changes, there has been a decrease in the socio-economic and environmental benefit for the population of western Pará to the level of R$ 4.664,37 thousand, which represented a decrease of 20,60% (-R$1.210,31 thousand) compared to the benefit obtained before the climate change (R$5.874,68 thousand).\n \nOriginality and Value: Sociobiodiversity products such as copaiba and andiroba oils are sensitive to climate changes. Excess and scarcity of rainfall cause a decrease in production and loss of income for extractivists. Therefore, these products should be part of the insurance policy to guarantee the income of producers.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate a set of critical knowledge-sharing enablers that might aid in successfully managing a circular supply chain (CSC) in the context of the Indian manufacturing sector. The knowledge-sharing enablers were determined through a review of the extant literature, coupled with discussion with subject matter experts (SMEs). The quantitative technique of interpretive structural modelling (ISM) was used to analyse the identified knowledge-sharing enablers. The findings of this study revealed that the knowledge-sharing capabilities of an organisation, organisation structure and support from the top management formed the most significant enablers for Indian manufacturing organisations. This study has significant managerial and academic contributions. While supply chain managers can use the findings of this study to gain a better understanding of the role of knowledge sharing in managing CSC in the Indian manufacturing context, policymakers can use these findings to formulate strategies for effectively managing the CSC, as well as improving its operational effectiveness. The findings can also aid academic researchers to further analyse the role that knowledge sharing might play in successfully managing CSC, including other industries (for example, service industries), as well as other geographical regions. </jats:p>",

Each Australian gas market has followed a different trajectory, with the west being defined by large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, a relatively small domestic market, and a long-standing domestic gas reservation that historically ensured the domestic market was oversupplied and prices remained low. The east coast market instead relied for decades on supply from the Cooper and Gippsland basins which only supplied the domestic market, with both now in decline. The establishment of LNG export capacity in Queensland connected the east coast market to international markets for the first time and was followed by bans and moratoriums on gas development in some jurisdictions. Notwithstanding their very different history, both markets now face potential domestic supply shortages within a decade, and both have experienced government intervention in the past 12 months. Government’s stated aims are to lower prices, ensure ongoing investment in supply, reduce emissions, and continue LNG exports. This paper examines forecast supply and demand, the impact of government intervention, net zero policies and the importance of maintaining Australia’s export reputation as a reliable supplier. Getting this balance just right will require a challenging ‘Goldilocks moment’, with serious consequences if we get it wrong.   To access the Oral Presentation click the link on the right.

Application of this method in Siyang County is meticulously investigated. First, four measurement strategies are employed for the precise estimation of the volume of irrigation water from agricultural irrigation water pumps (AIWPs) in Siyang County. Then, the CCECIWS data collected through on‐site testing and the distribution pattern of the CCECIWSs of AIWPs are analysed, and the ranges of the CCECIWS values for different groups are delineated. Conjoint analysis is conducted to quantify the influence of two factors on the CCECIWSs. Finally, three regression models are developed and validated to predict the CCECIWSs for the remaining 60% of the total AIWPs, which are not tested on site. The prediction results show that the regression models have acceptable accuracy. The contribution of this research is the provision of a practical and efficient CCECIWS method to indirectly evaluate the irrigation water supply, saving both time and economic costs and laying the foundation for future research on this topic.</jats:p>",

Показано, что реализация концептуальных решений на основе IoT-технологий позволяет интегрировать информационные данные и IoT-приложения в структуру энергетических объектов. В то же время энергетический сектор делает шаг вперед с точки зрения мониторинга энергоресурсов в режиме реального времени. Отмечается, что энергетические микрогрид-сети промышленных предприятий, которые построены с использованием IoTтехнологий, позволяют анализировать имеющиеся данные с целью снижения энергопотребления, систематизировать большие объемы данных и повысить эффективность работы энергетического оборудования. Это позволяет промышленному предприятию перейти от классической потребительской модели к проактивному потребителю, эффективно интегрирующему ресурсы своей энергокоммуникационной инфраструктуры в общую энергосистему, способствуя переходу от традиционной сети распределения и потребления электроэнергии к цифровым интеллектуальным сетям.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>The article shows the possibilities and advantages of using Internet of Things technology for power supply of enterprises.

This review is significant as it provides insights into the exploration of a more universal approach to investigate which factors really influence blockchain adoption, which is a pre-requisite for the technical sustainability of blockchain technology in supply chains. As observed in the review, the technology acceptance model (TAM), the technology–organization–environment (TOE) framework, and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) are frequently used in the literature, but little attention has been paid to whether blockchain technology fits the users’ tasks in understanding blockchain adoption in the supply chain. Among the technology adoption theories, task–technology fit (TTF) considers whether a technology fits the tasks, but only two previous studies involved the use of TTF. This study discusses the suitability of these existing models of technology adoption for blockchain applications in supply chains and comes up with a new unified model, namely TOE-TTF-UTAUT. This review also has implications for a more appropriate conceptual research design using mixed methods.</jats:p>"

Different emerging pathogens have been found in drinking water and their presence is considered to be an important public health problem. For this reason, it is necessary to carry out the validation of reliable technologies for this type of pathogens and evaluate their performance. This paper reports, for the first time, <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic> reduction in a drinking water pilot plant of two slow sand filters (SSF). Inlet water was taken from a gravel filtration system of a rural water supply in Colombia and then inoculated with viable cells of <jats:italic>H. pylori</jats:italic>. By determining the Genomic Units (GU) through quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR), the concentration of GU/sample was measured.

In recent decades, a number of projects have been initiated by national and international organizations to meet the desired need for safe drinking water and sanitation, but a large proportion of these development projects fail shortly after their execution. The majority of water supply projects fail in rural communities within three years after development due to the least level of community participation regarding decision-making, site identification, planning, execution, monitoring, evaluation and management process and, above all, unawareness, lack of basic technical and management skills. This study presents the most influencing determinants of community participation that are compulsory for the sustainable functionality of rural water supply systems. This study was conducted in the district of Lahore, Pakistan and simple random sampling methods and techniques were applied to draw the sample from the population. A semi-structured questionnaire was used as a tool for data collection. The result of the study indicated that a significant association existed among community participation in planning, execution, operation, maintenance &amp; evaluation processes and sustainability functionality of rural water supply systems.</jats:p>",

The proposed approach to modeling double ground fault modes is universal and can be used for standard traction power supply systems, as well as promising high-voltage traction networks.

Accompanied by this, due to the uncertain characteristics of renewable energy generation, the issue of imbalanced power supply and demand in microgrids has posed, which brings great challenges to the reliability of microgrid. In recent years, how to use an energy storage system to solve this problem has become a hot research topic in microgrid. In this paper, an online H∞ policy iteration algorithm is proposed to control the output power of photovoltaic arrays and micro-gas turbines. At the same time, considering the uncertainty of the load demand in the microgrid system and the input disturbance of the micro-gas turbine governor, the power supply and demand relationship of the microgrid can be balanced by the proposed control strategy. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the control strategy were demonstrated through simulation analysis.</jats:p>",

Hence, blackout recovery scenario is usually prepared and considered as one of the measures to achieve the system readiness after blackout. This study presents a techno-economic comparative analysis between two blackout recovery methods, namely via line charging and internal cross-supply, in CCCP Priok, Indonesia. It analyzes the historical data of the relationship of the active power contribution to the frequency, and then obtains the appropriate settings for the power plant parameters. From the technical perspective, the gain value or participation factor of this plant is 49 MW/Hz with 6% droop setting and 0.029 Hz of deadband frequency. It is found that a load set point lower than 2.49 MW can lead to grid synchronization failure since there are self-consumption loads on each gas turbine. Moreover, to prevent the risk of reverse power and to achieve a successful internal cross-supply scenario, the minimum load setting shall be adjusted to 3 MW. Meanwhile, from an economic perspective, the results show that a successful internal cross-supply method may save up to IDR 2.7 billion compared with line charging method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A brief description of power plants using renewable energy sources is given for autonomous power supply to small oil and gas field facilities with a power of no more than 20 kW, wind power plants in their composition – 10 kW with an energy efficiency of no more than 0.35-0.45. A modernized design of a vortex wind-solar power plant based on a combined H-Darrieu-Savonius rotor has been developed. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory vortex wind-thermal power plant, simulating the operation of a vortex wind-solar power plant. Experiments have shown that the rotation frequency and power of the H-Darieu rotor in a vortex tube will be greater than for the H-Darieu rotor in a horizontal air flow. This effect is explained by the peculiarities of the aerodynamics and energy of H-Darier rotors placed in a circular flow in a vortex tube. It is shown that the power of this installation can exceed the power of other types of wind power plants by an order of magnitude and the energy efficiency reaches 0.70. An example of an energy-technological scheme for using a modernized vortex wind-solar power plant to drive well pumps for oil production is given. It is shown that in this scheme the costs of traditional energy resources for oil production can be reduced by 2 times.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Human milk is optimal for infant nutrition. However, many mothers cease breastfeeding because of low milk supply (LMS). It is difficult to identify mothers at risk for LMS because its biologic underpinnings are not fully understood. Previously, we demonstrated that milk micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) may be related to LMS. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) also plays an important role in mammary involution and may contribute to LMS. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 139 breastfeeding mothers to test the hypothesis that milk levels of TGFβ would identify mothers with LMS. We explored whether TGFβ impacts the expression of LMS-related miRNAs in cultured human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). LMS was defined by maternal report of inadequate milk production, and confirmed by age of formula introduction and infant weight trajectory. Levels of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 were measured one month after delivery. There was a significant relationship between levels of TGF-β1 and LMS (<jats:italic>X</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 8.92, p = 0.003) on logistic regression analysis, while controlling for lactation stage (<jats:italic>X</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 1.28, p = 0.25), maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (<jats:italic>X</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.038, p = 0.84), and previous breastfeeding experience (<jats:italic>X</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 7.43, p = 0.006). The model accounted for 16.8% of variance in the data (p = 0.005) and correctly predicted LMS for 84.6% of mothers (22/26; AUC = 0.72). Interactions between TGF-β1 and miR-22-3p displayed significant effect on LMS status (Z = 2.67, p = 0.008). Further, incubation of HMECs with TGF-β1 significantly reduced mammary cell number (t = -4.23, p = 0.003) and increased levels of miR-22-3p (t = 3.861, p = 0.008). Interactions between TGF-β1 and miR-22-3p may impact mammary function and milk levels of TGF-β1 could have clinical utility for identifying mothers with LMS. Such information could be used to provide early, targeted lactation support.</jats:p>"

These disasters have clearly shown the uncertainty and vulnerability of supply chain systems. Also, it confirmed that adopting Just-in-Time (JIT) strategy to reduce the logistic chain cost may lead to inbuilt complexity and risks. Efficient tools are therefore needed to make complexity optimized supply chain decisions. Evolutionary algorithms, including genetic algorithms (GA), have proven effective in identifying optimal solutions that address the trade-offs between total supply chain cost and carbon emissions regulatory policy represented by carbon tax charges. These solutions pertain to the design challenges of supply networks exposed to potential disruption risks. However, GA have a set of parameters must be chosen for effective and robust performance of the algorithms. This paper aims to set the most suitable values of these parameters that used via GA – ased optimization cost and risk reduction model in firms using a JIT as a delivery system. The model has been conceptualized for addressing the design complexities of the supply chain, referred to as SCRRJITS (Simultaneous Cost and Risk Reduction in a Just-in-Time System). A complete analysis of the different parameters and operators of the algorithm is carried out using design of experiments approach. The algorithm performance measure used in this study is convergence of solutions. The results show the extent to which the quality of solution can be changed depending on selection of these parameters.</jats:p>",

In fact, this system has been given a new lease of life in the construction industry development plan lately to strengthen its contribution to the country. The availability of building materials from the mainland of Peninsular Malaysia is a crucial factor for the successful installation of IBS components at construction sites. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the critical factors in the supply management of IBS components at the Pulau Perhentian, Terengganu’s construction site. In order to achieve the objective of this study, a qualitative study that is a structured interview with sixteen (16) construction contractors, three (3) each from supplier companies and transport ships/vessel or ‘barges’ that are directly involved in the supply of this IBS components have been carried out. Seven (7) critical factors have been identified which are: 1) compliance with government directives; 2) accuracy of work planning and scheduling; 3) the contractor’s current financial position is good; 4) good relationship (tolerance) between contractor and supplier; 5) availability of components; 6) availability of transport ship/vessel or ‘barge’ and machinery; and 7) able to predict weather conditions. These critical factors can be used as a useful basis in providing a more effective industrialised building system-based project implementation environment in the future on Perhentian Island in particular and other islands in general. The findings of this study have opened up a new research space towards providing a more perfect environment for the implementation of management activities for the supply of IBS components at the construction site.</jats:p>"

To address the potential endogeneity in the fertility decision, I exploit Indian families’ preference for having sons. I leverage exogenous variation in the gender of older children aged 6 + years as an instrumental variable for having younger children aged 0–5 years in the family. IV estimates show that the mothers’ participation is significantly reduced by 9.9% due to the presence of young children aged 0–5 years in the household, with the negative effect mostly driven by mothers belonging to the highest income quartile; mothers with high education; and mothers residing in nuclear families. The findings highlight the need for investment in high-skilled jobs and formal childcare facilities to encourage mothers’ labour supply. Using the testable implications for the generalizability of LATE discussed in Angrist (The Economic Journal, 114: C52 C83, 2004), I show that the estimated causal effect is homogenous across compliers, always takers, and never takers and thus, generalizable to the whole population of interest.</jats:p>",

To explore these directions, a sampling of 19 bulbs of different geometries is considered, and a specially designed power supply is used, capable of controlling the shape (duration and magnitude) and frequency of current pulses injected into the plasma. A dedicated test bench, including a supervisory program that drives the power supply and collects system performance data, is used to perform parametric sweeps and guarantee measurement repeatability: the set of electrical parameters is fully explored for each lamp, and each experiment is characterized by UV emission performance and electrical generator operating conditions. Multiquadric response surfaces, used to format the results of this multi-variable exploration, reveal the most efficient directions for system optimization: increasing gas volume and, at a given operating frequency, providing the shortest possible current pulses with high amplitude can increase both UV emission and conversion efficiency.</jats:p>",

The scaled-up batch fermentation process achieved an enhanced conversion rate (83.58%) and specific productivity (0.26 g/L·h).

Modifications are made by moving the gas outlet from the top to the middle or reduction area. The initial start-up of the system uses a blown air supply system, then after the syngas are produced by the operation, it is replaced with a sucked air supply. Two blowers are used, namely an exhalation or blowing blower for initial start and a suction blower for continuous operation. The fuel used was low bulk density, specifically rice husks. The aim was to characterize the modified gasifier, focusing on parameters such as operating time, duration of gas combustion, air-to-rice husks ratio, and flame color. Typically, the experiments were conducted under constant of air velocity and fuel quantity. The results showed that the average operating time, duration of flammable gas, and air-to-rice husks ratio were 74.25 minutes, 52.28 minutes, and 7.6 kg air/kg husk, respectively, and the flame produced was a bluish-yellow color that indicates a reduction tar.</jats:p>"

In the Mid-Atlantic region, irrigation in agriculture has grown since the 1980s due to rising temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns. Dry summers and uneven seasonal rainfall have necessitated a shift toward irrigation, particularly in Maryland's Coastal Plain. However, high dependence on confined groundwater for irrigation around this area has strained aquifers. To mitigate this strain, exploring alternative water sources is now important. This study investigates the viability of utilizing treated wastewater from plants as an irrigation substitute in Maryland's Coastal Plain. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, the research evaluates crop productivity and irrigation needs under various climate scenarios. Results indicate that recycled water from nearby treatment plants can meet crop water requirements during wet years and partially during moderate and dry years, reducing aquifer reliance by 56 and 30%, respectively. This framework aims to boost yields while conserving freshwater resources. By serving as a decision support tool, stakeholders can assess the feasibility of recycled water for irrigation, thereby potentially reducing strain on confined aquifers.</jats:p>",

Changing salinity and nutrient conditions affect phytoplankton physiology by altering elemental ratios of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). This study aimed to understand how salinity stress and resource acquisition affect phytoplankton stoichiometry. We incubated a phytoplankton polyculture composed of 10 species under different light, inorganic nutrient ratio and salinity levels. At the end of the incubation period, we measured particulate elemental composition (C, N and P), chlorophyll a and species abundances. The phytoplankton polyculture, dominated by Phaeodactylum tricornutum, accumulated more particulate organic carbon (POC) with increasing salinity. The low POC and low particulate C:N and C:P ratios toward 0 psu suggest that the hypoosmotic conditions highly affected primary production. The relative abundance of different species varied with salinity, and some species grew faster under low nutrient supply. Still, the dominant diatom regulated the overall POC of the polyculture, following the classic concept of the foundation species.</jats:p>",

The study aims to shed light on how technological innovation capabilities (TICs) affect the implementation of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) and how they can help organizations overcome internal barriers to SSCM implementation. This descriptive survey was conducted in the context of Iran. The survey was carried out with 27 responses, which were analyzed by one-sample t-test to determine the relationships between variables, and the Friedman test to rank the results. This study employs SPSS for statistical analysis. The study reveals that all TICs have a substantial effect on SSCM implementation in general, especially the learning capability, resource allocation capability, and manufacturing capability, which all have an almost identical positive and significant effect on SSCM implementation. Interestingly, organizing capability had the least influence on SSCM implementation. In addition, the results demonstrating improved TICs could assist firms in overcoming internal barriers to SSCM implementation. From a practical standpoint, the relationship between TICs and SSCM implementation and its barriers may give insight into how organizations can enhance their SSCM implementation by improving TICs. Moreover, policymakers and sustainable supply chain managers in Iran can benefit from the identified relationships in this study. This study is one of the first to analyze the impact of TICs on SSCM implementation, and the findings provide a novel paradigm for understanding how TICs influence the implementation of SSCM.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we analyze these arguments in favor of livestock farming. Through argumentation analysis based on scientific data, we show that the arguments are either invalid or that their validity is limited to certain circumstances. Without taking into consideration any other potential arguments for livestock farming, or arguments against it, we conclude that the arguments analyzed here cannot in isolation provide justification for more than a small proportion of today’s livestock farming.</jats:p>",

Consumer priorities when buying online were identified: saving money, proof of availability of the necessary product, saving time, ease of choice, security, etc. It has been determined which social networks are channels for online transactions in Ukraine. It has been established that logistics is a key factor in the success of е- сommerce. OTIF is an indicator of the quality of е-сommerce logistics. A few delivery delays may not be disastrous, but they can cause disruptions and send ripple effects in supply chains.  Businesses increasingly outsource their logistics operations to 3PL providers to benefit from their expertise, infrastructure, and economies of scale. Sources of failures in е-сommerce supply chains have been investigated. Actual problems faced by logistics operators have been identified, among them: rising costs of transportation, shortage of vehicles, limited infrastructure, cyber security, labor shortage, last mile logistics, reverse logistics. Strategies for increasing the resilience of supply chains are proposed: increasing visibility, multisourcing, lean best practices, bulding security, 4PL partnership, сoopetition, сooperation, reshoring/nearshoring/friendshoring.  The e-commerce logistics market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. Technological advancements like artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics will play a key role in improving efficiency and resilience in logistics operations.

However, the supply chain risk management is often prone to the impact of various uncertainties associated with supply chain disruptions caused by meteorological, pandemic, resources shortage, etc. Therefore, one way to quantify these uncertainties are the stochastic modeling approaches of supply chain management. The stochastic modeling is a powerful tool that can predict with certain probability the events that may occur within the supply chain such as that associated with manufacturing processes. In the present research a stochastic model, based on probability theory, is developed and proposed for the analysis of supply chain risk management, for manufacturing processes. Therefore, the studies are performed to investigate the impact of the number of manufacturing processes on the supply chain proper evolution. The current study shows that the increase of the number of the manufacturing processes results in an increase of uncertainty in the supply chain management and thus, it increases the probability of supply chain disruption occurrences, within the supply chain. Therefore, it is recommended that a supply chain should contain a minimum number of manufacturing process, if the delivery time and final product allows.</jats:p>",

It also analyses the performance characteristics of hot water supply heaters installed on individual heat points of insulated buildings. The authors compared the heat transfer surface area of heaters and network water flow rate through the heating point for one-stage and two-stage combined schemes of connection of heat exchangers and heat networks.\nThe analysis of calculation results showed that using a two-stage combined connection scheme reduces the consumption of network water through the individual heat supply unit compared to the one-stage scheme. However, the two-stage scheme causes the necessity to increase the heat transfer surface area compared to the one-stage connection scheme. We generalised the results by formulas for calculating water flow rate from distribution heat networks and heat transfer surface area. It is possible to use the obtained results to develop a strategy for reforming micro-district centralised heating systems.\nUsing a two-stage combined connection scheme for hot water supply heat exchangers installed on individual heating points (IHP) of additionally insulated buildings reduces network water consumption through the individual heating point by 8–16% compared to a one-stage connection scheme. The device of a two-stage combined scheme in comparison with a one-stage scheme causes the increase of heat transfer surface area of heat exchangers of the hot water supply of individual heating points from one and a half to two times depending on the accepted design temperature of heating of cold water at the first stage of the heating unit. The results of calculations are approximated by equations, allowing, with acceptable accuracy, to compare the indicators of two-stage combined and one-stage schemes of connection of water heaters for individual heating points of insulated buildings.\nKeywords: centralised heat supply, individual heating point, water heaters, hot water supply.</jats:p>",

У статті розглянуті аргументи і контраргументи щодо використання аграрної розписки як інвестиційного інструменту для сільськогосподарських товаровиробників. Основною метою дослідження було проаналізувати поточний стан застосування аграрних розписок у діяльності сільськогосподарських підприємств, виявити переваги і недоліки, визначити передумови і перспектив для збільшення обсягу цих інструментів.\r\nПроаналізовано їх сутність, досліджено позитивний вплив аграрних розписок на вітчизняне сільське господарство. Використання аграрних розписок дозволяє адаптувати залучені кошти під потреби сільськогосподарських підприємств. Під час дослідження цих товаророзпорядчих документів виявлено, що вони є певними видами документів, застосовуваними у сфері господарювання для опосередкування певних дій з майном та майновими правами.\r\nУ статті проведено аналіз динаміки їх використання у період з 2015 по 2023 рік. Розглянуто також використання аграрних розписок в регіонах України, зокрема там, де діяв пілотний проект. Пропонуються напрями активізації використання аграрних розписок по всій Україні.\r\nСтаття також досліджує проблеми розвитку кредитування сільськогосподарських підприємств за допомогою аграрних розписок. За результатами аналізу встановлено, що в Україні ефективно застосовується ця практика в діяльності сільськогосподарських підприємств. У статті проаналізовано обсяги банківського кредитування сільського господарства і встановлено, що обсяги випуску аграрних розписок майже дорівнюють обсягам банківського кредитування аграрного сектору на короткий термін в національній валюті, чим сприяли значному розширенню фінансування оборотного капіталу в аграрному секторі.\r\nУ статті визначено подальші напрями розвитку використання аграрних розписок, зокрема за участю банківського кредитування під заставу фінансової аграрної розписки.

This research aims to see the influence of supply chain dynamic capabilities, including collaboration, integration, agility, and responsive capabilities, on the operational performance of food and beverage MSMEs in Sleman, Indonesia. The sample of this study is food and beverage MSMEs located in Sleman, Indonesia, which apply supply chain management capabilities such as collaboration, integration, agility, and responsive capabilities. The MSMEs must have been operated for more than three years, starting from 2019, so MSMEs already have a more robust supply chain network. Data from sixty food and beverage MSMEs was collected in 2024 using a set of questionnaires tested for validity using Pearson’s correlation and reliability using Cronbach’s Alpha. Data processing in this research uses SPSS 25 software with an analysis tool, namely multiple regression analysis. This analysis helps prove whether or not there is an influence between two or more independent variables on the dependent variable. The results of this research show that collaboration capabilities, integration capabilities, agility capabilities, and responsive capabilities partially have a significant positive effect on operational performance. Increasing collaboration capabilities between MSMEs and internal and external parties must be maintained to improve value from the MSMEs themselves. According to the hypothesis test results, the integration capability variable significantly influences the operational performance of MSMEs in Sleman, Indonesia. The agility capability variable significantly influences the operational performance of MSMEs in Sleman, Indonesia. The responsiveness significantly influences the operational performance of MSMEs in Sleman, Indonesia. </jats:p>"

Two novel methods of performing nonlinear modeling are presented in this research, the first being novel Takagi-Sugeno model, which combines two linear state space models using a membership function to model the nonlinear transitions between operating points. The second method involves using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a nonlinear modeling technique that uses L1 regularization of least squares for time-series data to define a parsimonious polynomial function set. This set is used to define the input feature space to extended dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) with control. These models are then used for data-driven model predictive control of a buck switch mode power supply to find the optimal duty cycle that regulates the output voltage over a finite tuned proportional integral derivative (PID) controller. Numerical accuracy challenges are discussed, and strategies are offered for their mitigation.</jats:p>",

The study aims to provide an understanding of how DeFi can overcome the limitations of traditional supply chain finance methods and create new opportunities for businesses. The research starts by discussing the challenges faced by supply chain finance and introduces DeFi as a solution. Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, DeFi enables a transparent and trustworthy system for real-time tracking of financial transactions and assets, this transparency reduces the risk of fraud and enhances decision-making. The study explores how DeFi can streamline and automate various supply chain finance processes, such as invoice factoring, trade finance, and payments, using smart contracts and decentralized applications. However, there are challenges and limitations that need to be addressed for successful implementation. The implications of DeFi for the US financial system, including risks to traditional institutions and regulatory considerations, are also discussed. The research proposes potential solutions and prospects for DeFi in supply chain finance. Additionally, the research examines the potential impact of DeFi on the US economy and job market, highlighting the emergence of new job roles and skills. The study concludes by providing key findings and recommendations for stakeholders, including companies, policymakers, and researchers. The integration of DeFi in supply chain finance offers an opportunity to transform financial operations and relationships within the supply chain. Collaboration, innovation, and strategic efforts from all stakeholders are crucial for realizing the potential of DeFi. The US should take a proactive approach by developing regulatory frameworks, fostering research and development, promoting partnerships, and investing in education and talent development to position itself as a global leader in supply chain finance innovation.</jats:p>",

We identify global hotspots of present-day and mid-century drought risk under future scenarios of climate change and demand growth (namely, SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5). We estimate the mean rate of unsustainable or disrupted utility supply at 15% (interquartile range, 0–26%) and project a global increase in risk of between 30–45% under future scenarios. Implementing the most cost-effective adaptation action identified per utility would mitigate additional future risk by 75–80%. However, implementing the subset of cost-effective options that generate sufficient tariff revenue to provide a benefit-cost ratio that is greater than 1 would only achieve 5–20% of this benefit. The results underline the challenge of attracting the financing required to close the climate adaptation gap for water supply utilities.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on the supply points established during the lockdown period of Shanghai in 2022 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this investigation, the actual distribution of the population is depicted using a thermodynamic map generated from cell phone usage data, while the per capita supply capacity and the intensity of supply coverage are assessed using an official list. Furthermore, the efficacy of the supply point is evaluated through a public survey. Through these combined analyses, the level of \"Supply Resilience\" is assessed and categorized for each district of Shanghai. The findings indicate a high level of supply resilience in the central city, with varying degrees of divergence observed in the near suburban districts and generally lower resilience in the remote suburban districts. Based on these observations, this research identifies and discusses the supply challenges exposed during the epidemic lockdown in Shanghai and proposes strategies to enhance the urban resilience in the future. Leveraging both data analysis and public survey, this study aims to offer approaches and methodologies for evaluating urban resilience under major public emergencies.</jats:p>",

By integrating a trade-in strategy with suppliers, it ensures a precise and timely response to the fluctuating demand for relief supplies post-disaster. Utilizing the newsvendor model, optimization theory, and supply chain coordination principles, we developed a comprehensive model that calculates optimal reserve quantities for pre-positioning demanders. It also outlines the expected profit function for suppliers and a robust supply chain coordination model. The findings highlight that optimal stockpiling decisions for relief supplies are heavily influenced by cost parameters, material characteristics, and the relationship between trade-in pricing and market resale values. Notably, higher trade-in prices generally reduce the government’s optimal reserve quantities, impacting strategic decisions within supply chain coordination. This research adds to disaster management literature by offering strategic insights into how coordination and pricing strategies can improve disaster preparedness and response efficiency and effectiveness.</jats:p>"

In this article, we consider this problem with reference to a multi‐stage SC (MSSC) whose dynamics is characterized by the following elements of complexity: perishable goods with uncertain perishability rate, an uncertain future customer demand that is only known to fluctuate inside a given compact set. The problem we face is to define a resilient and robust Replenishment Policy (RP) such that at any stage the following requirements are satisfied: the fulfilled demand is maximized, overstocking is avoided, the bullwhip effect (BE) is mitigated. These objectives should be pursued despite the mentioned uncertainties and unexpected customer demand behaviors violating the bounds of the compact set. Robustness is here intended with respect to uncertainty on the perishability rate, and resiliency as the ability to quickly react to the mentioned unforeseen customer demands. We propose a method based on a distributed resilient robust model predictive control (DRRMPC) approach. Each local robust MPC (RMPC) involves solving a Min‐Max constrained optimization problem (MMCOP). To drastically reduce the numerical complexity of each MMCOP, we parametrize its solution by means of B‐spline functions.</jats:p>",

This research aims to illustrate institutional risks in the halal supply chain for the potato chip MSME cluster using the SCOR method. SSOP and GMP are added to strengthen the analysis. Key actors in the halal supply chain institution include suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. The study identifies several risky activities that threaten the halal integrity of potato chip products. Using the SCOR method for risk mapping in the halal supply chain institution resulted in 69 risk events and 70 risk agents. The potential risks in the halal supply chain for potato chips occur mainly at the manufacturer level (70% of the total risk events). They are most prevalent in the production process variable. The majority of risk agents in micro-scale businesses are related to the implementation of PPH, SJPH, SSOP, and food safety.</jats:p>",

Using the individual-level uncertainty measurements initially proposed by Wang and He (2011) and their alternative transformations, we analyze how these factors of demand and perceived supply sides affect people's valuation uncertainty. Our results demonstrate the significant contribution of these determinants in explaining respondents' uncertainty. On the demand side, people who ‘don't know much’ about benefits-related factors have the highest level of uncertainty, and those claiming to ‘know nothing’ most often report the lowest level of uncertainty. On the supply side, people who either do not trust or are not satisfied with the control policies tend to be more certain of their valuation. The subsequent analyses also suggest that these results be interpreted as negative certainty, which is attributed to a lack of interest.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the shipping and maritime transport segment has undergone profound changes. Faced with the need to achieve the sustainability goals set by Agenda 2030, different sustainable modes of transport must therefore be evaluated. Passenger transport by ship has proven to be the least polluting per pax/km. Different European regulations are moving in the direction of limiting transport by air when there are fewer polluting methods on average lengths, mainly on a national scale. The tourism sector is one where the impacts on the Agenda 2030 goals are often not properly assessed. Ship connections with a tourism function are central in connections to smaller islands which, due to their size and relatively small flows, do not have airports. In medium-sized basins, tourist traffic by ship is changeable and often dependent on specific characteristics of the basin. The aim of the present research work is to analyse the general case of an open basin, with an application to the Adriatic-Ionian basin. The system of connections between eastern Italy and western Greece by ship is analysed. The case study refers to the characteristics of travel from Italy to Greece by ship, with reference to the Ionian Islands. The overall method proposed is articulated in several successive steps, which can be summarised as follows: analysis of the characteristics of services; analysis of supply with network analysis methods applied to services; analysis of demand with estimation of a regression model. The methodologies identified make it possible to highlight the temporal and central characteristics of the network considered, and at the same time to verify the influence that certain attributes have on tourism for the area studied. The results show, on the one hand, that not all services have a significant summer component and, on the other, that the centrality of the various ports within the network changes, even heavily, with the season. The work is expected to be of particular interest to policy makers, planners, and researchers,  considering centrality as closely linked to the distribution of services for passengers in ports and related port-city areas, and considering the possibility of better planning the distribution of funding in relation to the ports’ development and resilience to address disruptive events.</jats:p>"

There are many different autonomous systems of heat supply of objects. One of the variants of such systems is the system with tubе gas heaters. A tube gas heater consists of a gas burner, a radiating tube and a fan. One of the technical solutions for such heat supply systems is a tubular heater located inside the building structure. Increase of the efficiency of gas equipment can be achieved by operating this equipment in the condensation mode. Therefore, the operation of tubular gas heaters in building structures in the condensation mode is quite interesting in terms of increasing the efficiency of utilisation of the thermal potential of gaseous fuel and ensuring its saving. For research and practical design of autonomous heat supply systems with gas tube heaters in building structures with regard to the condensation mode of operation it is essential to develop a mathematical model for calculating the thermal and hydraulic modes of the system. The purpose of the article is to develop a mathematical model of an autonomous heat supply system with tubular gas heaters in building structures when operating in the condensation mode. Conclusion. The mathematical model of hydraulic and thermal modes of autonomous heat supply system with tubular gas heaters in building structures when operating in the condensation mode was developed. It is presented in the form of differential equations. The model is based on the equations of conservation of mass, motion and energy for the gas-air mixture inside the canal in two-phase flow, the equation of heat transfer inside the building structure, the equation of heat transfer from the external surface of the heater to the environment. The mathematical model of hydraulic and thermal modes of autonomous heat supply system with tubular gas heaters in building structures when operating in the condensation mode will be used to calculate and design such systems.</jats:p>"

Many, but not all, DAUCOs have relatively low total water supply variability compared to that of state-wide precipitation. Such low variability, in DAUCOs having sufficient diversity of water supply sources, is the result of switching between sources as needed to maintain a reliable total water supply. We used multiple approaches to explore these variations which involved four categories of water supply (local, groundwater, imported, and other) and two categories of water use (agricultural and urban). First, a cluster analysis of the volumetric water balance data identified a small set of clusters having similar magnitudes and proportions of water supply sources and water use—some of them composed of only a few DAUCOs but accounting for a disproportionate amount of the state’s water use. Second, a principal components analysis identified leading modes of anomalous water supply and water use among the 475 DAUCOs, capturing most of the time variation during 2002 to 2016. The most prominent mode exhibits a multi-year trend, most strongly involving increasing groundwater supply and agricultural water use, and decreasing urban water use and imported water supply. Over the study period, trends in both supply and use were pronounced, but differed considerably across California DAUCOs. One predominant subset of DAUCOs grew their agricultural water use with increased groundwater supply; in contrast to a widespread group of DAUCOs which reduced their urban water use. An important result for planners is our finding that variation in precipitation—itself important—is amplified by the human response to water supply availability and regulatory policy.</jats:p>"

Under the same discharge, the transverse slope of the water surface in the case with sediment was larger than that without sediment and the change was steep; the change in the longitudinal slope of the water surface was small in the upper half bend and large in the lower half bend. By increasing the water discharge, the number of secondary flow vortices at the apex of the meandering channel increased. The trends of the mainstream lines with and without sediment supply were roughly opposite and the difference between them decreased with increasing discharge. The lateral and vertical turbulence intensities of the flow near the outer bank were larger in both cases (with and without sediment). In the case with sediment, the turbulent kinetic energy of the cross-section was larger near the bed and the water surface. </jats:p>",

Water samples were collected from six different points of the water distribution network of Dhaka’s south locality, starting from the source (Shitalakhyariver, Narayanganj) to Jagannath University, Dhaka. The dominant taxonomic units were isolated using standard culture techniques, followed by biochemical identification, VITEK2 identification, and biofilm-forming potential of each isolate individually and co-cultured with other isolates. Presumptive identification of isolates from the Shitalakhya River revealed the presence of Citrobacter sp., Alcaligenes sp., and Pseudomonas putida. The sample from Saydabad Water Treatment Plant yielded Vibrio mimicus, Pseudomonas fluorescence, and Alcalimonas. The major aerobic bacteria in the water specimen from the community overhead tank included S aureus, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus sp., Enterococcus sp., Lactococcus sp. Tap water revealed the presence of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus, Enterobacter, Shigella, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as anaerobic bacteria. Biochemical tests and VITEK2 yielded different results. Potential biofilm formers such as Klebsiella, E. coli, Enterococcus, Aerococcus, Enterobacter, and Cronobacter indicated quality deterioration potential inside the piped water supply system. Alteration in the major taxonomic units throughout the municipal water distribution network and the presence of opportunistic pathogens and biofilm-formers indicate the necessity for an updated water treatment, quality control, and in-line maintenance system.\n\n\n\n</jats:p>"

The service sector, including small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) involved in logistical operations, is actively pursuing measures to achieve the expected sustainability goals. In recent years, incorporating sustainable service quality attributes (SSQAs) has become a crucial strategy for attaining competitive advantages and sustainability objectives. In this context, the current study examines sustainable service quality attributes’ role in achieving sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) and obtaining triple bottom line sustainability outcomes. Data were obtained from 295 logistics service-providing SMEs using the purposive sampling technique. The acquired data were then analyzed using the structural equation model. According to the findings, SSQAs have a positive association with SSCP. The moderating roles of blockchain technology (BT) and environmental uncertainty (EU) were significant between SSQAs and SSCP. SSCP also mediated between SSQAs, BT, and TBL. Meanwhile, EU and BT also have a significant influencing role between SSQAs and SSCP. The study adds to the body of knowledge within the domain of sustainability, by testing the unique interaction between sustainable service quality attributes and SSCP. Likewise, the use of blockchain technology as a moderator on a given relationship is empirically unique in itself. The study also provides the first of their kind findings on the subject matter in the context of 295 logistics service-providing SMEs from a developing country like Pakistan. The study’s findings are helpful for managers in transforming their services by embedding the SSQAs and developing their workforce to be equipped with the knowledge and facilities necessary to achieve TBL outcomes.</jats:p>"

Nous avons collecté la géolocalisation, le nombre de mammographies réalisées par mois et le coût d'une mammographie de dépistage dans chaque service radiologie. La capacité était définie comme le nombre d'unités de mammographie disponibles pour 10 000 femmes âgées de 40 ans et plus.\nRésultats : A Yaoundé, 37,78% (17/45) des services de radiologie disposaient d'un appareil de mammographie, et 76,47% (13/17) de ces appareils étaient en état de fonctionnement au moment de l'étude.

Cameroon has adopted an annual mammography screening policy for women aged 40 years and over.\nObjective: To evaluate the capacity of the current mammography supply to meet the needs for breast cancer screening in Yaounde City.\nMethods: Cross-sectional study targeting radiology departments containing a mammography unit in Yaounde (Cameroon, Central Africa) from January 2021 to June 2021. We collected the geolocation, number of mammograms performed per month, and cost of a screening mammogram for each radiology service. We calculated mammography capacity as the number of mammography units per 10,000 women aged 40 and above.\nResults: In Yaounde, 37.78% (17/45) of radiology departments had a mammography unit, and 76.47% (13/17) of these units were in operating condition at the time of the study. The median number of mammograms performed per month in each service was 15 [8 - 60], and the median cost of a screening mammogram was 53.55 US dollars [48.68 - 64.9]. Mammography units were mainly located in the administrative center, but they were accessible within an hour's drive from any location in the city. The capacity was estimated to be 0.32 per 10,000 women aged 40, which was only enough to cover 19.54% of the needs for screening mammography in eligible women.\nConclusion: Mammography service supply in Yaounde was critically insufficient to cover breast cancer screening needs in 2021. Functional mammography units were accessible but underutilized. Further research is needed to identify the barriers to mammography screening and the scarcity of mammography units in Yaounde.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>При использовании подземных вод для питьевого водоснабжения поселков часто возникает необходимость в их обезжелезивании и деманганации. Вода со сверхнормативным содержанием железа и марганца неприятна на вкус, вызывает болезни сердечно-сосудистой, костной и репродуктивной систем человека. Высокая жесткость воды ведет к атеросклерозу и мочекаменной болезни. Цель данного исследования – разработка технологической схемы подготовки питьевой воды из подземных источников для водоснабжения малых населенных мест Сибири. Исследования проведены в рабочем поселке Ордынский Новосибирской области на экспериментальной установке, предназначенной для очистки природной подземной воды из скважин. В результате установлено, что предварительная аэрация и реагентная обработка воды с последующим фильтрованием на двух ступенях осветлительных фильтров, загруженных новым фильтрующим материалом «Диамикс Аква», обеспечивают питьевое качество очищенной воды.

High water hardness leads to atherosclerosis and urolithiasis. The purpose of this study is to develop a technological scheme for the preparation of drinking water from underground sources for water supply to small populated areas in Siberia. The research results were obtained by conducting experimental studies. The research was carried out at an experimental installation in the working village of Ordynsky, Novosibirsk region, for the purification of natural groundwater from wells. As a result of research, it was established that preliminary aeration and reagent treatment of water followed by filtration on 2-stage clarification filters loaded with the new Diamix Aqua filter material ensures the drinking quality of purified water. A new technological scheme for water treatment for the drinking water supply of the village has been developed, including new equipment, materials and reagents, with the reuse of rinsing wastewater and disposal of water sludge.</jats:p>"

The impact factors on the layout of EMPs are first analyzed. Then, a new emergency monitoring layout model is presented with the goal of maximizing the number of the excluded possible sources and minimizing the formulated time of emergency response. Finally, taking EPANET Network 3 as a simulation case to verify the proposed model. The results show the new layout model can effectively exclude 60% of the number of possible sources, and shorten 18% of the formulated time of emergency response measure. There are many factors that affect the layout of EMPs, which mainly include the time of arranging EMPs, the latest time to formulate the emergency response measure, the number of emergency monitoring equipment available, and the relative error criteria of pollutant concentration, from apparently to slightly. It provides a new idea for emergency decision-makers to deal with sudden water pollution accidents in water distribution networks.</jats:p>",

Managing dynamic supply chains is highly challenging, particularly when considering various sources of risk factors. This paper extensively explores dynamical analysis and multistability analysis to understand nonlinear behaviors and pinpoint potential risks within supply chains. Different phase portraits are used to demonstrate the impact of various factors such as transportation risk, quality risk, distortion, contingency reserves, and safety stock on both customers and retailers. We introduced a sliding mode control method that computes the sliding surface and its derivative by considering the error and its derivative. The equivalent control law based on the sliding surface and its derivative is derived and validated for control purposes. Our results show that the controller SMC can significantly enhance supply chain stability and efficiency. This research provides a robust framework for understanding complex supply chain dynamics and offers practical solutions to enhance supply chain resilience and flexibility.</jats:p>"

It identifies out-shopping as a factor explaining why existing studies observing food prices at local stores in remote areas find much higher prices than at urban stores, while studies observing actual purchases of household in remote areas find small differences in food expensiveness with urban households. To investigate this difference, a food expensiveness index was constructed using home scanner data measuring households’ actual purchases. Data from the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, when travel restriction limited out-shopping, were compared with the same period in 2019 when such restrictions were not in place. The results find that the premium paid in remote rural areas was small overall, but a statistically significant increase during lockdown was found for those households that lost access to discount stores because of movement restrictions. This result indicates that out-shopping is an important factor limiting food expensiveness in remote areas of Scotland and thus ensuring food affordability. Data suggest that approximately 42 percent of households in Scotland remote areas rely on out-shopping for obtaining affordable food.</jats:p>",

Findings confirmed the direct effect of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and employee attitude on behavioral intention to use blockchain in the food supply. However, perceived usefulness was found to be more significant on behavioral intention to use blockchain due to higher beta value. Furthermore, the indirect effect of employee attitude on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention to use blockchain positively and significantly suggested a partial mediation effect. For the Blockchain system to gain acceptance, it should be easy to use and be perceived as useful by end users.

If an educator relies on just one or two teaching methods repeatedly, it can make learning monotonous. It is important to consider a variety of teaching methods, such as group discussions, project assignments, problem-solving, simulations, or the use of diverse learning media. The education system in state vocational schools under the Ministry of Transportation implements a boarding school education system. In the boarding school education system, where students, in this case, Taruna, are involved in activities throughout the day, the learning process inside the classroom becomes less effective. Therefore, it is crucial to introduce engaging and effective learning media. The use of digital learning media is an appropriate method to address this issue. By utilizing digital learning media, it can enhance students' interest, clarify learning materials, provide variation in teaching methods, and involve students in the learning process. This research aims to design effective learning media for the SKO course by utilizing PLTS technology as a power supply for APILL in the learning process at the Land Transportation Polytechnic.

This paper investigates how the two markup pricing strategies influence firms’ managerial behaviors in a green supply chain, considering three power structures: Manufacturer Stackelberg, Retailer Stackelberg, and Vertical Nash. We find that the retailer’s pricing strategy choice is jointly affected by power structures and consumer sensitivity to product green levels. Particularly under Manufacturer Stackelberg, the fixed-markup strategy makes the retailer earn a higher profit. However, under Vertical Nash, the retailer’s pricing strategy depends on consumer sensitivity to green levels. When consumers are less sensitive to green levels, a flexible-dollar markup strategy is more profitable for the retailer; otherwise, the fixed-markup strategy is better. Additionally, for the manufacturer, the green levels of the product and the firm profit are always higher when the retailer adopts a fixed-dollar markup strategy under Manufacturer Stackelberg and Vertical Nash. Interestingly, if the retailer adopts a flexible-dollar markup strategy, the manufacturer has the “late-mover advantage” only when consumer sensitivity to the green level is high. Furthermore, the supply chain achieves the highest profit when the manufacturer acts as the leader under the fixed markup strategy.</jats:p>"

As a result, a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices can be influenced by CSR practices of its customers and suppliers—known as CSR diffusion. This study examines how CSR diffuses in a supply chain that encompasses a focal firm, its suppliers, and customers. Adopting a relational view, this research hypothesizes that a firm's CSR is influenced by its customer‐base CSR differently than its supply‐base CSR. By analyzing panel data consisting of 1972 firm‐year observations integrated from multiple data sources, the results offer evidence for a positive impact of customer‐base CSR and a negative impact of supply‐base CSR on firm CSR. Interestingly, when customers and suppliers of a focal firm establish direct business connections (i.e., customer–supplier closure), the positive follow‐suit effect of customer‐base CSR is enhanced. In contrast, the negative free‐ride effect of supply‐base CSR is diminished. This suggests that a focal firm is more likely to embrace CSR practices from CSR‐active supply chain partners when embedded in closed triads. This research shows the need to consider the directionality and closure of relationships in understanding the diffusion of voluntary, ill‐defined, costly operational practices within a supply chain.</jats:p>",

This research: examined the effect of fleet management process on supply chain performance in ADMA International assessed the effect of route planning on supply chain performance in ADMA International and determined the effect of order processing on supply chain performance in ADMA International.  Materials and Methods: Both descriptive survey and correlational research designs were used in this study in order to facilitate the accomplishment of the aforementioned goals. The target population of this project was 141 people that included 21 ADMA International employees working at the head office and 120 customers (suppliers and distributors) of ADMA International that operate in each of the secondary cities in the country including Kigali city. The other cities were: Huye, Musanze, Nyagatare and Rubavu. This study made use of a variety of methods, including surveys, interviews, written records, and other institutional reports, in order to collect research data. SPSS, a software used for descriptive statistics, was used to examine the data in order to determine whether transportation has an impact on supply chain performance of manufacturing industries in Rwanda. In this study, we considered both inferential and regression analyses in order to assess the strength of the link that exists between the study variables.  Results: From the findings, the following were discovered: (Î²1= 0.410, t=2.108, p = 0.013&lt;0.05 Î²2= 0.206, t= 1.779, p =0.017&lt;0.05 Î²2= 0.425, t= 1.214, p =0.011&lt;0.05). This refers to the fact that 1 per cent increase in transportation practices in form of fleet management, route planning and order processing will lead to 0.410, 0.206, 0.425 and 0.558 increase in supply chain performance of ADMA International. Therefore, the regression model showed that supply chain performance was 1.347+ 0.410 Fleet management + 0.206 Route planning + 0.425 Order processing. From these findings, all the hypotheses were rejected. In accordance with the studys conclusions, the researcher suggested that ADMA management be engaged for the supply chain and prerequisite in order to handle the complexity and rising customer expectations. The supply chain processs planning and control should be strengthened by ADMA management. Furthermore, ADMA management ought to keep developing a competitive infrastructure, utilizing global logistics, and matching supply and demand. In summary, the research findings suggest that raw material transportation has an impact on the supply chain of manufacturing businesses at ADMA based on an analysis of the data collected there.  Conclusion: While ADMAs product quality and quantity are important competitive advantages in the market, the research shows that competitive transit times and dependable raw material suppliers that dont require longer than four weeks for delivery, depending on the source, should distinguish the ADMA supply chain. The transportation of raw materials is correlated with the supply chain of manufacturing industries at ADMA, according to research using the Pearson correlation.</jats:p>"

The key goals are to identify and analyse Indofood Agri-palm business’s present sustainable supply chain management practices, as well as determine the potential influence of sustainability practices on overall supply chain performance. Supply Chain Operation Reference theoretical framework was used to map the sustainability of the supply chain processes and operations in the Agri-palm industry. The study examined current supply chain management practices and identified gaps in ideal sustainability standards by employing the Analytic Hierarch Process model. The findings from the study showed significant improvement in sustainability practices over the years. The Indofood Agri-palm business put more effort in sustainable innovation practices such as environmentally aware solutions and practices. Also, there was a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from estate and palm oil mill operations. Additionally, there study identified no traces of child labour along the supply chain of the Indofood Agri-palm industry. This was a result of a robust labour policy which eliminates all forms of child labour across the supply chain. The study recommends the integration and putting more effort into other alternatives that could offer a rounded approach towards fostering sustainability, resilience and innovation. Finally, Indofood-Agri palm business should engage more in afforestation projects outside its jurisdiction as part of its corporate social responsibility to contribute to greenhouse gas reduction in Indonesia as a whole.</jats:p>",

Insufficient water quality data augment risks as conventional monitoring methods lack comprehensive coverage. Technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning offer real-time water quality monitoring and classification. IoT nodes often provide point data insufficient for monitoring the quality of entire water bodies. Remote sensing, though useful, has limitations such as measuring only optically active parameters and being affected by climate and resolution issues. To address these challenges, an unmanned surface vehicle named `AquaDrone' has been developed. AquaDrone traverses water bodies, collecting data of four key parameters (pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, and temperature) along with GPS coordinates. The data is transmitted to a web portal via LoRa communication and Wi-Fi, where visualizations like data tables, trendlines and color-coded heatmaps are generated. A multilayer perceptron classifies water quality into five categories, aiding in real-time classification. A comparative analysis of various oversampling techniques has been conducted in the context of water quality classification. The AquaDrone offers a feasible solution for monitoring quality of small to medium-sized water bodies, crucial for safeguarding public health.</jats:p>",

Each firm's objective is modelled as a weighted sum of its profit and consumer surplus, with the weight on consumer surplus representing the concern level of the firm. We first examine a push supply chain where the manufacturer determines the wholesale price and the retailer determines the order quantity. We derive the optimal decisions and investigate the impact of the firms' consumer surplus consideration on the interactive decisions of the supply chain members and the overall performance of the supply chain. We show that a higher level of retailer's consumer concern does not necessarily lead to higher consumer surplus because her concern on consumers may be exploited by the manufacturer to improve his objective; and the manufacturer's concern on consumers may not benefit the retailer in terms of her profit, especially when the manufacturer's concern level is relatively low. Nevertheless, compared to the for‐profit supply chain, concern on consumer surplus could be beneficial to both firms' profits as well as consumer surplus, inducing a “win‐win‐win” situation under certain conditions. Furthermore, as a social planner, the government seeks to optimize social welfare by adopting subsidy policies, and we examine two types of intervention policies, that is, subsidizing firms and subsidizing consumers. We show that when subsidizing firms, government's quantity‐based subsidy is always more cost‐effective than sales‐based subsidy. As the firms' concern levels become higher or the demand uncertainty becomes lower, subsidizing consumers can achieve higher social welfare than subsidizing firms. Moreover, we examine the impact of the government's budget constraint and concern level on consumer surplus, and extend the analysis to a pull supply chain to show the robustness of the major findings.</jats:p>",

The aim was to overcome the current temperature limitations faced by heat pump technology in industrial heat supply sectors by examining the viability of the reversed Brayton cycle. In particular, the effects of the operating conditions on the cycle performance, such as the waste and return heat temperatures, were analyzed through thermal performance analysis. The reversed Brayton cycle heat pumps showed improved performance over conventional vapor compression cycle heat pumps when a heat supply above 215 °C was required. Furthermore, integrating additional heat exchangers into the cycle configuration was proposed in this study as a method to enhance waste heat utilization and recover unused heat from industrial processes. By incorporating preheating and recuperated cycles, these modifications broaden the operational range under the same operating conditions. They also improve the coefficient of performance (COP) of the reference cycle by up to 23% and 27.4%, respectively. This study explored the potential of reversed Brayton cycle heat pumps to supply heat above 300 °C and provided fundamental guidelines for the efficient design and operation of reversed Brayton cycle heat pumps. The results are expected to enhance our understanding of the performance characteristics of reversed Brayton cycle heat pump technology and expand its use as an alternative to fossil-fuel-based heat supply systems.</jats:p>"

Here, hourly reanalysis climatological data are leveraged to examine historical trends in defined extreme shortage events worldwide. We find uptrends in extreme shortage events regardless of their frequency, duration, and intensity since 1980. For instance, duration of extreme low-reliability events worldwide has increased by 4.1 hours (0.392 hours per year on average) between 1980–2000 and 2001–2022. However, such ascending trends are unevenly distributed worldwide, with a greater variability in low- and middle-latitude developing countries. This uptrend in extreme shortage events is driven by extremely low wind speed and solar radiation, particularly compound wind and solar drought, which however are strongly disproportionated. Only average 12.5% change in compound extremely low wind speed and solar radiation events may give rise to over 30% variability in extreme shortage events, despite a mere average 1.0% change in average wind speed and solar radiation. Our findings underline that wind-solar systems will probably suffer from weakened power security if such uptrends persist in a warmer future.</jats:p>"

By establishing an index system to gauge regional digital trade development levels, the article examines the impact mechanism and spillover effects of digital trade on carbon reduction from both the supply (enterprises) and demand (residents) perspectives. The research results show that: (1) Digital trade can effectively promote regional carbon reduction, with a more pronounced effect in China's central and western regions and lower carbon emissions regions. (2) Digital trade can incentivize green innovation by enterprises and improve residents' consumption behavior, thereby reducing carbon emissions. (3) Digital trade has spillover effect on carbon emissions, and this “neighborhood effect” is greater than the “local effect”. Digital trade provides strong support for carbon reduction and sustainable development and also provides a strategic direction for government policy formulation.</jats:p>"

The impact of process parameters, including applied pressure, temperature, pH, time, and concentration, on flux and Fe removal% is investigated. Results of the permeation test confirm higher permeability for MF membranes (214.71 L/m2.h.bar) than that for NF (2.708 L/m2.h.bar) and UF (56.52 L/m2.h.bar) membranes. The FESEM-EDS characterization confirms the deposition of dominant foulant Fe particles over the membrane surface. At 2 bar applied pressure (temperature = 30 °C, pH = 6.13, and concentration = 6.62 ppm), MF, UF, and NF can eliminate 93.5, 90.2, and 100% Fe, respectively. However, UF and NF exhibit much lower fluxes (72.43 and 3.85 L/m2.h, respectively) compared to MF (317.13 L/m2.h) at the same process conditions. NF eliminates 100% Fe from start to end with rising pressure, while MF (62.16–100) and UF (87.09–100) show gradually improved removal rates. Above pH 6, all membranes demonstrate higher Fe rejection because the oxidation rate of ferrous iron increases at a high pH. With increasing concentration (6–500 ppm), Fe removal efficiency increases for NF (88.26–94.18%) but decreases for both MF (89.63–23.64%) and UF (27.66–14.4%). To validate experimental findings, five machine learning (ML) regression models are scrutinized using various statistical measures.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the effects of different magnesium (Mg) levels (0, 1, 2, and 5 mol Mg plant−1; HMg0, HMg1, HMg2, and HMg5) on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Cuibi No. 1) under HL (1500 μmol m−2 s−1), aiming to understand the role of Mg in mitigating the impact of HL on photosynthesis and carbon–nitrogen metabolism. Plants treated with 1 mol Mg plant−1 under 750 μmol m−2 s−1 light conditions served as the control. HL led to a reduced chlorophyll (Chl) content and inhibited the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax). It also decreased energy involved in photosynthetic electron transfer (ET) and electron flux to reduction end-electron acceptors at the photosystems I (PSI) acceptor side (RE) and caused photosynthetic system damage. H2O2 accumulation exacerbated membrane lipid peroxidation damage, disrupting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and inducing antioxidant enzyme activity. HMg2 increased Chl content, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and the net photosynthetic rate compared to HMg0. It enhanced ET efficiency, PSI and PSII functionality, reduced dissipated energy flux (DI), and minimized photosynthesis damage. Conversely, excessive Mg application (HMg5) decreased Pmax and PSII activity, increasing DI. Adequate Mg supply alleviated HL’s detrimental effects by enhancing Chl content and ET and RE efficiency.</jats:p>"

Here, we use a process‐based morphodynamic model to simulate the estuarine sediment dynamics impacted by turbidity current venting implemented by the Shihmen Reservoir during three typhoon events in 2008. Upon validation with the post‐event bathymetries, the model hindcasts reveal that mud releasing can be effective in mitigating reservoir siltation, yet may be a suboptimal strategy for alleviating coastal sediment deficit. A vast majority of the released muds were delivered through the estuary and exported to offshore by flood advection, wave dispersion, and tidal flushing. The flood‐driven sands, sourced mainly from downstream tributaries, were instead the major contributor to coastal sediment budget. However, mud mantling (covering and immobilizing sand deposits by the reservoir‐released muds) reduced sand availability and thus sand delivery to the coast. For the present case, 25% of the released muds were deposited along the way, presence of these mud covers reduced sand delivery by 15%, compared to a hypothetical scenario of clear‐water flood releases. The relative sand transport deficit is found to increase linearly with the degree of bed mud saturation, 1–<jats:italic>D</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>, with <jats:italic>D</jats:italic>/<jats:italic>R</jats:italic> the ratio of single‐event mud deposit to release. Given broad relevance to global reservoirs encountering the problems of siltation and coastal sediment deficit, our findings highlight that sustainable management needs to look beyond just a bulk amount of sediment, but it is critical to consider how different sediment fractions are interacting and impacted by human activities.</jats:p>",

TPM effectiveness can be done by measuring the OEE value, where the performance of a machine can be said to be optimal if it has an OEE international standard value of &gt; 85%. This paper provides valuable information about the performance of production machines and offers possible solutions to increase their efficiency. Based on the results of data calculations, it is known that the average value of the effectiveness of the Kalix Plastic 501 filling machine at PT. XYZ is 57,05%, meaning that this value is below the standard OEE value. Furthermore, it is known that the losses that cause low OEE values in this study are the result of deceleration loss (23%), setup and adjustment (14,78%), idle and minor stoppages (7,41%), breakdown failure (3,91%), scrap loss (0.24%), and yield loss (0%). The six losses occurred due to human factors such as lack of manpower and not following work instructions, machine factors such as sensor errors, broken filling valves, and procedural factors such as lack of PM schedules and product operations not continuing.</jats:p>"

Sunflower seeds produce oil that can be extracted and used as a raw material in the food, pharmaceutical, bioenergy, and cosmetic industries. The problem is the low availability of superior local seeds, so it must be imported. The impact of imports is the low value-added. Therefore, this study aims to determine and measure the value-added of sunflowers in the upstream and midstream networks. The methods are Hayami and BPS input-output, also aims to identify the effectiveness of these two methods.. The results of value-added on sunflower seeds, cooking oil, herbal oil, and animal feed by the Hayami and the BPS input-output each are IDR6,000 (40%) and IDR24,005,528 (20%), IDR4,900 (26%) and IDR41,377,013 (23%), IDR21,000 (60%) and IDR117,653,333 (38%), IDR3,500 (86%) and IDR23,996,000 (100%). it is better to calculate using the BPS method because it is more detailed and clear in all aspects of the sunflower agroindustry, while using the hayami method only focuses on sales and labor. In the future, this research will be developed by designing sustainability improvement to reduce environmental impacts; performing value-added calculations for derivative products in the downstream supply chain network; also developing a decision support system.</jats:p>",

However, there are still deficiencies in the gas supply system control strategy that plays a crucial role in PEMFCs, which limits the rapid development and application of PEMFCs. This paper provides a comprehensive and in-depth review of the PEMFC air delivery system (ADS) and hydrogen delivery system (HDS) operations. For the ADS, the advantages and disadvantages of the oxygen excess ratio (OER), oxygen pressure, and their decoupling control strategies are systematically described by the following three aspects: single control, hybrid control, and intelligent algorithm control. Additionally, the optimization strategies of the flow field or flow channel for oxygen supply speeds and distribution uniformity are compared and analyzed. For the HDS, a systematic review of hydrogen recirculation control strategies, purge strategies, and hydrogen flow control strategies is conducted. These strategies contribute a lot to improving hydrogen utilization rates. Furthermore, hydrogen supply pressure is summarized from the aspects of hybrid control and intelligent algorithm control. It is hoped to provide guidance or a reference for research on the HDS as well as the ADS control strategy and optimization strategy.</jats:p>"

In order to explore whether the power supply capacity of urban EVCF can meet the charging requirements of NEVs, using the progression of NEVs in Beijing as a basis, initially, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) approach simulates the power demand trajectory for NEVs in the region. Subsequently, to forecast the ownership trends of NEVs across three distinct scenarios from 2021 to 2030, the study employs Grey correlation analysis combined with the bidirectional long short-term memory model (GRA-BiLSTM), facilitating the determination of NEVs’ charging needs. Second, the charging supply of EVCF for the next 10 years is derived by analyzing different development scenarios with three growth rates of EVCF and three combinations of fast and slow pile ratios. The findings indicate a discrepancy between the rate of increase in ownership of NEVs and the rate of increase in charging infrastructure in Beijing between 2021 and 2030. Even under a scenario of high growth in NEV ownership, the balance between supply and demand for charging capacity is not achieved, resulting in suboptimal utilization of charging infrastructure. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An important field of bioenergy development is the use of biomass energy, which requires significant amounts of raw materials grown in the fields. One of the prospective sources of such raw materials is the planting of fast-growing wood species capable of restoring the above-ground part after cutting in a short period of time. The article sets out the task of developing approaches and constructive solutions regarding the possibilities of creating highly productiveaggregates for planting such woody energy crops as willow, poplar, and others that are propagated by cuttings. The analysis of the current state of development of this issue revealed that one of the factors inhibiting the process is the insufficient level of developments and their implementation in the field of automation of the technological process of planting. In most technical solutions, the use of the labor of the planter is included, which makes the process as a whole dependent on human capabilities and other related factors.The work is intended to solve the empirical task of developing an automated planter for plants planted with lignified cuttings.To develop an automated system that would provide uninterrupted and uniform supply of cuttings to the coulter of the planter, a two-factor experiment was conducted on a developed laboratory stand simulating a slotted hopper. As a result of research, it was found that the optimal width of the unloading window of the feeder should be at least 80 mm, and the optimal angles of inclination of the slotted hopper walls should be at least 40°. These parameters will provide complete and continuous unloading of cuttings both in the absence of external forces acting on them (oscillations, vibrations, etc.) and with them. Taking into account the analysis of existing technical solutions and the results of a laboratory experiment, a number of solutions were synthesized, which were used in the development of a new construction of the cuttings unloading mechanism. The developed construction of the mechanism of automated dosing, selection and supply of cuttings for the planter of energy willow is protected by a patent and embodied in a single-row design and tested in field conditions. Such a planting machine allows to plant without the support of a planter, whose functions are reduced to periodically loading the slotted hopper with cuttings previously oriented in one direction. </jats:p>"

By strictly regulating the geographic origin and production methods, the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) not only guarantees the preservation of traditional practices but also safeguards the cultural legacy and identity of the regions where genuine PDO products are produced. However, the very mechanisms safeguarding PDO authenticity can be exploited within globalized food systems, creating opportunities for fraudulent activities and intentional or unintentional adulteration. This study specifically delves into the overarching realm of PDO SCs, using PDO Feta cheese as a prominent case study. Through an assessment of Feta cheese SC in Greece, encompassing the Delphi Technique with the amalgamation of the design stages of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), Vulnerabilities Assessment and Critical Control Point (VACCP), and Threat Assessment and Critical Control Point (TACCP) methodologies, the operations, vulnerabilities, and critical control points are scrutinized. The results indicate multifaceted vulnerabilities and Critical Control Points (CCPs) in the Feta cheese SC that need to be addressed and constitute a precursor for augmenting PDO SCs. Moreover, the utilization of Blockchain Technology (BT) exhibits intrinsic potential for enhancing the administration of supply chains with the potential to fundamentally transform data management practices and foster increased levels of trust among stakeholders.</jats:p>"

The Baoshan Reservoir (BS) and the Baoshan Second Reservoir (BSR) are two major sources of water supply to the HSP. However, the impacts of climate change on the water supply have not been analyzed. In this study, a hydrological model (i.e., SWAT) and an operation model of the BR and the BSR were coupled to assess the climate change impacts on the inflow, outflow, and water storage volume (WSV) of the reservoirs. The simulations were based on the weather data for the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios of AR5 for the Periods of 2021–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2060, and 2081–2100 derived from up to 33 GCMs/EMSs. It is found that more intensified global warming would generally result in more apparent rainfall seasonality that is wetter in the wet season and dryer in the dry season and more magnified seasonality in river flow. During the hotspot period of water shortage in the HSP from February to May, future water scarcity is expected to worsen. Among the 16 combinations of scenarios and Periods, 13 indicate lower WSV in the future compared to the Baseline. The annual mean number of ten-day periods with WSV lower than the operation rule curve ranges from 4.84 to 6.95 ten-day periods, higher than the Baseline of 4.81 ten-day periods. Overall, RCP6.0 has the most significant impact on the study area, with the highest annual economic loss occurring during the 2041-2060 period, reaching USD 1 billion (~2.37% of the 2023 annual production value) for the HSP. This study also provides a three-month cumulative rainfall threshold as an operational warning indicator for the HSP. Our assessment results indicate that future water supply to the HSP should be a serious concern for stabilizing the manufacturing processes and hence the global semiconductor component supply.</jats:p>"

Nowadays, in connection with the difficult situation with energy supply, the implementation of cogeneration technologies using mine methane is becoming of urgent importance. Solving the issue of extracting mine methane as an alternative energy source is of great importance. The article substantiates and develops a method of methane extraction from distant thick layers of sandstone. The idea of the work is to use the laws of forgery and filtration properties of thick layers of sandstone (more than 10 m) distant from the developed layer, which is a gas collector, for the purpose of extraction and further use of methane as an energy resource. The use of the proposed method of methane extraction will allow increasing the safety of cleaning operations, solve the issue of methane utilization and improve the environmental situation in the industrial region. According to the developed method of methane extraction from distant thick layers of sandstone, degassing is performed by underground wells. Capturing the methane-air mixture is carried out using a vacuum pump station, which is located on the main industrial site of the mine. To ensure the company's own production of electricity and thermal energy, a gas-piston cogeneration power plant was chosen. As a fuel, mainline natural gas with an average supply pressure or methane mine gas is used. The basic configuration of the power plant is a gas piston engine with a liquid  cooling system. In order to obtain a gas-air mixture of the required concentration (from 25% to 40%) at the vacuumpump degassing station, a methane concentration increase installation is planned.

However, many studies have found that the relationship between SCMP and OP is not direct and is greatly influenced by some other capabilities such as knowledge management (KM) and innovation capabilities of organizations. Prior research mainly focused on developed countries and suggested numerous models and frameworks to adopt and implement SCMP in various industries. However, the mediating role of KM and innovation capabilities in the linkage between SCMP and OP has not been fully grabbed in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) organizations and especially, Pakistan remained unexplored. This study filled this gap and investigated the mediating role of KM and innovation capabilities in the linkage between SCMP and OP in FMCG organizations of Pakistan. This was carried-out by developing an explanatory model, formulating hypotheses, and testing the hypotheses after gathering sample data from the 194 FMCG organizations of Pakistan and applying PLS based SEM for data analysis. The study revealed many interesting results based on the data from Pakistani FMCG organizations. First, the study exhibited that SCMP positively influences OP in FMCG organizations of Pakistan. Second, the study showed that SCMP positively influences KM and innovation capacities. Third, the study indicated that KM positively affects OP but innovation does not affect OP. Lastly, the study disclosed that KM partially mediates the linkage between SCMP and OP in this context. However, innovation demonstrates no mediating effect in the association between SCMP and OP. The results are vital for theory and practice. Theoretically, the results can be used to develop new and/or update existing theories and frameworks related to SCMP, KM, innovation, and OP. Managers and practitioners can also utilize their scarce resources in limited areas where they should invest their resources, time, and effort for ultimate improvement of OP.

Thus, we analyze the impacts of overall ESG, its three main elements, and each sub elements of ESG on the firm efficiency of 29 suppliers, partners, and customers of Japan Airlines over the period of 2013–2022. First, we employ a two‐stage hierarchical network data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique that assesses the interrelationships and interdependencies among the supply chain players in contributing toward achieving their respective operating and profitability efficiencies. Second, we run ordinary least squares regression analyses with 5000 bootstrap replications and determine that overall ESG and its three main elements are positively linked with firm efficiencies. The sub elements of ESG have different impacts on firm efficiencies. That is, resource use and environmental innovation under the Environmental element and human rights and product responsibility under the Social element show significantly positive associations with firm efficiencies. All Governance sub elements positively affect firm efficiencies. The outcomes of this study will be valuable for managers at Japan Airlines and other policymakers within its supply chain because it highlights the importance of focusing on the three main and sub elements of ESG and employing the accurate firm efficiency measurement method when interrelationships and interdependencies of decision‐making units exist.</jats:p>",

Key findings show that small firms use information sharing, whereas large firms do not, with their suppliers to accelerate innovation efforts in developing supply chain resilience capabilities. This study extends knowledge in the field by providing insights enabling large firms to improve their information sharing efforts to enhance innovation activities.</jats:p>",

A two-phase PSO-type metaheuristic solution tackles the nonlinear, recursive model, efficiently managing inventories and evolving consumer preferences. The model integrates production decisions, inventories, and sales prices, considering scarcity conditions and user preferences. It uses a multinomial logit for the consumers’ demand function with soft exogenous constraints, which influence utility and change consumption preferences and choices.

Elevated K has been associated with high sugar and low acidity in juice. Characterising the accumulation patterns of K and other components in pericarps treated with various experimental factors may indicate potential regulators of berry K levels. A soil fertiliser trial using nutrient solutions with two K supply rates was conducted on potted Shiraz vines during berry ripening. Doubled-K supply increased L-malic acid content in the early-ripening phase, and increased K and magnesium concentrations in the late-ripening phase. Doubled-K supply reduced the ratio of K to sodium in later ripening phases, suggesting that the accumulation of K relative to sodium was limited in more mature berries supplied with extra K. Pericarp water percentage, sugar, K and ATP were correlated in both treatments, indicating links between hydration, solute transport and energy in maturing berries. In a separate rootstock trial over the two growing seasons, Shiraz scions grafted onto 420-A rootstock produced berries with lower K concentration and content than those grafted onto Ramsey or Ruggeri-140 rootstocks and own-rooted vines. This study demonstrated that the K supply and berry ripening phase impacted the berry K level.</jats:p>"

The biggest advantage of using natural gas as a fuel is its high heat capacity and complete combustion without the formation of harmful substances. The process of natural gas distribution in the gas supply network is observed with gas loss. This is an objective, natural situation and creates a number of difficulties for natural gas enterprises. The article focuses on gas consumption in technological processes in the gas supply network, gas purges from pipelines during pipeline repair works, gas flushing out from the pipeline and determination of gas technological losses during the removal of air from the pipeline. Determination of gas losses caused by non-hermeticity of external gas pipelines and equipment, gas pressure regulation station (GPRS), cabinet-type gas control points (GCP), universal pressure regulator (UPR) and gas losses occurring during repairing of other technological equipment are discussed. Also, the determination of technical losses of natural gas at meters, sampling nodes, safety valves, gas distribution stations (GDS) (from gas losses during the management of shut-off valves, during purge of process instrumentation and automatics, when taking gas samples, during purges proses of safety valves, apparatus and pulse lines) is discussed. The article describes the principle of formation of technical losses in the gas supply network. Technical loss sources of natural gas in the process of gas supply, methods of calculating loss norms, the amount of small loss of which is determined separately for each specified loss source, are mentioned.

Methods: finding of equivalent currents of phases of a step-down transformer using the theory of linear electric circuits; statistical methods, including: construction and approximation of external characteristics of regression analysis methods, construction of theoretical and experimental law of distribution of equivalent current of traction load and determination of current quantile for a given confidence probability. Results: advantages and disadvantages of methods of simulation modeling of traction power supply system as applied to determination of parameters of active devices are shown, possibilities of experimental method are given. A detailed description of the conducted experiment is given, connection schemes of measuring devices and vector diagrams of currents and voltages are shown. The main stages of the proposed methodology for selecting the parameters of the booster transformer are outlined. Calculation formulas for determining the equivalent phase currents are presented, the external characteristic for the selected traction substation is constructed. The theoretical and experimental distribution law of the equivalent current of the traction load was constructed and the quantiles of the equivalent current were determined, which amounted to 400 A at a confidence level of 0.968. The maximum required value of volt additive for the selected traction substation and the law of volt additive voltage control for the booster transformer were determined. Practical importance: the proposed methodology of selecting the parameters of active devices of traction power supply system based on the experimental determination of external characteristics of traction substations will allow to determine more accurately the energy performance of booster transformers. It is supposed to improve the methodology by processing the results of synchronous measurements of currents and voltages at neighboring traction substations feeding the inter-substation zone. This will make it possible to expand the possibilities of application of active devices of the traction power supply system and improve the algorithms of booster transformer operation, including taking into account the operation of controlled reactive power compensation devices.</jats:p>",

Methods - analysis and generalization of the legislation of Kazakhstan in the field of agriculture and land reclamation,  Land Code based on data on the number of livestock in dynamics and  share of regions in the overall country indicator.  Results - issues of accessibility of pasture lands for grazing and food supply for animals in the Mangistau region were considered, facts of their death due to dystrophy caused by malnutrition were revealed. According to statistics, in 2022 there were 22.8 thousand heads of cattle, which is 4.2% less than in 2021, about 85.7 thousand heads of camels (increase by 6%), 120.5 thousand heads of horses (increase by 6.3%). Due to desertification and deterioration of pastures, the number of abandoned pastures is increasing.  Conclusions - Innovative approaches are needed to address sustainable land management challenges, implementing strategies such as rotational plot systems that promote restoration of rangelands, allowing vegetation to rest between grazing periods in mountainous and foothill areas, which in turn maintains soil fertility and contributes to conservation of biodiversity. It is also necessary to grow drought-resistant forage desert plants adapted to climate change, this increases the availability of forage crops, balances livestock diets and reduces the load on ecosystems.

The research employs a systematic literature review methodology, sourcing data from peer-reviewed articles published between 2018 and 2023, across databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library. The selection process involved a rigorous screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on works that explicitly discuss the intersection of cybersecurity and sustainability within supply chains. Key findings reveal that cybersecurity and sustainability, while traditionally viewed in isolation, are increasingly recognized as complementary facets of supply chain management. The study highlights the critical role of emerging technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things, in enhancing supply chain resilience and sustainability. Furthermore, stakeholder engagement is identified as crucial in developing effective cybersecurity strategies that align with sustainability goals. The future landscape of cybersecure sustainable supply chains is characterized by both challenges and opportunities, necessitating continuous innovation and collaboration across industries and with governmental bodies. Strategic recommendations for industry leaders and policymakers emphasize the importance of fostering a culture that values cybersecurity and sustainability, investing in technology sharing, and developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity of integrating cybersecurity practices within sustainable supply chain management, offering insights into navigating the complexities of this integration to achieve resilient, transparent, and responsible supply networks.   \r\nKeywords:  Cybersecurity, Supply Chains, Supply Chain Management, Sustainability.</jats:p>"

A brand incentivizes the carbon abatement effort of an upstream supplier through a two‐part contract in the form of a fixed salary and a proportional incentive. We discover that, under some circumstances, the brand may benefit more from the unobservability of supply chain information. The brand bundles the risk of uncertainty with the supplier through the proportional incentive. In classical incentive contracts, only the cost is considered and the positive effect of risk conveyance is often ignored. In our study, the brand needs to investigate a trade‐off between the benefit of risk conveyance and the drawback of the incentive cost. On one hand, the proportional incentive characterizes the incentive cost. The brand increases the incentive intensity due to the unobservable effort of the supplier. On the other hand, it also has a risk conveyance effect. Specifically, the proportional incentive decreases with the correlation coefficient under the cap‐and‐trade policy. Additionally, there are situations in which consumer surplus benefits from the observability of supply chain information.

Given that the leadership structure in supply chains affects the chain members' decision‐making and performance, we study this impact in a two‐period dynamic pricing setting with an upstream manufacturer and a downstream retailer, where the patience degree of consumers is the retailer's private information. We examine two leadership scenarios: retailer dominance and manufacturer dominance. The two members play a signaling game under retailer dominance, whereas the manufacturer can only set its wholesale price based on its prior belief under manufacturer dominance. Our analysis indicates that when consumers are more patient, the retailer tends to share its private information with the manufacturer under retailer dominance to avoid the reduction of its retail margin and enhance its profitability. However, the retailer may keep the consumers' patience information private when the manufacturer dominates the supply chain because the manufacturer will set a compromised wholesale price and passively cede profits to the retailer. Finally, we examine consumer surplus and social welfare. We demonstrate that retailer dominance is the Pareto optimal strategy.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the metabolic pathways involved are yet to be identified. Thus, we aimed to explore the metabolic pathways associated with these positive effects and develop new metabolomics-based hypotheses.  Twelve lactating Holstein cows (primiparous, n = 6; multiparous, n = 6; 42.2 ± 10.6 kg/d milk yield; 83 ± 28 days in milk) were enrolled in two 3×3 replicated Latin squares consisting of 14-day treatment periods: heat stress [HS; max. Temperature Humidity Index (THI) 84, 16.8% crude protein (CP), 1,741 g/d metabolizable protein (MP), 108 Lys, 33 Met, and 37 His (g/d)], pair feeding in thermo-neutrality (TN; max. THI 64, same diet as HS), and HS with increased Lys, Met and His supply [HS+AA; max. THI 84; 17.0% CP, 1,730 g/d MP, 179 Lys, 58 Met, and 45 His (g/d)]. Blood plasma and milk were sampled on day 14 for metabolomics profiling. Several amino acids (AA) and derivatives differed between the treatments. Plasma and milk Met, Val, Trp and α-amino adipic acid concentrations were highest in HS+AA (false discovery rate-P (FDR) &amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, only plasma Lys and milk His were highest in HS+AA (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05). Some phosphatidylcholines (PC) and diglycerides had lower concentrations in HS than TN (FDR &amp;lt; 0.05), while HS+AA had similar concentrations as TN. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the AA-related pathways were more significantly affected in multiparous than in primiparous cows. Our results suggest that increased supply of Met stimulated PC synthesis in HS+AA to similar concentrations as in TN. Increased Lys supply likely elevated the oxidation rate of Lys and downregulated the catabolism of other essential AA (EAA) such as Val and Trp, stimulating milk protein synthesis. No clear associations were found related to His availability. In conclusion, partial amelioration of productive and physiological effects of heat stress associated with increased dietary Met and Lys supply were likely explained by stimulated PC synthesis and increased plasma and milk concentrations of other EEA.</jats:p>"

The conventional evolutionary game method is employed to propose a model called the evolutionary game for the cooperative strategy of both the manufacturer and the seller groups in the supply chain of public goods. Also, white Gaussian noise (WGN) is added to reflect random interference in the evolution process. Then, a stochastic dynamic system is established, and Ito’s differential equation is used to analyze both sides’ strategy evolution in a game, interpret changes in system stability when random disturbance is added, and finally test the influence of different situations on the system stability by running a numerical simulation. The research shows that the stronger the reciprocity coefficient is, and the system is subjected to random interference, the greater the strategy choice change in players’ decision-making procedures when the repeated game of public goods is conducted.</jats:p>"

Accordingly notions about influence of C-containing fuels on greenhouse effect and on warming of environment, the existing tendency of substitution the fossil fuels — generally — and the natural gas — particularly — for methane-hydrogen mixtures is discussed as a controversial point. The problem of advancement the national fuel complexes is under consideration and has been studied with approach based upon the example of Ukrainian pre-war state of economics. An attention has been paid up on reduction of production and consumption of all types of the fossil fuels in the last decades, mainly due lowering the industrial using constituent. An enhancement of fuel using efficiency due improvement of furnace equipment basis provides an successive solution the fuel problems. The thermodynamic background for evaluation the efficiency of fuel using with account of the furnace’s non-ideality has been developed. The problem of “wet combustion” takes of special significance by the reason of weather and climate conditions’ account, on the one hand, and an opportunity to control the efficiency of fuel using, on the other hand, with new combined technique. The contemporary approach consists in combination the direct method of decrease the CO2 emission due exclusion of using the C-containing fuels (firstly — the fossil fuels) and with enhancement the efficiency of using the fossil fuels, for example due erection the recuperative heat recovery facilities with preliminary preheating of combustion air, in some advanced cases by combination with an air, humidification. The perspective ways of provision the decarbonization of environment consists in substitution the fossil fuels (mainly the natural gas NG) for hydrogen or H2-containing gas mixtures. The thermodynamic analysis of relevant technique has been carried out to estimate the opportunities of control the efficiency of hydrogen admixture to NG. Taking into account the variety of technologies of hydrogen production, the engineering method with giving of conditional coloration of hydrogen as a fuel has been considered. The “green” H2 makes the most valuable type of fuel (compared with “blue”, “turquoise”, “yellow”, “rose” colored and especially to the “grey” H2) as a substituting fuel from the standpoint of H2 fitness to process and plant. Particularly for high-temperature melting furnaces a provision of maximum emissivity of flame requires an using of carbon containing fuels to organize thermal pyrolysis of gas and soot formation within the combustion zone.

The problem of clean water availability is caused by limited water sources on the surface. The frequency of rainwater in Selengen Village is very small and with very low intensity. In order to meet the need for clean water, the community has to pay additional costs to buy clean water or wait for a drop from the government. The Selengan Village community has limited information regarding simple methods that can be used to collect clean water sourced from rainwater. The method used to introduce rainwater capture as a source of clean water is to provide direct outreach to the Selengen Village community about rainwater storage in the form of ABSAH (Artificial Aquifer for Rainwater Savings). The ABSAH method can be done individually or in groups. The socialization was carried out at the Panggung Barat Hamlet office involving the community consisting of farmer groups, community leaders, youth organizations and housewives. The result of the socialization regarding the introduction of artificial rainwater aquifers is the high desire of the community to create rainwater storage, either independently/individually or in groups. In the process of making it, the community hopes to get assistance from the implementation team so that the calculation of the storage volume is in accordance with the volume of water used. Apart from that, the community also hopes to be given drawings of storage designs, installations for collecting water from the roofs of houses and designs of distribution networks to people's homes.</jats:p>"

This research proposes the recovery of Zn from the Milluni lagoons, an important water supply for Bolivia, where high concentrations of Zn have been identified that exceed permitted limits, exposing a risk to health and ecosystems. The application of reverse osmosis (RO), operated with low pressures, is proposed as a first stage for the concentration of Zn and subsequent recovery of this metal through chemical precipitation. The aim was to maintain the separation efficiency of the RO operated at low pressures without presenting operational problems. As a result, 98.83% metal concentration was achieved with a laboratory-scale pilot system. The above means an important potential for large-scale Zn concentration, apart from orienting the RO toward sustainability by working with low pressures that reduce energy costs during its operation. This study can be used as a valuable reference for the advancement of sustainable technologies in the field of water treatment that simultaneously allow the recovery of resources to promote a circular economy. Finally, this study exposes an alternative for regions with heavy metal water contamination in Bolivia and worldwide.</jats:p>"

The expected effect during the approbation of the apparatus is predicted under the condition of eliminating high-temperature intermediate coolants (hot air, etc.) due to the use of a film-like resistive electronic heater of the radiating type. The temperature field is established, which confirms the uniformity of the temperature effect on meat and vegetable products, and a slight deviation within the limits of autonomous exhaust fans is not critical and within the permissible error. Also, the introduction of Peltier elements into the design of the rotary apparatus will allow converting thermal energy into a low-voltage supply voltage (3–6 W) and, already at 20 °C, ensure autonomous operation of fans. The obtained results in the form of practical implementation of the developed apparatus will allow to implement low-temperature processing of meat and vegetable products. This allows to maximally preserve the functional properties of meat raw materials and the physiological properties of vegetable semi-finished products with a high degree of readiness.\nThe practical implementation of the universal low-temperature rotary apparatus from the side of constructive implementation due to the use of functional containers makes it possible to obtain a wide range of assortment of meat products, both in the shell and without the shell.

However, it was found that the application of existing optimization techniques has limitations. Therefore, as an alternative method, a minimum hydraulic gradient method based on physical theory was introduced to establish a sequential pipes removal algorithm.Results and Discussion:The excellence and the effectiveness of this program were proven through the existing pipe network and optimal path analysis using the EPANET2 input file of the test-bed Y_area. According to the results of the optimal path analysis, in the case of the Y_ area pipe network, 66 pipes and 6,465 m pipe length were analyzed to be possible for removal or maintenance, which was found to be 18.3% of the total pipe length.Conclusion:According to the results of the optimal pipe network analysis derived by the minimum hydraulic gradient method, there was little change in the minimum pressure head, and it was evaluated that there was no effect on water supply from a hydraulic perspective. In particular, in terms of water quality, the minimum residual chlorine concentration was found to increase by 0.011 mg/L due to a decrease in residence time and pipe length, which was analyzed to improve water quality.</jats:p>"

This research constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes core enterprises as employers, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as contractors, and banks as financial institutions, where they have been simulated for their impact on blockchain technology, especially on the strategic choices of supply-chain financing behavior and the system’s evolutionary path under core enterprises’ guarantee mechanism. The findings show the application of blockchain technology can effectively reduce the regulatory and review costs for financial institutions, thereby enhancing the efficiency of supply-chain financing. Particularly, blockchain technology provides a more reliable credit endorsement platform for SMEs in reducing their tendency to default. The guarantee mechanism of core enterprises is more effective with the support of blockchain technology, which helps to build more solid supply-chain financial cooperation relationships. The research contributes to the theoretical research on the integration of blockchain technology into supply-chain finance, especially for improving the operational efficiency of financial services. It also highlights the need for blockchain-backed guarantees from core enterprises in optimizing supply-chain financial services.</jats:p>"

On the based of Pukhov's differential transformations, differential mathematical models are proposed for determining, in analytical form, the state probabilities of graph nodes. Based on the minimax principle, methods have been developed to determine the optimal cyber security strategy, which allows to achieve the specified security indicators.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The development of water resources in Nigeria has not risen alongside population increase. Although groundwater is the available source of water at all locations in Nigeria, groundwater aquifer is becoming deeper due to increased groundwater harvest, especially in urban areas. There is a need for continuous groundwater modelling using geological, climatic, environmental data, and spatial tools especially under climate change and intense landcover conversions. The Spatial Multi-Criteria Analysis (SMCA) was adopted in this study to model the current groundwater potential in Nigeria. The multi-criteria analysis tool in ArcGIS was explored to overlay the nine factor maps to model historic and futuristic groundwater potentials. Our groundwater factor maps show an interesting pattern across Nigeria, the southern parts show more potential considering suitability factors like; surface water density, rainfall, temperature, soil, land cover and elevation in the region. Whereas the upland regions even with higher rainfall and lower temperatures suitable for groundwater recharge, are disadvantaged by geomorphological factors. Northern part of Nigeria shows high potentials, considering the geology, soil, lineament density and slope, but disadvantaged by other factors like lower rainfall and higher temperatures. This informed the final groundwater potential maps; results for the historic potential revealed that, no location in Nigeria has optimal (9–10), very poor or no (1–2) groundwater potential. The results further revealed that areas with higher groundwater potentials are largely within the corridors of major rivers in Nigeria (Niger and Benue), covering about 17.6% of the Nigerian landmass, while 2.6%, 33.7, 44% and 2.2% are occupy areas with very low, low, moderate and very high groundwater potentials respectively. Further analysis highlighs locations of concern due to climatic and environmental changes. Interestingly, our groundwater projection results show a persistent increase in groundwater potential from 2021 to 2100 if current landuses and environmental factors are maintained, and if the projected increase in rainfall is true. Despite these groundwater potentials, the recent issues of shallow aquifers have been cautioned by scientists, especially due to groundwater uncertainties in Nigeria especially with intense landcover conversions, combined with accelerated water demands due to increase in population, and incessant groundwater extractions. Therefore, there is a need to seek caution in the pattern of unregulated and incessant groundwater harvest in Nigeria and we recommend frequent updates of the groundwater potential using geospatial tools to inform governing policies on a centralised consolidated sustainable water supply in Nigeria.</jats:p>",

Understanding future water supply–demand dynamics and underlying mechanisms is crucial for water resource sustainability. This study presents a framework for analyzing water supply–demand dynamics and their driving mechanisms under future land use/land cover (LULC) changes in China's Han River (HR) Basin using PLUS, InVEST, and geographic detector models. Results show precipitation increased slowly (0.64) from 2000 to 2020, while potential evapotranspiration slightly decreased (−0.02). By 2030, under the scenarios of the natural increase scenario (NIS), economic development scenario (EDS), and ecological protection scenario (EPS), significant changes are projected in forest, cropland, and construction land. The future impact of LULC on water supply is concentrated between 0.17 and 0.45%, while its effect on water demand is significant, approximately 10%. The water security index (WSI) in the HR Basin gradually declined from 0.118 to 0.078. Particularly in the EPS scenario, WSI improves (0.103). In the future, LULC will increasingly influence water yield in conjunction with other factors, but excessive precipitation will dampen the impact of other factors on water yield. This study enhances understanding of water resource balance evolution, enabling sustainable LULC development for ecological conservation and economic coordination.</jats:p>",

During extreme weather events, the output from wind and photovoltaic sources is typically reduced. In light of this, this paper proposes a two-stage operational strategy for energy storage, under scenarios of extreme-heat-with-low-wind-speed, in power systems. Firstly, historical data on wind and solar power, along with weather characteristics, are collected to analyze the power output during multi-day periods of extreme heat and low wind speed. Then, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to generate multi-day load curves with inherent uncertainties, based on regional load characteristics of the power system. Finally, a two-stage operation strategy for energy storage charging and discharging is established. In the first stage, normal operations are conducted to identify periods of power shortage across various types of loads. In the second stage, based on the identified moments of power shortage from the first stage, charging and discharging constraints are applied to the energy storage systems. The feasibility and effectiveness of this two-stage operational strategy are then validated through simulations, using historical data to generate scenarios of multi-day extreme-heat-and-low-wind-speed conditions.</jats:p>"

Although photothermal therapy (PTT) has extremely high therapeutic efficiency, the crafty tumor cells allow an increase in the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) to limit its effect, and PTT‐induced inflammation is also thought to be a potential trigger for tumor metastasis. Herein, myricetin, iron ions, and polyvinylpyrrolidone were utilized to develop nanomedicines by self‐assembly strategy for the treatment of metastatic TNBC. The nanomedicines with marvelous water solubility and dispersion can inhibit glucose transporter 1 and interfere with mitochondrial function to block the energy supply of tumor cells, achieving starvation therapy on TNBC cells. Nanomedicines with excellent photothermal conversion properties allow down‐regulating the expression of HSPs to enhance the effect of PTT. Interestingly, the broad spectrum of ROS scavenging ability of nanomedicines successfully attenuates PTT‐induced inflammation as well as influences hypoxia‐inducible factors‐1α/3‐phosphoinositide‐dependent protein kinase 1 related pathway through glycometabolism inhibition to reduce tumor cell metastasis. Moreover, the nanomedicines have negligible side effects and good clinical application prospects, which provides a valuable paradigm for the treatment of metastatic TNBC through glycometabolism interference, anti‐inflammation, starvation, and photothermal synergistic therapy.</jats:p>",

Thus, we used the classical tools of non-linear dynamics (Lyapunov Maximum Exponent, bifurcation diagrams, phase maps, and Poincaré maps) that corroborated to determine the regions of chaos. However, to produce energy, the chaotic behavior makes the production of unpredictable electric current that compromises the operation of the device. Therefore, we apply two control techniques to suppress the chaotic behavior for a desired periodic orbit. The first is the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) which considers the non-linearities of the system and Optimal Linear Feedback Control (OLFC) which employs a linear methodology to control the device. The results were promising due to the trajectory errors between the controllers that show that chaos was suppressed, and the current produced by the system became periodic.</jats:p>",

The following scientific methods were used in the research process to achieve the set goal: scientific abstraction, deduction and induction – to formulate a scientific hypothesis of the work, laws and principles; formal logic – when determining the specifics of the implementation of production and economic activity of farms of all categories in the conditions of the introduction of martial law; abstract and logical – for making theoretical generalizations, formulating conclusions; monographic analysis – for a detailed study of the factors that reflect the peculiarities of the production of agricultural products in the conditions of military aggression of Russia against Ukraine.\nFindings. An evaluation of the production of agricultural products in the context of providing the population with food products in the conditions of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine was carried out.\nThe main factors that influenced the production of the main products of plant and animal husbandry at the agricultural enterprises and households were determined.\nIt has been established that the effective and permanent activity of agricultural agro-formations, which work on the basis of market relations and private ownership, must take into account new requirements for the producer and his strategy of competitive development in modern economic conditions of management.\nOriginality. Proposals for solving the problem of food supply of the population with domestically produced food products, which involve the introduction of innovative technologies, which should ensure acceptable volumes and quality of agricultural products, are substantiated. The prospects for the transition to sustainable development of agricultural production will primarily determine the possibilities of using the advantages of its diversification both in terms of the product structure and increasing its share that is in demand not only on the global, but also on the domestic agricultural market.\nPractical value. The proposed recommendations can be used in the development of programs for the development of rural areas in terms of the development of agricultural production and food supply of regions.\nKey words: food supply, agricultural production, households, agricultural enterprises, relocation, diversification.</jats:p>",

It specifically studies how government support can moderate this relationship. The pandemic's unprecedented disruptions have emphasised the vital need for resilient supply chains to guarantee ongoing operations and achieve sustainability goals. This study employs a quantitative approach to investigate the influence of effective SCM on the long-term viability of companies. Survey questions were distributed to a total of 488 respondents, consisting of upper-level employees of manufacturing companies in Malaysia. The study has employed a stratified random sampling process. The study utilise data from 197 manufacturing enterprises in Malaysia, which is examined using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings suggest that organisations with robust and flexible supply networks were more capable of sustaining their operations and attaining their sustainability objectives. Contrary to expectations, the data indicate that government support did not have a moderating effect on the connection between VSCM practices and corporate sustainability. To improve sustainability and ensure operational continuity during times of crisis, the report emphasises the importance of investing in and cultivating resilient supply chain procedures for industry professionals. The findings indicate that governments should reevaluate the processes and effectiveness of government support given to companies during disruptive events. This calls for a more nuanced approach to the development and execution of policies.</jats:p>"

Under this background, we study the recycling decision and corporate social responsibility (CSR) implementation for closed‐loop supply chains (CLSC) considering green design under EPR policy. We build game models of CLSC under six situations, and analyze the interaction between the manufacturer's green design behavior and the retailer's CSR behavior, along with their influence on recycling decisions and the operational performance of CLSC. We show that both the manufacturer's green design behavior and the retailer's CSR behavior are beneficial to improving social welfare and the other party's profits, but a higher level of green design is uneconomical for the manufacturer. Similarly, a higher CSR awareness is not conducive to retailer's profitability. We also find that under the influence of the government's “Tax‐Reduction‐Subsidy” policy, the selection of the optimal recycling channel is influenced by factors such as the difficulty of recycling waste products, government subsidies, and the profit of unit reprocesses from the perspective of maximizing supply chain member's profits.</jats:p>",

They have been used to insulate kilns, furnaces, and other hot enclosures for thousands of years. Firebricks are refractory bricks that can, with one composition, store heat, and with another, insulate the firebricks that store the heat. Because firebricks are made from common materials, the cost per kilowatt-hour-thermal of a firebrick storage system is less than one-tenth the cost per kilowatt-hour-electricity of a battery system. It has thus been hypothesized that using excess renewable electricity to produce and store industrial process heat in firebricks can provide a low-cost source of continuous heat for industry. Here, it is hypothesized further that, upon a transition to 100% clean, renewable energy worldwide, using firebricks to store industrial process heat can reduce electricity generator, electricity storage, and low-temperature heat storage needs, thereby reducing overall energy cost. Both hypotheses are tested across 149 countries combined into 29 world regions. Results suggest, relative to a base case with no firebricks, using firebricks may reduce, among all 149 countries, 2050 battery capacity by ∼14.5%, annual hydrogen production for grid electricity by ∼31%, underground low-temperature heat storage capacity by ∼27.3%; onshore wind nameplate capacity by ∼1.2%, land needs by ∼0.4%, and overall annual energy cost by ∼1.8%. In sum, the use of firebricks for storing industrial process heat appears to be a remarkable tool in reducing the cost of transitioning to clean, renewable energy across all energy sectors.</jats:p>",

It is significant because Iranian factories are not efficient from this point of view and produce a considerable amount of waste. For this purpose, the mixed methodology has been employed. In the qualitative part, 15 enablers are identified by using the meta‐synthesis method, which are categorized into four economic, human resources, organizational‐managerial, and infrastructure dimensions. In the quantitative stage, the cause‐and‐effect relationship between enablers is identified by using the Fuzzy DEMATEL method, and forward and backward scenarios are formulated using fuzzy cognitive map technique. While the research practical contributions include identification of key enablers in implementing circular supply chain management 4.0, formulation of forward and backward scenarios to guide strategic decision‐making in sustainable practices, and offering actionable insights for waste reduction and resource optimization in the glass industry leading to improved operational efficiency, it has theoretical contributions such as highlighting the significance of specific enablers in the successful implementation of circular supply chain management 4.0, demonstrating the interplay between different enablers and their impact on key aspects, and advancing knowledge on sustainable practices within the context of the glass industry, contributing to environmental sustainability and operational excellence in Iranian factories.</jats:p>",

The results indicate that the infiltration volume of rainwater is 0.6, 79.7, 36.5, 62, and 10,000 m3 under different design schemes. COMSOL software is employed to simulate the infiltration situation of rainwater under different schemes, and the scheme with the most favourable infiltration effect is identified. The simulation results indicate that scenarios 2, 4, and 5 demonstrate superior early-stage infiltration performance. Ultimately, the optimal infiltration scheme is selected by integrating the infiltration volume, infiltration effect, construction, economic, and ecological factors to achieve the objective of enhancing rainwater harvesting and utilization. This study offers effective and reasonable measures for addressing the challenge of water resources management in arid regions. It provides suitable reference schemes for river channel rainwater storage projects and offers innovative approaches to rainwater resource utilization, thereby contributing to the alleviation of water scarcity in arid areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>After signing the Association Agreement between the European Union and its Member States [47], Ukraine undertook a number of commitments, including the progressive alignment of its legislation with the European Union acquis. This includes the strengthening of economic and trade relations with a view to Ukraine’s gradual integration into the European Union internal market through the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area, including intangible goods such as digital content. In May 2019, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a new legislative act in the field of digital content distribution – Directive 2019/770 on contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services, which entered into force for European Union member states on July 1, 2021. The process of implementation of the Directive provisions involves recodification of the member states’ national civil legislation. This underlines the importance of studying the provisions of this regulatory act in the context of the Ukrainian legislation adaptation. Therefore, the study of the possible implementation of the provisions of this Directive, in particular of the perspective of determining the parties’ obligations in contracts for the supply of digital content into the national legal system of Ukraine, is of great importance.  The purpose of this study is to clarify the content of the obligations of the parties in contracts for the supply of digital content, to examine the possibility of application current national legislation to regulate relations for the supply of digital content, and to develop regulatory provisions for the improvement of Ukrainian legislation in accordance with the provisions of European Union law.  In the course of this research, the following general scientific and special legal methods have been applied: the method of legal analysis, the method of comparative law and modeling, the system-functional method, the method of analysis and synthesis, and the method of generalization.  The article substantiates the need to establish a digital content supply contract in the Civil Code of Ukraine as a separate type of named contract with its own subject matter and other essential conditions. The authors demonstrate the ineffectiveness of applying the rules of sale of goods, service, and lease contracts to legal relations with digital content. The authors substantiate the appropriateness of the imposition of additional information obligations on the provider of digital content in contracts with consumers. Within the framework of the conducted research, the authors identify the obligations of the supplier of the digital content, including:  a) to deliver the digital content; b) to transfer the ownership of the physical data carrier on which the digital content is stored in favor of the recipient; c) to ensure that the digital content complies with the terms of the contract; d) to ensure the possibility of using the digital content in accordance with the terms of the contract; e) to transfer the necessary documents to the recipient together with the digital content. The article proves that the recipient’s obligations under a contract for the supply of digital content are as follows:  a) to pay the contract price (unless the terms of the contract provide for the fulfillment of another counter-obligation, including the provision of personal data usage, or provide for the supply of digital content on a gratuitous basis); b) to accept the digital content together with the necessary supporting and authorization documents; c) to take the necessary measures to ensure the use of the digital content.</jats:p>",

The research results show that the 750 V DC traction system uses a rigid overhead conductor rail system (ROCS) with distances between traction power stations of up to 6 km with double feeding. The system provides a service frequency of 36 trains per hour per direction, and has a transport capacity of up to 47,520 passengers per hour per direction. The implementation of this solution, as proposed, has the potential to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, reduce environmental pollution, and provide a complete and modern urban railway network for HCMC. The system could also be implemented in other similar global scenarios. Additionally, this investigation also demonstrates the feasibility of applying the new ROCS to medium-capacity railway systems (MCSs), which have garnered increasing attention in recent years owing to their discernible advantages over extant systems. The outcomes of this study underscore the pragmatic nature of the proposed solution, which orients sustainable and integrated development in the realm of urban rail transport.</jats:p>"

Soil microbes improve soil fertility by regulating soil organic matter production, plant nutrient accumulation, and pollutant transformation. Addressing the impact of Cd toxicity on soil fungal community composition, soil health, and rice yield is urgently required for sustainable rice production. Vermicompost (VC) is an organic fertilizer that alleviates the toxic effects of Cd on soil microbial biodiversity and functionality and improves crop productivity sustainably. In the present study, we examined the effects of different doses of VC (i.e., 0, 3, and 6 tons ha−1) and levels of Cd stress (i.e., 0 and 25 mg Cd kg−1) on soil biochemical attributes, soil fungal community composition, and fragrant-rice grain yield. The results showed that the Cd toxicity significantly reduced soil fertility, eukaryotic microbial community composition and rice grain yield. However, the VC addition alleviated the Cd toxicity and significantly improved the soil fungal community; additionally, it enhanced the relative abundance of Ascomycota, Chlorophyta, Ciliophora, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycta in Cd-contaminated soils. Moreover, the VC addition enhanced the soil’s chemical attributes, including soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (AN), total nitrogen (TN), and microbial biomass C and N, compared to non-VC treated soil under Cd toxicity conditions. Similarly, the VC application significantly increased rice grain yield and decreased the Cd uptake in rice. One possible explanation for the reduced Cd uptake in plants is that VC amendments influence the soil’s biological properties, which ultimately reduces soil Cd bioavailability and subsequently influences the Cd uptake and accumulation in rice plants. RDA analysis determined that the leading fungal species were highly related to soil environmental attributes and microbial biomass C and N production. However, the relative abundance levels of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycta were strongly associated with soil environmental variables. Thus, the outcomes of this study reveal that the use of VC in Cd-contaminated soils could be useful for sustainable rice production and safe utilization of Cd-polluted soil.</jats:p>"

The strategic recycling of rare earth resources serves the dual purpose of alleviating supply shortages and aligning with the global quest for carbon reduction and environmental preservation. This study establishes a second-level, closed-loop supply chain that includes a rare earth group (REG) that synergizes rare earth mining and smelting companies with rare earth material manufacturing companies, as well as a specialized rare earth recycler. The study considers three different recycling scenarios: the recycler only recycles oil sludge scrap (S1), the recycler only recycles end-of-life products (S2), and the recycler both recycles oil sludge scrap and end-of-life products (S3). In addition, the study examines the impact of government subsidies, carbon trading mechanisms, and corporate research and development (R&amp;D) initiatives on closed-loop supply chains. The findings are summarized below. (1) Rare earth recycling does not impact the rare earth market downstream. (2) The profits of both REG and the recycler have a positive correlation with the quantity of recycling. However, recycling sludge waste can generate higher revenues for the recycler compared to recycling end-of-life products. (3) Government subsidies exert a positive effect on the recycler’s profits and the production of secondary rare earths. However, the REG redirects a segment of the recycler’s profits in its direction. Elevated carbon trading prices encroach upon the REG’s profitability, prompting increased procurement of secondary supply rare earths. (4) The benefits of increasing rare earth recycling rates outweigh government subsidies and carbon trading valuations in the supply chain. Therefore, enterprise-focused research and development initiatives play a critical role in improving the efficiency of the closed-loop rare earth supply chain.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of renewable energy by converting it into heat is an important form of storing energy in a usable form and improving the energy supply flexibility; therefore, the electricity–heating system (EHS) can cope with load fluctuations. However, relevant research is lacking on improving the energy supply limitations by the optimal dispatch of energy flow at the typical EHS, such as the coupled CHP–heat pump–thermal storage system (CCHTS). Based on the study of the energy supply characteristics of the CCHTS for extending the energy supply limitation, this study develops an optimal dispatch method using a heat pump (HP) and the thermal storage (TS) of heating networks to improve the flexibility of the CCHTS and the accommodation capacity of renewable energy. The maximum and minimum energy supply limitation model of the CCHTS and the output power characteristic model are established. Based on the piecewise power supply constraint, the energy flow of the EHS is optimized by using the quadratic programming algorithm. The CCHTS can significantly improve the energy supply flexibility; both coupled combined heat and power (CHP) + HP and coupled CHP + TS can improve the power supply flexibility, but the enhanced effect of CHP + HP is better than that of CHP + TS. An increase of 7.6% in wind power consumption is achieved. The consumption of renewable energy increases by 17.9% in the energy flow optimization results.</jats:p>"

This paper takes Tesla’s new energy automotive supply chain network as an example to study the impact of cascade failure on the destructive resistance of the automotive supply chain network. From the analysis of the identification results, it is found that the key nodes in the automobile supply chain network with strong influence on risk propagation are mostly charging pile enterprises, motor enterprises, and electronic control enterprises at the core, such as Hengdian Electromagnetics, Wanma Stocks, etc. Meanwhile, Changxin Science and Technology, as a central control panel manufacturer with a large number of indirect suppliers, is also in the top position. Through the proposed key node identification method, it has good practical application value for preventing risk transmission in the automotive supply chain.</jats:p>"

Thus, there will be a need to increase food production to keep pace with the population increase.\r\nGoal and Objectives: This study seeks to analyse the interplay between population growth and land productivity changes in Nigeria as a pathway towards achieving sustainable food supply by 2030 and beyond, in line with Goal 2 of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which is aimed at “ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.\r\nMethodology: Data on land productivity and Nigeria's population and Population growth for 1961-2022 was sourced from the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (ERS-USDA, 2023). The data was analysed using descriptive statistics such as mean; standard errors and graphs; the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) was used to explain the interplay between population growth and land productivity changes in Nigeria.\r\nResults: The results of the population estimates revealed that the model successfully converged and significantly (p&lt;0) explained 98.3% of the variance of the endogenous variable that is, the population at an intercept of -2500.7. Of the hypothesized variables, year (1.212), cropland (9.14E-4), irrigated (0.283), and pasture (0.003). These findings imply that the future population would increase in each period until the series becomes explosive because, the coefficient of the lagged variable of population is positive and greater than 1, which is in contrast with the assumptions of the ARIMA model which should be less than 1. Thus, the study recommends adopting precision agriculture techniques such as GPS mapping, soil analysis, crop health monitoring, and automated irrigation to maximize crop yields, reduce costs, and transform farming practices in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The publication examines the influence of regional manifestations of the deterioration of natural conditions (moisture supply and unfavorable thermal parameters) on agricultural management. Global climate changes are superimposed by regional manifestations of adverse processes, such as the emission of greenhouse gases generated by an unbalanced land structure, in which we observe an excessive share of arable land. Excessive plowing of the territory leads to increased production of greenhouse gases by arable land, which complicates the manifestation of the greenhouse effect at the local level. Data on the structure of land plots of Ternopil region and Borsukiv territorial community are given.\r\nAttention is drawn to the map scheme of changes in the moisture supply of the territory of Ukraine, according to which a very wet climatic annual balance will be preserved only in the mountainous part of the Carpathians, Ternopil region will go from wet to insufficiently wet in its southeastern part, and over time, according to the forecast of 2100, to an insufficiently wet balance in the greater its territory At the same time, about 55% of the southeastern regions are threatened by dry and very dry climatic annual balance. According to the authors, the search for ways to solve the problem can be found in the optimization of land use. The algorithm of the optimization model is prescribed in the methodology of Professor Mykhailo Grodzynskii and consists in determining and ranking the development priorities of the research area and achieving a scientifically justified ratio between natural and anthropogenic land areas. Based on the materials of the Borsukiv territorial community, an optimization model of land use was created, according to which it is proposed to reduce the share of arable land from 65% to 45% due to the removal of heavily eroded and poorly productive lands from the arable wedge and their transfer to liming and afforestation, the share of which in the land use structure of the territorial community increased respectively 21% and 23%. Such optimization measures will ensure the transition from the emission of greenhouse gases by land to their assimilation by forest and meadow vegetation. Increasing the share of forests by 14% will contribute to a 5% increase in precipitation of local origin, which is especially important for stabilizing the water balance of the territory. An increase in the share of natural vegetation will contribute to the maintenance of ecological balance, restoration of biotic and landscape diversity, improved water balance, and natural living conditions of the population.Increasing or stabilizing the degree of humidification of territories under the conditions of global and regional climate changes is becoming an important scientific and applied problem, the solution of which requires the development and implementation of strategic tasks of sustainable development at the levels of regional, administrative and district territorial entities, the level of territorial communities, Starosty districts. Taking into account the priority criteria for the development of territorial entities is the first stage of optimizing the use of nature in these administrative-territorial entities. The second stage of the landscape and ecological optimization of territories is the substantiation of the ratio of natural and anthropogenic lands. Land optimization will contribute to tireless use of nature and the balancing of basic natural processes with anthropogenic ones. In the future, we envisage the creation of optimization models of land use for all territorial communities of the region, which will optimize the development of natural and economic systems.\r\nKeywords: regional manifestations of climatic conditions, land use structure, optimization, territorial community.\r\n \r\n </jats:p>"

It introduces a comprehensive many-objective optimization model designed to minimize holding costs, energy consumption, and shortage risk concurrently, thereby integrating sustainability considerations into inventory management. The model incorporates the distinct energy consumption profiles associated with various storage types and evaluates the influence of stock levels on energy usage. Through an examination of a 60-day production schedule, the dynamic relationship between inventory levels and operational objectives is investigated, revealing a well-defined set of optimal solutions that highlight the trade-off between energy savings and shortage risk. Employing a 30-day rolling forward analysis with daily optimization provides insights into the evolving nature of inventory optimization. Additionally, the model is extended to encompass a five-objective optimization by decomposing shortage risk, offering a nuanced comprehension of inventory risks. The outcomes of this research provide a range of optimal solutions, empowering supply chain managers to make informed decisions that strike a balance among cost, energy efficiency, and supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

Simulations were conducted using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with aluminum alloy 6061-T4, type-E fiberglass, and type-S fiberglass as materials. These materials were selected based on their stress properties, mass, and cost. The simulation indicated that the side impact test produced the highest stress levels, especially in the fiberglass materials. While the aluminum alloy exhibited higher von Mises stress than its tensile strength in one case, both types of fiberglass maintained safety as their tensile strengths exceeded the maximum von Mises stress. The pole side impact test showed aluminum's highest stress and deformation, whereas fiberglass materials showed higher stress and deformation in the side impact test. The door slam test demonstrated minimal stress and deformation across all materials. Among the three, type-E fiberglass demonstrated the most favorable and safest performance. Consequently, type-E fiberglass is highly recommended as the ideal material for the car prototype's door.</jats:p>"

This study analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of supply–demand of ESs and comprehensive urbanization level (CUL) in Shaanxi Province from 2010 to 2019 and assessed the coupling relationship between ecosystem service supply–demand ratio (ESSDR) and CUL using the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model. Random forests and geographically weighted regression methods were utilized to characterize the contribution and spatial distribution of the drivers of CCD. The results showed that: (1) except for habitat quality, the ESSDR of the other three types of services as well as the comprehensive services showed a decreasing trend, CUL exhibited increasing trend; (2) Although CCD was generally increasing, a significant portion (78.51%) of regions still remained uncoordinated, with relatively better coordination shown around the Guanzhong urban agglomeration, which has a higher urbanization level; (3) The CCD in Shaanxi Province was primarily influenced by local financial income, the secondary industry, and temperature forces. In regions with high and increasing CCD, the tertiary industry was the decisive force. In other areas, there were significant spatial variations in the driving forces. These findings provide a coupled and coordinated perspective for urban ecological management, which can provide scientific reference and practical guidance for cities with different development modes.</jats:p>"

This paper takes the quality level as a decision variable, considers both the consumer demand and the recovery of imperfect products in a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain (CLSC), and studies the significance of a revenue-sharing contract for coordination. The results show that the relationship between the optimal price and the quality level is affected by the repair cost of imperfect products and that the consumer’s attention to price and quality affects the trend of the overall profit with the quality level. In some cases, simply improving the quality level cannot expand the demand and is not even conducive to the improvement of green supply chain profits. It is also found that in both centralized and decentralized scenarios, coordination contracts can effectively motivate retailers to collect waste and help improve the economic efficiency of green supply chains.</jats:p>"

Although its importance, the knowledge of how to shape SCEL is limited. Based on signaling theory, we explore that the mechanism and boundary conditions of green intellectual capital (GIC) shape SCEL via ambidextrous environmental strategy and the moderating role of supply chain trust. Using 317 survey data from Chinese manufacturers, we conducted the hierarchical regression analysis to test the hypotheses. Our results reveal that both green human capital and green relational capital have direct and indirect impacts on SCEL, while green structural capital only contributes to SCEL via ambidextrous environmental strategy. Moreover, when the degree of supply chain trust increases, the effect of ambidextrous environmental strategy on SCEL becomes stronger. This research contributes to the supply chain leadership and environmental strategy literature and provides novel insights into better understanding the mechanisms of shaping SCEL. Managers would do better to shape SCEL by sending reliable signals of GIC and ambidextrous environmental strategy.</jats:p>",

They are due to the fact that the process of preparing the product occurs in a dynamic mode: heating to a boil, cooking and cooling. These cycles are repeated with each new boiler loading. The main indicator of the efficiency of a boiler is its efficiency factor (COP). Two options for determining efficiency: calculated and experimental are considered. It is indicated that in the calculation method for determining efficiency, its value is significantly influenced by the specific heat capacity of the feed (product), which can vary over a wide range depending on the composition. It has been established that the accuracy of the calculation is significantly influenced by various heat losses for heating metal structures, for purging the steam jacket during the initial period of boiler operation, heat removed from the boiler body into the environment, energy losses with gases escaping into the atmosphere, determined by formulas in which various coefficients vary over a wide range. A more accurate method for determining efficiency is proposed - experimental. The total gas consumption for heating the product to a boil in automatic and manual modes, the gas consumption for compensating for heat losses and maintaining a quiet boil was determined separately by experimental studies. The useful energy component for heating the product to a boil was determined based on the results of experimental studies. The efficiency when the boiler operates in various modes is determined from experimentally obtained data on the total gas consumption and useful gas consumption.</jats:p>",

One V2G charger is used for two vehicles. The control function also ensures the organization of the process of starting the engines of the technological equipment. The method of determining the parameters of the system according to the load schedule under the condition of autonomous operation of the farm during the day using the energy of electric transport batteries is substantiated. For maintain of the gas generator power within the specified limits by adjusting the power of the main battery of the system according to the forecast of the generation of renewable sources is proposed. In case of deviation of RES generation relative to the forecast and load relative to the calculation schedule, the power value of the main battery is adjusted relative to the calculation. An algorithm for calculating the schedule of the gas generator power and the power of electric transport batteries according to the generation forecast and the specified load power schedule has been developed. Based on this, the power schedule of the main battery is determined. For this, the solution of the issue of maximum use of energy from RES for consumption is pursued. According to the simulation results, the workability of the proposed solutions was confirmed. It is shown that in the absence of generation of RES, the normal functioning of the farm is ensured with limiting the use of electric transport, and already with photovoltaic generation of 0.5 of the monthly average in December, the use of electric transport is possible almost without restrictions. In the case of photovoltaic generation, which exceeds the average monthly value for December by three times, energy utilization is about 99%.

Simultaneously, the impact of the degree of risk aversion, consumer green preferences, and channel preferences on the optimal decision-making process of green supply chain members is analyzed. We address the issue of financial constraints faced by manufacturers through bank loans and trade credit financing and compare the two cases. Our findings illustrate that trade credit financing outperforms bank loan financing in the dual-channel green supply chain. Moreover, pricing decisions under different models are influenced by consumer preferences and risk aversion.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Some prominent e-commerce giants, such as Amazon and JD.com, have established their own logistics service and shared it with other merchants. In this paper, we study the channel (reselling channel or agency channel) and logistics service (platform’s logistics or third-party logistics) selection strategies in an e-commerce supply chain composed of a limited capital supplier and a platform within the consideration of the supply chain finance. We show that the supplier’s channel and logistics service selection strategies depend on the cost coefficient of the platform’s logistics service and the production cost. Interestingly, the supplier prefers the reselling channel rather than the agency channel with the platform’s logistics service. This explains why the merchants in JD.com rarely use JD.com logistics in the agency channel. From the perspective of the platform, the platform may prefer the supplier to use third-party logistics service to deliver goods in the agency channel particularly when the cost coefficient of the platform’s logistics service is relatively large. Furthermore, the platform will put in more effort level aimed at enhancing the logistics service in the reselling channel. </jats:p>",

Rhein, a compound extracted from the Chinese herbal medicine Rheum palmatum L. (Dahuang), exhibits good anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidative effects. However, its effect and underlying mechanisms against Aspergillus flavus have not yet been fully illustrated. In this study, we characterized the inhibition effect of rhein on A. flavus mycelial growth, sporulation, and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) biosynthesis and the potential mechanism using RNA-seq analysis. The results indicate that A. flavus mycelial growth and AFB1 biosynthesis were significantly inhibited by 50 μM rhein, with a 43.83% reduction in colony diameter and 87.2% reduction in AFB1 production. The RNA-seq findings demonstrated that the differentially expressed genes primarily participated in processes such as spore formation and development, the maintenance of cell wall and membrane integrity, management of oxidative stress, the regulation of the citric acid cycle, and the biosynthesis of aflatoxin. Biochemical verification experiments further confirmed that 50 μM rhein effectively disrupted cell wall and membrane integrity and caused mitochondrial dysfunction through disrupting energy metabolism pathways, leading to decreased ATP synthesis and ROS accumulation, resulting in impaired aflatoxin biosynthesis. In addition, a pathogenicity test showed that 50 μM rhein inhibited A. flavus spore growth in peanut and maize seeds by 34.1% and 90.4%, while AFB1 biosynthesis was inhibited by 60.52% and 99.43%, respectively. In conclusion, this research expands the knowledge regarding the antifungal activity of rhein and provides a new strategy to mitigate A. flavus contamination.</jats:p>"

The study addresses critical gaps in the field of technological readiness, which challenge the effective integration of disruptive technologies. Using bibliometric analysis, the study evaluated the contributions of academia, industry, and government to developing disruptive theory in supply chain management in South Africa. The study found a significant increase in research activity in 2022, with 71.6% of publications focusing on disruptive theory in supply chain management. The findings highlight the need for collaboration among academia, industry, and governmental bodies to advance disruptive theory in South African supply chain management and promote sustainability. Further, it provides a foundation for further exploration and development of strategies to overcome challenges and leverage opportunities in the rapidly evolving supply chain management landscape. Future researchers may explore a deductive research approach to understand how disruptive theory applies explicitly to the unique challenges and dynamics of the South African supply chain.</jats:p>",

In this study, we used bathymetry, free-air gravity anomaly, and sediment thickness data to calculate the residual bathymetry, mantle Bouguer gravity and crustal thickness of the Reykjanes Ridge. According to the gradient of changes in crustal thickness and residual bathymetry along the axis, the influence of melt supply on the spreading state of the Reykjanes Ridge can be divided into three zones: ultra-strong effect zone (0–160 km), strong effect zone (160–610 km), and weak effect zone (610–930 km). In the ultra-strong effect zone, excess melt supply and a higher melting degree result in a strong upwelling and large melt eruption. The change in relative position between the Reykjanes Ridge and the Iceland hotspot results in the spreading state of the Reykjanes Ridge transforming from asymmetric spreading to symmetric spreading. In the strong effect zone, the decrease in melt supply and melting degree weakens the mantle upwelling and enhances the viscosity of the dehydrated mantle layer. Sufficient viscosity of the dehydrated mantle layer forces asymmetric asthenosphere rise along the sloping boundary of the lithosphere, resulting in symmetric spreading. In the weak effect zone, the pattern of magma upwelling becomes a focused magma supply pattern similar to that of the slow–ultraslow-spreading of the mid-ocean ridge, and tectonics dominate the spreading process. The asymmetry of this weak effect zone may be due to the concentration of tectonic and magmatic activity on one flank of the ridge.</jats:p>"

This method is used to remove various deposits (carbonic acid salt, chloride salts and sulfates of Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+ cations) in pipeline systems and various types of heating heated equipment.\nThe reasons for the formation of deposits on the surfaces of heating equipment, pumps of borehole stations and pipelines is the presence of mineral salts of magnesium and calcium in the water. This is a problem for the thermal power industry, industrial and civil sectors. The resulting scale with a layer thickness of only 1 mm leads to an increase in fuel reserves for heating the coolant by 5-10% and, as a result, loads the hot water supply system.\nThe magnetic water treatment method is an environmentally friendly, cost-effective and safe way to prevent scale formation and improve water quality in general. When exposed to water by a magnetic field, the structure of salts changes, which helps to reduce the formation of solid particles.\nResearch shows that the magnetic field alters the morphology and adhesion of various types of deposits, such as calcium carbonate, converting calcite into aragonite.\nWhen the flow passes through a magnetic field, the structure of the hardness salts changes. These salts combine into a crystalline form, into aragonites. When heated, aragonite crystals do not settle in the form of scale. The changed structure of the salts gradually destroys the scale that had previously accumulated on the heating elements.\nThe intensity of descaling depends on the amount of aragonite formed and the water flow rate.</jats:p>"

With abundant resources and a significant rural population lacking access to electricity, Africa has emerged as a key area for research on variable renewable energy-based electricity generation. Despite this focus, there remains a substantial gap in understanding at regional-scale the potential and variability of solar and wind power across various time scales, as well asthe impact of available resource synergy. Thisstudy aims to bridge this knowledge gap by conducting comprehensive simulations of hybrid wind and solar energy systems, both on-grid and off-grid, across 20 geographically diverse locations in Kenya. Using high-resolution hourly time step data, we examine the effect of resource complementarity on system reliability at varying time scales: daily, monthly and annually. The study findings shows the available VRE resource exhibit moderate tendency for complementarity, and optimizing their deployment can reduce hourly variability by 20%, significantly enhancing supply reliability, especially in the northern and eastern regions.</jats:p>"

Based on this principle, we propose a power-modulated reconfigurable nonlinear device based on spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waveguide loaded by varactor diodes, without applying DC power supply or feed circuit. Increasing the input power level reduces the effective capacitance of the varactor diode, leading to a blueshift in the cutoff frequency of the SSPP waveguide. This feature can be employed to realize the switching on/off of the input signal depending on the signal power. On the other hand, the transmission state of a low-power signal can be controlled by inputting another independent high-power EM wave simultaneously. Increasing the power of the control wave will enable the low-power signal within a wider bandwidth switched from off to on states. Experimental results are presented to show the excellent performance of the power-modulated reconfigurable SSPP device. This method can reduce the system complexity and provide inspiration for reconfigurable all-passive multifunctional devices and systems.</jats:p>"

However, frequent emergencies raise the risk of supply chain disruption, seriously threatening people’s lives and health security. Therefore, building a resilient healthcare supply chain is an important initiative to manage the healthcare crisis effectively. Based on the secondary supply chain formed by medical supply manufacturers and retailers, this paper constructs an evolution game model of resilience investment decisions under the non-disruption and disruption symmetry scenarios of the supply chain and analyzes the stabilization strategies employed by both parties based on their asymmetry strategy choices. Subsequently, the numerical simulation is used to analyze the impact of various parameters on the evolutionary results and their evolutionary trends. The results of the study show that additional benefits from resilience investment, potential costs, disruption losses, market encroachment revenue, “free-rider” benefits, additional benefit increase coefficient, resilience investment reduction coefficient, disruption loss reduction coefficient, additional unit cost reduction coefficient, and market encroachment revenue coefficient all influence the resilience investment decisions. Finally, based on the simulation results, specific recommendations are formulated to improve the resilience of the healthcare supply chain.</jats:p>"

It is of utmost significance for promoting regional sustainable development to construct ESP and put forward sub-regional optimization suggestions based on the supply and demand ratio of ecosystem services (ESs). In this paper, we assessed the level of supply and demand for five ESs based on multi-source data in 2020 with the help of InVEST, ArcGIS, and IUEMS. Based on the results of supply and demand, we calculated the supply and demand ratio of ESs and extracted the ecological source areas (ESAs) on this basis. Then, we used the Linkage Mapper tool to construct the ESP based on the principle of the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and circuit theory in the Chengdu–Chongqing economic circle (CCEC). Our results indicated that there were apparent spatial differences in the supply and demand of five ESs. There were 35 ESAs in the ESP network, covering an area of about 7914 km2, and most of their land use types were woodland. The CCEC was interconnected by a network of 91 ecological corridors (ECs), spanning a total length of approximately 10,701 km. From the ECs, we extracted 29 ecological pinch points (EPPs) and 16 ecological barrier points (EBPs), which each accounted for about 0.3% of the planned area of the CCEC. Finally, we divided the ecological spaces into four types and put forward the corresponding optimization suggestions. Among them, the proportion of ecological restoration area was 7.7%, which was located in Chengdu City, northwest of the study area. The findings of this paper can give some theoretical guidance and serve as a reference for making decisions in the pursuit of ecological civilization in this region.</jats:p>"

However, the complexity of the supply chain structure under front warehouse mode poses a challenge in reducing logistics costs and improving distribution efficiency while meeting consumers’ immediate delivery demands. Therefore, this paper studies the vehicle routing problem of two-echelon fresh e-commerce under front warehouse mode. Considering trans-shipment time constraints between the two echelons and the characteristics of terminal distribution, this paper initially models the vehicle routing problem for front warehouses as a two-echelon multi-trip capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. A mixed-integer linear programming model is subsequently established. To solve the model, a hybrid genetic algorithm integrated with neighborhood search is developed. Matrix coding is employed to merge vehicle selection and route assignment decisions. Simultaneously, neighborhood search is applied to enhance the search capability of algorithms, thereby improving the quality of solutions. Furthermore, the effectiveness and efficiency of the model and algorithm are verified through experiments of varying scales. Finally, comparative strategies and sensitivity analysis highlight the advantages of multi-trip strategies and provide insights into the optimal vehicle capacity limit.</jats:p>"

The automation of transactions through smart contracts streamlines processes, reduces the need for intermediaries, and leads to substantial cost savings and faster delivery times. However, the implementation of blockchain also presents challenges such as scalability, interoperability with existing systems, high costs, and regulatory concerns. Addressing these challenges through future research and pilot projects is essential for unlocking the full potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing supply chain management in the automotive industry.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The self-excited thermoacoustic instability (SETAI) frequently occurs in combustion equipment, leading to intense mechanical vibration, big noise and flame instability. SETAI poses a substantial challenge to the advancement of combustion technology, chiefly due to its complex mechanism. Our previous research has demonstrated that altering the premixed chamber length upstream of furnace can impact the interaction between heat release and sound pressure oscillations, which potentially enables SETAI control. However, supply duct is generally not straight, and changing the premixed section is impractical and unsafe. This paper aims to investigate the influence of introducing elbows and adjusting the supply duct length preceding the premixing stage on SETAI behavior. The goal is to offer guidance for the safe and convenient control of SETAI. Finds reveal that incorporating an elbow in the premixed chamber or changing its position does not affect sound wave propagation along the duct’s center axis within a low frequency regime when maintaining a constant total equivalent length. In systems with both separate and premixed sections, the oscillation pattern is determined by the total time required for acoustic propagation throughout the entire supply system. Consequently, modifications to either of these lengths can impact SETAI. </jats:p>",

Enterprises must use effective quality information disclosure strategies to reduce losses affecting market sales and profit. Therefore, this paper aims to address the supply chain structure composed of one product manufacturer and one component manufacturer under the influence of stigma. It constructs a decision optimization model under three scenarios: no information disclosure, the product manufacturer disclosures information, and the component manufacturer disclosures information, and uses Stackelberg game theory to solve and analyze the model. Furthermore, we use numerical examples to verify the model results, and provide management suggestions for enterprises. The research results show that enterprises suffering from product stigma should actively implement information disclosure strategies to reduce their profit losses, and the lower the stigma level, the better the effect of information disclosure will be; when the stigma level becomes more serious, enterprises should take timely steps to reduce the sales price of products, the sales price of components, and the efforts to disclose information; for industries that value confidentiality of product information, although the implementation of information disclosure by the component manufacturer can require less effort for information disclosure, the two enterprises will suffer higher economic losses.</jats:p>"

However, it is important to recognize that within the accounts receivable financing segment of the SCF credit market, the credit risk associated with SMEs poses a serious challenge and potential threat to the stability, health, and sustainable development of the SCF system. This paper pays special attention to the stability of the two-party evolutionary game between SMEs and financial institutions (FIs) within the context of the Chinese SCF credit market. To identify a pathway to reduce credit risks for SMEs while simultaneously enhancing system stability, this paper adopts the stochastic evolutionary game (SEG) model and combines the fixed-point method to determine the conditions that satisfy the stability of the system’s index p mean square of the system. This study has made attempts in various aspects, such as the innovative construction and investigation of a nonlinear SEG model, the endeavor to study the stability of SEG systems using fixed-point methods, and the innovative construction of a more realistic two-player SEG system. The data and simulation results generated from hypothetical scenarios show that the conclusions of the article are credible and feasible. Through the study, we conclude that the higher credit ratio from FI and the higher penalty intensity from core enterprises (CEs) will accelerate the stability of the system. Based on solid data and modeling analysis, insights into the regulation of FI are provided.</jats:p>"

The aim of this work was to analyze and identify conditions that would increase the energy efficiency of the improved system while expanding the total volume of generated heat for decentralized heat supply. Additionally, the work aimed to ensure the environmental friendliness of primary fuel energy use. The proposed approach aims to improve the energy and environmental performance of heat sources by regulating the temperature of the waste energy carrier to its design value, following a standardized temperature schedule.  The most important result of the study of the improved system of decentralized heat supply is the established generalized dependence of determining the actual conversion coefficient in the heat pump operation. It allows qualitative analysis of the dependence of energy efficiency of the heat supply system on the temperature change of the analyzed low-temperature sources, the ratio of the above-mentioned water flow rates and the influence of cold water distribution for municipal and industrial-technological purposes.  The results of the analytical study of the improved heat supply system create a basis for adjusting the temperature schedule of heat supply, taking into account the characteristic conditions of decentralized heat supply and heat consumption modes of municipal and industrial systems.</jats:p>",

Several studies have been conducted on a laboratory scale that may not represent what happens on a prototype scale. Using fruit and vegetable waste as a basic substrate, mixing them with agro-industry by-products (called co-substrates), the Hermes project set up a process on medium (2 kg) and large (10 kg) scales with two different feeding regimes (1.25 g/BSFL and 2 g/BSFL). At the mature stage, larval biomass was separated from frass (the by-product of the larval rearing). The production of larval proteins and fats and the use of frass as soil conditioning were evaluated. The lowest feeding regime (1.25 g/BSFL) provided the best waste valorization. The shift towards higher production scales is not completely linear. The addition of co-substrates to fruit and vegetable waste, as they are provided by the large-scale retail trade, can help to standardize a process as part of an insect farm. The frass recovered from the residue of rearing (on the diet or on the agrifood leftovers) was composted and used in field to grow a processing tomato variety. The addition of composted frass assured a slightly lower yield than synthetic fertilizer but there was no statistically significant difference (p &gt; 0.10). This suggests that partial replacement of synthetic fertilizer with composted frass has potential. Overall, the work demonstrated that, using a multidisciplinary approach, the interest and the value in building a supply chain based on bioconversion mediated by Hermetia illucens can be emphasized.</jats:p>"

They are produced in millions of pieces per year. Therefore, significant attention has always been paid to research aimed at reducing resource consumption in the production and operation of these engines, improving the initial characteristics and increasing their competitiveness. The article conducted a study of the starting torque when starting single-phase induction motors depending on the initial phase of the voltage of the single-phase network supplying the stator winding, on the phase angles of the network voltage at fixed phase angles of the starting winding. It is also analysed how the active resistance and inductive leakage resistance of the stator winding and the equivalent rotor winding, and the resistance of the capacitor capacitance affect the starting characteristics of the engine.</jats:p>"

Nearshore fish-aggregating devices (FADs) are simple, climate smart devices placed in coastal fishing grounds away from reefs to concentrate pelagic fish and make them easier for fishers to catch. We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in Timor-Leste to test the effects of <italic>nearshore </italic>FADs on fish catch rates and to evaluate the effects of the FAD placement alone, a social behaviour change (SBC) component alone, and the combined effects of the FAD and SBC on household weekly fish purchase and women’s and children’s consumption the day prior. Catch data was collected daily from landing sites, using a digital fisheries monitoring system. Household fish purchases were measured by asking detailed questions about purchases in the previous seven days, and qualitative 24-hour recalls were conducted with a woman of reproductive age in the house. Analysis was intention-to-treat. The catch per unit of fishing effort (CPUE) significantly increased at one fishing ground with FADs (0.85 kg/fisher/hr) but decreased significantly at two fishing grounds, one by –0.43 kg and one by –0.50 kg. Households in the FADs+SBC arm were almost twice as likely to purchase fish during the previous week compared to the control households (PR; 1.90, 95% CI; 1.14, 3.20, p&lt;0.05). Women in the FAD+SBC arm were 4 times as likely to report consuming fish the day prior as compared to women in the control arm (PR: 4.17, 95% CI 1.88, 9.29; p&lt;0.001). There were no differences in fish purchases or consumption in either the FAD alone or SBC alone arms. From our finding that both the FAD placement and SBC interventions were required to improve diets, we conclude that efforts, investments, and programs aimed at improving diets should focus on both supply and demand aspects of the food system.</p>"

The <jats:italic>WBR7</jats:italic> gene encodes sucrose synthase 3 (SUS3). A weak functional allele of <jats:italic>WBR7</jats:italic> is beneficial in increasing grain yield and quality. During the domestication of <jats:italic>indica</jats:italic> rice, a functional G/A variation in the coding region of <jats:italic>WBR7</jats:italic> resulted in an E541K amino acid substitution in the GT‐4 glycosyltransferase domain, leading to a significant decrease in decomposition activity of WBR7<jats:sup>A</jats:sup> (allele in cultivar Jin23B) compared with WBR7<jats:sup>G</jats:sup> (allele in cultivar Beilu130).

This caused more sucrose transportation to the endosperm, enhancing the synthesis of storage components in the endosperm and leading to decreased WBR. More sucrose was also transported to the anthers, providing sufficient substrate and energy supply for pollen maturation and germination, ultimately leading to an increase rate of seed setting and increased grain yield. Our findings elucidate a mechanism for enhancing rice yield and quality by modulating sucrose metabolism and allocation, and provides a valuable allele for improved rice quality.</jats:p>",

The study of the ossibilities of developing the energy system of mountainous territories is shown on the example of the city of Almaty (Kazakhstan). Materials and Methods. To study the energy efficiency indicators of enterprises in the manufacturing industry, Almaty Heavy Machinery Plant (AHMP) was selected as one of the largest machine-building enterprises in Almaty. Results. It is shown that in the conditions of supplying the water supply system with industrial water from mountain rivers, hydro turbines can be used. It was found that such hydro turbines can be placed in water supply pipelines of production shops. Discussion. An assessment was made that showed that the electricity generated by them can be used to power their own equipment, as well as to supply electricity to the general network. Conclusion. The obtained average efficiency of the hydro turbine of 39 % allows us to calculate the possible generation of electricity in real conditions up to 11 kW, while the declared capacity was 16 kW. Resume. If we consider the tasks of energy saving in production, we can confidently predict that the generation of electricity from the developed hydro turbine will reduce the total electricity consumed from the grid. Suggestions for practical applications and directions for future research. The mini-hydroelectric power station developed and presented in this work can be used in water supply systems of industrial enterprises located in mountainous regions. This system can contribute to increasing the energy efficiency of enterprises. In the future, it is planned to scale these mini-hydroelectric power stations and make smaller and larger units for use in larger and smaller enterprises.</jats:p>",

However, ICU capacity and availability are ongoing concerns beyond the pandemic, particularly due to an aging population and increasing complexity of care. This study aimed to assess the current and future shortage of ICU physicians in France, ten years after a previous evaluation. A national e-survey was conducted among French ICUs in January 2022 to collect data on ICU characteristics, medical staffing, individual physician characteristics, and education and training capacities.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Among 290 ICUs contacted, 242 responded (response rate: 83%), representing 4943 ICU beds. The survey revealed an overall of 300 full time equivalent (FTE) ICU physician vacancies in the country. Nearly two-thirds of the participating ICUs reported at least one physician vacancy and 35% relied on traveling physicians to cover shifts. The ICUs most affected by physician vacancies were the ICUs of non-university affiliated public hospitals. The retirements expected in the next five years represented around 10% of the workforce. The median number of physicians per ICU was 7.0, corresponding to a ratio of 0.36 physician (FTE) per ICU bed. In addition, 27% of ICUs were at risk of critical dysfunction or closure due to vacancies and impending retirements.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The findings highlight the urgent need to address the shortage of ICU physicians in France. Compared to a similar study conducted in 2012, the inadequacy between ICU physician supply and demand has increased, resulting in a higher number of vacancies. Our study suggests that, among others, increasing the number of ICM residents trained each year could be a crucial step in addressing this issue. Failure to take appropriate measures may lead to further closures of ICUs and increased risks to patients in this healthcare system.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

This study assessed the knowledge progress and development trends in the sustainable development of cross-border agro-food supply chains enabled by digital technology. A total of 352 authoritative papers from the core Web of Science database were selected for analysis. The Citespace tool was utilized to visually examine research elements. The findings reveal that research outcomes in this territory experienced a significant period of rapid growth, particularly after 2020. Sustainability and IEEE Access are the journals with the highest and second-highest number of publications. China and the France National Institute are the countries and research institutions with the largest number of publications in this field. The research hotspots are mainly the application of digital technologies, food safety, and supply chain system model innovation. In the past ten years, the research in this territory has gone through three stages: precise timeliness orientation, intelligent strategic decision-making orientation, and model predictability orientation. We further construct the ‘antecedent–practice–performance’ conceptual framework of the sustainability of the digital technology-enabled cross-border agro-food supply chain. Finally, this paper presents the potential research directions in this territory, focusing on four aspects: research method, research mechanism, research topic, and research frontier.</jats:p>"

Improper feeding practices repeatedly reported in the media have contributed to the issuance of Fatwas on the impermissibility of animals fed with non-halal feed or impurities in 2007. Hence, feeding animals with Halal feed would be a judicious effort to solve these problems. Nevertheless, in the production and supply chain of halal animal feed, numerous risks must be considered concerning the feeds safety, quality, and halal integrity. The use of non-halal ingredients in animal feed can render the animals non-halal for consumption, as stated by the Malaysia National Fatwa. Additionally, even if the feed is initially halal, it can become non-halal through contamination with non-halal additives, equipment, or utensils. Therefore, a halal risk assessment is necessary to identify and analyze potential contamination risks during feed production. This study focuses on analyzing halal risks in animal feed production in Malaysia, employing qualitative research methodology by utilising a library research approach to identify these risks. In addition, the identification of activities involved in the feed supply chain will also help to analyze the risks. Developing a halal risk analysis and risk ranking matrix is essential for creating a Halal Risk Management Plan for feed production. This framework will benefit feed manufacturers by preventing contamination and assisting Halal authorities in establishing specific standards for halal feed production.</jats:p>"

For those with advanced, metastatic disease, retrospective chemotherapy studies demonstrate short-term median progression-free survival (PFS) of around 3 to 5.5 months. Benefit from checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been reported, however clinical trial data is scarce, and endpoints are not well defined, thus benchmarking outcomes is challenging. The IMMUNOSARC I master-trial exploring sunitinib plus nivolumab in multiple sarcoma subtypes, detected potential activity in DDCS leading to a specific cohort within the phase II trial IMMUNOSARC II (NCT03277924). Methods: Patients (pts) with ECOG 0-1, centrally confirmed and progressive, measurable DDCS were eligible and treated with sunitinib 37.5 mg/d for 14 days (induction phase), followed by 25 mg/d, in combination with nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks until progressive disease (PD) or intolerance. Imaging assessments were performed every 8 weeks. Main endpoint was 6-m PFSR with one-arm survival design (type I error α 0.05, power 0.90, H0 40%, H1 70%) and a Brookmeyer-Crowley like test was assumed with at least 14 of 23 pts required without progression at 6 months. Results: Between December 2019 and October 2023, 24 pts with a median age of 60 years (38-76) were enrolled in 7 centres. Sixteen pts (66%), were male. Pts had received a median of 1 (0-2) prior lines of therapy. In total, 23 pts were evaluable with a median follow-up of 20.1 months (95%CI: 11.6-28.6). Median PFS, according to local site assessment, was 5.6 months (95%CI: 4.5-6.7); the 6m-PFSR was 10 of 23 pts (46%); (95%CI: 23-66) and median overall survival 10.3 months (95%CI: 6.7-13.9). In 19 pts with RECIST measurable response, 5 pts (26.3%) achieved a partial response; 10 (52.6%) stable disease and 4 (21.1%) PD. End-of-treatment reasons were PD in 21 pts (87%), toxicity 1 pt (4.2%) with two pts (8.4%) ongoing. For safety population, the most relevant study drug-related G3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (20.9%), anemia (16.7%), and increased ALT (12.5%). Conclusions: Sunitinib and nivolumab demonstrated encouraging activity in advanced DDCS that did not meet the primary endpoint, but compares favourably with previous analyses of cytotoxic and targeted therapy. The combination is worthy of further exploration in conjunction with reaching a consensus on clinically meaningful endpoints in this challenging population. Translational studies to identify potential predictive biomarkers are ongoing. Clinical trial information: NCT03277924 . </jats:p>",

For that, the best-worst method (BWM) determined the weights of four identified challenges to effective SCMP in the sector, and subsequently, the alternative ranking order method accounting for two-step normalization (AROMAN) evaluated four alternatives to overcome these challenges. To show the applicability of our approach, the national oil corporation in Kenya is considered as a case study. Results show that collaboration between supply chain actors for the provision of transport and distribution is the most appropriate alternative for an effective SCMP for the national oil corporation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recycling of used products can provide substantial economic and environmental benefits for supply chain players. However, many factors associated with the design of closed-loop supply chain networks are uncertain in their nature, including demand, opening cost of facilities, capacity of opened facilities, transportation cost, and procurement cost. Therefore, this study proposes a novel fuzzy programming model for closed-loop supply chain network design, which directly relies on the fuzzy ranking method based on a credibility measure. The objective of the presented optimization model aims at minimizing the total cost of the network when selecting the facility locations and transportation routes between the nodes of the network. Based on the problem characteristics, a Migratory Birds Optimization Algorithm with a new product source encoding scheme is developed as a solution approach. The inspiration for the product source coding method originates from the label information of raw material supplier and manufacturing factories on product packaging, as well as the information of each logistics node on the delivery order. This novel encoding method aims to address the limitations of four traditional encoding methods: Prüfer number based encoding, spanning tree based encoding, forest data structure based encoding, and priority based encoding, thereby increasing the likelihood of heuristic algorithms finding the optimal solution. Thirty-five illustrative examples are developed to evaluate the proposed algorithm against the exact optimization method (LINGO) and a Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, Simulated Annealing, which are recognized as well-known metaheuristic algorithms. The results from extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm is able to provide optimal and good-quality solutions within acceptable computational time even for large-scale numerical examples. The suitability of the model is confirmed through a meticulous sensitivity analysis. This analysis involves adjusting the confidence level incrementally from 50% to 100%, in 5% intervals, with respect to the model’s uncertain parameters. Consequently, it yields valuable managerial insights. The outcomes of this research are expected to provide scientific support for related supply chain enterprises and stakeholders.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective. The problem of the quality of water supply for the population of Ukraine is getting worse every year. This is one of the most important threats to the national security of Ukraine. Poor quality water can cause many infectious and non-infectious diseases. This confirms the need to monitor the quality of water from springs and drinking water consumed by the population.  Goal: еcological and hygienic assessment of the quality of drinking water consumed by the population of the Rivne region and the dynamics of its changes for the period 2010-2020.  Research methods: sanitary and hygienic, bibliometric, analytical.  Research results. The materials on the state of centralized and decentralized water supply of the urban and rural population of the Rivne region for 2010-2020 have been summarized and systematized. During this period, the percentage of inconsistency of water samples from sources of centralized water supply according to sanitary and chemical indicators increased by 1.06 times. Then, as from the centralized water supply network (MCSV) in 1.8 times. There was an alarming trend towards an increase in the non-compliance of water quality with MCV according to microbiological indicators: from 5.4% in 2010 to 19.8% in 2020. For rural water supply systems, it was established that the percentage of non-compliance above the regional average according to microbiological indicators was in Goshchanskyi (72.2% in 2020), Dubenskyi (28.8% in 2016), Kostopilskyi (80.0% in 2020), Mlynivskyi (42.37% in 2017), Rivneskyi (46.1% in 2015) and Zdolbunivskyi (50% in 2016) districts. It was found that the average regional indicator of non-compliance of drinking water from sources of decentralized water supply according to sanitary and chemical indicators increased 1.2 times over the studied period from 26.2% in 2010 to 31.8% in 2020. Average regional indicator of non-compliance of drinking water samples decentralized water supply according to microbiological indicators for 2010-2020 was characterized by constant growth: from 8.4% in 2010 to 30% in 2020.  Conclusion. Taking into account the threatening trend of deterioration of the quality of drinking water according to microbiological indicators, the need to take urgent measures regarding the introduction of modern technologies and means of water disinfection for drinking needs is substantiated</jats:p>",
