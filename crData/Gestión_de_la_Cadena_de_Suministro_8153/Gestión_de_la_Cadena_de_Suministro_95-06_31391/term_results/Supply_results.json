Following the privatization of the Electricity Supply Industry in England and Wales in 1990, there is an overriding commercial incentive for the privatized electricity companies to operate the high voltage transmission networks as economically as possible without compromizing their reliability in a climate of substantial uncertainty as to the generator prices and availabilities that are bid into the pool from day to day and the energy trading contracts that have to be implemented. These circumstances often mean that the transmission and distribution networks must operate close to their defined security limits and still be capable of surviving severe disturbances. Hence artificial intelligence is being applied to the development of online real‐time monitoring systems to assist the electricity supply companies' control room engineers. This paper reviews this field and presents two case studies.</jats:p>",

Such an analysis allows characterization of the French sport system and identification of the transformations caused by social, cultural, economic, and political changes. This article provides evidence about the construction of a “mixed” national system linking sport federations to the state and, up to the 1980s, favoring high-performance sport. Evidence is also provided that since the 1980s, a system that takes into account economic profitability as well as individual needs has responded to diversified objectives. Local political administrations have thus played a preponderant role in sport policy, but the commercialization of sport has also competed with public politics.</jats:p>",

Biomass allocation was significantly affected by nutrient supply: higher nutrient doses resulted in less biomass allocation to belowground organs, whereas the period of intensive production of aboveground biomass was prolonged. Shoot height increases with nutrient supply. The height ratios were constant over time. Within each treatment and each harvest, inflorescence biomass was positively correlated with shoot height. Branching of the main shoots (number of lateral branches) was positively correlated with plant height and changed with time. The number of new rhizomes was affected by both treatment and harvest, especially in older plants. The results suggest that high nutrient supply increased the allocation of biomass both to reproductive organs and to vegetative organs.

Our dependence upon them requires that they function with no problems. System safety is crucial. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems are commonly equipped to supply stable power regarding critical loads, e.g., large computer centers, telephone and telecommunication centers, aviation control systems, etc. Several types of UPS systems are now used in many of these important fields. However, there has been to date little numerical evaluation vis‐a‐vis system reliability.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper evaluates mean time between failures (MTBF) of parallel redundant UPS systems, and reports that the MTBF of two sets of parallel redundant UPS systems is lower than that of 3 sets of parallel redundant UPS systems under some circumstances. Continuous power supply reliability of the UPS system with bypass and uninterruptible transfer switch is much higher than is the case for other UPS systems lacking bypass circuit and uninterruptible transfer switch. Highly reliable parallel operation technology is also shown.</jats:p>",

Three years ago, Amoco began to question this selection practice and embarked on an extensive benchmarking effort that has led the company to a proven strategy for goods and services procurement called supply chain management (SCM). However, the company found that managing compact, integrated supply chains is not always easy. Several implementation issues need to be reconciled for alliances to achieve their full bottom-line potential benefits consistently. Issues that must be resolved, whether they are called alliances, supply chains, or integrated services, are (1) whether these new working relationships are profitable for all the entities involved, from suppliers through to end users; (2) how to assess and improve risk management; (3) how to reduce total system costs; and (4) how to improve performance for each of the alliance members and for the alliance as a whole. This brief describes one possible solution to the complex issues involved in making alliances work: a computer-facilitated management system designed to integrate the work processes of different organizations. In the case described, the Drilling Management System (DMS) was developed and used by the Amoco (U.K.) Well Dept. The system uses off-the-shelf commercial software to improve the performance of the company's drilling operations by integrating the activities of the company and its suppliers.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Initial samples from the air were collected with 3-h settle plates; air sampling following cleanup was done with an Anderson air sampler. The source of contamination in the mouse rooms was determined to be Beta Chip bedding, which came from the manufacturer highly contaminated. Beta Chip bedding (1 g) obtained from the manufacturer just prior to testing contained 10(4) CFU of A. fumigatus, 20 CFU of a zygomycete, and 10 CFU of a Penicillium sp. Coarse-grade Beta Chip had approximately one-half those levels of contamination. Pure Cob bedding was highly contaminated also, but with a Fusarium sp. and a Cladosporium sp. Untreated and heat-treated Sani-Chip as well as all other heat-treated preparations obtained from the manufacturer contained no detectable spores. Rodent chow direct from the manufacturer had no A. fumigatus, although it did contain 150 CFU of fungus per g, including 80 CFU of a Rhodotorula sp., 60 CFU of Cryptococcus uniguttulatus, and 1 CFU of a Penicillium sp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</jats:p>",

In eight animals, cervical dentin was exposed bilaterally in the mandibular canines, 7–10 d after unilateral resection of the inferior alveolar nerve. The observation intervals were 30 d, 90 d and 180 d, after which histological examination of dentin was performed. In order to verify the loss and regeneration of pulpal innervation and an intact blood supply, blood flow responses to electrical stimulation of the tooth and to i.v. injections of substance P (SP) were recorded by laser Doppler flowmetry before and at 7–10 d after denervation, at the end of the experiments, and at predetermined intermediate intervals. SP‐induced vase‐dilation was significantly enhanced at 1 wk and 30 d postoperatively and was normalized to control values at 90 and 180 d. Vasodilation in response to electrical tooth stimulation, which was absent after denervation, reappeared after 90 d in two of four cats. There was no irregular dentin formation under the exposed dentin at any time in denervated or control teeth. Formation of regular secondary dentin appeared to be enhanced on the denervated side at 30 d and 90 d postoperatively, whereas at 180 d there was no difference between sides. The results indicate that intradental nerves influence secondary dentin formation in feline permanent teeth.</jats:p>",

Combined measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence under low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations allowed the demonstration of a linear relationship between the photochemical efficiency of PSII (fluorescence measurements) and the apparent quantum yield of gross photosynthesis (gas exchange). This relationship was used under normal O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> to compute total light‐driven electron fluxes, and to partition them into fractions used for RuBP carboxylation or RuBP oxygenation. This procedure also yielded an indirect estimate of the rate of photorespiration <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. The time courses of light‐driven electron flow, net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation and photorespiration paralleled that of photosynthetic photon flux density, with important afternoon deviations as soon as a severe drought stress occurred, whereas photochemical efficiency and maximal fluorescence underwent large but reversible diurnal decreases. The latter observation indicated the occurrence of a large non‐photochemical energy dissipation at PSII. We estimated that less than 60% of the total photosynthetic electron flow was used for carbon assimilation at midday, while about 40% was devoted to photorespiration. The rate of carbon loss by photorespiration (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>) reached mean levels of 56% of net assimilation rates. The potential application of this technique to analysis of the relative contributions of thermal de‐excitation at PSII and photorespiratory carbon recycling in the protection of photosynthesis against stress effects is discussed.</jats:p>",
