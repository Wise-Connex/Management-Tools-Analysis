Ethane is an important petrochemical feedstock for the production of ethylene. It is also used as a miscible agent for enhanced oil recovery. Propane and butanes are by-products of natural gas and crude oil feed to distilling, which are obtained from gas plants and refineries. Propane is used primarily as a fuel and as miscible flood for enhanced oil recovery. However, in contrast to propane, butanes are used primarily as feedstock in refineries and petrochemical plants. They are seldom used in miscible floods except when entrained in NGL mixes. Pentanes plus is a by-product of natural gas which is obtained from gas plants as well as condensate from crude oil. Pentanes plus is used as a refinery feedstock and as a diluents in reducing viscosity of bitumen and conventional heavy crude oil to allow conventional pipelining.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to describe and project supply and demand for NGLs in the province of Alberta for the period 1988 to 2000. The Gas Energy Management Model (GEMM) and Energy Requirements Model of Alberta (ERMA) are used for the projections of supply and demand for NGLs, respectively.

Riding on the buoyant prospects for natural gas exports, the NGLs production will peak in the 1990s; the uncertainty is in NGLs demand. NGLs may be used in miscible flooding schemes for enhanced oil recovery, as diluents for the pipelining of heavy oil and bitumen, as petrochemical feedstocks and directly as fuel or in blends with other fuels. Western Canada ought to be poised for significant expansions in most petroleum and petrochemical sectors. Therefore, the NGLs demand prospects in the 1990s ought to be good. However, with unpredictable world oil prices such expansion plans may recede into the next century, leaving western Canada awash in surplus NGLs. With the help of two models developed at the Alberta Research Council, this paper examines the Western Canadian NGLs prospects in the 1990s. The two models are a continental natural gas model (AGAS) and a Canadian liquid fuels model (ALF01).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Natural Gas Model Description</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>AGAS is an optimizing, multi-period, clairvoyant energy supply demand model. Because of its large size, linear programming is the only practical optimization technique. A linear programming model simulates a perfect market economy, which maximizes the sum of the producer and consumer surpluses. While it can only approximate reality, the solution represents an upper bound on what the energy sector can achieve, provided that the proper policy and economic choices are taken. By taking ‘snapshots’ of the energy sector of the economy at various time intervals, we can trace its behavior over time. Normally, the model has a 24-year time horizon, covering 8 time periods of 3 years each. All investment and production decisions are solved simultaneously over time; thus the model has perfect foresight. While this knowledge is never completely available, the model permits us to test various scenarios involving different perceptions of future developments.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>AGAS is a partial equilibrium model for natural gas supply and demand in North America. Supply functions are estimated for four gas supply regions. Demand curves are specified for each time period and in each of nine consuming regions. The existing gas processing and pipeline network, with capacities and tariffs, is specified. Separate gas deliverability profiles are specified for each producing region. Policy constraints, such as export and import limits, reserve or deliverability tests, can be incorporated into the model.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Investment decisions, including the development of new gas supplies and the building of new gas processing plants and pipelines, the level of production of gas from each producing region for each time period, the capacity utilization level of existing facilities, the level of consumption of gas in each consuming region, the city gate price for gas in each consuming region — all these are determined endogenously.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The model seeks that development and production profile of the natural gas industry in North America that maximizes the present value of the sum of consumer and producer surpluses generated over the time horizon of the model.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The management of a complex system of reservoirs, rivers and waste treatment plants, such as in the case of the Canal de Isabel II of Madrid, regards the needs and feasibility factors as parts of the overall hydraulic planning program of its watersheds. The complexity of Madrid's hydraulic system and the influence that erroneous conclusions could exert upon determining the discharge regimes has prompted the Canal de Isabel II to adopt more technical aids than commonly used for these types of studies. It was necessary to integrate a wide range of mathematical models for water quality, resource management and instream flow, so that ultimately, each alternative could be contrasted with its corresponding economic and social costs.</jats:p>",

Given a perfect capital market, optimal harvesting decisions depend on timber prices, the interest rate, and the merchantable timber stock. Under effective credit rationing, timber supply and the life cycle harvest become dependent on forest owners' preferences, i.e., timber supply and consumption decisions must be made simultaneously. Thus, the effect of the price of timber on short-term supply becomes ambiguous, and the interest rate only has a negative income effect. Further, because the harvest and consumption are decided simultaneously, supply is also affected by owner characteristics. The optimal life cycle harvest rate need not be constant, and the age of the owner is a relevant explanatory variable. The timber supply function is estimated using Finnish micro data from 1982 to 1985, and the Tobit model. The hypothesis of an imperfect capital market cannot be rejected as the owner characteristics, including the owner's age, have highly significant coefficients, although the estimated coefficient of the interest rate is positive. The positive effect of the interest rate may be due to the fact that the loans of the credit-rationed forest owners in the sample are relatively small, and the positive effect of the nonrationed forest owners dominates. However, the effects of other capital (or, e.g., amenities) market imperfections cannot be ruled out. For. Sci. 37(4):1011-1029.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> BACKGROUND. Despite the rapid growth of the US physician supply since the mid-1970s, it remains unclear whether physicians have spread into the most rural areas of the country. This report examines the urban-rural distribution of physicians between 1975 and 1988. METHODS. A county-based typology of the urban-rural continuum was employed to examine trends in the supply of nonfederal primary care physicians, specialist physicians, and osteopaths. RESULTS. All urban and rural areas gained physicians during the late 1970s and 1980s. The supply of physicians increased most rapidly in metropolitan counties. Within nonmetropolitan areas, urbanized remote counties became more prominent centers of the physician supply. Osteopaths were more likely to locate in the most rural areas than allopaths. The physician supply in all areas also became more specialized over time. CONCLUSIONS. The rapid growth of the US physician supply was associated with the spread of more practitioners into all parts of the country. However, the supply of physicians increased most rapidly in urban areas, widening urban-rural differences in the availability of physicians. </jats:p>",

The analysis uses data on all full-time teachers in Indiana from 1965 to 1988, as well as a survey of new hires in 1987–1988. Our data suggest that experienced teachers (both returning and migrating) have constituted an important source of supply—at present they account for almost 60% of all new hires. Inexperienced teachers appear to be delaying entry into teaching—they have become increasingly older over time, with over a third of them being 35 years old or older. These findings have important implications for teacher recruiting in the future as retirements increase and the reserve pool begins to shrink. </jats:p>",

A two-year study was designed to test cover crops of rye (<jats:italic>Secale cereale</jats:italic>L.), hairy vetch (<jats:italic>Vicia villosa</jats:italic>Roth), and big/lower vetch (<jats:italic>Vicia grandiflora</jats:italic>Scopoli) for their ability to produce N and to conserve soil water for a succeeding corn (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic>L.) crop. We measured the cover crops' biomass, N yield, carbon (C) to N ratio, and influence on a subsequent corn crop grown under two tillage regimes (disk tillage or no-till). Nitrogen content in cover crop biomass at time of corn planting ranged from 37 to 187 kg/ha. Pure stands of hairy vetch and a mixture of hairy vetch plus bigflower vetch had generally higher N yields, and rye was lowest. Rye growing in association with hairy vetch had lower C:N ratios than rye growing alone. Legume C:N ratios remained generally unchanged from earlier (disked) to later (herbicide) kill dates, but total N and biomass typically increased in the last 2 to 3 weeks before corn planting. Soil water retention was affected by tillage in some cases; no-till was superior to disk incorporation in each case where there was a tillage effect. Cover crops with greater biomass resulted in greater soil water retention. Among cover crops, uptake ofNby corn was greater from hairy vetch or hairy vetch plus bigflower vetch mixture. Biological immobilization of N appeared to be reducing N uptake by corn grown in rye residues. Corn in nonlegume plots fertilized with 140 or 210 kg N/ha took up more N than corn following legumes, but there was no corresponding yield increase. Corn biomass yields following the cover crops ranged from 8.6 to 18.0 Mg/ha with no additional fertilizer N. In the second year of the study, average corn yields following hairy vetch (15.3 Mg/ha) or hairy-bigflower vetch mixtures (16.4 Mg/ha) were not statistically different from corn yields produced by a 140 kg N/ha fertilizer rate (17.4 Mg/ha). These results suggest N from a legume cover crop can replace or substantially reduce fertilizer N requirements in corn production systems in the Appalachian region.</jats:p>",

The maximum even-flow allowable cut from the whole forest as a unit was 1.33–2.13% larger than the sum of the five maximum even-flow allowable cuts from the five working circles. Maximum even-flow allowable cuts found with linear programming using stand aggregation were 1.31–2.10% larger than allowable cuts using area aggregation. Maximum per period cost constraints were found, on average, to increase predicted differences from unconstrained stand-based versus area-based analysis. Use of the maximum cost constraints led to the ability to develop curves for the marginal cost of allowable cut for both stand-based and area-based analyses. By incrementally examining increases in the allowable cuts generated on the independent management units at different cost constraints, a curve for the average marginal cost of allowable cut was derived. Careful use of this curve will allow woodland managers to select the least costly method of analysis for any particular desired allowable cut. As well, the selected curve can aid managers in determining the marginal cost of timber supply at any production level and to set upper limits on external wood purchase prices. While biological data were easier to derive for stand-based aggregation, area-based aggregation led to smaller linear programming models, which were thus cheaper to solve, and it was much easier to develop location-dependent economic data for these type models than for stand-based models. </jats:p>",

This observation suggests that the amino acid supply is one of the factors limiting cell growth and productivity in typical batch processes, and we demonstrated that a similar limitation occurs in a semicontinuous culture. Finally, we showed that the cell decline observed after a period of amino acid deficiency is not irreversible and that proliferation could be resumed if the required amino acids were added.</jats:p>",
