      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article compares certain rivers in Europe and the United States in regard to several aspects of pollution and suggests a means of avoiding or diminishing hazards, actual and potential, associated with this type of public water supply. The problems to be discussed include: high pollution and low flow; mineral pollution due to mining and oil field operations; fluctuation of chemical composition; health hazards due to pathogens; and, single, massive industrial discharges. Francis W. Montanari of the State of New York Conservation Department, Division of Water Resources, discusses Biemond's thoughts on the use of underground storage, or recharge, and nuclear‐energy plants as possible sources of contamination, against which underground storage could provide a buffer. Montanari discusses the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission's (Orsanco's) system of protective measures against spills and accidents through the cooperation of the advisory committees and Orsanco's staff.</jats:p>",
