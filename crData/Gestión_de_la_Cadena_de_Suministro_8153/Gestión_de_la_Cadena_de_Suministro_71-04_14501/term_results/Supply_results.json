The supporting area of the conveyer is comparatively large, and has multiple air supply holes, whose positions may vary due to the relative motion of the article and the supporting surface. The analysis is made under the assumption of semi infinite area of supported surface with the discrete supply holes of the conveyer, and thereafter, with equivalent air feeding distributed over the conveyer surface. The case of the circular pad is analyzed as well in order to take into account the effect of the finite supported surface area. The distributed air feeding solution agrees well with the discrete supply hole solution as well as with experimental results.</jats:p>",
