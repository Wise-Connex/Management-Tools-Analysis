Integrated within this survey is an extensive discussion of public policy issues relating to labor supply, including income transfer programs, such as welfare and Social Security, and the income tax system. A concluding chapter discusses secular trends in labor supply in the U.S. economy, in particular the long-run increase in female labor force participation.</jats:p>",

In particular, we consider how its properties are changed by the presence of binding constraints on cutting behaviour. This is done by comparing the properties of the supply function under rationing with the corresponding properties under a free market. One result from this exercise being that the effect of a relaxation of the constraint will increase (decrease) the cuts in periods whose cuts are complements (substitutes) to the cut of the constrained period. Another result being that the supply function in one particular period will be less price elastic under rationing than under a free market. This latter result is supported with some preliminary empirical evidence from the Swedish roundwood market. </jats:p>",

Such water supplies may act as either a leader of urban development or as a follower. In either case, this engineering approach to the provision of water has fostered less than optimal utilization of regional water and land resources for urban growth. More efficient utilization of these resources is achieved when water supply development and urban growth planning are conjoint activities. Water supply planners and land use planners, working together, are able to generate and evaluate the full range of urban development options, including water demand management through conservation. Preferred regional growth plans are achieved using the best mix of water supply and urban growth. The result is a reduced rate of water supply development and a reduction of urban expansion on prime lands. This partnership approach is demonstrated for the Calgary Region under two levels of water conservation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a surge analysis which was undertaken on the Caledon-Bloemfontein supply scheme, a large-diameter pipeline (1.2 m) on which the static head is unusually high: over 240 m. Currently, the pipeline operates at less than 20% of the design flow, but transducer traces show that surge pressures following pump failure already cause concern, with a peak at least 16% above the pipeline rating. Moreover, these peak pressures are not compatible with those predicted by traditional methods. Thus, the computer analysis described herein was undertaken firstly to determine the reasons for the unexpectedly high transient pressures, and secondly, to study the effectiveness of alternative surge suppression methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The distribution of the cardiac output and the maternal placental blood flow has been measured in guinea‐pigs at days 49‐51 of pregnancy using radioactively labelled microspheres. In some instances uterine blood flow was reduced chronically by ligating one uterine artery at day 30 of pregnancy. Between 3 and 4% of the cardiac output passed normally to placenta, and this could be reduced to less than 2% after uterine artery ligation. The result of the ligation was to reduce fetal and placental weight by up to 70%. Fetal and placental weight showed a close linear correlation in controls and in pregnancies with uterine artery ligation. However, when placental size was reduced below 60% of control, fetal weight was less affected by a reduction in placental weights than normal. Placental blood flow and placental size exhibited a close linear relationship over the whole range of values, but there was limiting placental weight which approached 1.3 g as placental blood flow approached zero. Thus a reduced placental size, particularly below about 50%, was associated with a proportionately greater reduction in maternal placental blood flow. Maternal placental blood flow or the percentage of maternal cardiac output to the placenta and fetal weight also showed a well‐correlated linear relationship. However, when placental blood flow was below about 50% of control values further reduction had a less than normal effect upon fetal growth. Small fetuses were hypoglycaemic and hypoinsulinaemic and the degree of each was dependent upon the extent of the reduction in fetal weight and in maternal placental blood flow. In fetuses that were below about 40% of normal size, and in which placental blood was below about 30% of control, fetal weight was less sensitive to falls in blood glucose, which in turn was more sensitive than normal to a fall in maternal placental blood flow. The results indicate that over the range of 50‐100% of normal fetal growth, maternal placental blood flow and probably nutrient supply to the fetus vary in parallel. Hence over this range fetal and placental growth rates are determined in part by placental blood flow. At placental blood flow rates and fetal growth rates below 40% of normal fetal growth is less dependent upon placental blood flow than usual, presumably because of a reduced dependence upon glucose metabolism for growth. This would appear to be essential, since as maternal placental blood flow is reduced to low values the placenta has to utilize an increasing proportion of the available glucose.</jats:p>",
