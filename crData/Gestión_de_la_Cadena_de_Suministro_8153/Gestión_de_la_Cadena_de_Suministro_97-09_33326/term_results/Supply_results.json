This trend has resulted in an economy wherein practically every manufacturing company has become dependent on a supply-chain of vendors in order to serve its customers. In the context of this distributed manufacturing environment, the Internet and related technologies such as Java, VRML and intelligent WWW agents are creating fundamentally new approaches to supply-chain interactions that offer greater flexibility in identifying suppliers and the ability to dramatically reduce the response time within a supply-chain for processing requests-for-quotation (RFQs) and orders from customers. In this paper, we describe a generic framework for Internet-based customer-vendor interactions, and present a computer-integrated system for rapid and effective processing of RFQs in such an Internet-based supply-chain. We also identify some key research challenges within this framework that need to be overcome for Internet-based supply-chain interaction to be successful.</jats:p>",

Developed in 1990 by the Research Libraries Group of the Research Libraries Information Network, ARIEL is becoming the document delivery system of choice for a rapidly growing number of users in the USA and abroad. The key advantages which ARIEL has over the fax are: no long‐distance phone charges; high image resolution; original source can be scanned; can send and receive documents at the same time; does not require dedicated equipment; and documents can be stored and forwarded at a later time.

Understanding how family labour market activity was affected by short-term economic fluctuations provides evidence about both the impact of the economic crisis and the economic responses made within the family. In analyzing family labour supply during Latin America’s economic crisis of the 1980s it is important to look beyond the usual measures of labour force participation and unemployment, such as those for prime age males, and consider the effects of macroeconomic fluctuations on the labour supply of different types of family members. Labour supply responses of married women, children and adolescents, and older people may provide indirect evidence about the flexibility of labour markets and the role that labour market adjustments play in periods of large macroeconomic changes, especially those caused by deliberate policy interventions.In particular, we are interested in the extent to which negative welfare effects of macroeconomic ‘shocks’ on individuals are lessened by a change in households’ strategies regarding labour force activity of household members. That is, are families able to buffer the impact of macro shocks via a reallocation of the time of family members, presumably from other activities into market work? If so. then evidence on the magnitude of changes in the labour supply of household members is one indirect indicator of the magnitude of the shocks felt by individual house holds.</jats:p>",

Forming a JIT supply chain makes the production scheduling activity much more complex because: (i) while a manufacturer is trying to synchronize its internal production activity, it needs to synchronize with the activities of external partners on the same chain as well; and (ii) under JIT, suppliers typically make smaller and more frequent deliveries, resulting in a significant increase in related business transactions and the variations of the inputs to the scheduling process is increased accordingly. This paper discusses why and how the application of Internet and EDI technology can improve the production synchronization of a JIT supply chain System. A software structure for system integration is also presented.</jats:p>",

The principal focus of the work is the operational issues surrounding the organization, management and control of the subcontract process, but related issues and research streams are also considered. Some of the operational issues are placed within the context of current practice by presenting case studies of two small to medium‐sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) in the electronics assembly sector which use subcontract manufacture. The approaches of the two companies to the management and control of the process are compared and contrasted, and mapped onto generic models. This work is considered timely because of the increasing importance of the subcontracting of manufacture within the supply chain, and because of the lack of supporting theoretical and practical work. It identifies key issues which need to be addressed by academic researchers and by industry practitioners in the pursuit of world class manufacturing ideals, as part of a process of concentrating on core competencies and expertise.</jats:p>",

Contrary to anticipated results, the use of an alliance approach did not lead to any appreciable improvement in status and respect for supply management's role in developing corporate strategy. While several suggestions are offered to explain these results, the major conceptual models of supply‐chain strategy are reassessed and a more appropriate and grounded framework for study is proposed.

The survey results indicate that restructurers use partnerships to facilitate restructuring. Restructurers and non‐restructurers form partnerships for different reasons and realize different types of benefits. Furthermore, restructurers realize greater benefits than do non‐restructurers and view their partnerships as more successful. Restructurers report dramatic improvements in logistics cost (1l‐30%) and order cycle time (62%). The research contributes to the existing literature by highlighting restructuring as an important aspect of logistics partnership formation and by presenting empirical data that shows how the two strategies are linked. </jats:p>",

Both quantitative and qualitative data sources are combined to test the hypothesis that channel transformation involving adoption of EDI and redesign of replenishment processes enables performance improvements more than an order of magnitude greater than implementation of EDI alone. This new process, enabled by EDI, provides retailers with 50‐ 100% higher inventory turns for products on continuous replenishment processes (CRP) relative to retailer performance using traditional ordering processes. Firms adopting EDI without using CRP to reengineer the ordering processes have failed to realize any statistically significant improvements in either inventory levels or warehouse stockouts. This research provides evidence to support the claims of process reengineering that are common in the popular business press, but for which statistically significant empirical evidence is minimal. The findings of the research also demonstrate the potential improvements that firms can realize through extending the business process reengineering concept to include the firms' entire supply chain. </jats:p>",

This paper seeks to bridge the divide between theoretical and empirical research through a case study of New York City's water supply. Current processes of socio‐economic restructuring are leading to negative environmental consequences obscured by a failure to extend analysis beyond limited temporal, spatial or sectoral scales. Insights from regulationist theory show that a combination of fiscal, political and other developments are bringing about a wide‐ranging reformulation of existing patterns of environmental regulation and service provision in the city. The power of the state is being radically diminished in relation to the power of capital and a plethora of different interest groups. A relatively simple centralized model of environmental regulation is being transformed into a complex decentralized pattern involving the emergence of new approaches to urban governance. Further research is needed on the contradictions between capitalist accumulation and environmental regulation at different spatial scales in order to link New York's changing role within the global economy to the declining political legitimacy and fiscal capability of the state to play an extensive role in environmental management.</jats:p>",

Inorganic carbon fixation in the root provides carbon skeletons for the assimilation of the NH<jats:sup>+</jats:sup><jats:sub>4</jats:sub> resulting from NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> reduction, and the subsequent removal of amino acids through the xylem.

The extent and localization of pial blush in relation to the total tumor volume were determined angiographically. The amount of edema and tumor size were calculated using computerized tomography. The edema—tumor volume ratio was defined as Edema Index (EI). There were 49 meningiomas with PTBE; of those tumors, 46 were supplied by pial vessels, and three were supplied exclusively by dural vessels. Tumors without PTBE showed no pial blush. The mean EI in meningiomas with pial blush was significantly larger (EI = 3) than in meningiomas without pial supply (EI = 1.1; p &lt; 0.0001). Meningiomas with a smaller pial supply than dural supply had a significantly smaller mean EI than tumors with a pial supply equal to or greater than the dural supply (EI = 2.9 vs. EI = 3.7; p &lt; 0.015). In 69.9% of cases with pial blood supply, major portions of the edema were located adjacent to the tumor region supplied by pial vessels. Edema index differences among tumors of different subgroups, as defined by size or histology, were significantly related to the pial supply in each subset. Thus, pial blood supply may be associated with the development of PTBE in meningiomas.</jats:p>",

The response of zoobenthos was studied during 1970–1990 as part of a long‐term monitoring program, including annual sampling at 15 fixed stations with very different environmental conditions (elevation, sediment grain size) on Balgtand, a 50‐km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> tidal flat area. The total zoobenthic stock in the affected area roughly doubled within 2 yr after the doubling of the stock of planktonic algae. However, the magnitude of the response differed from station to station. We tested the hypothesis that a strong positive response would occur particularly at stations where food could be limiting, i.e. where zoobenthic food demand was high relative to food supply. Biomass increases of zoobenthos in the order of a doubling were indeed restricted to the part of Balgzand characterized already in the 1970s by high biomass values. The zoobenthic biomass hardly increased in two areas of Balgzand with relatively low values for zoobenthic biomass and species richness. In these impoverished areas environmental conditions are harsh and the benthic communities are dominated by small opportunistic species. One of these areas is characterized by a high intertidal elevation (short daily inundation periods) combined with a sheltered location near the coast (resulting in muddy sediments), the other by severe exposure to currents and wind (rasultinh in mobile sands with silt and organic‐matter contents) due to its offshore position. We conclude that food limitation only existed in the midshore communities living under relatively mild abiotic conditions. Apparently, the benthic consumer populations benefitted from eutrophication‐induced enhancement of their food supply by enlargement of their stocks only where they were not too stressed by unfavorable abiotic conditions.</jats:p>",

After 3 weeks of collecting the faecal and renal excretions the animals were killed. True absorption and endogenous faecal excretions were determined by the isotope‐dilution technique after an injection of <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se at day 7 of the experiment.</jats:p><jats:p>True absorption and endogenous faecal excretion of Se averaged 96% and 7% of intake irrespective of the Se supply. Renal excretions accounted for 12% of intake between dietary Se levels of 40 and 100 ng/g, increased abruptly to 32% at 150 ng/g, rose degressively to a maximum of 68% at 1000 ng/g and fell to 63% at highest Se intake. The Se retention was proportional to Se intake up to dietary Se levels of 100 ng/g, remained constant up to 200 ng/g and then increased at rising extent as dietary Se rose.</jats:p><jats:p>The tissue Se concentrations increased with rising dietary Se contents, especially between 40 and 150 ng/g and between 1000 and 3000 ng/g. The most pronounced changes were observed in the liver which acted as Se storage. In brain, testes and hair the Se concentrations remained constant except at highest Se supply.</jats:p><jats:p>Rising Se intake intensified the elimination of injected <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se mainly via urine and reduced the final whole body <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se activity from 88% of injected dose at 40 ng/g to 7% at 3000 ng/g. Below 150 ng/g the contribution of liver <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se to whole body <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se was reduced in favour of testes and other tissues. At high Se supply, the <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se contribution of skeletal muscles increased. This may indicate the existence of a slow exchanging or immobile Se compartment within this tissue. The recovery of injected <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se was complete irrespective of the level of Se supply. Se exhalations were therefore not of quantitative importance.</jats:p><jats:p>The GSH‐Px activity in blood plasma increased degressively with rising Se supply. Due to its continuous change the GSH‐Px activity could not be used to identify the transition from a deficient to a sufficient dietary Se supply.</jats:p><jats:p>In conclusion, the homeostatic control of Se metabolism is based on the urinary Se excretion. The onset of this regulation at dietary Se levels between 100 and 150 ng/g indicates the transition of a deficient to a sufficient dietary Se supply. The compensatory capacity of Se homeostasis seems to be overloaded at dietary Se contents above 600 ng/g.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Homöostatische Anpassung des Se‐Stoffwechsels sowie des Gewebeselens an eine über einen weiten Bereich hinweg variierende Se‐ Versorgung <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se‐markierter Ratten</jats:italic></jats:p><jats:p>32 wachsende Ratten erhielten restriktiv 10 semisynthetische Diäten, deren Se‐Gehalte mit NaSelenit auf 40, 70, 100, 150, 200, 300, 450, 600, 1000 bzw. 3000 ng/g eingestellt waren. Die Kot‐ und Harnausscheidungen wurden quantitativ gesammelt und die Tiere nach 3 Wochen getötet. Die wahre Absorption und endogene fäkale Exkretion wurde über die Isotopen‐Verdünnungsmethode nach Injektion von <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se am 7. Versuchstag ermittelt.</jats:p><jats:p>Die wahre Absorption und endogene fäkale Exkretion von Selen betrug unabhängig von der Höhe der Se‐Versorgung 96% bzw. 7% der Se‐Aufnahme. Die renale Se‐Exkretion ereichte zwischen 40 bis 100 ng/g im Mittel 12% der Se‐Aufnahme, nahm bei 150 ng/g sprunghaft zu (32%), stieg degressiv bis auf maximal 68% bei 1000 ng/g und sank in der höchsten Se‐Stufe wieder auf 63% ab. Der Se‐Ansatz verhielt sich bis 100 ng/g proportional zur Se‐Aufnahme, hielt bis 200 ng/g ein Plateau und stieg bei weiterer Erhöhung der Se‐Versorgung überproportional an.</jats:p><jats:p>Die Se‐Konzentrationen im Gewebe stiegen mit zunehmendem Se‐Gehalt der Diät insbesondere im Bereich zwischen 40 und 150 ng/g sowie 1000 und 3000 ng/g. Die stärksten Verschiebungen traten in der Leber auf, die als Se‐Speicher fungierte. In Gehirn, Hoden und Haaren blieben die Se‐Konzentration außer in der höchsten Se‐Stufe unverändert.</jats:p><jats:p>Steigende Se‐Aufnahmen verstärkten die Elimination des injizierten <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se insbesondere über den Harn. Die Restaktivität im Ganzkörper sank dadurch von 88% der injizierten Dosis bei 40 ng/g auf 7% bei 3000 ng/g. Unterhalb von 150 ng/g war der Anteil der <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se‐Aktivität der Leber an der <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se‐Aktivität des Ganzkörpers zugunsten von Hoden und anderen Geweben vermindert. Bei hoher Se‐Versorgung nahm der relative Anteil der <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se‐Aktivität der Skelettmuskulatur zu, was auf die Existenz eines langsam austauschenden oder immobilen Se‐Kompartiments hinweist. Die Wiederfindung des injizierten <jats:sup>75</jats:sup>Se war bei allen Se‐Stufen vollständig. Exhalationen an Se hatten demnach keine quantitative Bedeutung.</jats:p><jats:p>Die Aktivität der GSH‐Px im Blutplasma nahm mit steigendem Se‐Gehalt der Diät degressiv zu. Aufgrund ihrer kontinuierlichen Reaktion war die Aktivität der GSH‐Px zur Ermittlung des Übergangs von einer defizitären zu einer bedarfsdeckenden Se‐Versorgung ungeeignet.</jats:p><jats:p>Die Ergebnisse zeigen, daß die homöostatische Regulation des Se‐Stoffwechsels über die renale Exkretion erfolgt. Der Beginn dieser Regulation bei einer Se‐Versorgung zwischen 100 und 150 ng/g markiert den Übergang von Se‐Mangel zur Bedarfsdeckung. Andererseits scheint die homöostatische Kompensationskapazität bei einem Selengehalt der Diät über 600 ng/g überlastet zu sein.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

A dynamic optimization technique is used to predict production and estimate shadow prices of processing capacity constraints and annual allowable cut restrictions. Models for large, medium, and small tenure holders are formulated reflecting the different cost structures of different sized firms. Results indicate that all categories of quota holders incur substantial costs due to institutional constraints, and that eliminating both types of constraints simultaneously reduces costs much more than the combined savings from eliminating each type of constraint individually.</jats:p>",

A <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N labelled grass meal‐beer yeast suspension was continuously infused into the abomasum over a period of 1 week. Subsequently, over a period of 4 days, the <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N excess in D<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, J and I digesta was related to <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N excess in blood plasma TCA soluble N.
