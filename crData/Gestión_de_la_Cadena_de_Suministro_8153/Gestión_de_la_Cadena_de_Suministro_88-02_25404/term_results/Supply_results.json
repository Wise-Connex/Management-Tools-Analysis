The proposals are for application level protocols within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) framework: an ILL Service Definition and an ILL Protocol Specification are being developed, and should reach the Draft Proposal stage late in 1988. The Service Definition lists 21 services required for ILL, defining standard messages to be interchanged during the ILL process, and also defining the data elements to be included in the messages. Time sequence diagrams and transaction states are included. The Protocol Specification defines the data elements to be included in each Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) as structured data types described using ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation Number 1). The protocol is now being modified to reflect the needs of union catalogue organizations and other intermediaries. Implementation of the protocol will depend upon organizations' ability to adapt their current (largely manual) ILL operations to automated systems for both requesting and responding libraries, and upon international acceptance of standardized ILL messages. Much progress remains to be made.</jats:p>",

Library users have been trained by librarians to be passive and to expect delays in their requests for information. This attitude springs from acceptance of interlibrary loan as a moral precept rather than a pragmatic commodity, an idea which now conflicts with librarians' responsibilities as managers of an accountable resource. Accepting the premise that resource sharing is the priority of the future, librarians must determine ILL costs honestly, in order to provide the supplier with a fair incentive. They must shape their procedures to the needs of their clients and they must allow for ILL as an alternative to purchase in their acquisition budgets. Since ILL is only another form of acquisition (albeit ‘temporary acquisition’) it is both irrational and unfair to charge clients for this service. If ILL is worth doing, it is worth doing well, ensuring timely, high quality service. ILL should take its place as a normal and necessary element of any library's acquisition policy: no library is an island.</jats:p>",

Within the last 5 years Canadian libraries have increasingly abandoned telex in favour of electronic mail when sending ILL requests. An OSI based ILL protocol has been developed by the National Library of Canada and automated systems using this protocol are now being implemented, with the help of information gained from an informal ILL survey conducted by the author in 1987. The National Library of Canada's protocol supported automated ILL system includes all functions required for location, lending and borrowing activities. Benefits of this system include better control of requests and greater efficiency due to standardization of procedures, also the optimization of resources and more cost‐effective use of staff time, resulting in an ILL service which operates with increased effectiveness. However, there still remains room for substantial research and development in the areas of directories, information retrieval, invoicing protocols, electronic document delivery and service management before technology's potential can be fully harnessed.</jats:p>",

The paper also introduces a new version of the row coefficient model, conceived as the “mirror image” of the Chenery‐Moses demand‐side column coefficient MRIO model. Given that the conventional supply‐side input‐output model has been shown to perform equally as well as the demand side model in forecasting exercises, the supply‐side MRIO model is expected to be of value for policy and planning purposes. Moreover, this model is of potential theoretical value for a broad synthesis of demand‐side and supply‐side MRIO models.</jats:p>",

For the first time since the voluntary donor system replaced the commercial blood system, there are widespread doubts about the ability of blood suppliers to meet the nation's increasing health care demands. This paper presents a framework for analyzing blood collection. First, we critique the existing literature on blood collection, arguing that its focus on donor motivation is difficult to integrate with policy analysis. We then present a specific model of the individual's decision to donate blood as a comparison of the costs and benefits of donating. The current system of collecting whole blood relies on donors receiving only altruistic benefits. We explore the limits of this approach to dealing with the quantity and quality problems presented by the AIDS virus. Alternative approaches to blood collection which allow personal benefitssuch as donor designation or monetary paymentsmay be necessary to supply the nation's blood demands in the future.</jats:p>",

In the second experiment N/P ratios of 6/1, 10/1, 15/1, 17/1, 20/1 and 25/1 were applied at two different N,P levels. Root length and number were determined using a digitizer connected to a computer. In the first experiment. the 6/1 N/P ratio gave the largest plants at day 14, and growth decreased with decreasing N/P ratio, The same pattern was found fur lateral root length and root number (seminal and lateral). In the second experiment the root weights decreased with increasing N/P ratio within each level. Lateral root number and overall length decreased with increasing N/P ratio at both levels as did the average lateral root length at the high N,P level. At the low N.P level, average lateral root length was about the same at all N/P ratios. Increasing the N/P ratio increased net uptake of P at the low N,P level, but decreased net P uptake at the high N,P level. Net P uptake increased with increasing P concentration in the roots and then decreased with further increase in P concentration. Net P uptake based on calculated root length [m (g root)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>] showed no significant deviation from weight‐based uptake plots. The effect of N and P on root structure is discussed as well as the interaction of N and P in P uptake. The relevance of a proper basis for expressing root activity is stressed.</jats:p>",

N03-N residues from rape in October exceeded those from oats by 60, 50 and 40 kg N/ha respectively in the 3 years. Previous crops affected development only in the 1984–5 season. The first 12 apical primordia were initiated faster after rape; thereafter rates were similar, wheat after rape having two more primordia than wheat after oats. Final numbers of leaves and spikelets were each increased by one. The first five leaves appeared faster after rape so that from December onwards the number of emerged leaves was one more after rape than after oats. The double ridge and terminal spikelet stages occurred 8 and 4 days respectively earlier after rape than after oats. Development was unaffected by N fertilizer applied in November or at various times from February onwards, although growth and N uptake were increased. Drought during autumn 1985 delayed emergence of the September-sown wheat and slowed the rates of initiation of the first ten primordia and appearance of the first four leaves. Consequently the number of shoots per plant in December was only about three cf. six in the other 2 years.</jats:p>",

The main question was: how and through which organizations is information supplied, on what subjects related to dental health? A group was formed, consisting of 182 organizations and institutions and 85% decided to collaborate with the study. Telephone interviews were used for the sampling of the data. Of the 154 organizations and institutions only 56% reported to be active in the field of DHI. Preventive information appears to be the main subject. Not the public, but dental professionals and other provider groups are seen as the main target groups. DHI activities appear to consist mainly of providing written information material with a preventive content. These activities are hardly evaluated. Further on: there seems to be no central coordination for DHI activities in the Netherlands. It is concluded that in the field of DHI activities the resource system (organizations and institutions who generate information) and the users system (the public and dental patients) are not in accordance with each other.</jats:p>",

The community obtained its water from two main reservoirs (A and B) and an auxiliary reservoir (C). Potable water was chlorinated but not filtered. The incidence of illness peaked approximately two weeks after the city began obtaining a major portion of its water from reservoir C, which had not been used for three years. The attack rate of giardiasis for residents of areas supplied by reservoir C was 14.3/1000, compared with 7.0/1000 in areas that received no water from reservoir C. A case-control study showed that persons with giardiasis were more likely to be older and to have drunk more municipal water than household controls. A community telephone survey indicated that over 3,800 people could have had diarrhea that might have been caused by Giardia, and 95 per cent of households were either using alternate sources of drinking water or boiling municipal water. Environmental studies identified Giardia cysts in the water of reservoir C. Cysts were also detected in the two other reservoirs supplying the city, but at lower concentrations. This investigation highlights the risk of giardiasis associated with unfiltered surface water systems. </jats:p>",
