      "abstract": "<jats:p>The influence of soil structure, determined visually, was the same with low and high N dressings. Poor structure was associated with great response to N; yields without N were remarkably low and higher optimum amounts of N were found with poor structures than with favourable ones. Differences in soil structure accounted for only a small part of the variation in N response (4.2-23.5 tons/ha) in old arable fields receiving no manure and pH and sowing date played a part. The structure of the marine-clay soils studied can best be characterized by the amount of large pores. (Abstract retrieved from CAB Abstracts by CABIâ€™s permission)</jats:p>"
