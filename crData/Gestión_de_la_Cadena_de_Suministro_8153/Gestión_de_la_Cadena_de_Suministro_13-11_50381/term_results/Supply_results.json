Results from a regression-discontinuity design reveal that larger federal transfers lead to a significant expansion of local public preschool services, but show no effects on the quantity or quality of private provision. These findings are consistent with a theory in which households differ in willingness to pay for preschool services, and private suppliers optimally adjust prices in response to an expansion of lower-quality, free-of-charge public supply.</jats:p>"

There have been no sufficient data and measurements underground, and that problem has been mitigated by using direct simulation of groundwater age. This paper has been motivated by the work of Daniel J. Goode, defining a rather different approach. A numerical model has been developed, using the Lagrangian approach and random walk particle tracking method, where groundwater age is calculated as a summed-up travelling time of certain particles. Basic input of this method is flow calculation; hence, in order to get the groundwater age simulation, an upgrade has been done to the existing software. Synthetic examples have been simulated for homogeneous, layered, as well as for low and medium heterogeneous aquifer systems. A stochastic analysis of heterogeneous aquifers has been done using a Monte Carlo simulation method. The results are given as groundwater age fields. Application of such an approach lays in possible estimation of the expected groundwater age at a certain location of water intake. Therefore, the calculated probability assumptions may be used as a decision support tool in cases of groundwater pollution, estimation of the level of aquifer's auto-purification, or in events where applying certain level of water treatment prior to usage is needed.</jats:p>",

A typical design would use a high pressure tank of gas (e.g. helium) along with a mechanical pressure regulator to deliver a constant pressure flow. An alternative concept for the vapor source is to use a tank containing a saturated liquid-vapor mixture. As the vapor is drawn off of the top of the tank, the temperature of the mixture is controlled to maintain the desired vapor delivery pressure. The potential advantage of this approach is that the vapor supply system can be designed to be lighter, more compact, and safer.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An experiment was designed to test the practicality of this concept in a small scale system. Carbon dioxide was chosen for the saturated mixture due to its availability, safety, and desirable operating pressures near ambient temperature levels. The apparatus was designed to allow for the measurement of relevant temperatures and pressures over a range of vapor delivery flow rates. Temperature control of the supply tank was accomplished by submergence in an ice bath. The experimental results confirm that this type of system can produce a well regulated vapor supply at low flow rates, but fails to produce steady pressures at higher delivery flows due to limitations of the heat transfer process in the supply tank.</jats:p>",

A key challenge was there were three long written assignments weighted at 90% of the course spread throughout 15 weeks (the final exam in week 16 was weighted at 10%). The secondary goal was to explore if Moodle could facilitate the online assessment of the three project management plans (PPs). A PP was approximately 25 single-spaced pages, based on a unique initiative for each of the 45 students, and it was evaluated against nine Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) standards as well as other course learning objectives. The PMBOK lectures were classroom-based, data collection was field- based for authentic experiential learning while the LMS was essential for material sharing and assignment management. Interrater reliability, correlation and pair-wise t-test estimates supported the hypotheses. Peer assessments were found to be reliable between students and consistent with the professor's evaluations. Moodle's workshop module was effective but there were two minor shortcomings: (1) reliabilities must be estimated manually, and (2) there was only one rudimentary algorithm in Moodle to calculate the student rater grade for peer assessment quality.</jats:p>"

Out of the 300 million urban dwellers in India, 22.6% reside in slums. This paper aims to examine the sanitation conditions of slums in the city of Mumbai. About 6.9 million slum dwellers are residing in almost 2000 slum pockets in Mumbai, which constitutes 54% of the population of the city. Most of the slum households depend on inadequate public toilet facilities of very poor quality. Efforts and investments in sanitation have failed to alleviate the situation, as the local population has not been involved. Only recently a demand-driven approach has been applied largely inspired by experiences in rural sanitation programmes. Still supply-driven initiatives by short-term political interests are, to some extent, eroding the resources available for sanitation. However, experiences from the last decade locally and globally, reveal that the demand-driven model is a way forward.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply of water for rural populations in developing countries continues to present enormous problems, particularly where there is arsenic contamination in the groundwater, as exists over significant parts of Bangladesh. In response, improvements in the sustainability of water supplies are feasible through the use of a combination of water sources wherein rainwater harvesting is employed for a portion of the year. This can potentially reduce the duration of the year during which arsenic-contaminated groundwater is utilized. As demonstrated, a rainwater cistern volume of 0.5 m3 in the Jessore district area of Bangladesh can provide rainwater for periods averaging 266 days of the year, which allows groundwater at 184 µg/L arsenic to be used as a water supply for the remainder of the year. This dual supply approach provides the body burden equivalent to the interim drinking water guideline of arsenic concentration of 50 µg/L for 365 days of the year (assuming the water consumption rate is 4 L/cap/day for a family of five with a rainwater collection area of 15 m2). If the water use rate is 20 L/cap/day, the same cistern can provide water for 150 days of the year; however, although this is insufficient to supply water to meet the body burden equivalent guideline of 50 µg/L. Results are provided also for different rooftop areas, sizes of cisterns and alternative arsenic guidelines [World Health Organization (WHO) and Bangladeshi]. These findings provide useful guidelines on supply options to meet sustainability targets of water supply. However, they also demonstrate that the use of cisterns cannot assist the meeting of the 10 µg/L WHO target arsenic body burden, if the arsenic contamination in the groundwater is high (e.g., at 100 µg/L).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The characteristics of ozone decomposition inside the nano-pores of ceramic membranes were identified according to nano-reactor configuration. Three types of ceramic membranes with a pore size of 50 nm were tested with compositions of Al2O3, MnO2/Al2O3 (4%) and CeO2/Al2O3 (4%) respectively. The results showed that the specific decomposition rate of ozone inside membrane pores was 428 times higher than that in pure water outside the pores. The influences of pH values or H2O2 dosages on ozone decomposition in bulk water can be explained on the basis of chain reactions or hydroxyl-radical mechanism; however, these did not work for the behaviours inside the nano-pores of membranes. The extents of the influences of NO3−, SO42− and Ca2+ were even opposite inside to outside the nano-pores of membranes. A unique configuration of nano-reactors within the ceramic membranes tested was proposed based on zeta potentials and water molecule-clusters. Inner charge layer and highly ordered water clusters might play critical roles for the reaction processes inside the nano-reactors.</jats:p>",

However, minimization of the chlorine residual requires stricter control of biodegradable organics in finished water to ensure biological stability during water distribution. In this context, we investigated the improvement of biological stability of drinking water by nanofiltration (NF). The removal of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) was 52% on average, but showed large seasonal variation. It was found to be difficult to maintain the acceptable AOC level for biologically stable water by NF. In addition, significant bacterial regrowth in NF permeates was still observed without chlorination, although 52% AOC was removed. Then, the chlorine concentration required to prevent bacterial regrowth during distribution of nanofiltrated water was determined using continuous-flow reactor systems. The heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) densities in biofilm were monitored at different chlorine conditions. The results indicated that the NF process could significantly reduce the chlorine requirement of the finished water. The relationship between free chlorine residual and HPC in biofilm formed from 1 μgC AOC showed that a trace level of chlorine residual, &amp;lt;0.1 mg/L, could inactivate heterotrophic bacteria and prevent biofilm formation.</jats:p>",

This paper looks at a partnership between water operators in the Netherlands and Malawi to see to what extent institutional experiences in the Netherlands can contribute to capacity development of the Lilongwe Water Board in Malawi. For this, it combines insights from policy transfer, with a conceptual framework based on the Institutional Analysis and Development framework. Stylized game theoretic models are used to analyze in-depth the institutional (dis)incentives that contribute to improved performance for customers. Experiences in the Netherlands are analyzed by studying four specific action situations, such as asset management at drinking water company Vitens NV. Potential lessons are derived from this, which are evaluated for potential transfer to Malawi. The analysis suggests ways in which improved information gathering and data management can support allocation of investment and budgets for operation and maintenance. Furthermore, it suggests ways to increase the frequency of encounters between government and financing institutions and water utilities, as well as the use of a system of benchmarking to provide a platform for sharing best practices and to create competition.</jats:p>",

Our findings show the stronger effect of the partisan component vis-à-vis other factors, resulting in further proof of the main role that parties play in influencing voters’ positions on the left–right scale, as long as they constitute the main and most visible actors around which electoral competition develops. Moreover, there are significant variations among countries regarding the impact of the partisan component, principally stemming from the degree of ideological polarization in party systems. </jats:p>",

Within an integrated framework, we are interested in modeling the decisions of a builder in terms of when, where, what type, and how much built space to build. We present a multidimensional discrete-continuous model formulation for the built space supply decisions that are based on expected profit maximization. The framework is applied to estimate a model for supply of new office space in the greater Toronto area (GTA) for the 1986 to 2006 period. To our knowledge, this work is the first that models the where, when, how much, and what type of office space to build in a single econometric framework at a fairly disaggregate spatial zoning system. The results indicate risk taker behavior on the builders’ part, while market conditions and supply of resources (labor, construction cost, etc.) are also found to be important factors in decision making.</jats:p>"

We develop a conceptual model and use 1981–1986 Current Population Survey data to estimate the policy’s labor supply effects. Our estimates suggest that the approximate 20 percent reduction in benefits for the highest income individuals led to a two to five percentage point increase in their labor force participation. Using 2008 data, we show that failing to index the taxation thresholds for inflation, adding a second set of thresholds in 1993, and removing the earnings test in 2000 all substantially magnify the policy’s scope. </jats:p>",

The lean concept is employed to investigate the wastes and to propose alternative methods for eliminating them. The value stream mapping technique (VSM) is used as a tool to identify non-value added activities in the supply chain. There are three main steps for this research, 1) create a supply chain model for latex industry, 2) assess the current state of the supply chain by evaluating value added (VA), non-value added (NVA) activities and the total supply chain cost, 3) move toward the future state by analyzing root causes and identifying countermeasures to eliminate wastes. The result indicates that the largest percentage of the total systemwide cost is the storage cost of raw materials and finished goods, which is accounted for 58.35%. The further research will be created forecasting technique and design collecting point field latex for reduce labor cost in supply chain.\nKeywords Lean Supply Chain Management, Latex Industry, Cost Reduction</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On a global level, water has become a commodity that is no longer taken for granted. Whether it is due to determining the rights to water, or determining the channeling of water with dams to create reservoirs for consumption, water violence has become a reality. Many believe that intelligence is correlated with water consumption, and that six to eight glasses of water a day contribute to cognitive functioning of individuals (Garchik, 1999; Howard-Jones, 2008). Significant contention had developed between users of water for agriculture, industry, and households. Such environmental conflict situations tend to be both challenging and convoluted. These situations are affected by the difference in priorities of the stakeholders and resource management decisions (Walker, Daniels, &amp; Emborg, 2008). As a result, solutions can be quite complicated and difficult to resolve.</jats:p>"

It seeks to reduce the total systemwide cost by reducing wastes throughout the supply chain. Value stream mapping is used to identify non value added activities in the chain. Four major stakeholders are included: rubber grower, minor collector, major collector, and manufacturer. Four study steps are involved: 1) collection of data for a supply chain model constructed; 2) creation of a value stream map and identification of non value added activities; 3) analysis of root causes of non value added activities, or wastes, identified in the first two steps; and 4) proposal of practical guidelines to reduce or eliminate the wastes. Results show that transportation contributes the second highest cost after personnel cost, but is more practical to be trimmed. Hub-spoke concept along with vehicle routing analysis is recommended to be further explored in depth for practical implementation.</jats:p>"

However, to date, there are no studies that address these topics. In this study, groundwater samples from dug wells were collected during the dry and wet seasons from 2009 to 2012, and Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms were analysed. Three wells were monitored each month for a year. Microbial concentrations in shallow groundwater were significantly higher during the wet season than during the dry season. Analyses of rainfall and E. coli concentrations in different seasons indicated that a high level of faecal material infiltration during the rainy season may have caused the seasonal variations in microbial quality. A moderate to strong relationship between E. coli concentrations and groundwater level suggested that the rise in groundwater levels during the wet season may be another reason for this variation. This long time-scale survey detected a significant decline in the microbial quality of shallow groundwater during the wet season as compared with the dry season. We propose that the infiltration of contaminants and change in groundwater level are the two probable mechanisms for the observed seasonal differences.</jats:p>",

However, desalination could be interrupted by natural hazards such as cyclones or harmful algal blooms. Four scenarios have been considered to help public institutions in Muscat to establish a water strategy for emergency situations. The numerical simulations of groundwater pumping have shown that the aquifer can supply emergency water in a safe way without any apparent risk of seawater intrusion to the Al-Khod Aquifer. The results show that Muscat can be easily supplied by emergency groundwater for up to 10 consecutive days with volumes varying between 24 and 71 l/cap/day at a low cost of US$0.18 per m3. Covering up to 66% of the total regular demand during an emergency is technically feasible but would bring the cost up to US$1.49 per m3 for groundwater and a cost of US$38.6 per m3 for storage reservoirs made of concrete. The cost per m3 of using concrete reservoirs is close to the market price of bottled water. Finally, the Public Authority for Electricity and Water might think of decentralizing the water storage at house levels by requiring new houses to be equipped with reservoirs on the roofs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology (IT) enablement helps in improving the agri-based Indian economy by focusing on supply-chain systems. This article aims at finding out the enablers of e-Applications in the Indian agri-food supply chain. Enablers were identified using secondary sources. These enablers were checked for relevance using a questionnaire that was surveyed among experts. Mutual relationship was developed among these enablers using interpretive structural modelling (ISM). ISM is applied to present a multilevel hierarchical model of identified enablers and a digraph, which shows their driving power and dependence. The study shows that there are certain enablers having strong driving power. From the hierarchy model, the enabler ‘continuously decreasing cost of hardware’ was found to have maximum driving power, which will further support other enablers for implementing IT applications in supply chain of Indian agri-food industries. All these enablers have their strategic importance for promoting usage of IT to serve the people and to improve the Indian agrarian economy. The paper is a blend of theoretical and practical applications, which employs structural analysis to draw an interventional roadmap to facilitate e-Applications in a supply chain. This paper provides a useful tool to supply-chain managers to differentiate between independent and dependent variables of e-Application interventions and their mutual relationship, which would help them to focus on those key variables that are most important for effective e-Applications in the agri-food supply chain. The IT enablers presented in a hierarchy model with their driving power and dependence rate is a unique effort made by the researcher in the area of Indian agri-food supply-chain management system. The use of IT is very useful for the common good of the society, which is not possible unless agriculture sector of India uses it for maximum benefit. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Emerging global supply chains not only increased efficiency in production and delivery but also natural-disaster risks. Based on two recent major natural disasters in Japan and Thailand, this article discusses the increasing natural disaster risks due to the development of global supply chains and identifies the impact of natural disasters on global supply chains. The results indicate that the risk of natural disasters is not confined by geographical boundaries, as negative effects can spill over globally throughout the supply chains and affect all the entities involved including firms, governments, financial institutions and end consumers. The article argues that enhancing disaster resilience becomes increasingly important in this context for maintaining the competitiveness of firms and the health and strength of the whole economy. Both firms and governments need to take disaster risks into consideration in supply-chain management to avoid supply-chain disruptions and subsequent negative effects. The article proposes some strategies to build resilient supply chains against natural disasters, emphasizing collaboration between the public and private sectors. </jats:p>",

Tests were carried out over a duration of 6 months in the presence and absence of disinfectants (chlorine and chlorine dioxide) at realistic doses and contact times. None of the three systems exhibited Fickian-type diffusion for BPA. Leaching was quite low for two epoxies while the third showed a trend of increasing leaching during the first 5 months of immersion. BPA was only observed in the absence of disinfectant while no BPF was observed under any condition. 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP), a BPA chlorination by-product was sporadically observed in the chlorinated water during the first months of contact. Following discontinuation of the disinfectants, its release was significantly enhanced in the water having been exposed to chlorinated water. Laboratory leaching tests also indicated rapid oxidation of epoxies by chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Analysis of 27 epoxy-coated drinking water storage tanks did not reveal any BPA, BPF or TCP. On the other hand, a large-scale examination of about 200 pipe sections rehabilitated with epoxies during the 1990s led to a high frequency of BPA and BPF detection, sometimes with maximum values around 1 μg/L.</jats:p>",

A simulation framework has been developed for the scale-adaptive hydraulic and chlorine decay modelling under steady- and unsteady-state flows. An unsteady decay coefficient is defined which depends upon the absolute value of shear stress and the rate of change of shear stress for quasi-unsteady and unsteady-state flows. By coupling novel instrumentation technologies for continuous hydraulic monitoring and water quality sensors for in-pipe water quality sensing a pioneering experimental and analytical investigation was carried out in a water transmission main. The results were used to model monochloramine decay and these demonstrate that the dynamic hydraulic conditions have a significant impact on water quality deterioration. The spatial and temporal resolution of experimental data provides new insights for the near real-time modelling and management of water quality as well as highlighting the uncertainty and challenges of accurately modelling the loss of disinfectant in water supply networks.</jats:p>",

Over the past few years, the determination of suitable cost-effectiveness criteria in the supply chain has become a key strategic issue. However, the nature of these kinds of decisions is usually complex and unstructured. Many quantitative and qualitative factors must be considered to determine the suitable criteria. As the human decision-making process usually contains fuzziness and vagueness, a hierarchy of MADM model based on fuzzy-sets theory is used in this research. Using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), the weights of criteria and subcriteria are determined and then the final ranking is determined by technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Finally, fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) is employed to compare the results with classic TOPSIS. This paper concludes that the subcriteria in all the items are in the same rank.</jats:p>",

Though there have been considerable amount of study of SCM, there have been very limited publications of applying the findings from the biological system study into SCM. In this paper, through systematic literature review, various SCM issues and requirements are discussed and some typical biological system behaviours and natural-inspired algorithms are evaluated for the purpose of SCM. Then the principle and possibility are presented on how to learn the biological systems' behaviours and natural-inspired algorithms for SCM and a framework is proposed as a guide line for users to apply the knowledge learnt from the biological systems for SCM. In the framework, a number of the procedures have been presented for using XML to represent both SCM requirement and bio-inspiration data. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a case study has been presented for users to find the bio-inspirations for some particular SCM problems in automotive industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The South African automotive industry makes an important contribution to the South African economy. However, there are deficiencies within the local automotive component manufacturers’ (ACMs) supplier base and therefore automotive assemblers, or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), have to import many of their parts requirements. These deficiencies are caused by ACMs’ lack of technology, global supply capability, cost competitiveness and their geographic location (ACMs are scattered across the country). A study was conducted to explore the supply chain challenges South African ACMs face and whether the location, size and age of participating ACMs have a bearing on whether they face the same challenges. The results revealed that the most significant supply chain challenges in South Africa were in the customer relationship category. From the hypotheses testing, the conclusion could be drawn that, in general, participating ACMs face common supply chain challenges, irrespective of their location, age and size.This article contributes to the published research on the topic and the findings reveal that business opportunities in the automotive industry exist for entrepreneurs aspiring to enter into the automotive component industry. </jats:p>"

The luxury industry in Italy has been particularly hard hit and most brands nowadays are urgently looking for demand-side and supply-side strategies to track and control the phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to provide a supply chain view of counterfeiting and illegitimate trade phenomena, in a supply chain risk management perspective, to define and illuminate the interaction of the legitimate and the illegitimate supply chains. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper introduces the LISC model to represent and include all the illegitimate trade phenomena under analysis such as pure counterfeiting, factory overruns, grey and parallel market, supply chain infiltrations, product diversion and sale of stolen goods </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The interrelations between legitimate and illegitimate supply chains are crucial to approach counterfeiting issue and define which illegitimate trade paths are more harmful to companies and customers. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The first limitation of the work is that the illegitimate trade categories defined in this paper mainly rely on data and phenomena collected from secondary sources that have not yet been directly observed by the authors. The second one is that a specific focus on high-end fashion industry was employed throughout this work: further analysis for evaluating the applicability and the significance of the illegitimate trade in other industries is still pending. The final limitation stems from the fact that it will be necessary to investigate the implications and the applicability of the model to the illegitimate on-line trade. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – During the course of the MI-FIDO project, the model and the selection rules identified for illegitimate trade family classification were used as a basis for defining the rules for anomalies detection to be included in a “track and trace” system developed the project team currently under with a major Italian fashion brand. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – To the authors\n\t\t\t\t\t'\n\t\t\t\t knowledge, this is the first work that attempts to present a concise and systematic approach to luxury illegitimate trade from a supply chain perspective.

Since KCD aims to improve institutional performance, it is often measured using technical performance targets. This paper cautions about the misleading nature of this measurement. The authors argue that technical performance improvement should be separated from competence development because the latter does not always directly translate into the former in a short time period. Drawing on empirical evidence about the management contract between Aqua Vitens Rand Limited and Ghana Water Company Limited, the paper demonstrates how the process of integrating and using competences is a necessary condition before KCD interventions can result in performance improvement. As this process often takes time, KCD providers and beneficiaries should set realistic performance targets. Not doing so creates unrealistic expectations and often leads to underestimation of the actual impact. This paper finds that knowledge management concepts common in the private sector are equally applicable in the public sector but that the latter may be constrained by short term goals and lack of insight in management processes. It is concluded that technical performance-based assessments should be complemented by capacity-based assessments in order to show fairly the contribution of KCD interventions.</jats:p>",

Each decision made can 'ripple' through supply chains and have serious repercussions that may include causing millions of dollars in damage or triggering a chain of events that degrade the quality of life for people, society, or the environment. We can teach relevant theory and train learners for some situations that do not require immediate responses. However, we remain disadvantaged by the constraints of time and space; observation of a real supply chain is often unpractical, and lengthy times for transports exceeding any class duration. In this paper, we present the nDiVE project which creates a supply chain story to immerse learners, provide an authentic experience in a realistic environment, and apply traditional and advanced gamification mechanisms to engage and motivate learners.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Polygeneration systems produce multiple energy products (i.e. electricity, heat, cooling), and other biochemical products (biofuels and syngas). Such systems offer a sustainable approach in meeting the ever-growing demand of energy, while reducing its environmental impact. The optimal design of such systems should consider the design of the supply-chain in producing the targeted energy products to reduce the resource consumption and waste generation and to maximize its economic potential. One of the important considerations in designing such a system is whether to out-source its raw materials or to produce them in-house. The criteria for such decision strategies are assessed through economics, product demand, and environmental impact. One holistic way to measure the environmental impact of such system is to consider the triple footprint: carbon, water, and land. The objective of this work is to maximize the economic potential while maintaining the footprints at acceptable levels and simultaneously meeting product demands. In this study, an adoption of fuzzy multi-objective approach is presented wherein the economic potential is introduced as a constraint. Moreover, predefined fuzzy trapezoidal-shaped limits for the product demand constraints are used which mimics the probabilistic demand scenario for each of the product streams. Lastly, the triple footprint constrains is utilized to assess the environmental impact of the polygeneration. The technique is demonstrated using a modified industrial case study of a polygeneration system.</jats:p>",

Product modularity, either in concert with or independent of such integration, can also produce flexibility for firms within a supply chain. In this proof‐of‐concept research, we explore whether the supply chain network affects each constituent firm's market valuation and how decisions regarding the level of supply chain integration and the usage of product modularity are associated with the value of the supply chain. We develop a method to identify and measure the supply chain's effect on each constituent firm's market valuation. Results indicate that greater integration is associated with a higher supply chain valuation, whereas increasing aggregated product modularity across the supply chain relates to a lower supply chain value. However, when combined, the interaction of aggregated product modularity and supply chain integration is positively associated with the supply chain's valuation. </jats:p>",

These policies have been oriented to the substitution of gravity irrigation systems for drip technology. The technological change has involved an important investment effort, developed by different public administrations and also the farmers and water users' associations (WUAs). This transformation, has also involved a change in the structure of costs of the WUAs. This paper analyzes the changes in costs and tariffs of irrigation after the important investments made in the modernization of irrigation. The effects of subsidies on the percentage of the cost recovery in the services of water for irrigation are also considered. All of them have developed modernization projects in the recent years. It can be concluded that conflict between two objectives proposed by the Water Framework Directive may exist. On the one hand, significant reductions of water supply are observed; meanwhile, on the other hand, the cost recovery percentage diminishes significantly.</jats:p>",

The virus removal ratios for AlCl3, alum, PACl-1.5, and PACl-1.8 decreased markedly when the pH of the treated water shifted from 6.8 to 7.8, but was high at both pHs for PACl-2.2 and PACl-2.5. PACl-2.5 contains Al13 species and possibly Al30 species, and has a high colloid charge density. It removed viruses more efficiently than the other aluminum-based coagulants, not only at neutral pH, but also under weakly alkaline conditions. Moreover, the in-line coagulation–ceramic MF process with PACl-2.5 pretreatment removed not only viruses but also dissolved organic carbon and UV260-absorbing natural organic matter more efficiently and resulted in a lower residual aluminum concentration than did commercially available PACls, especially under weakly alkaline conditions. A combination of coagulation pretreatment with a high-basicity PACl and ceramic MF can provide effective treatment of drinking water over a broader pH range than is possible with commercially available aluminum-based coagulants.</jats:p>",

For the first case, several alternative realistic routes towards the UK are analysed and the optimal route minimising total carbon emissions is identified and tested in real conditions. For the second case, emissions towards several destinations are calculated and two alternative routes to southern Europe are compared, using several transport modes (road, Ro-Ro, rail and maritime). An adapted Value Stream Mapping (VSM) approach is used to map carbon footprint and calculate emissions; in addition Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) data provided information for vessel specification allowing the use of more accurate emission factors for each shipping leg. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The analysis of the first case demonstrates that end-to-end logistics-related carbon emissions can be reduced by 16-21 per cent through direct delivery to the UK as opposed to transhipment via a Continental European port. The analysis of the second case shows that deliveries to southern Europe have the highest potential for reduction through deliveries by sea. Both cases show that for distant overseas destinations, the maritime leg represents the major contributor to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions in the end-to-end supply chain. It is notable that one of the main apportionment approaches (that of Defra in the UK) generate higher carbon footprints for routes using Ro-Pax vessels, making those not optimal.

Modular design has the potential to bring life cycle considerations into the product architecture decision-making process, yet most current modular design methods lack the capability for assessing module life cycle consequences in a supply chain. This paper proposes a method for product designers, called the architecture and supply chain evaluation method (ASCEM), to find a product modular architecture with both low life cycle costs and low energy consumption at the early design stages. ASCEM expands the assessment scope from the product's architecture to its supply chain network. This work analyzes the life cycle costs (LCCs) and energy consumption (LCEC) of two products designated within the European Union's directive on waste of electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) within a closed-loop supply chain to identify the most beneficial modular structure. In addition, data on 27 theoretical cases representing various products are analyzed to show the broader applicability of the proposed methodology. Our analysis shows that ASCEM can efficiently identify a good-quality modular structure having low LCC and LCEC in a closed-loop supply chain for both the two tested products and the hypothetical cases.</jats:p>",

We also compared the impacts of using different land quality (productive and marginal) for feedstock production, feedstocks (eucalyptus and switchgrass), final conversion technologies (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">XtY</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CXtY</jats:styled-content>) and markets (the Netherlands and Mozambique). At current conditions, the torrefied pellets (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TOPs</jats:styled-content>) are delivered in Rotterdam at higher cost (7.3–7.5 $/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content>) than pellets (5.1–5.3 $/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content>). In the long term, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TOPs</jats:styled-content> costs could decline (4.7–5.8 $/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ</jats:styled-content>) and converge with pellets. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TOPs</jats:styled-content> supply chains also incur 20% lower greenhouse gas (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GHG</jats:styled-content>) emissions than pellets. Due to improved logistics and lower conversion investment, fuel production costs from <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TOPs</jats:styled-content> are lower (12.8–16.9 $/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ<jats:sub>FT</jats:sub></jats:styled-content>) than from pellets (12.9–18.7 $/<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">GJ<jats:sub>FT</jats:sub></jats:styled-content>). Co‐firing scenarios (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CXtY</jats:styled-content>) result in lower cost fuel (but a higher environmental penalty) than 100% biomass fired scenarios (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">XtY</jats:styled-content>). In most cases, switchgrass and the productive region of Nampula provide the lowest fuel production cost compared to eucalyptus and the marginally productive Gaza region. Both <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> and ion in Mozambique are more costly than in Rotterdam. For the Netherlands, both <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> and power production are competitive against average energy costs in Western Europe. The analysis shows that large‐scale bioenergy production can become competitive against fossil fuels. While the benefits of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TOPs</jats:styled-content> are apparent in logistics and conversion, the current higher torrefaction costs contribute to higher biofuel costs. Improvements in torrefaction technology can result in significant performance improvements over the future chain. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

Using historical sources, it examines how a committee of influential citizens established, managed and implemented the project. It also explores how the committee relied on the great engineers of the time, in particular, Thomas Telford and James Watt, to deliver the project using cutting edge technology which ultimately proved inadequate. This sheds light upon the network of social relations revealed by the correspondence of the protagonists, and explores the physical legacy of these early engineers in a city where these pioneering works have been eclipsed by the later Victorian scheme to draw potable water from Loch Katrine.</jats:p>"

Hereby, titanium materials are suitable for producing patient-individual porous bone scaffolds by using generative techniques. In this in vitro study, the viability of human osteoblasts was investigated in porous 3D Ti6Al4V scaffolds, which were produced by electron-beam (EBM) or laser-beam melting (LBM). For each examination, two cylindrical scaffolds (30 mm × 10 mm in size,  700 µm × 700 µm macropores) were placed on each other and seeded with cells. The oxygen consumption and the acidification in the center of the structures were investigated by means of microsensors. Additionally, the synthesis of pro-collagen type 1 was analyzed. On the LBM titanium scaffolds, vital bone cells were detected in the center and in the periphery after 8 days of cultivation. In the EBM titanium constructs, however, vital cells were only visible in the center. During the cultivation period, the cells increasingly produced procollagen type 1 in both scaffolds. In comparison to the periphery, the oxygen content in the center of the scaffolds slightly decreased. Furthermore, a slight acidification of the medium was detectable. Compared to LBM, the EBM titanium scaffolds showed a less favorable behavior with regard to cell seeding.</jats:p>"

In a cross-functional multiple-case study involving marketing, purchasing, and sustainability executives of five supplier organizations in Central Europe, we explored four distinct approaches for marketing superior CSR management abilities in B2B markets that potentially foster long-term comparative advantages: (1) Fact-based communication of measurable CSR capabilities, (2) targeting of indirect customers and influencers, (3) marketing through education, and (4) marketing of CSR as a service. Moreover, our inductive results provide evidence that the effective marketing of CSR capabilities enhances a supplier’s reputation only if it sends consistent signals to the market. Therefore, a close integration of marketing and purchasing is crucial for achieving signaling consistency. Building on an established framework of purchasing-marketing integration in the particular context of CSR we developed a crossfunctional theory on the link between marketing, supply chain alignment and reputation, which is expressed in four sets of testable research propositions.</jats:p>",

This article aims to understand how institutional arrangements in the supply chain of oil palm fresh fruit bunches (FFB) affect decisions of smallholders to convert more land for oil palm cultivation instead of increasing productivity. Based on an analysis of in-depth interviews with involved actors we find that institutions meant to regulate land conversion are superseded by the structures that govern the transactions in the supply chain of FFB and that this reinforces decisions of smallholders to convert more land. Strategies designed to regulate land conversion need to look carefully at the interactions with the institutions ruling the supply chain of FFB. Institutional innovations such as establishing integrated governance structure from land use to market may induce farmers to focus on increasing productivity. </jats:p>",

The manufacturer produces and ships the retailer's orders with random delay that follows the Coxian‐2 distribution. Assuming lost sales at the retailer and infinite capacity at the manufacturer, we try to explore the performance of the supply chain system. The system is modeled as a continuous‐time Markov process with discrete space. The structure of the transition matrices of these specific systems is categorized as block‐partitioned, and a computational algorithm generates the matrices for different values of system characteristics. The proposed algorithm allows the calculation of performance measures—fill rate, cycle times, average inventory (work in progress [WIP])—from the derivation of the steady‐state probabilities. Moreover, expressions for the holding costs and shortage costs are derived.</jats:p>",

Two methods of reference current generation techniques are employed. In the first scheme, reference current is generated using instantaneous symmetrical component theory under balanced supply conditions. In the second scheme, extended synchronous detection methods such as equal current criterion, equal power criterion and equal impedance criterion are used for reference current generation under unbalanced supply conditions. The control strategy uses three hysteresis current controllers for source current shaping and an outer voltage loop with proportional‐integral controller for load voltage regulation. To validate the proposed method, a prototype controlled by dSPACE signal processor is set up. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed system offers regulated output voltage for wide load variations and provides power factor close to unity.</jats:p>",

Current strategies to ensure availability during increased demand or blood shortages include triaging by restricting supply to clinically urgent cases or deferring elective surgery. However, few data regarding urgency of need for different clinical indications are available. We developed a novel approach to clinical profiling of platelets and plasma to inform supply and contingency planning.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We conducted a random sample survey of platelet and plasma units in the Australian state of Victoria (population 5.3 million). The Australian Red Cross Blood Service produces and distributes all platelets and plasma for the state at a single site. Randomly selected units were tagged with a case report form (CRF) during production and distributed as usual. Institutional blood bank scientists completed the CRF when tagged units were issued for transfusion, reporting recipient demographics, clinical indication for transfusion, and transfusion urgency. Units were tagged over 12 months to minimize seasonal fluctuations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>1252 platelet units were tagged: 752 pooled (60%) and 500 apheresis units (39.9%). This represented 7.6% of issues during the study period (7.4% of pooled and 8.0% of all apheresis platelets). The fate of 1243 platelet units was determined (99.3%). Of these, 94 (7.6%) were discarded during production before issue and were excluded from analysis. 1885 plasma units were tagged, representing 9.6% of units issued. The fate of 1808 units was determined (95.9%).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Transfusion rate for issued platelets was 72.2% (830 units); 71.2% of pooled and 73.7% of apheresis platelets were transfused. Common reasons for discard were expiry (300 units, 26.1%); recall (5, 0.4%), commonly for bacterial flags; and other (14, 1.2%).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Transfusion rate for issued plasma was 87.8% (1587 units). Common reasons for discard were were expiry (48 units, 2.7%), recall (3, 0.2%) and other reasons including breakage and unit thawed but not used (170, 9.4%). Median age of platelets recipients was 58 years (range 0–99); 60.6% were male; for plasma recipients median age was 51 (0-98); 64.1% were male.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>For platelets, the clinical urgency of transfusion was reported to be acute (required within one hour) in 126 cases (15.2%); urgent (required within 24h) 527 (63.5%); semi-urgent (required within one week) 130 (15.7%); non-urgent 2 (0.2%); unreported 45 (5.4%). The most common indications for platelet transfusion were hematological and oncological, together 64% of cases (530 units), comprising acute leukemias 260 (31.3%); lymphoma 59 (7.1%); myeloma 35 (4.2%); non-hematologic malignancies 68 (8.2%). Surgical conditions followed: 25.1% (208) of cases, comprising cardiothoracic 91 (11.0%); urological 30 (3.6%); gastrointestinal 18 (2.2%) and solid organ transplantation 16 (1.9%).

Only 66 platelet units (7.9%) were transfused to support elective surgery.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>For plasma, urgency was reported as acute in 566 (35.7%), urgent in 857 (54.0%); semi-urgent in 84 (5.3%) and non-urgent in 13 (0.8%) and unreported in 67 (4.2%). The most common indications for plasma transfusion were surgical: cardiothoracic 249 cases (15.7%); vascular 87 (5.5%); gastrointestinal 58 (3.7%); orthopedic 29 (1.8%).

For sources based on the concept of dielectric barrier discharges (DBD), electric potentials with amplitudes in the range of some kV are arranged in close proximity to the skin of patients, wherein dielectric strength of the electrodes and leakage currents are crucial for electrical applicability. In this work, ceramic electrodes of 10 mm in diameter and varying ceramic thickness are operated at input powers up to 300 mW against non‐biological counter electrodes. In a combined experimental and numerical approach, electric fields inside the ceramic are determined, whereas values are well below the dielectric strength of the material. The spectrally weighted plasma emission is within limit values of exposure to human skin as long as daily treatment does not exceeded 7 h. Neutral gas temperatures of up to 310 K are determined which underline the minor thermal impact of the plasma exposure. In contrast, values for reduced electric fields are of the order of some hundred Townsend and thus the electrons can initiate various secondary effects such as chemical reaction chains. Consequently, ozone concentrations in the discharges are quantified between 230 ppm and 1140 ppm in close proximity to the actual discharge volume and the results are discussed in the frame of risk assessment for therapeutic applications in dermatology.

Economic network efficiency is based on daily data set collected by the company using about 200 flowmeters of the network. Data collected using these sensors are used by remote control and information storage systems and they are stored in a relational database. All information provided by ATLL is analysed to detect inconsistent data using an automatic data validation method deployed in parallel with the network efficiency evaluation. As a result of the validation process, corrections of flow measurements and of billed water volume are introduced. Results from ATLL water transport network corresponding to year 2010 will be used to illustrate the approach proposed in this paper.</jats:p>",

In this further radiological study we compared the arterial supply of the femoral head in 35 patients (34 men and one woman, mean age 37.1 years (16 to 64)) with a fracture/dislocation of the hip with a historical control group of 55 hips. Using CT angiography, we identified the three main arteries supplying the femoral head: the deep branch and the postero-inferior nutrient artery both arising from the MFCA, and the piriformis branch of the inferior gluteal artery. It was possible to visualise changes in blood flow after fracture/dislocation. </jats:p><jats:p> Our results suggest that blood flow is present after reduction of the dislocated hip. The deep branch of the MFCA was patent and contrast-enhanced in 32 patients, and the diameter of this branch was significantly larger in the fracture/dislocation group than in the control group (p = 0.022). In a subgroup of ten patients with avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head, we found a contrast-enhanced deep branch of the MFCA in eight hips.

Energy harvesting provides a green, cost-friendly and maintenance-free alternative, which has so far virtually exclusively been considered for low-power applications. This study shows a first approach of the incorporation of energy harvesting systems into everyday applications. With Nordic Walking becoming more and more popular and lighting devices being inevitable for the walker to be visible to others, an autonomous lighting device mounted on Nordic Walking poles is a great example to show the capabilities of energy harvesting. To set the framework for the design of such a system, first, the acceleration levels occurring during Nordic Walking are measured. On this basis, two linear electromagnetic generators are designed, implemented and evaluated. The presented generators exhibit maximum power outputs of up to 6.6 mW and are able to light up an ultra-bright light-emitting diode. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To achieve the UK Government's aim of expansion in the growth of perennial energy crops requires farmers to select these crops in preference to conventional rotations. Existing studies estimating the total potential resource have either only simplistically considered the farmer decision‐making and opportunity costs, for example using an estimate of annual land rental charge; or have not considered spatial variability, for example using representative farm types. This paper attempts to apply a farm‐scale modelling approach with spatially specific data to improve understanding of potential perennial energy crop supply. The model main inputs are yield maps for the perennial energy crops, <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> and willow grown as short‐rotation coppice (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRC</jats:styled-content>), and regional yields for conventional crops. These are used to configure location specific farm‐scale models, which optimize for profit maximization with risk aversion. Areas that are unsuitable or unavailable for energy crops, due to environmental or social factors, are constrained from selection. The results are maps of economic supply, assuming a homogenous farm‐gate price, allowing supply cost curves for the UK market to be derived. The results show a high degree of regional variation in supply, with different patterns for each energy crop. Using estimates of yields under climate change scenarios suggests that <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> supply may increase under future climates while the opposite effect is suggested for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRC</jats:styled-content> willow. The results suggest that <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SRC</jats:styled-content> willow is only likely to able to supply a small proportion of the anticipated perennial energy crop target, without increases in market prices. <jats:italic>Miscanthus</jats:italic> appears to have greater scope for supply, and its dominance may be amplified over time by the effects of climate change. Finally, the relationship to the demand side of the market is discussed, and work is proposed to investigate the factors impacting how the market as a whole may develop.</jats:p>",

Public drinking water supply wells typically have long screens and are expected to produce a mixture of groundwater ages. The groundwater age distributions of seven production wells of the Holten well field (Netherlands) were estimated from tritium‐helium (<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H/<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>He), krypton‐85 (<jats:sup>85</jats:sup>Kr), and argon‐39 (<jats:sup>39</jats:sup>Ar), using a new application of a discrete age distribution model and existing mathematical models, by minimizing the uncertainty‐weighted squared differences of modeled and measured tracer concentrations. The observed tracer concentrations fitted well to a 4‐bin discrete age distribution model or a dispersion model with a fraction of old groundwater. Our results show that more than 75% of the water pumped by four shallow production wells has a groundwater age of less than 20 years and these wells are very vulnerable to recent surface contamination. More than 50% of the water pumped by three deep production wells is older than 60 years. <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H/<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>He samples from short screened monitoring wells surrounding the well field constrained the age stratification in the aquifer. The discrepancy between the age stratification with depth and the groundwater age distribution of the production wells showed that the well field preferentially pumps from the shallow part of the aquifer. The discrete groundwater age distribution model appears to be a suitable approach in settings where the shape of the age distribution cannot be assumed to follow a simple mathematical model, such as a production well field where wells compete for capture area.</jats:p>",

Based on the literature, we devised a list of the conditions under which supply‐side interventions may yield positive conservation outcomes. We applied it to the trade of the orchid <jats:roman>Rhynchostylis gigantea</jats:roman>, a protected ornamental plant. We conducted a survey of <jats:roman>R. gigantea</jats:roman> at Jatujak Market in Bangkok, Thailand. Farmed (legal) and wild (illegal, protected) specimens of <jats:roman>R. gigantea</jats:roman> were sold side‐by‐side at market. These results suggest farmed specimens are not being substituted for wild plants in the marketplace. For any given set of physical plant characteristics (size, condition, flowers), the origin of the plants (wild vs. farmed) did not affect price. For all price classes, farmed plants were of superior quality to wild‐collected plants on the basis of most physical variables. These results suggest wild and farmed specimens represent parallel markets and may not be substitutable goods. Our results with <jats:roman>R. gigantea</jats:roman> highlight a range of explanations for why supply‐side interventions may lack effectiveness, for example, consumer preferences for wild‐collected products and low financial incentives for farming. Our results suggest that market‐based conservation strategies may not be effective by themselves and may be best utilized as supplements to regulation and education. This approach represents a broad, multidisciplinary evaluation of supply‐side interventions that can be applied to other plant and animal species.</jats:p><jats:p>Un Marco de Referencia para Evaluar la Oferta de la Conservación de Vida Silvestre</jats:p>",

Here we address this issue by conducting a <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>Be‐budget of detrital materials that characterize the morphogenetic domains representative of high‐altitude environments of the European Alps. We focus on the Etages catchment, located in the Ecrins‐Pelvoux massif (southeast France), and illustrate how <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>Be concentrations can be used for tracing the origin of the sand fraction from the bedload in the trunk stream. The landscape of the Etages catchment is characterized by a geomorphic transient state, high topographic gradients, and a large variety of modern geomorphic domains ranging from glacial environments to scarcely vegetated alluvial plains. Beryllium‐10 concentrations measured in the Etages catchment vary from ~1 × 10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> to 4.5 × 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> atoms per gram quartz, while displaying consistent <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>Be signatures within each representative morphogenetic unit. We show that the basic requirements for inferring catchment‐wide denudation from <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>Be concentration measurements are not satisfied in this small, dynamic catchment. However, the distinct <jats:sup>10</jats:sup>Be signature observed for the geomorphic domains can be used as a tracer. We suggest that a terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) budget approach provides a valuable tool for the tracing of material origin in basins where the ‘let nature do the averaging’ principles may be violated.

Smart city centric strategies are expected to comprise solutions to sustainable environment and urban life. Acting as an indispensable role in smart city, IoT (Internet of Things) connects the executive ability of the physical world and the intelligence of the computational world, aiming to enlarge the capabilities of things in real city and strengthen the practicality of functions in cyber world. One of the important application areas of IoT in cities is food industry. Municipality governors are withstanding all kinds of food safety issues and enduring the hardest time ever due to the lack of sufficient guidance and supervision. IoT systems help to monitor, analyze, and manage the real food industry in cities. In this paper, a smart sensor data collection strategy for IoT is proposed, which would improve the efficiency and accuracy of provenance with the minimized size of data set at the same time. We then present algorithms of tracing contamination source and back tracking potential infected food in the markets. Our strategy and algorithms are evaluated with a comprehensive evaluation case of this IoT system, which shows that this system performs well even with big data as well. </jats:p>",
