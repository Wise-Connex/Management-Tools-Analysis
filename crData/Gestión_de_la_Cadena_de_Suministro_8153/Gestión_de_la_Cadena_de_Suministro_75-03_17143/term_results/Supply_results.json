It is assumed that replenishment may be ordered only at times of periodic review but a provision is made for transfer of stock between the locations at predetermined times within the replenishment cycle. Problems of determining jointly optimal stockage and transfer rules according to the expected total cost criterion are investigated. Under certain regularity conditions, the optimality of a simple class of Base Stock Conserving (BSC) transfer rules is first established. The related optimal stockage rule is then characterized for the single period model of captive sales. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Disputes over the true volume ofunemployment are much more than scientific discussions among experts. Concepts and statistical data regarding employment, unem ployment and employability reflect the conflicting and chang ing orientations, needs and purposes of competing groups and interests. From earliest pre-statistical concerns with the dynamics of the entire population as the source of labor supply, attention shifted to the gainfully occupied concept, which reflected concern with specialization and the occupa tional needs of a developing industrial economy. Recurring cycles of boom and bust, and the dominance of a mass depression with unemployment as the critical problem, resulted in the introduction of the labor force concept which reflected a job scarcity, rationing orientation in its approach to defining unemployment and full employment. The current labor force approach understates the dimensions of un employment by omitting millions of persons who, though not actively seeking employment, wish to work and would be seeking jobs if adequate opportunities and conditions existed. Current attempts to develop new approaches to labor supply reflect the continuing struggle of different groups for greater equality and justice. A consideration of the real dimensions of labor supply is necessary as part of a genuine full employment strategy which attempts to respond to the needs of people who, while not officially unemployed, nevertheless very much desire and are capable of work. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During World War II, fears of postwar depres sion led to proposals for guaranteeing every adult American the \"right to a useful and remunerative job.\" Under the Employment Act of 1946, the job guarantee was displaced by triple-layered guarantees to insure corporate growth: assured expansion of market demand, assured returns on capital, and guaranteed supply of inputs including trained or educated labor. While these growthmanship policies suc cessfully averted mass depression, restrictive definitions of \"full\" employment obscured the growing supply of labor able and willing to work for pay but outside the officially defined labor force. The expansion of labor supply has branded millions of people \"surplus\" and has, in effect, contributed to many of the social ills whose symptoms are labeled the urban crisis. </jats:p>",
