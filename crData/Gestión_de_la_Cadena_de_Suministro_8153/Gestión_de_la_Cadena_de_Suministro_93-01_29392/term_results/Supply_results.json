      "abstract": "<jats:p>A coupled formulation of withdrawal and sampling designs for ground water supply models is presented. The withdrawal design is described as a discrete time optimal control problem and solved using a closed loop stochastic control (CLSC) method. Two main features of the CLSC method are the anticipation of the future observation program and decomposition of the objective function into the deterministic and stochastic part. The former characteristic indicates the necessity for coupling the withdrawal and sampling designs, while the later feature allows a decision maker to estimate the uncertainty in the objective function if certain withdrawal rates are applied. The sampling network is sequentially developed, with the design criterion defined as a sensitivity of the objective function stochastic part to the uncertainty in the hydraulic head distribution multiplied with the variance of the hydraulic head. The concept of minimizing the stochastic part of the objective function with respect to the hydraulic head uncertainty provides a convenient way to couple the withdrawal design objectives with the monitoring network development weighted with the magnitude of the prediction error in the hydraulic head distribution. The Bayesian concept of measurement conditioning is employed to sequentially adjust the withdrawal rates and sampling network development by accounting for the information conveyed in field observations. Between the sampling sessions the uncertainty in the hydraulic head prediction is evaluated using the first‐ and second‐moment analysis applied to the discretized ground water flow model. The uncertainty in the hydraulic head prediction is assumed to come from the natural uncertainty in the hydraulic conductivity and uncertainty in the boundary condition values and other external fluxes (e.g., leakages and recharge). A hypothetical example is included to demonstrate the application procedure and to illustrate the main features of the proposed coupled formulation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Objective:&lt;/i&gt; The purpose of the present study consists in an updated review of recent progress in the field of autologous blood supply. At different medical centers, autologous blood products are collected by quite different procedures, which may be applied during pre-, intra- and/or postoperative periods according the technical possibilities of the local blood supply systems. The products are very different, consisting in whole blood, red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, fresh-frozen plasma (from whole blood and from plasmapheresis), as well as in wound and drainage fluid and in washed red cell concentrates. Iron therapy against autologous blood donation – or against surgical bleeding-induced anemia – is now well established, but it is unclear whether it should be given perorally or intravenously. In addition, erythropoietin substitution may be necessary for some but not all patients. &lt;i&gt;Data Sources:&lt;/i&gt; For our review we have used as sources, beyond our own published reports, studies devoted to clinical experience as well as to pathophysiological aspects of blood donation. &lt;i&gt;Results and conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; It becomes apparent that the practice of autologous blood supply has now reached peripheral hospitals not affiliated with bigger medical centers. Smaller hospitals may share expensive equipment necessary for autologous blood collection. Such progress contrasts with persistent uncertainties regarding iron and erythropoietin substitution.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to measure genetic responses to variation in moisture supply in the yield of seed and straw, evapotranspiration and water use efficiency, to guide the lentil breeding programme. The response of 25 diverse lentil lines to a soil water gradient was studied in 1987/88 and 1988/89 at Breda, northern Syria, using a line-source sprinkler system. The coefficient of determination between rainfed and irrigated seed yield in the dry 1988/89 season was r2 = 0.26, and the genotypes that were well adapted to dry conditions were different from those well adapted to wet conditions. However, there were also widely adapted genotypes that yielded well under both wet and dry conditions. The selection of such genotypes might be appropriate for the region receiving 300–400 mm annual rainfall, in contrast with the approach to selection suggested for drier areas (less than 300 mm annual rainfall) in a companion article. Soil moisture extraction from the time of maximum profile recharge to maturity in 1987/88 and cumulative crop evapotranspiration in the 1987/88 rainfed crop did not differ among lentil lines. In the irrigated treatment, however, evapotranspiration in the medium to late maturing lines exceeded that in the early maturing lines towards maturity.</jats:p>",

The modification permits automatic filament saturation and monitoring. Using this system, variations and drifts in the emission current over time can be adjusted and compensated automatically with a feedback loop in the computer‐controlled system. This change also enables the accurate determination and setting of the primary electron beam energy. Therefore, the accelerating voltage is known for comparison to Monte Carlo computer modeling of the electron beam specimen interaction.</jats:p>",

This loading can be expressed quantitatively with the unbalanced current i<jats:sub>u</jats:sub>of RMS value ||i<jats:sub>u</jats:sub>||. A whole compensation of the unbalanced current i<jats:sub>u</jats:sub>was proved to be possible with reactive balancing circuits, however, it may be very complex. This paper shows that a substantial minimization of the unbalanced current i<jats:sub>u</jats:sub>may be achieved with such a circuit, but of much lower complexity. The method suggested requires that the unbalanced admittances A<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>of the load for harmonic frequencies are known. A harmonic analysis that provides the complex RMS values of the phase voltages and currents harmonics in a cross‐section between the load and the source enables us to determine these admittances and design the balancing circuit. It was shown, moreover, that the reduction of the unbalanced current i<jats:sub>u</jats:sub>can be integrated with the reactive current i<jats:sub>r</jats:sub>minimization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; The use of dextran solutions (DX) for hemodilution (HD) is considered being detrimental due to their effects on plasma viscosity. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; 14 splenectomized beagles (12.7+1.3 kg) were anesthetized and randomly assigned to HD to 20 vol% hematocrit (hct) with either 3 or 6% DX-60. The effects of HD upon nutritional organ blood flow (radioisotope-labelled microspheres, Ø 15 µm), local tissue oxygenation (pO2 multiwire surface electrode), plasma and blood volume (131I-labelled dog albumin distribution), and macrohemodynamics were evaluated with regard to actual changes in hct and plasma viscosity, respectively. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Normovolemic HD with either solution resulted in equivalent changes in macrohemodynamics, and plasma and blood volume. Despite the increase in plasma viscosity associated with HD using 6% DX-60 (up to 1.45+0.10 mPa-s), blood flow rose in all organs studied (p &lt; 0.05). After HD by means of 3% DX-60, plasma viscosity remained unchanged (1.09 + 0.04 mPa-s) but was not associated with higher organ blood flow as compared to 6% DX-60. In both groups, elevated pO2 values on the surface of liver and skeletal muscle (p &lt; 0.01) as well as the shift in the pO2 histograms toward higher pO2 values indicated a more homogeneous tissue perfusion upon HD, independent of the diluent applied. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; In comparison to 6% DX-60, the solution of 3% DX-60 is of equivalent efficacy as volume substitute and in the induction of normovolemic HD. The main advantage of 3% DX-60 solution, however, is the fact that twice as much volume can be administered before the recommended maximal daily dose of 1.5 g/kg DX is reached. Of the rheological factors influencing oxygen delivery, hematocrit thus plays the predominant role, while plasma viscosity is of minor importance.</jats:p>"

The muscle biopsy specimens were histochemically analyzed for fiber types (myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase) and capillaries (amylase-periodic acid-Schiff method). Differences between contralateral sites were not identifiable for any of the analyzed variables. Differences between sampling depths were larger than those between sample sites. The percentage of type-1 fibers increased, and that of type-2B fibers decreased as a function of increased sampling depth, but the relative frequency of type- 2A fibers did not change with depth. The mean crosssectional area of type-1 and type-2A fibers increased significantly, and that of type-2B fibers decreased between the most superficial and the deepest sampling sites. The capillary density and the mean number of capillaries per fiber increased as a function of sampling depth, but significant changes were not recorded between sampling depths for overall mean fiber area. The mean number of capillaries in contact with fibers of each histochemical type increased significantly with increasing sampling depth only for type- 1 fibers. However, the number of capillaries in contact with fibers changed significantly, relative to the fiber area, as a function of sampling depth; for type- 28 fibers this variable increased, whereas for type-2A and type-1 fibers, it decreased. These results indicate that fiber size and capillary supply of the various fiber types in the gluteus medius muscle of horses vary as a function of depth. These patterns of variation most likely indicate the functional difference between various portions of the muscle, and support the general opinion that the functional demands placed on the fiber population are an important factor in the development of muscle fiber properties.</jats:p>",

Soaking meals in aqueous myrosinase or copper sulphate solution and subsequent drying reduced the content of antinutrients by more than 90%. Broiler chickens were fed (i) a glucosinolate‐free diet, or this diet in which half the soybean meal was replaced by RSM of various origins and treatment; (ii) untreated cRSM; (iii) cRSM treated with myrosinase: (iv) cRSM treated with Cu (v) untreated nRSM; or (vi) nRSM treated with myrosinase. These diets were administered with or without supplementary iodine. Chickens receiving the iodine‐deficient diets with myrosinase‐treated RSM showed growth depression, incomplete feathering, leg injuries and severe goitre. In the serum T<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> could not be detected. Giving myrosinase‐treated RSM plus iodine, or giving other RSM diets irrespective of iodine administration, no growth depression was observed. RSM diets without iodine dosage markedly increased thyroid weight: there were no differences between the RSM variants. In contrast to the treatment with myrosinase, in the sera of the chickens fed on untreated RSM or RSM treated with copper T<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> could be detected, suggesting that in iodine‐deficient conditions differences in serum T<jats:sup>4</jats:sup> concentration between RSM groups indicate a differing anti‐thyroid activity. With iodine supplementation the RSM had a significant effect on thyroid weight. The largest thyroids (five‐fold heavier) were in the animals with myrosinase‐treated cRSM. The untreated cRSM and the nRSM trebled or doubled the thyroid weight, and the myrosinase‐treated nRSM trebled it. The thyroid weight of chicks fed cRSM treated with copper did not differ significantly from the glucosinolate‐free control. There was evidence that heating the myrosinase‐treated RMS produced anti‐thyroid compounds; these should be identified in further investigations.</jats:p>",

Slope and width of the gradients were investigated in dependence on the kind of immobilization, the culture age and the cell density on or in the carrier as well as the different forms of the oxygen supply in the medium. So it could be shown that large parts of immobilizates, approximately 96% of the diameter of both types, were oxygen‐free. In comparison with free mycelia, the lower oxygen supply of the immobilized mycelia led to a metabolic shift to fermentative catabolism.</jats:p>",

We used a method of determining inert gas wash‐out by mass spectrometry in the study of blood flow rates in pigs. The method was validated by comparison of the result obtained with inert gas wash‐out to that with measurement by microspheres. Furthermore, the effect of decreased inlet flow and venous congestion on the bone perfusion data was tested. The undisturbed bone blood flow was not significantly different when measured with wash‐out of inert gas (7 ± 0.7 ml/min/100 g) or with microspheres (9 ± 2.9 ml/min/100 g), and the methods were correlated. Perfusion was reduced significantly, to 20% of the original value, after arterial occlusion. The changes in wash‐out curves and accumulation of radioactive tracer provided substantial evidence for impaired intraosseous circulation following venous obstruction also. In conclusion, the study showed that this method of determining inert gas wash‐out is feasible for studies of local perfusion rates in bone. The flow rates obtained by wash‐out correlated well with the results of microsphere studies. In this animal model, both methods detected a fivefold reduction in flow rate after clamping of the arterial inflow. Obstruction of the venous outflow also impaired blood flow and lowered the cellular supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The effects of various purified carbohydrates, given as supplements to a basal diet of grass silage, on ruminal fermentation and on the urinary excretion of purine derivatives (PD) were investigated using six sheep in a 6 × 6 Latin square experiment with period lengths of 14 days. The six experimental treatments were (i) the basal diet of 4 kg day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of grass silage, supplemented with (ii) sucrose, (iii) lactose, (iv) xylose, (v) wheat starch, and (vi) fructose. All supplements were given at 200 g day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The basal diet and the supplements were given in two equal meals each day. Relative to the basal diet, xylose, starch and fructose all reduced (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) the mean ruminal pH; for sucrose, the depression was non‐significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0·05) whilst lactose produced virtually no depression of pH. All supplements reduced (at least <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) the ruminal concentrations of ammonia compared with the basal diet but, excepting xylose, all the sugar supplements produced a greater (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) reduction than did the starch treatment; for xylose, this effect just failed to reach statistical significance (0·10 &gt; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0·05). Starch did not alter the volatile fatty acid (VFA) pattern from the basal diet but the sugars produced very marked changes in the molar proportions of VFA. All sugars reduced the proportions of acetic acid (for xylose, 0·10 &gt; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; <jats:italic>0·05</jats:italic>, for the others, at least <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) but compensation was in terms of increased proportions either of propionic acid (xylose and fructose) or of butyric acid (sucrose and lactose). All four sugars increased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) the urinary output of PD over that seen with the basal treatment but the much smaller increase with the starch supplement was statistically non‐significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0·05). The calculated supply of microbial nitrogen to the small intestine was 10·2, 14·8, 14·3, 13·1, 11·9 and 13·7 g day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for the basal, sucrose, lactose, xylose, starch and fructose treatments respectively; the value for sucrose was significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) greater than that for starch but differences between sugars were statistically non‐significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &gt; 0·05). It is concluded that sugars, particularly sucrose, are clearly superior to starch as an energy source for the microbial fixation of nitrogen in the rumen.</jats:p>",

Analysis of variance was used as a quolitative measure of phenotypic plasticity (i.e. significance of P effect) and to determine differential phenotypic plasticity (i.e. significance of genotype × P interaction). Quadratic P response curves were calculated and plasticity measured quantitively as maximum slope.</jats:p><jats:p>While all plant characters measured exhibited plasticity, yield related characters were generally more plastic titan characters associated with plant morphology when compared using a scale independent test based on F‐ratios. Internode length and leaf size were the must plastic morphological characters and it is suggested that they are chiefly responsible for the resultant yield response of white clover to increased phosphate fertiliser supply. There was highly significance of variation for plasticity among genotypes for all plant characters measured, although within cultivars, significance of variation for plasticity among genotypes varied with cultivar. Magnitude of plasticity of genotype was not closely related to origin of cultivar. plant type, growth or breeding history. Many characteristics varied independently for an increase or decrease in plasticity of characters is an achievable option.</jats:p>",
