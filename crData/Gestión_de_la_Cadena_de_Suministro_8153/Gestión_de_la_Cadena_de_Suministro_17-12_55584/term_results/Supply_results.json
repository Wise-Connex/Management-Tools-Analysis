      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study introduces supply chain tsunamis as a major strategic supply chain phenomenon. Like their ecological counterparts, supply chain tsunamis occur at relatively long intervals and are therefore easily mistaken for unique events, rather than recurring phenomena. In contrast to ocean tsunamis, they can in principle be prevented through timely and adequate managerial action. However, their immediate impact is just as sudden and disruptive, and their ability to reshape supply chains of companies and even industries equally long lasting. They are fundamentally different from phenomena like the bullwhip effect and black swan events. This study further explores a preliminary typology of supply chain tsunamis by Akkermans and Van Wassenhove (2013). Each type of tsunami focuses on a very different part of the supply chain periphery where the first signals of a developing tsunami can be observed. In this study, we use a detailed example from the high‐tech electronics industry to describe how a supply chain tsunami unfolds over time. This is done both from an external and an internal perspective. The external perspective shows the sequence of events visible to the outside observer. The internal perspective focuses on the managerial decision‐making processes that cause and (sometimes) resolve supply chain tsunamis. We link the notion of supply chain tsunamis to the broader need to revive strategic operations and supply chain management research. Supply chain tsunamis affect corporate strategy and have a profound impact on business and management. Therefore, we argue that business tsunamis deserve deeper research and suggest avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we acknowledge the ongoing debate about survey research and focus specifically on examining the conditions under which a study might validly utilize data provided by a single respondent. To this end, we summarize the main challenges that survey research in supply chain management faces when dealing with single respondents and later argue that having multiple respondents does not necessarily represent a cure‐all solution. Next, we discuss the concept of alignment in survey research and explore the characteristics of research questions that can be addressed through single key informants. We conclude the paper by suggesting that researchers should carefully consider the appropriateness of single key informants in light of the type of research question and also clearly support such choice when describing the method adopted.</jats:p>",

While additive manufacturing is believed to revolutionize and enhance traditional manufacturing, there is no comprehensive toolset developed in the manufacturing field to assess the impact of additive manufacturing and determine the best production method that suits the applied supply chain strategy.

Absorptive Capacity (ACAP) theory is used to understand how the Brazilian sugar-energetic processors identified, assimilated, transformed, and exploited knowledge from this relationship, as well as how this experience could be used in other industries. As a trading result, Brazilian biofuel exports to the United States increased 758.22% during the studied period and the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC), an American tax act in vigor since the 1970’s, was extinguished at the end of 2011.  The main contribution of this study: Identify how the Absorptive Capacity Theory can explain such impacts in the Brazilian Biofuel exports through the relationship between partners in the U.S. and Brazil.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain research has become increasingly theory‐driven, research designs have become more rigorous, and analytical methods have grown in depth and breadth. Given this important and positive progression, we believe that it is time for scholars to abandon a popular data collection method—single‐source surveys—due to its inherent limitations. In the past, single‐source surveys have fueled important steps forward in knowledge development, but the field has progressed to the point that stronger designs are needed. Rather than attacking past research grounded in single‐source surveys (including our own) or offering stop‐gap advice (e.g., get more respondents), we offer a more constructive path forward—scholars should let their theory drive their designs. Specifically, we propose the concept of <jats:italic>theoretical calibration</jats:italic>—the degree to which the key tenets of a study's theory are captured within its research design—and describe four approaches that scholars can take to increase theoretical calibration. Our hope is that, in the future, surveys will remain one important method among many that can be used to build knowledge and inform managers, but that journal gatekeepers will judge designs that rely on single‐source surveys alone to no longer be sufficient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several recent high‐profile product recalls raise the question of why companies take so long to recall defective products from the market. The recall timing decision is not a simple task, as companies constantly face multiple, often competing goals during the recall process. In this research, we examine variations in large automakers’ recall timing decisions after an initial report of a suspected quality failures. Drawing upon problem‐solving theory, we theorize about how five recall attributes impact discovery‐to‐recall, defined as the time between a defective product's initial discovery and its officially announced recall. To test our hypotheses, we assembled a vehicle recall investigation dataset from recall reports filed by the six largest automakers that sold passenger cars in the United States from 2000 to 2012. Results from event history analysis reveal that discovery‐to‐recall is longer for: (1) recalls that are triggered by external initial reports, rather than internal initial reports; (2) recalls that are attributed to suppliers, rather than automakers; (3) recalls that are associated with design flaws, as opposed to manufacturing flaws; and (4) recalls with more models involved. We also find that cumulative recall experience, measured as the total number of previous recalls, shortens discovery‐to‐recall. These findings improve our understanding of why the timing of vehicle recalls varies considerably at the individual recall level. They also highlight the value of problem‐solving theory in vehicle recall research, as well as quality management research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There  are  many  articles  mentioning  the  advantages  and  benefits  of  supply  chain  alignment none, however, describe how to model such alignment in the supply chain. This paper offers a framework  for  examining  and  understanding  the  impact  supply  chain  alignment  has  on performance.  Based  on  supply  chain  mapping  approach,  a  model  describing  alignment between  processes/  flows  in  the  supply  chain  network  is  developed.  The  model  is  then validated  using  a  dataset  of  316  enterprises  operating  in  the  Vietnam  construction  sector. Evidence indicates that the supply chain processes and flows were aligned. According to the results,  the  proposed  supply  chain  alignment  model  is  able  to  explain  a  59.9%  variance  in operational  performance,  58.9%  in  customer  satisfaction,  34.5%  in  operating  costs  and 67.4%  in  business  performance.  To  successfully  align  the  supply  chain  network,  companies can use the proposed model as a “road-map” to reduce high costs, to avoid the loss of control,  management  difficulties  and/or  vulnerability  to  opportunistic  action,  all  of  which may hinder efforts to align the supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Outcrop, core, log, and seismic data from carbonate sequences ranging in age from Proterozoic through Pleistocene have led to the understanding that the carbonate stratigraphic record is best understood as a complex system: i.e., any system featuring a large number of interacting components (agents, processes, etc.) whose aggregate activity is nonlinear (not derivable from the summations of the activity of individual components) and typically exhibits hierarchical self-organization under selective pressures.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>(www.informatics.indiana.edu/rocha/publications/complex/csm.html).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Stratigraphers typically work with a limited set of regime variables (sea level, subsidence, sediment supply, climate) in order to predict patterns of accumulation from seismic scale down to grain-size and pore networks, but typically wind up short. Deviations from what would be predicted using the already complex multivariate parameters above are the norm not the exception. Clearly a broader spectrum of inputs, short-lived and long-term, periodic, and chaotic is at play and demand consideration. Here I focus on three examples of geochemically influenced sediment supply patterns that fundamentally alter sequence architecture but that are not easily predicted from standard consideration of the A/S equation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Permian mixed siliciclastic-carbonate sequences of the Permian Basin have served as a testing ground for carbonate sequence stratigraphy since the pioneering publications by Exxon in the mid 80s. RCRL began research in these outcrops in 1987 starting with San Andres ramps, Grayburg mixed siliciclastic-carbonate shelves, and more recently complexly faulted Capitan reef-rimmed profiles. A framework has been developed in the outcrop that captures much of the system and serves as an important guide for deciphering the Delaware and Midland basin patterns as well as the Northwest Shelf/Central Basin Platform record. Though A/S is a good high-level predictor of sequence development, facies substitution and evolution across ramp/rim transitions requires an understanding of basin geochemistry and slope stability at a range of scales. Ignoring these controls hampers prediction of such fundamental attributes as depositional profiles, reservoir facies distributions, and of reef morphology and evolution.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Greenhouse (Cretaceous/Jurassic) carbonate sequences of the Gulf of Mexico illustrate another challenge to standard A/S-driven patterns. Order-of-magnitude perturbations in carbonate factory rates are seen during oceanic anoxic events with their attendant decrease in oxygenation and potential ocean acidification. These drastic impacts on the carbonate factory cause shifts in accumulation patterns that are not simply linked to base-level. Because geochemical forcing varies significantly within a basin and between basins as driven by oceanographic effects, eustatic signals typically do not produce regionally mappable and predictable sequence frameworks.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In young highly constrained carbonate sequences of the mid-late Pleistocene the impact appears even more dramatic, as two to four times increases in depositional rates can be shown to occur within a 2-4 ky time scale. Such “explosions” of ooid facies as shown in the Caribbean are likely analogous to the “overshoots” tied to oceanic anoxic events like the Toarcian. Currently our more widely applied sequence models do not predict these complex system responses. These deviations should excite and challenge researchers dedicated to unraveling carbonate sequence stratigraphy. Rather than becoming passé or irrelevant, carbonate sequence stratigraphy is an essential first step in constraining known parameters, allowing focus to shift to critical but less well understood signals.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, the transportation and mixed integer programming algorithms are used. The formulation of both algorithms were analyzed using LINDO program. The method of linear programming (LP) is adopted to optimize water delivery schemes for Icbid City, the second largest city in Jordan. This city as well as the whole country depends mainly upon surface water, and groundwater resources which are scarce and expensive to exploit. The result of the study shows a reasonable argument where all surface water from all sources (Mukhaiba, Wadi Arab and Local supply) is used and none of the groundwater supply is diverted for agricultural purposes due to'its higher cost.</jats:p>"

Through an analysis of sample labor provisions in United States and European Union free trade agreements, this paper shows that both approaches, albeit using different methods, aim primarily to improve &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt; labor law and &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; enforcement of that law by government regulatory institutions. This paper argues that instead, labor provisions ought to be grounded in a supply chain approach. A supply chain approach shifts the focus from impacting &lt;em&gt;de jure&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; labor law as administered by the state though sanctions or dialogue, and towards context specific, experimental, and coordinated private and public regulatory interventions that operate in key export industries that are implicated in trading partners’ supply chains.

Ultimately intending to support the strategic decisions of stakeholders. The constraints included are: economies of scale, location of facilities, production capacity, raw material supply, product demand, bill of materials and mass balance.Objectives:The model aims to minimize, both, the total cost and environmental impact of five chain echelonsMetodology:The solution procedure resorts to chance constraint and the ε-constraint method to solve the biobjective model.Results:Computational experiments allowed assessing the performance of the solution procedure. The CPU times for the solution of the instances of the problem show very good values.Conclutions:By approaching the modeling of the biodiesel supply chain the current contribution can serve as the basis of future similar works and associated solution procedures, thus facilitating decision-making at different supply chain stages. The current approach can be improved through its modeling and/or through the development of solution procedures that allow its practical use in larger instances of the model. This can be overcome through permanent research lines that include the development of adequate acceleration methods, valid constraints, Benders decomposition, branch and cut, Lagrangian decomposition, Danzing-Wolf decomposition, or heuristics and meta-heuristics.</jats:p>"

This research presents a mathematical model to simulate the emptying process of water supply networks, and the application to a water emptying pipeline with nominal diameter of 1000 mm and 578 m long which is located on the southern of Cartagena, Bolívar Deparment, Colombia. In the application, both pipes and the air valve data manufacturer were considered. The behavior of all hydraulic and thermodynamic variables is considered. Results show that is crucial to know sub-atmospheric pressure values to prevent the collapse of the pipeline. The application of the mathematical model confirms that the hydraulic system is well designed depending on air valve sizes and maneuvering of drain valve.</jats:p>"

As the economy develops, economic activities, such as industrialization and provision of services rise. These economic activates raise the energy demand. On another hand, Pakistan generating a small amount of energy from its own sources and a major part of its energy supply is relying on energy imports. In this study, we analyze the economic development and energy gaps nexus in Pakistan. The data on energy consumption, energy production, energy exports, and energy imports is taken from U.S. Energy Information Administration, we use this information to generate aggregate energy supply and energy demand. We also use World development indicators (WDI) in order to get data on financial development, urbanization, and economic growth. We apply the Auto-Regressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) bound test. Empirical findings show the marginal effects of financial improvement on energy gaps exists in long as well as in the short run. These findings are not sensitive to control additional variables (i.e. urbanization and economic growth). These results show financial development, urbanization, and economic growth increasing the energy demand and supply gaps.</jats:p>"

Among the features, effective Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the core. Whatever the wage level or lead time (the period from order confirmation to shipment) without proper management of supply chain business is not viable and sustainable. Supply chain can categories into two phases – Macro level, part of global supply chain and Micro level, the supply chain system within the manufacturing unit. In supply chain system, it can be materials, it can be information, and even it can be a supply of business (continuation of business). One single and very simple issue like mismatching thread count or wrong button line, incorrect or delayed information can make the whole process jeopardies. Considering the importance, present study has been carried out on supply chain system in Bangladesh RMG industry. The study revealed the difficulties in supply chain system and also tried to set some guidelines to improve the system for the sustainable development of the sector.</jats:p>"

We study the influence of transaction costs on the convergence of the system to a stationary outcome. In particular, we consider a dynamic bargaining game among a finite set of agents and its replications, and use a limit stationary equilibrium to examine the system’s behavior as the population’s size goes to infinity. The convergence of the system to a limit stationary equilibrium would capture the common belief that as the market gets large, it converges to a competitive and stable outcome. However, we prove that depending on the underlying transaction costs, the system might not converge to such an equilibrium. Interestingly, our result shows that a small increase in the transaction cost at one end of the chain can be greatly amplified and shifts the system away from the steady state. When a limit stationary equilibrium exists, we show that it is unique. We use such an equilibrium outcome to study trade surplus among sellers, buyers, and middlemen. </jats:p>",

Despite the general emphasis to the benefits of implementation of ISO 9001 in the literature, there is a still lack of research concerning the actual impact of quality management systems for improving specific logistics processes. The research is focused on the Polish market because there is no research in the subject literature which concerns the impact of the implementation of quality management systems on the improvement of logistic processes in Polish enterprises.&#x0D;\nPurpose of the article: The focus of this publication was to examine the impact of the implementation of the requirements of ISO 9001 for process improvement supply logistics.&#x0D;\nMethods: Empirical studies were carried out in September and October 2014 on a group of 17 companies with implemented and certified quality management systems according to ISO 9001. The research tool was a questionnaire survey sent to management representatives (25 respondents) and workers (140 respondents). The surveys were supplemented with direct interviews with employees of the companies.&#x0D;\nFindings: Based on the survey it can be stated that the quality management systems, accord-ing to ISO 9001, had a fairly large impact on improving procurement processes. This is particularly evident in areas including relationships with suppliers, quality control, workflow and communication, both internal and external. The positive aspects achieved through the implementation of quality management systems due to the fact that the ISO 9001 standard in its commitments puts great emphasis on the organization of the procurement process.</jats:p>"

Initially, monochloramine demands of acetaminophen (AAP) and its chlorination byproduct, 1,4-benzoquinone, were determined in excess of oxidant at pH 8.5 and 25 °C. Monochloramine demands of AAP and 1,4-benzoquinone were respectively 1.2 (±0.2) and 4.4 (±0.3) mol/mol after 72 h of reaction. Chlorination reactions were also conducted under the same experimental conditions in order to compare the oxidant demands and the reactivity of free chlorine and monochloramine toward AAP and 1,4-benzoquinone. Chlorine demands of AAP and 1,4-benzoquinone were much more important than monochloramine demands and respectively accounted for 13.4 (±0.2) and 6.8 (±0.5) mol/mol. The reaction of AAP with monochloramine was monitored using reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet absorbance (HPLC-UV). AAP reacted with monochloramine to form simultaneously two first byproducts. The half-life of reaction was estimated to be 90 min. The apparent second-order rate constant (kapp2) for the reaction of AAP with monochloramine at pH 8.5 was 231 M−1·h−1.</jats:p>",

Therefore, these agroecosystems are unsustainable and poorly resilient. However, traditional agroforestry systems (TAS) contribute to the conservation of biodiversity and to the provision of inputs for the maintenance of local populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of the TAS in the food supply under the food sovereignty (FSv) approach in three different ethnic groups. The study was conducted in three communities of different origin in the State of Campeche, one Maya Tseltal-Chol, the other Mestizo, and the third Yucatec Mayan. The theoretical-methodological framework of this research was based on agroecology. Ethnographic methods and participatory research activities were carried out to describe and analyze the factors that strengthen FSv using five indicators. Our results present a description and analysis of resource access, current production models, patterns of consumption and food security, commercialization and participation in decision-making of these communities. Traditional agroecological management practices are still preserved and native species are still being cultivated. Farmers obtain about 55% of their food from TAS. The consumption of food is influenced by the culture, the purchasing power linked to economic activities and government support. TAS have played a strategic role for the survival of families but to ensure their contribution to FSv, it is necessary to articulate the actions of the sectors that share the same objective and encourage the active participation of communities in agricultural policies.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the paper is to address the following research problems: (1) How manufacturers’ market power influences the pricing policies and green strategies of supply chain members in a green supply chain? (2) What conditions do first-mover advantage and green competitive advantage be effective simultaneously? We establish the linear demand functions of the duopoly green supply chain and obtain the players’ optimal decisions under channel members’ different market power. Further, we conduct sensitivity analysis and numerical examples of players’ optimal decisions about consumer’s environmental awareness and greening cost effector. Based on the theoretical and numerical analysis, we find that green manufacturer would benefit from the increment of consumer’s environmental awareness but be depressed by the increase of greening cost, which is contrary to the traditional manufacturer. Additionally, correlations of retailer’ optimal decisions and profits between consumer’s environmental awareness and greening cost effector are related to the manufacturers’ market power structures. Furthermore, we find that the green competitive advantage is more effective than first-mover advantage while first-mover advantage does not always effective in the duopoly green supply chain. Specially, traditional manufacturer always prefers to be the follower competing with the green manufacturer, no matter with the variety of consumer’s environmental awareness and greening cost effector, while green manufacturer would like to be the leader only when the consumer’s environmental awareness is relatively high or the greening cost effector is relatively low.</jats:p>"

The power supply changes the current from AC 110 volts to 60Hz or 220 volts 50Hz to DC + 3.3 volts, +5 volts and + 12 volts. Power Supply must carry a good and stable DC power supply so the system can run well. Tools running on the voltage supplied by the onboard voltage regulator, for example RIMM and RIMM require 2.5 volts while AGP AX and cards require 1.5 volts, both supplied by the onboard regulator of the motherboard. In addition to supplying power, the Power Supply can prevent the computer from starting until a Power Supply voltage exists at a predetermined area. Power Good is a sign of a special test that is sent to the motherboard as an active signal on the computer, usually marked by a green light when the power button is pressed. The current issued by the Power Supply is a direct current (DC), power output is composed of 200 watts, 250 watts, 300 watts, 350 watts, 400 watts to 600 watts. Computers with Intel Pentium 4 processors and above use power of 380 watts to 450 watts.Keywords: Power Supply, Computer, DC, Power Good, and volt</jats:p>"

Forecast-based make-to-stock production strategy was not suitable anymore. Make-to-order strategy was employed by more and more apparel companies. However, there were still many defects in traditional make-to-order apparel supply chain, e.g., sustainability is still at a low level. In this study, we proposed a collaborative cloud service platform to develop a novel model of sustainable make-to-order apparel supply chain. A service provider selection heuristic was designed for this platform to optimally select suppliers corresponding to each received demand. Multi-agent-based simulation technology was utilized to build the proposed platform and to evaluate the new sustainable supply chain model. Experiment was conducted in the simulation to compare our new model to traditional apparel make-to-order model and model with outsourcing mechanism. Based on simulation results, the remarkable improvement in terms of sustainability of the proposed platform and corresponding supply chain model was demonstrated.</jats:p>"

A number of modular systems have been proposed, these include a Purchase Order System, GPS Fleet Tracking System, Credit Reference System and Fore Court Operations management system. It is expected that a comprehensive integration of these modules would significantly make the operations of Ghanaian oil marketing companies systems more efficient and effective.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the article is identifying the management tools of the green supply chain in the functional stages of the supply chain, to determine their expression and obstacles in implementing these measures in the enterprises of the Siauliai region. To achieve the green supply chain management measures’ application realization and problems in Siauliai region’s companies, scientific literature analysis and a survey (n = 275) were conducted in regional companies. Research has revealed that most of Siauliai region’s companies apply the green measures in manufacturing and service, while the most problematic area is utilization. Siauliai district’s production companies prioritize the green supply chain management measures more than trading and service companies.</jats:p>",

The influence of process variables, namely initial pH (3.0–11.0), fluoride concentration (50–200 mg/L), biosorbent dosage (0.25–8.0 g/L) and agitation speed (0–600 rpm), on the fluoride uptake was studied. Fluoride uptakes increased with increase in fluoride concentration due to enhanced driving force and decreased with increase in biosorbent dose. An empirical relationship, exponential in nature, was proposed between fluoride uptake and biosorbent dose. The pseudo-second-order rate constant (k2) was determined as 0.00474 g/ (mg.min) at 303 K with an initial fluoride concentration of 100 mg/L and the rate constant increased with increase in temperature. The activation energy was determined as 6.023 kJ/mol. The chemisorptive nature of fluoride removal was proven through kinetic modeling. The findings of this research proved the feasibility of industrial application of this novel biosorbent for fluoride removal over a wide range of environmental conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Environmental awareness is increased and heat pump systems have become more common because of several reasons such as; the depletion of fossil fuels and environmental harm caused by the fossil fueled air-conditioning systems. Heat pumps can be air source, waterborne, ground source due to the ambient that they transfer or reject heat. Water is the most efficient way to transfer heat in comparison to other resources. Considering cooling systems, waterborne systems are more efficient and smaller than air source systems. As it is known, air temperature is very high in the Mediterranean region hence COP (coefficient of performance) of air source heat pumps decrease. This study carries out the energy analysis of a heat pump which transfers the heat between cooled space and hot water tank. The waterborne air pump is installed in the Thermodynamics Laboratory of Engineering Faculty of Akdeniz University and the energy analysis of both cooling system and hot water supply is performed based on various parameters for a sample day. Mean water heating, space cooling and overall COP are calculated as 2.61, 2.08 and 4.69, respectively.</jats:p>"

With 3D printing technology, a design file can transform directly to a product, skipping many traditional manufacturing steps. Thus, this new application can affect all logistics and supply chain activities positively. The research problem of this paper is to search and assess supply chain changes associated with 3D printing technology adoption to identify the potential impact of AM. To do so, two different supply chain networks, which are TSCN and 3D printing supply chain network (3DPSCN) for healthcare industry are considered. A simulation model is developed to evaluate the potential impact of 3D printing improvements on the configuration of orthopedic insole supply chains. The main contribution of this paper is proposing a simulation model for a healthcare company to compare its 3DPSCN structure with its TSCN version. The results show the concrete benefits such as lead-time and number of customers that can be achieved by 3DPSCN compared to TSCN.</jats:p>"

Industrial technology generated a new development curve in several productive sectors, such as the alcoholic beverages. Beer is produced since 8000 BC, but its global popularization took place after the Second World War. Yet, brewing technology has been recently writing a new chapter: a paradigmatic transformation not only on instrumental principles, but also in terms of its economic and symbolic impact inside and outside organizations. This article aims to explore the new brewing paradigm and its pragmatic implications in terms of main concepts, management and operations in Brazil. Secondly, as a theoretical approach, it seeks to demystify technology and its social relationship. Technology, considering its material aspect, does not provide a broad understanding of field transformation. Therefore, the nuances of brewinng technology were captured by qualitative research. Secondary data and interviews with key elements were used as the main data collection strategy. Results indicate a brewing revolution, materialized by the offer of creative new products to mainstream markets, specialty beer shops and pubs. It is technological transformation in its essence, creating a new path from the craftman to the technique and demanding innovative management and operations forms. New brewing technologic paradigm rescues traditional techniques that in essence are concerned with producing “good” beer.</jats:p>"

In order to regain its competitive advantage, there is a clear need for a redesign of the inland supply chain in Brazil through the use and expansion of existent inland waterways and rail networks. In this paper, an optimal supply chain redesign methodology is presented to achieve the aforesaid objective, with a focus on Mato Grosso which is the largest producer and exporting state in Brazil.

A 2014 chemical spill of crude (4-methylcyclohexyl)methanol (MCHM) resulted in a $126 million USD fine to the water utility. The spill consisted of at least ten chemicals including 34% cis- and 60% trans-4-MCHM and 0.7% cis- and 0.3% trans-methyl-4-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate (MMCHC). While a very minor component, trans-MMCHC contributed substantially to odour because of its high Henry's Law Constant, 2.23 × 10−2 at 40 °C showering, and low odour threshold concentration (OTC), 0.02 ppb-v, air. Using USEPA risk assessment parameters in a 15-minute shower model with influent concentration of 42 ppb-aq cis- and trans-4-MMCHC, representative of initial spill concentrations in the distribution system, adult ingestion and inhalation for trans-MMCHC were almost equal, 4.00 × 10−4 and 4.26 × 10−4 mg/kg/d, respectively. For children, inhalation doses exceeded ingestion dose: 1.72 × 10−3 mg/kg/d versus 0.93 × 10−3 mg/kg/day trans-MMCHC. This exposure assessment with varying OTC for crude MCHM chemicals reinforces considering chemical, physical, and biological properties of all chemicals in the spill. Consumers aware of their exposure to chemicals in drinking water lost consumer confidence; the water utility was required to compensate individuals and businesses for financial losses.</jats:p>",

The authors present a composite equilibrium consisting of separating and pooling outcomes in different parameter regions and claim that it satisfies the intuitive criterion. We show that their analysis for the pooling equilibrium has errors and also that all pooling outcomes are actually eliminated by the intuitive criterion. The positive note is that if the undefeated equilibrium or the lexicographically maximum sequential equilibrium refinement is adopted, a similar composite equilibrium will be achieved, which will lead to qualitatively the same results as in the original paper. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Chris Forman, information systems. </jats:p>",

The key research questions were, first, whether money supply has been determined independently from capital flows, and then which factor, capital flows or money supply, has given a dominant effect on property prices. The contributions of this study are to investigate the impacts on property prices jointly from capital flows as an external factor and from money supply as a domestic factor, and to count on the differences in the trends in property prices of seventy regional cities in China. The main findings through the VAR estimations were as follows. First, domestic money supply has been determined exclusively from external capital flows through the authority’s perfect sterilization of foreign-exchange-market intervention. Second, the main contributor to property prices’ movement has been domestic money supply rather than external capital flows. Third, some deviations of property prices from the trend in money supply were found in big cities and/or coastal advanced cities.</jats:p>"

This paper explores the optimal strategies for a retailer-dominated closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with a triple recycling channel in the construction machinery remanufacturing context. In this special system, the retailer is the leader and authorized by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to remanufacture. Moreover, the OEM, the retailer, and the secondary market all take part in the used products collection activities. Considering the differentiation of the OEM, the retailer, and the secondary market in collecting the used construction machinery, a mathematical model of the CLSC system based on reasonable assumptions is built, the closed-form optimal pricing decisions are derived, and the optimal collection efforts allocation strategies are explored within the framework of the game theory. In addition, the impacts of the reverse logistics cost coefficient, the competing coefficient, and the buy-back price coefficient on the supply chain performance are elaborately analyzed. These achievements provide decision makers with managerial insights and offer efficient guidelines for the construction machinery remanufacturing firms to solve similar puzzles.</jats:p>"

Variable selection was done using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) via hierarchical interactions, resulting in a model called GAM-Lasso. The GAM-Lasso model was then extended by including tensor product interactions to yield a second model, called GAM- -Lasso. Comparative analyses of these two models were done with a gradient-boosting model to act as a benchmark model and the third model. The forecasts from the three models were combined using a forecast combination algorithm where the average loss suffered by the models was based on the pinball loss function. The results showed significantly improved accuracy of forecasts, making this study a useful tool for decision-makers and system operators in power utility companies, particularly in maintenance planning including medium-term risk assessment. A major contribution of this paper is the inclusion of a nonlinear trend. Another contribution is the inclusion of temperature based on two thermal regions of South Africa.</jats:p>"

Fluorescence excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy was employed to characterize and quantify spatial and seasonal variations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) along a raw water canal of the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA) Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 276 raw water samples were collected from 23 stations during the winter, summer and rainy season. Results indicate that hydrophobic fractions made up the majority of DOM and this water source also had high specific UV absorbance (SUVA). Seasonal variation of DOM was found to be more pronounced than geographical variation along the canal. The presence of humic substances was the highest in the rainy season due to rainfall and surface runoff, while soluble microbial by-product-like substances were found only in summer. The results provide an insight into the prediction of humic acids in source water, which benefits the MWA in being aware of seasonal variation in water quality.</jats:p>",

The results of this study revealed that civil-military relations are essential for EPM to function as a coordinated approach to safety and security, and are necessary to respond effectively to complex emergencies and mitigating threats to developed countries. Civil-military relations are still a concern in the context of communication, the exercise of authority, and the coordination of emergency supplies (ES) to emergency operations.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This qualitative study is based on field observations, with attention focused on the EPM of Sweden, Finland, and Poland. The analysis of a broader SCNM through EPM was supported by semi-structured interviews among civil-military actors in Sweden, information collected from informal conversations known as “hanging out”, and secondary materials. Empirically, the analysis included a variety of civil-military relationships and identified implications for management, policy, and planning that are applicable to developed countries.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The management of civil-military relations is a meaningful resource when used as an overall approach for safety and security. The integration of civil-military relations in EPM in the planning of ES is a long-standing and complex matter. The management of Swedish civil-military relations in EPM is recognising that implications for management are imbedded in continuous policy changes in, for example, the Swedish policy history. Civil-military relational complications that arise in the field of operations are impossible to anticipate during emergency planning, as those complications are grounded in policy changes.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Escalating threats to developed countries are highlighted. The study underlines the primary measures used in studying military involvement in EPM. An understanding of SCNM as a choice for management can be obtained in future research that focuses on a broader role of the military in EPM. Sweden has emphasised a clearer role for the military by reactivating total defence planning and by evolving common practices and processes with civil actors in civil defence. Meanwhile, Poland and Finland are increasing their focus on supporting the management of civil-military policies on safety and security regarding communication, authority, and developing coordination. Consistent with findings from previous reports on SCNM, civil-military relations are essential for EPM. This study confirmed the importance of civil-military coordination, the management and practice of authority, and shared forms of communication.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Specifically, I quantify the relative contributions of four different forces: (i) a within-sector non-neutral technological change, (ii) the creation of new high-skill services/sectors, (iii) polarizing product demand shifts, and (iv) shifts in the relative supply of skilled labor. The model considers endogenous human capital accumulation. I find that positive supply shifts completely explain the fall of the skill premium during the period 1970–1980. Demand forces play a major role in the post-1980 period, when the skill premium rises. Among the demand forces, the results show an increasing contribution of polarizing product demand shifts over the decades. On the other hand, the effect of the within-sector non-neutral technological change is more important in the earlier decades of the post-1980 period.</jats:p>",

We conducted a literature review in English language journals which publish research of production and operations management and sustainability, resulting in a final sample of 29 papers. Results show that social and legal pressure for companies to adopt a responsible behavior prompts an isomorphic process that leads them to conduct their operations on behalf of triple bottom line goals. Behavioral differences between spin-offs in various countries caused institutions to create mechanisms that can press and change private standards through regulation and enforcement. There is room for progress in studies that seek to analyze the company’s relationships in its international experience and its multi-institutional relations.</jats:p>"

It includes computation of mass transfer cofficient, sorp-tion, useful heat sorption, heat input for heating the sorbent, device casing, water in the humidifier, evaporation of water, heating the sorbed water,  desorption, and calculating efficiency coefficient. Operational performance of open-type heat storage device based on the sorbent composite ‘silica - sodium sulfate’ is estimated. Suggested com-posite sorbent is obtained from tetraethoxysilane, Na2SO4, ethanol (as a solvent), hydrochloric acid (as a catalyst) and polyionenes served as organic modifiers. The impact of vapor flow velocity on efficiency is taken into account by the coefficient equal sorption value. A monotonic increase of efficiency coefficient while increasing the vapor flow speed and its relative humidity is shown. The efficiency coefficient of heat storage device is shown to be with little to no dependence with regeneration temperature heightened from 90 ºC to 110ºC. The optimal operating con-ditions of the heat accumulating device which allow to operate with maximum magnitudes of efficiency coefficients 53 – 57 % are stated to be vapor-air mixture speed 0.6 - 0.8 m/s and relative humidity of 40 – 60 %. The results of simulative experiments and field trials are given. Field tests were carried out in two modes differed with start time. Heat storage device was switched on in the morning or  in the evening for load-factoring of electric energy peaks,  indoor temperature being kept within limits from 20 ºС to 22ºС during day or night hours. Correlation between effi-ciency coefficients deduced from experiments and calculated with suggested algorithm is confirmed. The possibility of reducing the power consumption by applying of the heat accumulators in 2,4 - 90 times versus decentralized heat-ing systems on basis of  solid fuel boiler, gas boiler and electric boiler is stated when open-type sorptive heat stor-age device used. Results of the study can be applied to develop sorptive storage devices in decentralized heat supply and ventilation systems and sorption units for utilization of low-temperature waste heat.</jats:p>"

The research has been accomplished using various bibliographical sources, books, scientific reports, internal reports and information material. This paper analyses different national and international studies in the field of supply chain management, converge to identify eventual differences concerning authors’ opinion, problems and research gaps. It has been found that the specialty literature analyses in general subjects such as supply chain management, supplier performance, suppliers’ selection and evaluation, suppliers’ development, performance management and do not take into consideration also the supply chain management performance, so that various gaps concerning the specialty literature in the field of supply chain management performance evaluation have been identified. It is thus proposed that these research results are disseminated with the aid of a knowledge transfer eLearning platform within the “Lucian Blaga” University of Sibiu. This platform allows university personnel and its students gain access to specific academic findings.</jats:p>",

The VRF-OAP system refers to a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to complement a ventilation function, which is not provided in the VRF system. It is a system that supplies air indoors by heat treatment of outdoor air through the OAP, as a number of indoor units and OAPs are connected to the outdoor unit in the VRF system simultaneously. This paper conducted experiments with regard to changes in efficiency and the cooling capabilities of each unit and system according to supply air temperature in the OAP using a multicalorimeter. Based on these results, an algorithm that controlled the temperature of the supply air in the OAP was developed considering indoor and outdoor temperatures and humidity. The algorithm was applied in the test building to verify the effects of energy reduction and the effects on indoor temperature and humidity. Loads were changed by adjusting the number of conditioned rooms to verify the effect of the algorithm according to various load conditions. In the field test results, the energy reduction effect was approximately 15–17% at a 100% load, and 4–20% at a 75% load. However, no significant effects were shown at a 50% load. The indoor temperature and humidity reached a comfortable level.</jats:p>"

We show how lotteries as in Rogerson (1988) can again be used to convexify consumption sets, and aggregate over individual preferences. With a mix of sequential discrete and continuous labor supply decisions, aggregate disutility of non-market work becomes separable from market work, and the elasticity of the latter increases from unity to infinity.</jats:p>"

In 2000, the Japanese social care vision turned towards meeting the elderly’s care needs in their own homes with proper formal care services. This study aims to understand the quantitative properties of the macro supply and demand structure for facilities for the elderly who require support or long-term care throughout Japan and present them as index values. Additionally, this study compares the targets for establishing long-term care facilities set by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for 2025. In 2014, approximately 90% of all the people who were certified as requiring support and long-term care and those receiving preventive long-term care or long-term care services, were 75 years or older. The target increases in the number of established facilities by 2025 (for the 75-years-or-older population) were calculated to be 3.3% for nursing homes; 2.71% for long-term-care health facilities; 1.7% for group living facilities; and, 1.84% for community-based multi-care facilities. It was revealed that the establishment targets for 2025 also increase over current projections with the expected increase of the absolute number of users of group living facilities and community-based multi-care facilities. On the other hand, the establishment target for nursing homes remains almost the same as the current projection, whereas that for long-term-care health facilities decreases. These changes of facility ratios reveal that the Japanese social care system is shifting to realize ‘Ageing in Place’. When considering households’ tendencies, the target ratios for established facilities are expected to be applied to the other countries in Asia.</jats:p>"

Due to climate change and population increase, the lack of clean water resources is becoming more and more serious. A system dynamics model of water resources is proposed for alleviating water shortage, changing the imbalance between supply and demand, promoting sustainable patterns of consumption and production, protecting and managing water resources. First, a water supply and demand model combining principles and methods of system dynamics was constructed by analyzing the factors that influence water resources. The model is divided into five subsystems according to the water's purpose, i.e. a supply amount subsystem, an industrial water subsystem, an agricultural water subsystem, an ecological and domestic water subsystem, and a sewage water subsystem. In the model, the supply and demand index can indicate whether scarcity occurs as well as the degree of scarcity. The province of Shandong, China was picked as object of research. Relevant statistical data were analyzed to predict the supply and demand index in Shandong in 15 years using the model. Water scarcity in Shandong is explained through social and environmental drivers by addressing physical and economic decline. Finally, an intervention plan was formulated to avoid water shortage from occurring in the next 15 years.</jats:p>"

The retailer has superior forecast information about market demand, and the manufacturer builds the capacity and sets the wholesale price prior to demand realization. We explore forecast information sharing between the retailer and the manufacturer by means of cheap talk. We show that meaningful forecast information can be shared truthfully only before the manufacturer sets both the capacity and the wholesale price. By sharing the demand forecast with the manufacturer, the retailer faces the trade-offs between inflating the forecast to convince the manufacturer to increase capacity and deflating the forecast to persuade the manufacturer to offer a lower wholesale price. When the value of forecast information sharing is high, the trade-offs are balanced, and incentives are aligned, leading to truthful information sharing. Moreover, we find that larger demand uncertainty can promote credible information sharing and, surprisingly, can benefit both firms. Finally, we demonstrate that under general distributions, in equilibrium, firms share forecasts as a form of range/interval, which has been also implemented in practice. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

Stakeholder utama dalam industri gula adalah petani tebu dan pabrik gula yang dalam penelitian ini adalah PG. Djatiroto. Semakin banyak stakeholder, maka proses bisnis di dalamnya akan semakin kompleks. Oleh karenanya, dibutuhkan pengelolaan risiko supply chain untuk koordinasi dan mengelola aktivitas dari masing-masing aktivitas bisnis supaya tujuan utama berupa peningkatan produktivitas gula bisa tercapai. Langkah awal yang harus dilakukan adalah identifikasi risiko. Dalam penelitian ini digunakan metode Delphi karena metode Delphi menyediakan alternatif yang lebih handal dan efisien untuk memecahkan masalah dengan ketidakpastian yang tinggi dan menguatkan cara brainstorming dan wawancara expert Delphi. Responden dalam metode Delphi terdiri dari 2 stakeholder utama dalam supply chain industri gula, yaitu PG. Djatiroto dan petani tebu.</jats:p>"

The main objectives of this research were to assess the level of customer satisfaction on urban water supply services of Southern Region, Ethiopia, and identify major determinants. Quantitative data were collected from 8,413 customers in seventeen towns, using a questionnaire based on the SERVQUAL model. Qualitative data were collected from customers via focus group discussion, and interviews were used with utility employees and officials. The results showed 47% of customers were satisfied with the water supply enterprise services, while 43% were dissatisfied for various reasons. The customer satisfaction score was below the acceptable level for all service quality dimensions, and understanding of customers, communication, and responsiveness were far below the benchmark. The correlation analysis revealed the existence of a monotonic, positive relationship between customers' total satisfaction and service quality dimensions. The proportional odds model indicated that total customer satisfaction was highly dependent on the nine service quality dimensions used in this research.</jats:p>",

Hence, we aim with this study to unveil the influence of supply chain variables on supply chain performance and sustainability. The proposed model consists of 10 hypotheses to disclose the relationship between 6 main constructs; Supply Chain Uncertainty, Supply Chain Risks, Supply Chain Performance, Collaborative Planning Systems, Vulnerability, and Supply Chain Sustainability. The hypotheses are validated by empirical study with 213 domestic and foreign automotive companies operating in Turkey. The results of this study indicate that supply chain sustainability is primarily affected by supply chain performance and collaborative planning systems. The findings of this study could provide the necessary point of view for the managers working in supply chain management area to comprehend the dynamics behind sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>"

The analysis was based on two facilities, including one with a diverse spectrum of consumers, including residential housing and industry. The carried out simulations indicate the possibility of the occurrence of water quality degradation as a result of excessively long periods of storage in the water supply network. Also important is the influence of the irregularity of water use, especially in the case of supplying various kinds of consumers (in the analysed case - mining companies).</jats:p>",

A sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO) facility fulfills the need for pure water. Conventionally, these plants use open-ocean water that is rich with natural organic matter (NOM) and transparent exo-polymers (TEP). Marine flora increases the demand for fouling the membrane in the SWRO facility that raises the pressure and results in the halting of the station. Therefore, water samples were collected from SWRO stages during high-pressure problems to probe the factors that play a key role in membrane biofouling. NOM and TEP particles physically disappeared after the dual-media filter (DMF). However, turbidity significantly increased after the DMF stage, which is indicative of the fragmentation of NOM and TEP particles. Chlorophyll and phycoerythrin disappeared after the DMF stage but were observed in the reject stage (brine). Therefore, NOM and TEP are playing a role indirectly in membrane biofouling. Fifteen potential species of heterotrophic prokaryotes are identified and recorded in all stages of the SWRO. The characteristics of these species imply that they form a cooperative consortium that potentially creates the biofilm in the RO membrane. Therefore, SWRO facilities that use open-ocean water must develop highly sophisticated pretreatment technology to eliminate the seeds of the biofilm that fouls RO membranes.</jats:p>",

Data were collected from 69 respondents working for organisations in two industrial segments within the UK manufacturing sector: “Industrial and Commercial Machinery and Computer Equipment” and “Measuring, Analysing and Controlling Instruments, Photographic, Medical and Optical Instruments”. The respondents worked for entities that were categorised in three groups: customers, suppliers, and entities that were both customers and suppliers. The groups that were self-identified as “customers” or “suppliers” answered 20 survey items each and the group that was identified as both “customers” and “suppliers” answered 40 survey items.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The results revealed that AM was considered a suitable vehicle for the fulfilment of SP demand. However, AM appeared to make no material difference to CS; the scenario used improved delivery time of SP but increased price. Also, AM was thought to improve IP through less reliance on buffer stock to manage SR and spikes in demand and less carrying of SP at risk of obsolescence.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The respondents worked for entities within two manufacturing industry segments within the UK and the insights garnered may not be indicative of similar organisations competing in other manufacturing industry segments within the UK or in other countries. In addition, approximately 82 per cent of the surveyed respondents worked for small organisations with fewer than 100 employees and the results may differ for larger organisations. Further limitations were the relatively small sample size and lack of open-ended questions used in the survey. Larger sample size and the usage of open-ended survey questions may lead to more reliable and valuable responses and feedback.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The findings from this research are considered to be of interest to practitioners contemplating adoption of AM and to developers of AM wishing to increase market share due to the positive reaction of entities within the industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment, and measuring, analysing and controlling instrumentation industrial segments. This research raises awareness to the possible risks and rewards – from a range of perspectives, of AM to practitioners considering its adoption in the spare parts supply chain (SPSC).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The paper takes a novel perspective on AM in SPSCs by illuminating the supplier and buyer perspective based on empirical data. This research provides new insights about the appreciation of the use of AM in SPSCs of mostly small sized manufacturing companies located in the UK. This paper also gives new insights about the willingness/conditions of manufacturing companies in the UK to adopt AM for the provision of SP. The originality of this research is twofold: it broached the applicability of AM in the supply chains of the two targeted industrial segments, and as far as the authors are aware, the influence of CSy (e.g. to price or lead time) and SR on SPSC players’ attitude to AM is yet to be considered. Finally, this research adopted a systems theory lens and considered system-wide impact of AM introduction.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

This article builds on research accounting for levels of primary timber consumption—e.g., toward forest footprints—and developing reference values for benchmarking sustainability—e.g., toward land use targets—in order to improve systemic monitoring of timber and forest use. Specifically, it looks at future trends to assess how current EU policy may impact forests at an EU and global scale. Future demand scenarios are based on projections derived and adapted from the literature to depict developments under different scenario assumptions. Results reveal that by 2030, EU consumption levels on a per capita basis are estimated to be increasingly disproportionate compared to the rest of the world. EU consumption scenarios based on meeting around a 40% share of the EU renewable energy targets with timber would overshoot both the EU and global reference value range for sustainable supply capacities in 2030. Overall, findings support literature pointing to an increased risk of problem shifting relating to both how much and where timber needed for meeting renewable energy targets is sourced. It is argued that a sustainable level of timber consumption should be characterized by balance between supply (what the forest can provide on a sustainable basis) and demand (how much is used on a per capita basis, considering the concept of fair shares). To this end, future research should close data gaps, increase methodological robustness and address the socio-political legitimacy of the safe operating space concept towards targets in the future. A re-use of timber within the economy should be supported to increase supply options.</jats:p>"

We aim to analyze its effect on dynamic pricing in a supply chain with multiple suppliers and one manufacturer. The profit‐maximizing manufacturer makes final products using raw materials from suppliers with heterogeneous prices and emission rates. A two‐stage game model is built over an infinite time horizon for this issue. In the first stage, suppliers face price‐dependent demand to set their prices and production rates under the constraint of inventory capacity. Then, in response to the carbon tax scheme, the manufacturer evaluates the procurement prices and emission rates of suppliers to control its emission volumes and sets the sales price of its product. This article predominately focuses on the optimal pricing strategies in a decentralized supply chain. The open‐loop equilibrium and Markovian Nash equilibrium for the dynamic pricing game models of both suppliers and the manufacturer are derived, respectively. The equilibrium prices of suppliers and the manufacturer can be solved based on both irreversible actions and real‐time states. These two types of equilibria can be regarded as the solutions of two different models in specific situations. To analyze the effect of sourcing diversity on pricing strategies and emissions control for the manufacturer, the more general equilibrium price for the manufacturer in an <jats:italic>n</jats:italic>‐suppliers oligopoly is studied. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the equilibrium and its monotonicity with various parameter settings.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we built a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain model composed of manufacturers, retailers, and network recycling platforms. Based on the influence of customer bargaining behavior, we studied several different scenarios of centralized decision-making, decentralized decision-making, and contract coordination, using the Stackelberg game theory. The results show that retailers and network recycling platforms will reduce the direct recovery prices to maintain their own profit when considering the impact of consumer bargaining behavior, while remanufacturers will improve the transfer payment price for surrendering part of the profit under revenue and the expense sharing contract. Using this contract, we can achieve supply chain coordination and eliminate the effect of consumer bargaining behavior on supply chain performance. It can be viewed from the parameter sensitivity analysis that when we select the appropriate sharing coefficient, the closed-loop supply chain can achieve the same system performance under a centralized decision.</jats:p>"

Proactive environmental strategy is considered as an internal antecedent and competitive pressure as an external antecedent. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis is used to test the hypothesized relationships using data from a sample of 149 manufacturing companies located within the U.K. food industry. The results suggest that proactive strategy and competitive pressure exert both independent and combined influences on environmental supply chain practices. Proactive strategy appears to be a stronger driver of these practices, suggesting that internal stakeholders such as directors, managers, and employees may be more influential in the adoption of certain practices than external stakeholder pressures. This article builds upon the recent wave of research highlighting the potential for internal and external factors to generate a combined influence on the adoption of environmental practices within companies and their supply chains. </jats:p>",

Established in 1997, CHIP allocated $40 billion of federal funds across the first 10 years but continued support required reauthorization. After 2 failed attempts in Congress, CHIP was finally reauthorized and significantly expanded in 2009. Although much is known about the demand‐side policy effects, much less is understood about the policy's impact on providers. In this paper, we leverage a unique physician dataset to examine if and how pediatricians responded to the expansion of the public insurance program. We find that newly trained pediatricians are 8 percentage points more likely to subspecialize and as much as 17 percentage points more likely to enter private practice after the law passed. There is also suggestive evidence of greater private practice growth in more rural locations. The sharp supply‐side changes that we observe indicate that expanding public insurance can have important spillover effects on provider training and practice choices.</jats:p>",

The target population was all the 187 state corporations in Kenya. The study employed a census approach. Primary data was collected using questionnaires. A pilot study was conducted to measure the research instruments reliability and validity. Descriptive statistics were used aided by Statistical Packages for Social Sciences version 24 to compute percentages of respondents’ answers. Inferential statistics using linear regression and correlation analysis were applied to assist examining relationship between the research variables. The results were presented using tables and graphs.Results: The findings revealed that supplier competence explained 44.1 % of the total variations in performance of state corporations in Kenya. Further, the results indicated that the overall model was statistically significant as supported by a p value of 0.000. This was supported by an F statistic of 111.904 and the reported p value (0.000) which was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 significance level. In addition, the findings show that there is a positive and significant relationship between supplier competence and performance of state corporations in Kenya as supported by a p value of 0.000 and a beta coefficient of (0.903). This implies that an increase in supplier competence by 1 unit would increase the performance of state corporations by 0.903units.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy:  Based on the findings, the study recommended that suppliers should develop competent technical abilities so as to provide high quality products or services. Some of the technical dimensions that suppliers should develop competence in include; compliance with quantity, compliance with due date, compliance with packaging standard, production planning systems of suppliers, and maintenance activities of suppliers, plant layout and material. It’s also recommended that state corporations in Kenya should check frequently if supplier organisation is abreast with the newer information technology developments as technology is very dynamic and changes regularly as the technology that was used in the past is not the one we using now and it will not be the one we will use tomorrow.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to analyze the extrinsic and intrinsic OC blood supply on cadaveric specimens using dissections and microcomputer tomography (Micro‐CT). Thirteen human specimens were dissected and the internal or common carotid arteries were injected with red latex, China Ink with gelatin or barium sulfate. Three Micro‐CTs were obtained to reveal the intrinsic blood supply to the OC. The superior hypophyseal arteries (SupHypA) (13/13) and posterior communicating artery (PCoA) (12/13) supplied the pial network on the inferior side of the OC. The first segment of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) (10/10), SupHypA (7/10), the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) (9/10), and PComA (1/10) supplied the pial network of its superior side. The intrinsic OC blood supply was divided into three networks (two lateral and one central). Capillaries entering the OC originated principally from the inferior pial network. The lateral network capillaries had the same orientation as the visual lateral pathways, but the central network was not correlated with the nasal fibers crossing into the OC. There was no anastomosis in the pial or intrinsic networks. Only SupHypA, PCoA, ACoA, and ACA were involved in the OC blood supply. Because there was no extrinsic or intrinsic anastomosis, all arteries should be preserved. Tumor compression of the inferior intrinsic arterial network could contribute to visual defects.  Clin.

Intrinsic case study methodology was applied to evaluate eleven drinking water project of western region of the country. Field observation, focus group discussion, and key informant interview methods were deployed during collecting information. This study found that all the drinking water schemes are running presently with big social and cultural issues. Beneficiaries are changing their behaviour while getting drinking water services offering by government and non-government mechanism. As so far, for natural and effective use of drinking water schemes it is inevitable to change social stigma and cultural attitude of the local people. Finally, this study reveals the importance of social analysis during drinking water project formulation stage so that issues of changing social behaviour of the beneficiaries can be addressed. Nepalese Journal of Development and Rural StudiesVol. 14 (Joint issue) (1&amp;2), 2017, Page: 80-85</jats:p>"

Red-footed falcon <jats:italic>(Falco vespertinus</jats:italic>) preys predominantly on larger insect species with a supplementary portion of smaller vertebrates. In the breeding periods 2014 and 2016 their food supply, focusing on Orthoptera, Mantodea, Rodentia and Eulipotyphla, was analysed at five historical nesting sites of the species in Slovakia. Preference for these prey groups in the diet was also studied at the last active nesting site in this country. Overall we recorded 45 Orthoptera species (of which 23 species are known as the food of the red-footed falcon), one species of Mantodea, 10 species of Rodentia (of which 2 species are known as the food of the red-footed falcon) and 5 species of the Eulipotyphla order in the food supply. With regard to the availability of the falcons' preferred food, in both years the most suitable was the Tvrdošovce site, which continuously showed the greatest range and abundance of particular species. In the interannual comparison the insects showed lower variability in abundance than the small mammals. In 2014 the growth of the common vole <jats:italic>(Microtus arvalis)</jats:italic> population culminated and with the exception of a single site (Bodza) a slump in abundance was recorded in 2016. In comparing the diet composition with the food supply at the last Slovak breeding site Rusovce (Special Protection Area Sysľovské polia), we recorded significant preference for grasshopper <jats:italic>Caliptamus italicus</jats:italic> (in 2014), common vole (in 2016) and cricket <jats:italic>Tettigonia viridissima</jats:italic> (in both years) in the falcons' diet. They did not prey on the <jats:italic>Apodemus sylvaticus</jats:italic> species belonging among the abundant small mammal species in that locality. Conservation measures in the agricultural landscape are discussed in relation to homogeneous red-footed falcon breeding territories.</jats:p>",

Optimization research on system construction has recently become an important issue. In this paper, simple stochastic mathematical equations were used to interpret the optimal design problem of a DER system, and based on this, a novel method for solving the optimization problem, which has multi-dimensional stochastic uncertainties (involving the price of input-energy and energy supply and demand), was put forward. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model was established for the optimal design of the DER system by combining the ideas of mean value and variance, aiming to minimize the total costs, including facility costs, energy purchase costs, and loss caused by energy supply shortage, and considering the energy balance and facility performance constraints. In the end, a DER system design for an office building district in Xuzhou, China, was taken as an example to verify the model. The influences of uncertainty on the selection of system facilities and the economic evaluation were analyzed. The result indicated that uncertainty of energy demand played a significant role in optimal design, whereas energy price played a negligible role. With respect to economy, if uncertainties are not considered in system design, it will result in a short supply, and therefore the total cost will increase considerably. The calculation convergence was compared with previous work. The implementation results showed the practicality and efficiency of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

The main goal of this paper was to assess the regional green and blue water footprints (WF) of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) production in the department of Norte de Santander, Colombia. Water footprint assessment was based on the Water Footprint Assessment Manual. The results show that the green water footprint was about 13,189 m3/ton, and the blue water footprint was 5687 m3/ton. The WF proposed method can be a good approximation for the uses of water for different crops, but weather conditions and hydrological modeling must be considered in extreme conditions, which would permit a much more detailed analysis for a region. This study allowed us to provide data on the cocoa water footprint, principally concentrating on elevated grain production in the department of Norte de Santander, Colombia. In addition, some of these results may positively contribute to water resource management improvement, especially regarding food security and water scarcity, both at the local and national levels. Therefore, the cocoa production process was analyzed from agronomic practices in settled crops, through the primary processing of the grain, to the procedures of grain selection and packaging. Thus, taking into consideration that most cocoa crops produced in Colombia are not irrigated, it is possible to implement productivity enhancement programs.</jats:p>"

The target population was all the 187 state corporations in Kenya. The study employed a census approach. Primary data was collected using questionnaires. A pilot study was conducted to measure the research instruments reliability and validity. Descriptive statistics were used aided by Statistical Packages for Social Sciences version 24 to compute percentages of respondents’ answers. Inferential statistics using linear regression and correlation analysis were applied to assist examining relationship between the research variables. The results were presented using tables and graphs.Results: The findings revealed that supplier competence explained 44.1 % of the total variations in performance of state corporations in Kenya. Further, the results indicated that the overall model was statistically significant as supported by a p value of 0.000. This was supported by an F statistic of 111.904 and the reported p value (0.000) which was less than the conventional probability of 0.05 significance level. In addition, the findings show that there is a positive and significant relationship between supplier competence and performance of state corporations in Kenya as supported by a p value of 0.000 and a beta coefficient of (0.903). This implies that an increase in supplier competence by 1 unit would increase the performance of state corporations by 0.903units.Unique contribution to theory, practice and policy:  Based on the findings, the study recommended that suppliers should develop competent technical abilities so as to provide high quality products or services. Some of the technical dimensions that suppliers should develop competence in include; compliance with quantity, compliance with due date, compliance with packaging standard, production planning systems of suppliers, and maintenance activities of suppliers, plant layout and material. It’s also recommended that state corporations in Kenya should check frequently if supplier organisation is abreast with the newer information technology developments as technology is very dynamic and changes regularly as the technology that was used in the past is not the one we using now and it will not be the one we will use tomorrow.</jats:p>"

The cognitive ability of pharmacists to recall, synthesise and memorise information is a critical aspect of safe and optimal medicines use, yet few studies have investigated the clinical reasoning and decision-making processes pharmacists use when supplying prescribed medicines. The objective of this study was to examine the patterns and processes of pharmacists’ clinical reasoning and to identify the information sources used, when making decisions about the safety and appropriateness of prescribed medicines. Ten community pharmacists participated in a simulation in which they were required to review a prescription and make decisions about the safety and appropriateness of supplying the prescribed medicines to the patient, whilst at the same time thinking aloud about the tasks required. Following the simulation each pharmacist was asked a series of questions to prompt retrospective thinking aloud using video-stimulated recall. The simulated consultation and retrospective interview were recorded and transcribed for thematic analysis. All of the pharmacists made a safe and appropriate supply of two prescribed medicines to the simulated patient. Qualitative analysis identified seven core thinking processes used during the supply process: considering prescription in context, retrieving information, identifying medication-related issues, processing information, collaborative planning, decision making and reflection; and align closely with other health professionals. The insights from this study have implications for enhancing awareness of decision making processes in pharmacy practice and informing teaching and assessment approaches in medication supply.</jats:p>"

A neuro-fuzzy network (NFN) was developed for three different levels (low, medium and high) of turbid water. Experimental turbid water bioclarification data were used, in the Matlab environment through a sub-clustering neuro-fuzzy function, for modelling NFN. The network consisted of four inputs (untreated water turbidity, untreated water pH, settling time as well as treated water turbidity) and Mango Kernel Coagulant (MKC) dosage as the output variable. The best NFN architectures that produced minimum percentage error were considered for biocoagulant dosage calculator GUI development and implementation. The experimental data and results obtained from the NFN-GUI calculator were compared; and the prediction of the dosage has Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as well as correlation coefficient ranges of 0.01–0.10 and 0.93–0.99 respectively. The high correlation coefficient found in this study indicates that the NFN-GUI calculator is a perfect match with the traditional jar-test calculator. Therefore, the Matlab-based calculator template is able to predict the biocoagulant quantity needed in a community water bioclarification treatment unit.</jats:p>",

Setting: Study was conceptualised during re-location of a 355-bed general hospital to newer premises within Singapore with an increased capacity of 700 beds. Study duration was 1.5 years and data collection was performed from Sep 2014 to Sep 2015.Results: Automating the inventory check and use of automated guided vehicles for medical supplies can improve business and operational performance by saving time on no-value added activities that can be transferred to patient care. RFID intervention requires least number of man-hours per day reducing the total manpower requirements by about one third as compared to the manual process while improving productivity by about 40%, it also provides cost savings of about 25% over a period of 10 years. Sensitivity analysis shows that extent of these cost savings are dependent on overall staff utilisation. Although use of AGV alone is expensive in our model, combining AGVs with RFID technology provides the least manpower dependence among the different interventions studied, it also gives a positive return on investment as compared to manual process beyond 3 years of operations.Conclusions: Optimising supply chains within healthcare helps minimise manpower dependency and costs. However, prior to adopting a specific intervention, the unique characteristics of each healthcare setting should be considered. There is need for similar research into healthcare supply chains to identify key determinants to cost savings and improving productivity, both locally and regionally.</jats:p>"

This study is undertaken to empirically investigate the impact of supply chain management on competitiveness. Sample consists of 327 production managers of medium scale entrepreneurial firms (manufacturing sector) in Colombo district. The analyzed data supports the hypotheses revealing that higher the level of involvement in SCM practices higher the competitiveness. Further, it is found that except level of information quality and lean practices, other practices of SCM (Strategic partnership with suppliers, customer relationship, level of information sharing and internal supply chain process are significant factors that affect firm competitiveness.</jats:p>"

We evaluate four end‐to‐end supply chain strategies under various scenarios using a newsvendor model, and compare the model's predictions against the prescriptions in Fisher's ( 1997 ) framework, which recommends “cost‐efficient” supply chains for “functional” products and “responsive” supply chains for “innovative” products. We considered combinations of offshore vs. nearshore sourcing, and online vs. brick‐and‐mortar retailing. This study's key finding is that sourcing and sales strategies are not completely modular: an integral end‐to‐end strategy may not decompose into an optimal sourcing strategy and a separately computed optimal sales strategy. Our analyses sharpen strategic supply chain thinking by identifying realistic conditions in which an end‐to‐end strategy with cost‐efficient components could outperform one with responsive components for innovative products, or when one with responsive components could be more profitable than one with cost‐efficient components for functional products. </jats:p>",

Yet most countries in sub-Saharan Africa experience significant delays in diagnosis because of operational inefficiencies in early infant diagnosis (EID) networks. We develop a two-part modeling framework relying on optimization and simulation to generate operational improvements in the assignment of clinics to laboratories and the allocation of capacity across laboratories, and to evaluate the associated impact on the number of infants initiating treatment. Applying our methodology to EID program data from Mozambique, we validate our simulation model and estimate that optimally reassigning clinics to labs would decrease the average sample turnaround time (TAT) by 11% and increase the number of infected infants starting treatment by about 4% relative to the current system. Furthermore, consolidating all diagnostic capacity in one centralized lab would decrease average TATs by an estimated 22% and increase the number of infected infants initiating treatment by 7%. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the consolidation of capacity in a single location would remain near optimal across a wide range of laboratory utilization levels in Mozambique. However, this full consolidation solution is dominated by configurations with two or more labs for EID networks with average transportation times larger than those currently observed in Mozambique by at least 15%. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1646 . </jats:p>",

Rooted in the literature on demand and supply integration, we develop the relationship between delivery variety decisions and sales through the mediating role of unit fill rate. We find that a decision to increase delivery variety will indirectly improve sales through the mediating role of the fill rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that decisions on order variety (the number of ordering methods offered to buyers) moderates this mediation effect. A decision to increase order variety enhances the benefits of delivery variety. We estimate our models using archival data including deliveries, order fulfillment, sales records, and other operational data over three years. When the number of delivery methods increases from 1 to 3, fill rates increase by 1.22% and sales increase by 15.39%, and when the number of order methods increases from 1 to 4, the impact of delivery variety on fill rates increases by an additional 0.39% and on sales by an additional 4.68%. These findings provide empirical support for the integration of demand and supply associated with decision making in supply chains and underscore the need for top management to consider the complementary benefits of delivery variety and order variety on order fulfillment and sales.</jats:p>",

It  is  through  significant  investment  in  infrastructure  development  that economic   growth   and   poverty   alleviation   can   be   enhanced.   However   central   to   all construction projects is an effective and sustainable procurement system.  There is a notable shift by some African governments to turn to the private sector to design, build, finance and operate infrastructure facilities previously provided by the public sector in the form of Public Private   Partnerships   (PPP’s).   As   an   innovative   financing   model,   PPPs   present   an opportunity  to  governments  to  improve  service  delivery.  Accordingly,  this  paper  focuses  on assessing  international  best  practices  as  to  how  some  developing  nations  tap  into  the resources  of  the  private  sector  in  implementing  their  infrastructure  projects.  The  study  is  a result  of  critical  review,  synthesis  and  contextualization  of  relevant  academic  literature, conference  and  journal  publications.  A  thorough  document  review method  was  employed  to assess   how   some   developing   countries   have   institutionalized   PPP   as   part   of   their development strategy. The paper will be of significant value to senior government officialsasunderstanding  the  concept  and  dynamics  of  PPP  will  resultin  accelerated  and  effective service delivery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Nitrogen is a major limiting factor for crop productivity. The relationship between photosynthesis and nitrogen nutrition has been widely studied. However, the molecular response of leaf photosynthesis to low nitrogen supply in crops is less clear. In this study, RNA sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) was used to investigate the gene expressions related to photosynthesis in maize in response to low nitrogen supply. It was found that low nitrogen supply down-regulated the expression of genes involved in photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII). Thus, low nitrogen supply down-regulated the expression of genes related to the antenna system, reduced light absorption, light transport, and electron transport. Correspondingly, the parameters related to chlorophyll fluorescence were very sensitive to nitrogen deficiency. Under low nitrogen supply, leaf chlorophyll content, actual quantum yield of PSII photochemistry, photochemical quenching, and electron transport rate, were reduced. However, the thermal diffusion and chlorophyll fluorescence were increased. RNA-Seq was used to analyze the genes involved in the response of leaf photosynthesis to low nitrogen supply in maize. These results highlight the possibility of utilizing chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and the related genes, as indicators for plant nitrogen nutrition. This could lead to the development of new tools to make precise nitrogen fertilizer recommendations and select nitrogen-efficient genotypes.</jats:p>"

The optimal supply stability as well as the optimal purchasing strategy are characterized with a quadratic cost function. Based on these models, the following findings are brought about. Firstly, when the difficulty level of building supply stability exceeds a certain threshold, it would be more profitable for the retailer to choose a less reliable supplier. Secondly, given that the suppliers can get positive profit, the retailer would choose the one who has the strongest ability to be reliable. Thirdly, the equilibrium supply to the retailer would always meet the demand on the retailing market. Finally, emergency procurement is shown to be an effective way to reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions. To better fit the real situations, an extended model which considers the impact of the stability on costs is further discussed.</jats:p>"

It then led to the adoption of public private partnership (PPP)  initiative  with  a  view  to  pursuing  the  broad  goal  of  housing-for-all  in  Nigeria.  Most recent  studies  have  however  criticised  the  effectiveness  of  the  existing  PPP  practice  in  the housing  provision  structure  without  providing  a  pragmatic  suggestion  towards  an  effective framework  for  improvement.  It  thus  raised  the  question;  what  are  the  main  causes  of ineffectiveness  of  existing  PPP  in  housing  provision  and  how  can  an  effective  PPP  policy framework  for  urban  low-income  housing  be  achieved  in  Nigeria?  This  study  utilised  the concepts   of   new   institutional   economics   (NIE) -a   theoretical   and   methodological underpinning   for   multi-actors’  policy  matters.  Using  qualitative  data  from  structured interview  and  credible  literature  sources,    findings  indicate  that  uncertainties  in  land accessibility, high transaction costs and the developers’ high  profit  agenda,  are  the  major causes  of  PPP  ineffectiveness  for  housing  provision,  which  are  also  attributed  to    lack  of  a specific PPP policy that recognises  all income groups  and their roles on housing provision. End-users  suggested  that  governmentcould  have  a  negotiation  with  land  owners  and building materials dealers to address the housing problem. In conclusion, it is established in this study that adoption of all-inclusive conceptual approach described within the context of NIE thought can facilitate an effective planning for urban low-income housing in Nigeria.</jats:p>"

Data on coffee supply, economic variables (rural credit, rural agricultural credit, and production value), and climatic variables (air temperature, rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, water deficit, and water surplus) for each region, during the period from 2000-2014, were used. The models were calibrated using multiple linear regression, and all possible combinations were tested for selecting the variables. Coffee supply was the dependent variable, and the other ones were considered independent. The accuracy and precision of the models were assessed by the mean absolute percentage error and the adjusted coefficient of determination, respectively. The variables that most affect coffee supply are production value and air temperature. Coffee supply can be estimated with multiple linear regressions using economic and climatic variables. The most accurate models are those calibrated to estimate coffee supply for the regions of Cássia dos Coqueiros and Osvaldo Cruz.</jats:p>",

The required amount of raw materials for production in the internal supply chain is determined by minimizing the total relevant operational cost, made up by the setup cost and the stock maintenance cost, which maximizes efficiency of the resources used in the process. This study takes into account such factors as capacity of the hoppers, the time-dependent setup sequence, routes of supply hoppers, filling rates and supply times, based on a model of mixed-integer linear programming. Objective: Provide a strategy that allows efficient use of resources in the production process, subjected to the demand of materials from the material requirements planning (MRP) of the company under study. Materials and methods. The short-term multi-period model defines the scheduling of elevators and conveyors for each time period, and the amount of raw materials that is sent to each hopper and bins. Results. This research determines the amount of initial stock required to operate, as well as the operations strategy that the company under study must follow, so that it meets the demand for raw materials, making efficient use of the resources used in the production process. Conclusion. In the analysis of results and presentation of scenarios, the most representative cost, the one related to stock maintenance, could be observed. Since this is a critical factor for companies belonging to this sector, we present an innovative proposal, both in practice and in the literature, to contribute to minimizing the total setup cost and the cost of maintenance of raw material stock in hoppers through a rational use of resources.</jats:p>"

The applied heritage of logistics and supply chain scholarship motivates researchers to identify problems residing in current and future practice, address them in a conscientious manner, and to provide findings that yield meaningful insights. Yet, this bond is sometimes strained when scholarship loses touch with “real problems” found in industry. Strains in the bond then limit the contribution potential and impact of resultant work. This editorial calls for supply chain researchers to embrace the discipline's applied heritage in the identification of problems and delivery of results, while employing the requisite rigor for valid conclusions. Fortunately, there has never been a better time to work with practitioners in light of the disruptive forces at work in industry and the thirst for meaningful insights.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper introduces a theoretical explanatory conceptual framework derived from a literature analysis and further developed by four case studies from the automotive sector, which highlight the linkages between the value proposition and supply chain of PSS providers. The results are summarised into 11 propositions that underline the key roles and capabilities that bridge PSS offering features with distinctive characteristics of the PSS supply chain.

This widely accepted practice is further complicated by a lack of advisory guidelines for non-microcystin-producing cyanotoxins. This study has investigated the effectiveness of this management approach over five and a half years, monitoring 65 different sites in South East Queensland using phycological and toxin-analysis. This study concluded that cell counts of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, the most common potentially toxin producing species of cyanobacteria in South East Queensland's inland lakes, was a poor proxy indicator for cylindrospermopsin toxin production. Seqwater, the local water authority responsible for the management of recreational access to drinking water storage lakes, initiated an alternative management approach for recreational cyanobacterial water quality management in December 2016. This new approach is based on cyanobacterial toxin guideline values for five different cyanotoxins, with closures and warning notices issued based on the actual cyanotoxin concentration, not the proxy indicator. We encourage other recreational water management authorities consider this approach to manage recreational access in the future.</jats:p>",

Numerous nonformulary medications were kept on hand and reordered based on inventory levels that were established with inadequate usage information, while some formulary agents did not have on-hand inventory levels and had to be reordered on a patient-specific basis, which required paperwork and then a review by drug information staff per institutional policy. Because there was no true distinction in the ordering of formulary versus nonformulary oncology agents, the medical staff prescribed both in the same manner, leaving the pharmacy staff responsible for ensuring that enough quantities were on hand for many drugs, regardless of formulary status. Using supply chain management principles, a formal analysis of the on-hand inventory was performed. In addition, the formulary process for oncology drugs was restructured to align with how oncology drugs are managed for on-hand inventory levels. The alignment of these processes allowed the operation to have 1 supply strategy for the ambulatory oncology infusion center. As a result, inventory exhaustion rates were reduced by 70% and inventory turn rates improved by 78%. There was also significant time savings in the operational process streamlining, eliminating the rework and inefficiencies caused by an unclear process that was not fully captured in this assessment.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Alignment of the formulary review process with inventory analyses that support supply management principles reduced inventory exhaustion while improving inventory turn rates.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In the 21st century, climate change in combination with increasing demand, mainly from population growth, will exert greater pressure on the ecosystems of the Sahel to supply food and feed resources. The balance between supply and demand, defined as the annual biomass required for human consumption, serves as a key metric for quantifying basic resource shortfalls over broad regions.Here we apply an exploratory modelling framework to analyse the variations in the timing and geography of different NPP (net primary production) supply–demand scenarios, with distinct assumptions determining supply and demand, for the 21st century Sahel. We achieve this by coupling a simple NPP supply model forced with projections from four representative concentration pathways with a global, reduced-complexity demand model driven by socio-economic data and assumptions derived from five shared socio-economic pathways.For the scenario that deviates least from current socio-economic and climate trends, we find that per capita NPP begins to outstrip supply in the 2040s, while by 2050 half the countries in the Sahel experience NPP shortfalls. We also find that despite variations in the timing of the onset of NPP shortfalls, demand cannot consistently be met across the majority of scenarios. Moreover, large between-country variations are shown across the scenarios, in which by the year 2050 some countries consistently experience shortage or surplus, while others shift from surplus to shortage. At the local level (i.e. grid cell), hotspots of total NPP shortfall consistently occur in the same locations across all scenarios but vary in size and magnitude. These hotspots are linked to population density and high demand. For all scenarios, total simulated NPP supply doubles by 2050 but is outpaced by increasing demand due to a combination of population growth and the adoption of diets rich in animal products. Finally, variations in the timing of the onset and end of supply shortfalls stem from the assumptions that underpin the shared socio-economic pathways rather than the representative concentration pathways.Our results suggest that the UN sustainable development goals for eradicating hunger are at high risk for failure. This emphasizes the importance of policy interventions such as the implementation of sustainable and healthy diets, family planning, reducing yield gaps, and encouraging the transfer of resources to impoverished areas via trade relations.\n                    </jats:p>"

Our research is in the context of a logistics service supply chain (LSSC) consisted of a logistics service integrator (LSI) and a functional logistics service provider (FLSP). LSI purchases first a service capacity from FLSP long before demand is realized and then adjusts this ordering quantity based on demand updating. We developed the profit models for LSI and FLSP which also include the constraints of rational expectations. Based on the assumption of Bayesian updating, this paper investigates the conditions for sub-strategy II outperforming sub-strategy I. The main results are verified through numerical analysis. Counter-intuitively, sub-strategy II is not necessarily always better than sub-strategy I. When using sub-strategy II, LSI needs to purchase more service the first time of placing orders, but the expected profits increase for both LSI and FLSP only with certain conditions, which have been derived as propositions in this paper. </jats:p>",

Technological innovations, price fluctuations of raw materials, as well as tax, regulatory, and market demands are driving change and making the pharmaceutical supply chain more complex. Traditional supply chain management methods struggle to protect the pharmaceutical supply chain, maintain its integrity, enhance customer confidence, and aid regulators in tracking medicines. To develop effective measures that secure the pharmaceutical supply chain, it is important that the community is aware of the state-of-the-art capabilities available to the supply chain owners and participants. In this article, we will be presenting a survey of existing hardware-enabled pharmaceutical supply chain security schemes and their limitations. We also highlight the current challenges and point out future research directions.

Furthermore, the Resolution called for such a differentiation, at least for products imported into the EU, to be based on yet-to-be-developed sustainability criteria, which the Resolution also outlined and called for. This article explores the potential feasibility of distinguishing tariff classifications based on process-characteristics rather than product-characteristics, while contrasting such approach to non-tariff related measures implemented by major economies (e.g., tying biofuel subsidies to ‘renewability’ in the United States, or to ‘sustainability’ in the European Union). The article also discusses the sustainability criteria outlined and proposed by the European Parliament, as well as their relation to other sustainability criteria present on the world stage, trying to identify the scope, tools and legal ambits through which tariff advantages could be provided to sustainable products in a WTO consistent and non-discriminatory manner.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

In this study, the effects of various concentrations of ammonium in culture media on the photosynthetic performance of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were done under two light conditions: low and high intensity. The microbes were grown at low (75% NH4Cl dosage), normal (100% NH4Cl dosage, which was 2 M NH4Cl), and high (125% NH4Cl dosage) nitrogen content. Cells density and chlorophyll content were quantitatively determined. Immunoblotting technique was used to separate proteins based on molecular mass. In both low and high light intensity, cells grown in 75% NH4Cl dosage culture medium showed lower cell density and chlorophyll concentration than those grown in 100% and 125% NH4Cl dosage media. The later two media produced almost the same amount of cell density and chlorophyll concentration. In conclusion, 75% NH4Cl dosage was insufficient for C. reinhardtii cells to grow well. The results also showed that accumulation of photosystem I (PsaA and PsaD/F) and light harvesting complex II (LHCII) were higher in low light than in high light intensity.AbstrakOrganisme menggunakan nitrogen diantaranya untuk memproduksi asam amino, protein, dan asam nukleat. Dalam percobaan ini pengaruh berbagai konsentrasi amonium dalam media pada fotosintesis Chlamydomonas reinhardtii dilakukan di bawah dua kondisi cahaya: intensitas rendah dan tinggi. C. reinhardtii ditumbuhkan dalam medium dengan dosis nitrogen (N) rendah (75% dosis NH4Cl), normal (100% dosis NH4Cl, yakni NH4Cl 2 M), dan tinggi (125% dosis NH4Cl). Parameter yang diukur adalah  kepadatan sel dan konsentrasi klorofil. Analisis protein dilakukan dengan imunobloting untuk memisahkan protein berdasarkan massa molekul. Pada intensitas cahaya rendah dan tinggi, sel-sel pada medium dengan 75% NH4Cl menunjukkan kepadatan sel dan konsentrasi klorofil lebih rendah dibandingkan dengan 100% NH4Cl dan 125% NH4Cl, di mana kedua media ini menghasilkan kepadatan sel maupun konsentrasi klorofil yang hampir sama. Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa 75% NH4Cl tidak cukup bagi C. reinhardtii untuk tumbuh dengan baik. Selain itu, akumulasi fotosistem I (PsaA dan PsaD/F) dan kompleks pemanenan cahaya II (LHCII) lebih tinggi pada sistem fotosintesis dengan intensitas cahaya rendah dibandingkan cahaya tinggi.Kata kunci: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, fotosintesis, intensitas cahaya, klorofil, nitrogen</jats:p>"

As organizational stakeholders, their involvement is vital in determining the ability of the dairy to achieve its goals. The other recommendation is the managers of cooperatives must have a clear policy on the price of milk, and this policy should indicate the transparency and accountability. Then, regarding the long-term benefit of dairy cooperative, it is recommended for dairy cooperatives to add the value of the milk so they can access wider markets, which, in turn, will maximize returns to the members. Based on this recommendation, it is better if the dairy cooperative in Indonesia not only serves as a marketing cooperative, but also serves as a farm supply cooperative which may process or formulate the milk into a more valuable product.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>The research confirms that individual dairy farmer’s loyalty can benefit the business of dairy cooperative.

Tropical ferralitic soils are phosphorus (P)-deficient. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) must form symbiotic associations with plants to enhance their hydro-mineral nutrition. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of mycorhization on growth of Vigna subterranea. Seedlings of two landraces were inoculated withAMF composite (Gigaspora margarita and Acaulospora tuberculata). P was administered by Hoagland solution (0 and 1000 mMPi). Two months after sowing, plants were harvested. The results show that,with or without phosphate, the number of nodules was three times (p less than 0.001) higher in mycorrhized plants compared to controls.Phosphate increased (p less than 0.001) the leaf P-content by 21 and 54% for the control and mycorrhized plants, respectively. Soluble phosphate did not affect the frequency and intensity of mycorhization. Soluble phosphate and mycorhizationsignificantly improve growth and leaf P-content.</jats:p>"

A simulation computer program was developed in accordance with the suggested pulse converter circuit, providing an opportunity to study transient processes of tractive motors current and voltage regulation during acceleration and regenerative braking. Availability of the suggested circuit when dealing with an electric traction drive of a self-powered electric stock is corroborated by the results of simulation modeling.

The methodology is based on various critical period approaches (the critical period method). A multi-criteria analysis was carried out to evaluate the effects of the critical period duration on the system characteristics. It was found that the critical period length is a design variable that significantly affects the economic, environmental and social aspects of the solution, with a lengthening of the critical period resulting in improvement of the overall sustainability of the solution. The results obtained indicate that a solar PV system is a promising solution to the energy sustainability of UWSSs. This form of energy supply does not emit greenhouse gases and furthermore the ‘social cost’ of carbon dioxide estimates decrease. The concept of a stand-alone PV energy system is a particularly promising sustainable energy solution.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the water quality in Xiahe County, located in the northeast Tibetan Plateau, was investigated. Six parameters (chloride, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, fluoride, sulfate) were selected to assess the quality and health status of surface water in Xiahe County. The main types of hydrochemical in the surface water were considered to be Mg2+-Ca2+-HCO3−-Cl− and Mg2+-Ca2+-HCO3−. The cations and anions were mainly from weathering and dissolution of carbonate rock. Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) results showed that the water quality in all 69 sampling sites was all class I. The integrated health status was higher than 0.95 and the health rate was 100%. Although ammonia nitrogen was recognized as the main contaminant, it had little effect on the entire body of water. Overall, the surface water qualities of most samples in Xiahe County were found to be in good condition.</jats:p>",

Mobile wood chipper comprise the carrier vehicle with Stirling engine and gasifier, chipper with hydraulic manipulator and trailing unit with containerdrier. The device performs functions of supply of wood, chipping, drying of wood chip, movement on a cutting area and unloadings of the produced wood chip. The mathematical model of the Mobile wood chipper is developed with use of the principle of decomposition and consists of interrelated submodels. The main submodels simulate the dynamic processes associated with operation of the machine and thermotechnical processes associated with drying of the wood chip. Slave submodels generalized simulate the functioning of the Stirling engine, the gasifier, chipper with manipulator, and interaction of machine with the structural elements of a cutting area. The mathematical model of dynamics is developed on the basis of Lagrange's equations. Submodel simulate the functioning of the Stirling engine represents the system of the differential equations of the adiabatic analysis of a thermodynamic Stirling cycle. For modeling of chip drying processes in an accumulative container of the Mobile wood chipper empirical data in the form of regression models are used. The developed mathematical model of functioning of the Mobile wood chipper make possible the computing experiment for determination of its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

The system can be implemented both in heat power engineering, in particular in circulating water supply systems for industrial enterprises, and in construction industry where there are heat evolutions produced by equipment and due to technological processes. According to the forecasts of Russia's energy strategy, the production of thermal energy will increase by 22-34 % in 2020. At the same time, it is planned to increase the real heat consumption by 1.4-1.5 times due to reduction of losses in the conditions of high energy saving potential in all energy sectors beginning with production to transportation and rational use of energy sources. The system of housing and utilities is extremely energy intensive, since utility infrastructure is worn out up to 80-90 %. The practical lack of biosphere-compatible technologies for engineering systems design and operation in Russia does not allow providing resource-saving at all stages of full life cycle of a building or a structure. Known studies and proposals based on the research and development decisions of RAASN Research Institute of Building Physics mainly relate to the thermal protection of the shell of a building and are not represented by engineering interconnected systems. Therefore, the development and implementation of measures for the integrated development of utility infrastructure becomes topical. The solution of this problem is related to complex of engineering and technical activities, including thermal protection by increasing thermal resistance of enclosing structures of buildings, upgrading heat and water supply systems, using non-traditional energy sources.</jats:p>"

The EU measure is remarkable insofar it incorporates an international soft-law instrument, the Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chain of Minerals from CAHR Areas, and makes it mandatory for EU importers. Importers are under a mandatory obligation to engage in supply chain due diligence to avoid dealing in conflict minerals, and thus regulating upstream entities. This contribution assesses the relation between such a regulatory strategy and provisions of WTO law. It assesses whether the EU bears responsibility for possible detrimental impact stemming from the incorporation of the OECD Guidance and from the delegation of certain regulatory tasks to economic operators. Subsequently, it evaluates the status under international law of the OECD Guidance, and discusses whether its status can justify possible detrimental impact stemming from the EU regime.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To avoid inventory risks, manufacturers often place rush orders with suppliers only after they receive firm orders from their customers (retailers). Rush orders are costly to both parties because the supplier incurs higher production costs. We consider a situation where the supplier's production cost is reduced if the manufacturer can place some of its order in advance. In addition to the rush order contract with a pre‐established price, we examine whether the supplier should offer advance‐order discounts to encourage the manufacturer to place a portion of its order in advance, even though the manufacturer incurs some inventory risk. While the advance‐order discount contract is Pareto‐improving, our analysis shows that the discount contract cannot coordinate the supply chain. However, if the supplier imposes a pre‐specified minimum order quantity requirement as a qualifier for the manufacturer to receive the advance‐order discount, then such a combined contract can coordinate the supply chain. Furthermore, the combined contract enables the supplier to attain the first‐best solution. We also explore a delegation contract that either party could propose. Under this contract, the manufacturer delegates the ordering and salvaging activities to the supplier in return for a discounted price on all units procured. We find the delegation contract coordinates the supply chain and is Pareto‐improving. We extend our analysis to a setting where the suppliers capacity is limited for advance production but unlimited for rush orders. Our structural results obtained for the one‐supplier‐one‐manufacturer case continue to hold when we have two manufacturers. </jats:p>",

The impacts of three factors on the ability of cellar sediment to desorb NH3-N were analyzed, which include the concentration of the cellar sediment, temperature and the degree of disturbance. In addition, the isothermal balance and kinetics fitting were studied. The results show that sediment concentration, temperature, and the disturbance degree greatly affect the NH3-N desorption process. The pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics equations are suitable for describing the desorption process (R2 &amp;gt; 0.86) under the different conditions of cellar sediment concentration. The Langmuir isothermal model is more suitable for describing the equilibrium desorption of the different sediment concentrations than the Freundlich isothermal model. Ultimately, the NH3-N desorption process has a significant influence on cellar water quality. Such results could be a theoretical basis for collection, treatment, and maintenance of cellar water.</jats:p>",

In particular, when retailers are perfectly rational and risk neutral, quick response is known to be a highly beneficial strategy to the retailers. However, in practice, retailers may possess different kinds of unstable risk preferences, which include risk‐averse and risk‐seeking attitudes. Thus, retailers may be stochastically risk sensitive. In this article, we consider all these factors simultaneously and explore how the retailer's stochastic risk preference affects the values of quick response to the supply chain and its members. Among various findings, we show that quick response is always beneficial to the supply chain when the retailer is stochastically risk sensitive. In most cases, we demonstrate that if the retailer is more risk averse (risk seeking) stochastically, the retailer is benefited more, whereas the manufacturer suffers a smaller profit loss (a bigger profit loss), under quick response. We prove that different commonly used supply chain contracts can achieve robust Pareto improvement in the supply chain. We also uncover that if the manufacturer ignores the retailer's stochastic risk preference, the achievability of Pareto improvement by contracts will be negatively affected.</jats:p>",

Currently, the problem of intestinal anastomosis reliability remains one of the most important, especially when the volume of surgical interventions is associated with significant disturbance of the blood supply to the intestine. According to the literature, the incidence of intestinal anastomosis incompetence after intestinal resection remains high and ranges from 4 to 10.2%.&#x0D;\nThe aim of the study is experimental assessment of the efficiency of omentoenteropexy application for prophylaxis of intestinal anastomosis incompetence.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. Experiments were carried out on 20 dogs divided into 2 groups. The first group consists of animals which were formed intestinal anastomosis and ligated mesenteric vessels, the second group is the animals, which in addition to the aforesaid activities were realized omentoenteropexy. Of the venous vessel, directly adjacent to the ischemic area of the small intestine, within 25 minutes after the formation of intestinal anastomosis was performed blood sampling, followed by the study of a number of indicators hemomicrocirculatory: сapillary filtrate, plasma protein loss, blood viscosity, coefficient deformation erythrocytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In addition, the blood flow in the vessels of the small bowel mesentery, adjacent to the zone of ischemia, was investigated. During the postoperative period pathomorphological changes were estimated in the peritoneal cavity, mechanical strength of the junctions and stricture formation index were defined.&#x0D;\nResults. Capillary filtrate and plasma protein loss in the ischemic area of the small intestine with the anastomosis increase by 6.4 times (p &lt;0.01) and 250% (p&lt;0.05). Blood viscosity increased by 30.6% (p &lt;0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased by 30.9% (p &lt;0.01). The number of functioning capillaries is equal to 48.5+1.8% (P &lt;0.01). In 1 case pneumopressia test revealed intestinal anastomosis incompetence. The postsurgical period was accompanied by a significant development of adhesions in the abdominal cavity. In the study hemomicrocirculatory rates in the ischemic area of the small intestine with anastomosis, covered the greater omentum, we didn't detect reliable differences to those of the first group of animals. In all cases intestinal anastomoses were competence and adhesions in the abdominal cavity was represented by single commissures.&#x0D;\nDiscussion. The paper presents the results of an experimental research on the morphological and functional changes in the ischemic area of the small intestine with the anastomosis in absense of omentoenteropexy and after covering the ischemic part organ with anastomosis by dint of the gastrocolic omentum and subsequent suturing it to the avascular part of the bowel mesentery.&#x0D;\nPerformed research determined significant change of hemomicrocirculatory rates in the ischemic area of the small intestine with anastomosis in flowing venous blood from it and in the mesentery of the small intestine, directly adjacent to the avascular area.&#x0D;\nPostoperative relaparotomy showed pronounced morphological disturbances in the ischemic area of the small intestine with the anastomosis, the presence of significant adhesions in the abdominal cavity. Intestinal anastomosis incompetence was diagnosed in 1 case. Covering explored part of the small intestine by dint of the gastrocolic omentum has contributed to a more favorable regeneration flow without the development of postoperative complications in the intestinal anastomosis. There was an insignificant adhesion in the abdominal cavity in most cases.&#x0D;\nConclusion. Thus, covering the ischemic area of the small intestine with anastomosis by dint of the gastrocolic omentum and suturing it to the avascular part of the mesentery resulted in a significant improvement in the regeneration of the intestinal anastomosis and reduction of intraperitoneal adhesions.</jats:p>"

The findings reveal that a substitutable overbooking strategy (free upgrade is permitted) is the best for the hotel. However, the optimal decisions depend on parameters such as wholesale price, arrival rate of economy room's consumers, the probability of consumers persuaded to book luxury room, and demand uncertainties in two channels. The OTA's purchasing quantity for economy room decreases in wholesale price, the probability of consumers persuaded to book luxury rooms, and OTA channel demand uncertainty. The hotel's optimal overbooking level decreases in the arrival rate of economy room's consumers and the probability of consumers persuaded to book luxury room and increases in wholesale price and hotel direct channel demand uncertainty. Moreover, the hotel can affect the OTA's purchasing quantity decisions by adjusting wholesale prices and determine the optimal overbooking level to maximize the expected revenue accordingly.</jats:p>",

We investigated two pathways of OC enrichment: trapping of organic matter in the water column and the direct supply of belowground seagrass detritus. We developed a new type of box corer to facilitate the retrieval of intact cores that preserve the structures of both sediments (including coarse sediments and dead plant structures) and live seagrass bodies. We measured seagrass density, total OC mass (OCtotal) [= live seagrass OC biomass (OCbio) + sedimentary OC mass (OCsed)], and the stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) of OCsed at back-reef and estuarine sites in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. OCbio accounted for 19 % and OCsed for 81 % of OCtotal; this contribution of OCbio to OCtotal is the highest in globally compiled data. Belowground detritus accounted for ~ 90 % of the OC mass of dead plant structures (&gt; 2 mm in size) (OCdead). At the back-reef site, belowground seagrass biomass, OCdead, and δ13C of OCsed (δ13Csed) were positively correlated with OCsed, indicating that the direct supply of belowground seagrass detritus is a major mechanism of OCsed enrichment. At the estuarine site, aboveground seagrass biomass was positively correlated with OCsed but δ13Csed did not correlate with OCsed, indicating that trapping of suspended OC by seagrass leaves is a major mechanism of OCsed enrichment there. We inferred that the relative importance of these two pathways may depend on the supply (productivity) of belowground biomass. Our results indicate that belowground biomass productivity of seagrass meadows, in addition to their aboveground morphological complexity, is an important factor controlling their OC stock. Consideration of this factor will improve global blue-carbon estimates.\n                        </jats:p>"

Results show the improved speed of price adjustment after the MPR in the supply chain of the beef industry, whereas a limited evidence of the increased price asymmetry is detected. The increased asymmetry is observed mostly through the long‐run regime switching coefficients of threshold autoregressive and error correction models. The price asymmetry mostly disappears in both pre‐ and post‐MPR periods when only short‐ and long‐run price adjustment coefficients are considered. The results also suggest the existence of the threshold cointegration in the vertical price relationship of the beef industry, which supports the use of the nonlinear threshold model in this study.[JEL codes: C22, Q11]</jats:p>",

However, lack of strategic relationships and low quality products with higher cost keep Sri Lanka’s rubber industry performance away from the global market. Since supply chain management (SCM) is implicated in the issue of external relationships and quality management (QM) is implicated in low product quality, the key aim of this study was to test the relationships between SCM, QM and organisational performance, in the context of the rubber industry in Sri Lanka. In particular, it empirically tested the mediating role played by SCM in the relationship between QM and operational performance (OP) of rubber manufacturing organisations though this relationship has already been established in theoretical literature. Data was gathered through a questionnaire from managers of 44 firms in the rubber products manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka. Data was analysed with the descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. The results indicated that QM practices and SCM practices improve OP while SCM practices are partially mediating the effect of QM practices on OP. The results of this study help the rubber products manufacturing organisations in Sri Lanka to formulate successful strategies by enhancing the OP via QM and SCM practices.</jats:p>"

The mathematical model of air supply with swirl and spread air jets in that type of apartments is improved. It is shown that for reachin of air distribution maximal efficiency it is necessary to supply air by air jets, that intensively extinct before entering into a working area. Simulation of air flow performed with the help of CFD FLUENT (Ansys FLUENT). Сalculations of the equation by using one-parameter model of turbulence Spalart-Allmaras are presented. The graphical and the analytical dependences on the basis of the conducted experimental researches, which can be used in subsequent engineering calculations, are shown out. Dynamic parameters of air flow that is created due to swirl and spread air jets at their leakage at variable regime and creation of dynamic microclimate in a room has been determined. Results of experimental investigations of air supply into the room by air distribution device which creates swirl air jets for creation more intensive turbulization air flow in the room are presented. Obtained results of these investigations give possibility to realize engineer calculations of air distribution with swirl air jets. The results of theoretical researches of favourable influence of dynamic microclimate to the man are presented. When using dynamic microclimate, it’s possible to decrease conditioning and ventilation system expenses.

The article summarizes the various steps of the developed procedure, from data collection until the final supply and use tables. It will be shown how several disconnected data sets with varying quality are harmonized so as to build an effective analytical database that can be used for several types of analyses, such as life cycle assessment, total material requirement, material intensity per product service, carbon footprint, and so on.</jats:p>",

In this regard, the impact of decisions made at different stages of a supply chain in a product's carbon footprint is quantified. Organizational and product carbon footprints are calculated using the Compound Method Based on Financial Accounts (MC3). The results underline that concentrating reduction efforts in some stages of the supply chain is more effective than implementing individual actions by the participants. Collaboration among the participants is needed to decide what practices are implemented, at what stage they are needed and how they are to be implemented. This article adds to the literature on supply chains and sustainability. Previous research suggests that collaborative strategies have great potential for reducing the carbon footprint of products, while indicating the need for empirical research to support this statement.

As a benchmark, we first obtain the equlibrium price and product sustainability level in a vertically integrated supply chain. Our analysis provides some interesting findings in a decentralized supply chain: (i) a dominant manufacturer (retailer) always benefits from its power; (ii) the entire supply chain earns the most profit from the Nash game, and the least from the retailer Stackelberg game, respectively; (iii) as the power shifts from the manufacturer to the retailer, product sustainability and retail price increase; (iv) dominant manufacturer does not necessarily imply low wholesale price that would benefit the retailer.

The rationale for this study stems from reports that while TP has been widely used as an instrument to improve the position of SMCs in the South African construction industry, three out of five SMCs do not become established firms. In addition, the nature of the influence of TP strategies on the growth performance of SMCs  is  not  known.  Following  a  review  of  existing  literature,  the  study  mainly  adopted  a quantitative  research  approach.  Questionnaire  surveys  were  administered  to  Construction Industry Development Board (cidb) Grades 3 to 6 contractors that have executed TP projects within  the  last  5  years.  The  collected  data  was  subjected  to  descriptive  and  inferential statistical analyses –Spearman’s rank order correlationwas used as an index of association between the study variables. The study found that tendering equity is the most frequently used TP strategy, closely followed by preferencing and mandatory subcontracting. The study also found  that  positive  significant  associations  exists  among  preferencing  and  turnover;  third-party management and company assets; tendering equity, turnover and number of employees; as  well  as  accelerated  rotations,  turnover  and  number  of  employees.  The  study  concluded that  government  intervention  through  targeted  procurement  has  the  potential  to  achieve  its intended  results  of  improving  the  position  of  historically  disadvantaged  SMCs  in  the construction industry in South Africa if selected and implemented appropriately.</jats:p>"

Five factors (network size, product complexity, cost variability, CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions generation and over‐capacity) are considered for the experimental framework. The problem is solved using the ε‐constraint method and the resulting Pareto frontiers (PF) are characterized using five new metrics specifically developed for analysing how those factors affect the resulting optimal configurations. The results show that over‐capacity and product complexity are the two most influential factors regarding the characteristics of the PF, and that their effects are in the same direction: more complexity and capacity mean a wider set of optima alternatives, some close to the ideal point, and in general with a smaller number of links used.</jats:p>",

Low concentrations of nutrients in the autumn, when the germinated wakame sporophytes are installed at aquaculture facilities, induce defective growth, resulting in withering. To determine the characteristics of the nutrient variations in this region, we conducted hydrographic measurements off the coast of Iwate Prefecture. The measured results showed that in the autumn, vertical mixing pumped nutrients from the deeper layers to the mixed layer, where nutrients had been depleted during the summer. Based on these results, we developed a one‐dimensional model incorporating vertical mixing by atmospheric cooling to project the vertical distribution of the nutrient concentrations. By conducting ensemble calculations, we created a probability projection calendar for the nutrient supply up to 50 days ahead. This information was provided to wakame farmers before they installed the germinated sporophytes. The projected probability calculated from the initial conditions on 11 October 2016 was 0% until 25 October and gradually increased to 85% on 30 November. The nitrate concentration detected by an ultraviolet nitrate sensor moored at a wakame farm revealed that the nutrient concentrations reached a critical threshold on 18 November. The projected probability on that date was 75%; therefore, the projection was successful. The observed temporal evolution of the temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations was well reproduced by our model. The information obtained using this model is expected to reduce the risk of wakame withering and improve the efficiency of wakame production.</jats:p>",

The Water Supply and Sanitation Services (WS&amp;SS) provided to subnormal clusters present peculiar features that require regulatory agencies to have appropriate tools to perform such monitoring. The aim of the current article is to build and present a system of indicators used for this purpose. A combination of traditional and participatory approaches was used to collect the indicators. Eleven indicators were proposed in the participatory approach and twelve were inserted in the traditional approach. These indicators were assessed by experts and applied to Cubatão County. Thus, a system comprising twenty-three indicators is herein presented to help monitoring the contractual and planning goals of WS&amp;SS provided to subnormal clusters. The model is innovative and can be used in Incentive-based or in Sunshine regulations.</jats:p>"

However, no scientific research has been conducted to assess correctness of such a breakdown and to estimate the differences (if they exist) of pension funds assigned to distinct groups. The results show that there are limitations to the supply side of second pillar pension funds and to participants’ possibilities to select appropriate investment strategies over life-cycle. The findings from statistical analysis suggest that used classification of pension funds is not necessarily meaningful. Even if two funds belong to different categories, this does not mean that their investment strategies and results will differ significantly. It raises the need for stricter rules for setting pension funds’ investment strategies and linkage to age of participants in order to increase compatibility between supply of funds and participants’ needs over life-cycle.</jats:p>"

Applying  this  to  an  infrastructure  delivery  system  (IDS)  context,  this  study  proposes  that  an  IDS  can  successfully  deliver  on  client  requirements  only  if  they  attain  and  maintain  viability.  Research  into  the  influence  of  National  Culture  (NC)  on an  IDS’s  viability  appears  to  be  lacking; hence this study. Adopting a multi-case study, qualitative research design, this study explores  three  IDSs  involved  in  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  projects  in  two  different  NC  contexts;  Nigeria  and  the  United  Kingdom.  25  semi-structured  interviews  were  conducted  across  the  cases  to  provide  for  an  in-depth  understanding  of  existing  interactions  between  participants  in  these  delivery  systems:  client/project  sponsor;  main  contractor  and  sub-contractors  and  to  understand  the  influence  of  the  prevailing  national  culture  on  such  interactions, if any. Findings indicate that NC in project delivery environments influence the ability of IDSs to attain viability, especially as it pertains to the sustenance of Team Quality Attributes (TWQ) within the system. Based on these findings, it is expected that in modelling IDSs  for  viability,  adequate  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  prevailing  NC  by  project  managers and planners.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In magnetic hyperthermia, the temperature and localization of a ferromagnetic implant in a tumor region is vital in determining the effectiveness of therapeutic heating. We have developed a noninvasive wireless temperature measurement method by utilizing the magnetic permeability property of a ferromagnetic implant with low Curie temperature (FILCT) that varies with the temperature. In clinical settings, when the FILCT is injected into a tumor region, the position of the FILCT is expected to deviate from the central axis of the heating coil (drive coil). When it deviates, the magnetic flux density applied to the FILCT decreases, thus causing difficulty in detecting the temperature of FILCT via a pickup coil and heating of the FILCT at a constant treatment temperature. Therefore, to adjust the magnetic field supply and detection (MFSD) unit to be directly above the FILCT, we propose a position adjustment method by referring to three voltages induced in three pickup coils symmetrically installed inside the drive coil. By using the average value of the three voltages, we also propose a method to estimate the distance between the MFSD unit and the FILCT, which is required for wireless thermometry and determination of the optimal energy applied. The proposed methods are experimentally examined by a verification system.</jats:p>",

Salt medium (3; 5; and 7‰) was made using sodium chloride solution, whose osmotic force corresponded to water salinity in the Northern Caspian - from 0 to 7‰. Temperature and oxygen condition changed within 20.0-22.0°C and 85.0-100.0% of saturation. Maximum fish growth was registered in salinity of 5 and 7‰, increase made 8.0-21.0%. The intensive growth rate proved that sturgeon breeding in brackish waters facilitated more efficient digestion of food components in the fish gastrointestinal tract. Blood indices corresponded to parameters specific for fishes in the natural habitat: haemoglobin - 30.0-45.0 g/l; cholesterol and crude protein - up to 3.5 mmol and 26.0 g/l. Level of lipids was high - 4.8-6.5 g/l, which is characteristic to fish fed with complete dry feed. Osmolality of fish blood serum was within 219.0 ± 2.41 - 239.0 ± 0.94 mmol/kg of H2O and corresponded to the parameters of sturgeons of different age groups in desalinated area in the Northern Caspian. However, increase of water temperature and salinity up to 7‰ affected operation of biological filter and raised the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in water, which lowered viability to 10.0%. Parameters of hydrochemical condition of a closed ecosystem were within normal values under salinity of aqueous medium up to 5‰, which should be taken as optimal for creating brackish regime in the closed water supply units of sturgeon breeding.</jats:p>",

BSC describes the supply capability of distribution networks under various loading conditions. First, BSC is defined as a total load of an operating point on the security boundary. The BSC set of all boundary points represents the overall capability of a distribution network; while the total supply capability is the maximum value in a BSC set. Second, a method is proposed to calculate the BSC and its related indices. This method consists of three steps: (i) obtain a set of boundary points by sampling, (ii) calculate the BSC value of each point, and (iii) analyse the BSC set and obtain the following information: sorted BSC curve, BSC proportion distribution curve, mean value, lower bound, upper bound and so on. Finally, extended IEEE‐RTBS‐BUS4 cases are used to illustrate the proposed concept and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BSC method.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To cope with the net load variability in real time, sufficient ramp capability from controllable resources is required. To address the issue of insufficient ramp capacity in real time operations, flexible ramping products (FRPs) have been adopted by some Independent System Operators (ISOs) in the USA as a new market design. The inherent variability and uncertainty caused by renewable energy sources (RESs) call for new FRP providers apart from conventional generating units. The so-called interruptible load (IL) has proved to be useful in maintaining the supply-demand balance by providing demand relief and can be a viable FRP provider in practice. Given this background, this work presents a stochastic real-time unit commitment model considering ramp requirement and simultaneous provision of IL for FRP and demand relief. Load serving entities (LSEs) are included in the proposed model and act as mediators between the ISO and multiple ILs. In particular, incentive compatible contracts are designed to encourage customers to reveal their true outage costs. Case studies indicate both the system and LSEs can benefit by employing the proposed method and ILs can gain the highest profits by signing up a favorable contract.</jats:p>"

Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and resistance to second-line agents have been previously identified in the country but the extent of the problem has yet to be quantified. A national survey was conducted to estimate the proportion of MDR-TB among a representative sample of TB patients. Sputum was tested using XpertMTB/RIF and samples positive for MTB and resistant to rifampicin underwent first line phenotypic susceptibility testing. The TB supranational reference laboratory in Milan, Italy, undertook external quality assurance, genotypic testing based on whole genome and targeted-deep sequencing and phylogenetic studies. 301 new and 66 previously treated TB cases were enrolled. MDR-TB was detected in 34 patients: 4.7% of new and 31% of previously treated cases. Resistance to pyrazinamide, aminoglycosides and capreomycin was detected in 68%, 18% and 29% of MDR-TB strains respectively, while resistance to fluoroquinolones was not detected. Cluster analysis identified transmission of MDR-TB as a critical factor fostering drug resistance in the country. Levels of MDR-TB in Djibouti are among the highest on the African continent. High prevalence of resistance to pyrazinamide and second-line injectable agents have important implications for treatment regimens.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two large coastal dune sheets, including the Santa Maria dune sheet and Vandenberg dune sheet, have been analyzed for late-Quaternary distributions, ages and volumes of dune sand deposition. Six new thermoluminescence (TL) ages establish the age range of dune sand deposition from &gt;106±21 ka to &lt;4.1 ka in the study area. Seven late-Pleistocene TL and 14C dated mid-depth samples (≤30 m depth subsurface), yield a mean of 33 ka for the late-Pleistocene dune deposits. Both TL and 14C dated Holocene dune deposits establish a transition from weathered middle-Holocene dune deposits to unweathered latest-Holocene dune deposits after 4 ka. Marine sand supply to the large dune sheets occurred by 1) cross-shelf eolian transport during late-Pleistocene marine low-stands (70–13 ka), 2) shoreward wave transport during slowing of the Holocene marine transgression (9–5 ka), and 3) longshore littoral transport during the latest-Holocene marine high-sand (3.5–0 ka). Measured and dated dune deposit sections (n=66, ranging from 2 to 60 m depth) demonstrate substantial differences in preserved sand volumes between the two adjacent dune sheets, Santa Maria (~ 2,300x106 m3) and Vandenberg (~430x106 m3). Asymmetric distributions of dune deposit volumes between and within the dune sheets show that long-term sand supply was locally controlled by paleo-shoreline orientations relative to corresponding deep-water wave propagation directions (260–290° TN) from the North Pacific Low Pressure Area. Recently declining sand supplies and/or -trapping efficiencies in the dune sheet littoral subcells led to ongoing shoreline retreat (≥ 200 m) and under-cutting of late- Holocene eolian sand ramps at the south ends of the Santa Maria and Vandenberg dune sheets. The termination of transgressive cross-shelf sand supply and locally variable longshore retention of littoral sand confirm previously reported framework models of regional coastal sand supply. Such models help to identify shorelines that are most susceptible to future beach erosion from predicted sea level rise following ongoing global warming. </jats:p>"

During the biosynthesis, oxygenation cascaded in conversion of hydrophobic n‐dodecane to DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub>, while the oxidation of n‐dodecane took place in the intracellular space. Therefore, it was important to investigate the role of oxygen supply on the cell growth and DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> biosynthesis. It was found that stirring speed and aeration influenced the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration which in turn affected cell growth as well as DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> biosynthesis. However, the effect of culture redox potential (Orp) level on DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> biosynthesis was more significant than that of DO level. For DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> biosynthesis, the first step was to form the emulsion droplets through the interaction of n‐dodecane and the cell. When the stirring speed was enhanced, slits in the surface layer of the emulsion droplets would be increased. Thus, the substances transportation by water through the slits would be intensified, leading to an enhanced DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> production. Compared with the batch culture at a lower stirring speed (400 rpm) without culture redox potential (Orp) control, the DC<jats:sub>12</jats:sub> concentration was increased by 5 times up to 201.3 g/L with Orp controlled above 0 mV at a higher stirring speed (800 rpm).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When formal distribution channels are absent in developing countries, micro‐retailers travel a long distance to replenish their stocks directly from suppliers. This “informal” replenishment strategy is inefficient due to high imputed travel costs involved in the replenishment process. To improve efficiency, one “hybrid” replenishment strategy has emerged under which one of the micro‐retailers in a neighborhood, while continuing its own retail business, also operates as a wholesaler to serve other micro‐retailers in the neighborhood. A major obstacle for the transition from the informal strategy to the hybrid strategy is that the micro‐retailers are reluctant to source from a wholesaler who also competes with them in the retail market. Thus, it is not clear when the micro‐retailers adopt the hybrid strategy instead of the informal strategy. Meanwhile, the micro‐retailers may prefer the “formal” strategy: a traditional replenishment strategy under which one of the micro‐retailers relinquishes its retail business and operates purely as a wholesaler. We examine a situation when competing micro‐retailers contemplate with the three potential aforementioned replenishment strategies. Our equilibrium analysis of the two‐store model reveals that the dominant strategy is: (a) the hybrid strategy when the travel cost is high; (b) the formal strategy when the travel cost is medium; and (c) the informal strategy when the travel cost is low. This key insight is shown continue to hold when we extend the two‐store model to incorporate other issues including: quantity discounts from the supplier, variable operating costs, price competition, local monopolies, and different decision sequences. One additional finding is that the transition from the informal strategy to the hybrid strategy could benefit consumers if the micro‐retailers receive quantity discounts from the supplier. Furthermore, when there are more than two stores, we show that the formal strategy is never dominant. Moreover, when the number of stores increases, the hybrid strategy becomes more preferable to the informal strategy. </jats:p>",

Verificam-se os conflitos gerados quando assinado o contrato e no processo de implantação e funcionamento da companhia de água encanada, versus o fornecimento de água pelo antigo sistema artesanal, controlado por ricos senhores. A análise estrutura-se a partir dos relatórios da companhia, das atas do Senado da Câmara e das matérias dos inúmeros jornais que circulavam na São Luís, oitocentista. Objetiva-se analisar a conjuntura que motivou a criação da Companhia Anil e sua importância no processo de modernização dos serviços públicos da cidade. Abordam-se de forma breve as questões relacionadas à modernização, urbanização e progresso na urbe do século dezenove. Nesse sentido, verifica-se a resistência de alguns atores sociais entronizados décadas no controle da água potável e os embates travados na esfera política e na impressa.</jats:p>"

We consider two cases: only the theme park exhibits (environmental) social responsibility; and both theme park and tour operator exhibit social responsibility. For each case, we design a coordination mechanism. In the first case, we find that (a) if the environmental governance investment is relatively inexpensive, then the retail price, environmental governance efficiency, and sale quantity may simultaneously increase with the theme park's environmental responsibility (extra investment on the treatment of ungoverned environmental damage) under the centralized system; (b) it is more likely to achieve a win‐win outcome if the theme park cares more about the environment when the channel is coordinated; (c) the theme park's environmental responsibility enables itself to gain more coordination benefit when its negotiation power is relatively high. In the second case, we find that (a) the environmental governance efficiency or sale quantity increases with the tour operator's social responsibility; (b) both members’ profits may increase with the tour operator's social responsibility.</jats:p>",

This research proposes an ammonia supply system which can be used for flue gas denitrification of low-speed marine diesel. In this proposed ammonia supply system, ammonium bicarbonate is selected as the ammonia carrier to produce ammonia and carbon dioxide by thermal decomposition. The diesel engine exhaust heat is used as the heating source for ammonium bicarbonate decomposition and ammonia gas desorption. As the ammonium bicarbonate decomposition is critical to the proper operation of this system, effects have been observed to reveal the performance of the thermal decomposition chamber in this paper. A visualization experiment for determination of the single-tube heat transfer coefficient and simulation of flow and heat transfer in two structures is conducted; the decomposition of ammonium bicarbonate is simulated by ASPEN PLUS. The results show that the single-tube heat transfer coefficient is 1052 W m\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n             °C\n            <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>\n            ; the thermal decomposition chamber fork-type structure gets a higher heat transfer compared with the row-type. With regard to the simulation of ammonium bicarbonate thermal decomposition, the ammonia production is significantly affected by the reaction temperature and the mass flow rate of the ammonium bicarbonate input.\n          </jats:p>",

Results showed that <jats:italic>S. canadensis</jats:italic> was able to selectively utilize P from Al–P but not from Fe–P or Ca–P by increasing root number and length under N additions. The increasing growth in <jats:italic>S. canadensis</jats:italic> was closely correlated with the increasing foliar P. Ability to utilize insoluble P sources under enriched N environment serves as a competitive advantage for <jats:italic>S. canadensis</jats:italic> in Al rich soils. Effective control of <jats:italic>S. canadensis</jats:italic> invasion may need to consider soil P management in the context of atmospheric N deposition as well.</jats:p>",
