Secondly papers on interlending of specialist materials (microform, audiovisual materials and music) are discussed. Thirdly, the review looks at some recent applications of new technology: the use of electronic mail for request transmission in Canada, three experiments with telefacsimile transmission of documents in the USA together with a proposal for high‐speed telefacsimile transmission via satellite in Australia, and the use of microcomputers in interlibrary loan departments. A new article delivery service in the USA and the demise of the Pacific Northwest Bibliographic Center are reported. Finally, the publication of a draft version of guidelines on union catalogues of serials is mentioned.</jats:p>",

Foreign demand reached a new peak, the International Loan Service being especially heavily used; more significantly, British demand increased by 4%. The Urgent Action Service, enabling users to telephone and receive a quick response, became established; an option of telefacsimile transmission was added. Telefax was also used for an Urgent Action Service abroad. The pattern of foreign demand changed somewhat; the countries making most use of the service are now Japan, France and Spain. Automated request transmission continued to grow. Retrospective conversion of records of the Division's monograph stock (post‐1979 imprints) to machine‐readable form made good progress, and Lending Division holdings have begun to appear on the regional ISBN union lists. The Keyword Index to Serial Titles continued to grow in size and coverage. The acquisition programme was maintained, nearly two‐thirds of the acquisition budget being spent on serials and over a quarter on monographs; the Division's coverage of ‘grey literature’ was further improved. A radical review of binding and conservation expenditure was started. Surveys included one of serials in order of demand, one of demand and satisfaction, and one of backup libraries. A Geac computer was installed for the Monograph Acquisitions and Records System and a Systime 8780 for the serials system. Retrospective MEDLARS searches increased sharply. Publications continued to be profitable, and plans were made for the interdivisional British Library Publications Sales Unit to be housed at Boston Spa. The Division continues to be involved in discussion on electronic document storage and transmission projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Interlibrary lending during the period 1900 to 1945 lacked co‐ordination, adequate funding, and motivation by the majority of librarians. Public library services had reached only 38% of the population of England and 50% of that of Wales by 1915. With the growing volume of relevant publications becoming available it was recognized that individual libraries could not cope alone with the demands of the population. Co‐operation was advocated in the form of union catalogues and co‐operative book purchasing. Those responsible for adult education pressed for a solution to their book provision problems and a proposal to the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust (CUKT) in 1915 for a Central Library for Students, was agreed. Emphasis on educational purposes soon gave way to interlending for library purposes — a process reinforced and continued with the establishment of the National Central Library and the Regional Library System. The NCL took up its role of book provider and interlending co‐ordinator in 1930 but interlending services were dogged by lack of finances. The support of CUKT and other philanthropic bodies was crucial at this time. Criticisms of interlending services could have been diminished by a greater collective responsibility from librarians. The desire to increase their own collections weakened the drive towards an interlending service. The concept that finally prevailed was too limited to be adapted to post‐war circumstances.</jats:p>",

Policymakers seem unwilling to confront the fact, for instance, that the oil glut does not insulate importing nations against sudden interruptions in supply. In any case, the glut will very likely have evaporated by 1990, when U.S. vulnerability will be sharply intensified. Despite the favorable opportunities for stockpiling and planning during the glut, the political process appears unable to respond.</jats:p>",

The condition that is required for the maximal flow to be equal to the minimal cut is examined. The max‐flow‐min‐cut theorem is used to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for feasibility of the multiterminal supply‐demand problem based on the compact flow model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When seedlings of Helianthus annuus L. were grown in the dark with their roots in vermiculite saturated with distilled water the rate of elongation of the hypocotyl was significantly increased by increasing the relative humidity around the shoot from approximately 25 to 100%. This response was correlated with a reduction in transpiration rate of approximately 95% and with increases in the water potential and cell turgor in the growing region. Measurements with a transducer revealed very rapid growth responses to changes in humidity, usually preceded by a variable period of growth oscillations. Excision of the roots, either in water or in air, induced an immediate increase in rate of elongation at low humidity, but at high humidity this response was delayed and markedly reduced. The growth rate was significantly increased by supplying 10 mM KCl to the roots at both high and low humidity. The response to K was slower than the response to humidity and was correlated with a significant reduction in the osmotic potential of the growing region. A growth response was first detected approximately 45 min after the application of K to the roots and 10 min after application to the shoot. These results arc consistent with the hypothesis that, in the intact plant, stem elongation is largely controlled by the interacting effects on cell turgor of transpiration-induced negative pressure potential in the apoplast and the osmotic potential of the growing cells. </jats:p>",

New Zealand White rabbits were given 0.5 mg/kg L-thyroxine (T4) for 3 or 16 days, and a third group served as a control. Chests were opened under anesthesia, and myocardial blood flow was determined using microspheres. In half of these animals, microspectrophotometric determinations were made on left ventricular arterial and venous O2 saturation, and by combining this data with blood flows, O2 consumption was determined. The other animals were then subjected to hypoxia (8% O2 in N2), and flows and O2 consumption were again determined. T4 increased arterial pressure and heart rate in normoxic animals and also increased myocardial blood flow 65 and 210% for 3- and 16-day T4 groups, respectively, with no regional differences. O2 extraction was also increased in T4 animals. O2 consumption increased 134 and 280% in 3- and 16-day T4 groups. Only normoxic saline controls had a regional O2 consumption difference with subendocardial O2 consumption higher than subepicardial values. When compared with their respective normoxic groups, blood flow increased 49 and 101% for the hypoxic 3- and 16-day T4 groups. Hypoxia had no effect on saline control blood flow. Hypoxia decreased O2 extraction 29 and 41%, respectively, in the 3- and 16-day T4 groups and was unchanged in saline controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </jats:p>",
