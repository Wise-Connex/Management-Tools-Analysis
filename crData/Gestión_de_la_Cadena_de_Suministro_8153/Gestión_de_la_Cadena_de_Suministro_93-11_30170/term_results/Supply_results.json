The effect of insurance is shown to decompose into a “risk reduction” effect as well as a “moral hazard” effect. The direction and magnitude of these effects depend on the parameters of the insurance contract, producer's risk preferences, and the underlying technology. Two models are considered for this purpose. In the first model, widely employed in the literature, a producer controls only one input. The second model uses a dual approach to extend the results to the case where a producer controls multiple inputs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In health markets, the price paid by insured consumers when health care services are demanded can be set separately from the price paid to providers when services are supplied. This fact suggests two alternate strategies for controlling the costs of health care: demand-side cost sharing, where patients must pay more in co-payments or deductibles, and supply-side cost sharing, which seeks to alter the incentives of health care workers to provide certain services. We review the rationale, limits, and comparative advantage of demand- and supply-side cost sharing in health care while primarily focusing on the short-run pursuit of consumer financial risk protection and efficiency. We then turn briefly to the long-run issue of technology adoption, as well as the how supply- and demand-side cost sharing may affect the fairness of the health system. </jats:p>",

The supply of oil and gas to the region will become more problematic as the decade progresses. Already 50% dependent on imported oil, this figure will rise to nearly 65% by 2000. Because high rates of domestic oil demand growth among traditional petroleum exporters ‐ Indonesia. China and Malaysia ‐ will absorb exportable surpluses, the region will find itself dependent on the Middle East for at least 90% of its imported oil needs by 2000. Currently linked to oil, LNG prices cannot justify the investments needed to bring new greenfield projects on line. With demand expected to exceed 67 million tonnes (Mt) in 2000 and 100 Mt in 2010. over 50 Mt of new capacity will be needed; satisfying this demand will necessitate a new pricing structure for LNG, raising the price substantially above the relative price of crude oil.</jats:p>",

The analysis is further extended to examine the impact of the money supply announcements during the period of monetary target‐ting; the cross‐sectional impact of the announcements across various stock price indices and the pre‐ and post‐announcement responses of stock prices.

After a series of quasi‐stationary alternate bars were formed under equilibrium sediment transport, feed rate was reduced in two steps to one third and one tenth the initial rate as discharge was held constant. The primary response following both reductions was an increase in bed surface particle size as a corridor of intensive bed load transport contracted and local transport rates decreased. After the first feed rate reduction, the channel incised by twice the mean water depth, on average, and caused distal bar surfaces to emerge as terracelike features. Bar roughness decreased, and mean boundary shear stress exerted on bed surface particles increased. Little incision occurred after the second feed rate reduction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>An apparatus in which plant roots may be challenged uniformly with inoculum of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is described. Seedlings of leek (<jats:italic>Allium porrum</jats:italic> L.) or clover (<jats:italic>Trifolium repens</jats:italic> L.) were first grown non‐symbiotically in the apparatus for 21 d at three rates of phosphorus (P) addition to soil (150 (P1), 450 (P3) and 750 (P5) mg P kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> soil). The positions of individual root tips were recorded, and the root systems then challenged with inoculum of <jats:italic>Glomus mosseae</jats:italic> (Nicol &amp; Gerd.) Gerdemann &amp; Trappe. Roots were excised 14 d later, and the probability of occurrence of internal infection in successive 3 mm (clover) or 5 mm (leek) sections of root was estimated in first‐order laterals (clover) or main axes (leek) from the proportion of sections at each location of replicate roots that bore internal fungal structures.</jats:p><jats:p>Only in the region of a root proximal to the position of the root tips at inoculation could data be used to investigate change of probability of infection with cell age. Here, there were sharp declines in probability of infection with proximal distance, in both hosts and in all P treatments. The decline of probability was greater in clover: when expressed in terms of cell age at the time of challenge, there was no infection at PI in cells ≤ 10 d old in leek and none in cells ≤ 7 d old in clover.</jats:p><jats:p>Models of the form log<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>, [<jats:italic>p</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/(1 –<jats:italic>p</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>)] =α+β× distance, where <jats:italic>p</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub> is the estimated probability of infection and a and α are constants, were fitted to these data. The odds on infection are [<jats:italic>p</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/(1 –<jats:italic>p</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>)]. For leek, β was unaltered by P addition (P3 and P5 curves were parallel to P1) but from a it could be calculated that on average the odds on successful infection at any particular distance were reduced by 37% and 70% by P3 and P5 rates of P addition respectively. In clover the curves for the three P treatments were not parallel. Addition of P appeared to reduce the odds on infection of clover much more than those of leek.</jats:p><jats:p>We conclude that the simplest explanation for the patterns of infection in leek is that P addition increased the time taken for soil inoculum of <jats:italic>G. mosseae</jats:italic> to infect roots: the mechanism in clover might be more complex.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Are there intrinsic differences in the rates of photosynthesis, shoot‐ and root‐respiration between inherently fast‐ and slow‐growing monocotyledons at high and low nitrogen supply? To analyze this question we grew 5 monocotyledons, widely differing in their inherent relative growth rate at high and low nitrogen supply in a growth room. Nitrate was exponentially added to the plants, enabling us to compare inherent differences in plant characteristics, without any effect of species differences in the ability to take up nutrients.</jats:p><jats:p>At high nitrogen supply, the fast‐growing species from productive habitats had a higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency and rate of root respiration than the slow‐growing ones from unproductive habitats. Only minor differences were observed in their rates of photosynthesis and shoot respiration per unit leaf area. At low nitrogen supply, the rates of photosynthesis and shoot‐ and root respiration decreased for all species, even though there were no longer any differences in these processes between inherently fast‐ and slow‐growing species. The photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency increased for all species, and no differences were found among species.</jats:p><jats:p>Differences in the photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency among species and nitrogen treatments are discussed in terms of the utilization of the photosynthetic apparatus, whereas differences in respiration rate are discussed in terms of the energy demand for growth, maintenance and ion uptake and their related specific respiratory energy costs. It is concluded that the relatively high abundance of slow‐growing species compared to fast‐growing ones in unproductive habitats is unlikely to be explained by differences in rates of photosynthesis and respiration or in photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency.</jats:p>",
