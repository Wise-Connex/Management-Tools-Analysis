This report reviews some experimental evidence with respect to this assumption and demonstrates the potential effect of altered haem‐haem interaction on tissue‐oxygen supply as distinguished from the effect of P<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> or position change. Theoretically, haem‐haem interaction values in the range that has been reported for apparently healthy human subjects can substantially modify oxygen transport to tissues, in some cases equalling or exceeding the effect from a similar range of P<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> values. It is not presently clear to what extent this range may represent true variation as opposed to random technical error, but the possible implications for oxygen transport indicate that a more systematic evaluation of the problem is desirable.</jats:p>",
