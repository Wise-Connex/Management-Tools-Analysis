The direct-current output from any one tap is limited to about 20 milliamperes, but two or more separate currents of this magnitude may be taken simultaneously from different taps. All parts of the circuit are insulated from the chassis and cabinet; therefore any one point in the circuit may safely be grounded. Also included is an unstabilized filament supply.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            The Microbiological Research Department has a very brief history. It is a defence research organization within the Ministry of Supply, staffed by members of the Scientific Civil Service. It had its origins early in the Second World War. The Government at that time considered it prudent to have assessed, if possible, the dangers likely to arise as a result of deliberate dissemination of disease-producing organisms and, if danger existed, to have developed means for counteracting the consequences of such evil. A very small band of research workers in the United Kingdom were set to face this colossal task. At first it seemed a most unhappy assignment, and a considerable period of time was spent wondering not only what to do, but how to do it. However, by the end of the war the information that had been collected was sufficient in content and implication to allow of three findings. First, it could tentatively be concluded that there was potential danger in the deliberate dissemination of pathogenic micro-organisms. Secondly, it seemed necessary that further work should be undertaken, but it could no longer profitably proceed on the purely\n            <jats:italic>ad hoc</jats:italic>\n            basis that had been essential as a starting point; fundamental study of infectious disease processes was required. Finally, it was obvious that the work would demand special laboratory facilities. In fact, these three findings dictated post-war policy in the United Kingdom, and I have now to describe something of how this policy is being carried out.\n          </jats:p>",

The soils were collected from a wide area in eastern Australia, extending from south-western Victoria to southern Queensland. Sulphur deficiency occurred almost as frequently as phosphorus deficiency. In fact, 75 per cent. of the soils were deficient in both phosphorus and sulphur. Thirty-one per cent. were deficient in all three elements. The effect of the interaction between the elements on the occurrence and intensity of the deficiencies is shown. Molybdenum responses were obtained only after the other deficiencies had been corrected. A deficiency in one of the elements is no indication of deficiency or sufficiency of either of the other two. There was no correlation between the occurrence or intensity of the deficiencies and the geological origin of the soil parent material, the climate of the regions from which the soils were collected, or such soil characters as colour, organic matter, and texture. Responses to phosphorus were less on the black earths than on the red or yellow podzolic soils; those on the red earths were intermediate. The intensity of sulphur deficiency increased, and the intensity of molybdenum deficiency decreased, with increasing soil pH. </jats:p>"
