Response to one-sided production shocks, is stronger for female labor, indicating that it is more important for smoothing consumption than male labor.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept and importance of supply chain management (SCM) has been introduced and described at length in the literature. Several mostly conceptual definitions of SCM were found. To classify these multiple definitions and extend SCM to include a process orientation a conceptual model of SCM evolution was developed. This research proposes that SCM is an evolving concept with individual firms at different stages in their adoption of the concept. In its most advanced form SCM is not a subset of logistics but is a broad strategy which cuts across business processes both within the firm and through the channels required to reach the customer and involves the firm's suppliers. Thus SCM as a concept is organization‐wide; not logistics‐specific. An exploratory study of purchasing professionals was performed and it was determined that their definitions of SCM focused on developing relations with suppliers including partnerships. SCM provided purchasers multiple benefits including improved supplier coordination. This improved coordination resulted in greater commitment to long‐term supplier relations, with a focus on reducing cost to the buying organization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Australian pastoral industries depend almost entirely on the nutrients derived from the available pasture and browse. This is particularly true for the northern cattle industry, where the production of pasture, and hence animal productivity, depend on the length of time that sufficient soil moisture is available during and after the wet season to sustain pasture growth. Animal nutrition is further affected by the relatively low digestibility of tropical grasses even at early stages of maturity. Hence animal production is marked by relatively low annual weight gain and poor reproductive performance. Research to date has demonstrated that lack of nitrogen both as ammonia for rumen microbes and as amino acids for the animal's tissues is the major nutritional deficit, which causes a depression in feed intake and hence exacerbates an already existing energy deficit. In many areas, too, deficiencies of P, Na, S and trace elements have been identified. Broadly speaking, the technology has been developed to overcome these nutritional deficiencies and to investigate remaining problems of undernutrition and low productivity. It is probable that new tropical legumes suited for areas with less than 750 mm annual rainfall will also be developed. However, despite these efforts, animal production will tend to be low, because for much of the year the high fibre low protein forage is eaten in only restricted amounts, and because only 40% or so of the energy in the forage becomes available to the animal. There is, therefore, need to develop rumen microbes capable of more rapid and more extensive breakdown of plant fibre and to achieve new methods to improve the conversion of amino acids into animal protein.</jats:p>"

The arterial vascularization of the pisiform bone comes from three pedicles: an upper pedicle arising from the dorsal carpal artery, a lateral pedicle arising from the ulnar artery, and a lower pedicle arising from the deep palmar branch of the ulnar artery. The pisiform bone is well vascularized and, whatever the distribution of the pedicles within the bone itself, we always found an arterial circle around it. The lengths of the upper and lower pedicles expressed as ratios of the length or width of the pisiform bone were variable, as indicated by the coefficient of variation that was greater than 36%. There was no significant correlation between the length of the upper or lower pedicle and the length or width of the pisiform bone. The length of the upper pedicle, which was greater than the distance between the origin of the dorsal carpal artery and the center of the lunate, allows a pedicled pisiform transfer in Kienböck’s disease. Nevertheless, it is difficult to assert definitively that the upper pedicle is sufficient to avoid a partial necrosis of the pedicled pisiform bone.</jats:p>"

Nightly light-trap collections of late-stage larvae were compared with patterns of juvenile recruitment. Otolith records provided estimates of larval duration and post- settlement age. Temporal patterns of larval supply were similar for both species: abundances peaked during the third-quarter moon. However, spatial patterns of larval supply varied between species: during large recruitment events, S. partitus larvae were more abundant in the south, A. bahianus in the north, suggesting that larval supply was not simply the result of passive transport. Patterns of supply were subsequently maintained (S. partitus) or modified (A. bahianus) by juveniles. In general, densities of juvenile S. partitus were evenly distributed along the coast; however, during major events, spatial patterns of recruitment reflected patterns of larval supply. In contrast, densities of juvenile A. bahianus were directly opposite patterns of larval supply, suggesting that for some species, postsettlement processes such as habitat selection may be more influential in creating spatial patterns of recruitment. </jats:p>"

In a second trial, we randomized infants to receive (from birth to age four months) formula without or with both AA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n‐3) at levels typical for mature human milk. Infants fed conventional formula showed a continuous decrease of phospholipid AA over time, whereas feeding of formula supplemented with AA and DHA led to significantly higher AA levels, similar to those in breast‐fed infants (two months: supplemented 9.6% vs. unsupplemented 7.1%; four months; 8.7 vs. 6.6%). In order to estimate infantile capacity for endogenous synthesis of AA, we fed four term neonates with newly diagnosed phenylketonuria (mean age 18 d) a formula with all fat contributed by corn oil, which has a higher natural<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C‐enrichment than European human milk or formula. Analysis of<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C‐enrichment in plasma fatty acids over four days allowed us to estimate infantile AA synthesis. We found an increased<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C‐value in plasma AA of all infants, which indicates that term neonates can synthesize AA. However, with a simplified isotope balance equation, we estimate that endogenous synthesis contributed only about 23% of total plasma arachidonic acid by day four. We conclude that full‐term infants fed formula may require a dietary supply of some preformed AA if the biochemical status of breast‐fed infants is to be achieved.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this article is to integrate this concept into supply-side economic theory and demonstrate the conditions under which decreased tax rates induce higher tax revenues. Within a standard aggregate demand, aggregate supply reduced form model, it is found that the relationship between tax rates and tax revenues depends on two factors: the tax rate elasticity of aggregate supply and the price level elasticity of aggregate demand. More specifically, it is found that a tax decrease that increases the aggregate supply of goods and services is more likely to also increase tax revenue when the price level elasticity of aggregate demand is greater. Alternatively, for a tax rate decrease to increase tax revenue, the tax rate elasticity of aggregate supply must be greater when the price level elasticity of aggregate demand is lower. </jats:p>",

Segment-scale and time-series observations of hydrothermal vents and plumes along fast and intermediate spreading centres reveal a close coupling between magma supply and hydrothermal fluxes. Based on the premise that magma supply exerts a primary control on hydrothermal processes, a new paradigm of segmented hydrothermal circulation has arisen featuring independent temporal evolution of hydrothermal systems along individual ridge segments. This paradigm explains observed segment-to-segment variations in the chemical composition of vent fluids and plumes (‘chemical segmentation’). Hydrothermally active segments can be classified, independently of spreading rate, into two types that represent end-members for the coupling of hydrothermal and magmatic processes: magma-rich segments and magma-starved segments. Along magma-rich segments, magma intrudes to shallow depths where water:rock ratios are high. Seafloor vent distribution tends to be magmatically controlled along dyke-induced fissures. Along magma-starved segments, intrusion is at greater depth, and deep cracks (usually faults) are required to transport water to and from the heat source. Water:rock ratios are low and vent locations are influenced by crustal permeability structure, as well as heat source location. Although both segment types can occur at any spreading rate, magma-rich segments are more common at faster spreading rates, and magma-starved segments are more typical at slow spreading rates.</jats:p>",

Subsequent studies in tropical ruminants and wild herbivores have highlighted the high levels than can occur in some diets and the extensive microbial modification and degradation that can occur in the tract. This paper reviews aspects of plant phenolics as they relate to ruminant nutrition in tropical or semi-arid environments in which some forage plants contain high levels of phenolic compounds. Effects range from occasional acute toxicity of hydrolysable tannins, to acetate-releasing microbial degradations that apparently enable certain phenolics to act as nutrients. The most important and complex effects are those due to tannin-protein interactions. Although these can clearly reduce feed intake, nutrient digestibilities, and protein availability, many of the interactions are still not understood. The diverse effects of plant phenolics on nutrient flow probably result from the balance between adverse effects on some organisms and the rate at which they are degraded or inactivated by other organisms, and improved animal performance can likely be obtained by manipulation of rumen microbial metabolism.</jats:p>"

This article addresses the subject by using patent statistics from nineteenth–century Victoria to examine the determinants of the supply of inventive ideas in the late colonial era. Such an examination indicates that, while both demand– and supply–side features clearly had roles to play in influencing the volume of ideas that emerged, it was the expansion and diversification of Australian markets in the latter half of the century that was most important. These findings also suggest that development and introduction of new technological ideas in pre–Federation Australia were predominantly economic activities shaped by local considerations.</jats:p>",

Siokra BT1-4) was investigated by growing plants at three levels of CO2=2 concentration: 350 (ambient), 550 and 900 μL L-1 and six levels of nitrogen (N) supply ranging from deficient to excess (0-133 mg N kg-1 soil week-1). Changes in leaf N concentration were also investigated. At 59 days after sowing, there was an average 63% increase in shoot growth at 550 μL CO2 L-1 compared with ambient CO2-grown plants, with no significant growth increase at 900 μL CO2 L-1 and, this response was closely matched by sink development (flower number and stem weight). Low N supply restricted the responses of both sink development and shoot growth to high CO2. At elevated CO2, leaf N concentration was reduced by an average 27% at low to adequate N supply. The high CO2-induced reduction in leaf N concentration, however, disappeared when the N supply was increased to a high level of 133 mg N kg-1 soil week-1. These CO2 effects on leaf N concentration were smaller when N was expressed per unit leaf area, apparently due to a combination of the effects of elevated CO2 or high N supply reducing specific leaf area and, to an N uptake limitation at low to moderate levels of N supply. The critical foliar N concentrations (leaf N concentration at 90% of maximum shoot growth) were reduced from 42 to 38 and 36 mg g-1 when CO2 concentrations were increased from 350 to 550 and 900 μL L-1 respectively, indicating that changes in fertiliser management may be required under changing CO2 concentrations. </jats:p>"

A single application of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>(17.8% atom excess <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N) was substituted for a normal weekly N application when the seedlings were 22 weeks old (day O). Six replicate plants of each species were harvested at 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 7, 11, and 30 days after <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N application. In a second experiment, NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> was supplied at 18,53, and 105 mg N/week to 14-week-old `Volkamer' lemon <jats:italic>(C. volkameriana</jats:italic> Ten. &amp; Pasq.) and sour orange (C. <jats:italic>aurantium</jats:italic> L.) seedlings in a complete nutrient solution for 8 weeks. A single application of <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NO<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> (23.0% <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N) was substituted at 22 weeks (day 0), as in the first experiment, and seedlings harvested 3,7, and 31 days after <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N application. Nitrogen uptake and partitioning were similar among species within each rate, but were strongly influenced by total N supply and the N demand by new growth. There was no <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N retranslocation to new tissue at the highest (105 mg N/week) rate, but N supplies below this rate limited plant growth without short-term <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N reallocation from other tissues. Leaf N concentration increased linearly with N supply up to the highest rate, while leaf chlorophyll concentration did not increase above that at 53 mg N/week. Photosynthetic CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation was not limited by N in this study; leaf N concentration exceeded 100 mmol·m<jats:sup>-2</jats:sup> in all treatments. Thus, differences in net productivity at the higher N rates appeared to be a function of increased leaf area, but not of leaf N concentration. Hence, N use efficiency decreased significantly over the range of N supply, whether expressed either on a gas-exchange or dry weight basis. Mean plant <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N uptake efficiencies after 31 days decreased from 60% to 47% of the <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N applied at the 18,20, and 53 mg N/week rates to less than 33% at the 105 mg N/week rate.

We measured eggs from 275 clutches of wild American kestrels (Falco sparverius) to study the degree of intraclutch variability in egg size. We also performed two food-supplementation experiments to investigate the proximate role of food supply during laying in determining egg size. Females with relatively abundant food and those in good body condition did not lay eggs that were more uniform in size than those laid by control females. This result is contrary to hypotheses that propose an adaptive explanation for intraclutch egg-size variation and also to ideas of energy depletion during laying. Patterns of egg size versus laying order were different between years, suggesting that females did not adaptively manipulate laying order and egg size within a clutch. The food-supplementation experiments showed that laying female kestrels probably depend on both stored energy reserves and on daily energy surpluses to form eggs. It appears that slight intraclutch variations in egg size occur in response to short-term food shortages during laying, but that these variations are probably nonadaptive. This is in marked contrast to interclutch (among females) variation in egg size, which we have shown varies significantly with food supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Past cropping research in the semi-arid tropics of northern Australia has shown that in this climate and on the predominantly sesquioxidic soils, recovery of fertiliser nitrogen (N) by crops is often low. Conceptually, no-tillage, legume ley farming offers features for coping better with the constraints of climate, soil and high fertiliser transport costs to this remote region. This paper summarises the N cycle in a system in which pastures provide N for successive crops, and mulch at the time of crop establishment is provided by the killing of new pasture growth. The aim was further to provide a sound foundation for managing N supply in relation to demand in a climate that causes high variation and uncertainty for pasture N2 fixation and sequestering, the amount of early season re-growth (mulch), rate of mulch decomposition, nitrate leaching losses, and crop growth and N demand. The research approach combined field studies with simulation modelling. A series of field studies that included bare fallow and grass and legume pasture leys on clay loam and sandy loam soils, were conducted at Katherine over 4 wet seasons to study subsequent mineralisation of N. Experimental results were used to test the performance of a simulation model for predicting the observed variations consequent upon the various management options. Experimental results showed that the carbon (C) : N ratio of the residue and soil texture were important factors in determining N mineralisation, immobifisation, and nitrate leaching following chemical kill of pasture leys. However, the greatest variation was between seasons. A modified version of the CERES-Maize N model was able to simulate the accumulation of nitrate following a bare fallow and following pasture leys with high levels (above and below ground) of freshly killed residues with widely differing C:N ratio, the downward movement of nitrate-N in the soil and the interaction of these processes with seasonal rainfall. Despite a capability for simulation of the soil N dynamics in a cropping phase following pasture leys, ex~erimental results indicated how nitrate distribution following leys is influenced by pasture growth during the ley, and how this varied greatly with season and soil texture. The simulation capability reported here has been incorporated elsewhere into the development of a full system model, embracing both the ley phase and the crop phase.</jats:p>"

Fitting a residual profit function, which incorporates the technology variables, to new data for UK agriculture for 1954–1990 produces short‐ and long‐run estimates of the output supply and input‐demand price elasticities, elasticities of the effects of relaxing the non‐variable input constraints and shadow prices for these non‐variable factors. All of the supply and demand relationships are found to be inelastic, but the price‐responsiveness of the system has increased over time. The long‐run model, in which all of the inputs except land are treated as variable and private‐sector research is included, gives a marginal rate of return to public agricultural R&amp;D of only 18 per cent. Estimates of the factor‐saving biases of the technology variables suggest that public R&amp;D has had its greatest effect in the animal sector.</jats:p>",

Applying the multiple‐valued logic concept, the new logic function, which can replace the conventional stack logic circuit and can be operated by a low supply voltage, can be realized. In conventional circuits, it is difficult to generate a signal with multiple voltage levels at the same time as the output of a logic gate and logic gates must be connected by placing a level‐shifter between them.</jats:p><jats:p>A circuit is devised in this study that generates the multiple‐valued logic levels (three levels in this paper) simultaneously at the output of the logic gate. Also, it is examined whether or not the basic logic functions, such as NAND, NOR, EX‐OR, and D‐Latch, can be realized by the proposed configuration. The characteristics of the proposed circuit are circuit simulated by a SPICE circuit simulator. It is seen as a result that the power consumption, the logic density, and the high‐speed performances, comparable to the conventional stacked‐gate logic circuit, can be realized with the low supply voltage of 1.9 V.</jats:p>",

The rod outer segment (ROS) of the retina was analyzed from rats fed diets varying in the ratio of 18∶2n‐6 to 18∶3n‐3 with or without 20∶4n‐6 [arachidonic acid (AA)] and 22∶6n‐3 (docosahexaenoic acid) from birth to six weeks of age. The level of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA, C<jats:sub>24</jats:sub>−C<jats:sub>36</jats:sub>) was identified using gas chromatography and gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry. In the ROS, the highest relative percent of AA was attained in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) of animals fed 1% AA diet, whereas feeding 0.7% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diet significantly increased the DHA level in PC, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol compared to feeding diets containing AA. VLCFA of n‐6 and n‐3 up to C<jats:sub>36</jats:sub> were found in PC, with the most abundant fatty acids being C<jats:sub>32</jats:sub> and C<jats:sub>34</jats:sub>. In PC, phosphatidylserine and PE, the n‐6 tetraenoic VLCFA level was highly increased in animals fed 1% AA compared to other dietary groups. This study suggests that dietary fat containing small amounts of AA or DHA is an important factor influencing membrane fatty acid composition of the visual cell during development.</jats:p>",

Target <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> plants were grown with neighbours of five grass species <jats:italic>(L. perenne, Poa pratensis</jats:italic> L., <jats:italic>P. trivialis L., Festuca ovina</jats:italic> L. and <jats:italic>F. rubra</jats:italic> L.) and <jats:italic>Trifolium repens</jats:italic> L. (white clover), at three nutrient levels (high, medium and low) and three defoliation severities (no defoliation or cut every 2 wk to 4 cm or 8 cm) over a 12 wk experimental period. Performance of <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> plants differed depending on the species of neighbour. Tiller numbers and dry weights of clippings of <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic>, at both individual cuts and the total accumulated over all seven cuts, were greater with <jats:italic>P. pratensis, F. ovina</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>T. repens</jats:italic> as neighbours than in a monoculture. The differences were generally confined to medium and high nutrient levels. The pattern of clippings depended on species association: clippings were similar at successive cuts except in mixtures with <jats:italic>P pratensis, F. ovina</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>T. repens</jats:italic>, where they increased until the 4–5th cuts. The total accumulated dry matter (DM) and nutrients of L. <jats:italic>perenne</jats:italic> and the percentage contribution of DM to the pot total were also greater in these mixtures. Individual linear regressions of tiller numbers and accumulated N for each species combination best described the relationships between <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> and its neighbour. Neighbouring species had no significant effect on the relative losses of dry weight of nutrients in clippings of <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> when expressed as a proportion of the total accumulated, but partitioning of DM to <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> roots (root weight ratio) was greater in associations with <jats:italic>Poa</jats:italic> species than in a monoculture. It was concluded that the species of neighbour affected the accumulation and partitioning of dry matter and nutrients in <jats:italic>L. perenne</jats:italic> and that nutrient supply, but not defoliation, modified the responses. The results are discussed in relation to species interactions in grazed swards.</jats:p>",

To investigate this, we measured growth and distribution (if biomass and P of tree seedlings, of a pioneer tree species, <jats:italic>Tapirira obtusa</jats:italic> (Benth.) Mitchell, and of a climax tree species, <jats:italic>Lecythis corrugata</jats:italic> Poit., at 10 levels of P‐supply under controlled conditions in a glasshouse. At intervals of 3 wk. dry weights of plant parts and their phosphorus concentrations were measured. The pioneer and the climax species took up similar amounts of P when grown at high P‐supply. The pioneer tree <jats:italic>T. obtusa</jats:italic> maintained a low P concentration (0.25 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) independent of P‐supply, and used the P taken up Hi increase growth., At high P‐supply it invested little biomass in roots, and reached a relative growth rate (RGR) of 40 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. The climax, tree species, <jats:italic>L, corrugate</jats:italic>, maintained a low RGR of 10 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and a constant distribution of biomass at all P‐supply rates. It stored the extra P in a structure between the stem and root derived from the former hypocotyl, which persisted for over 6 months after germination. The differences m growth and distribution of biomass and P in response to P‐supply of the two species are likely to contribute to the establishment of their seedlings in the field. If <jats:italic>L. corrugata</jats:italic> is capable of re‐translocating P from the hypocotyl, this storage of P has ecological advantages for long‐term survival, which might be important under low light conditions. Together with a low RGR, it enables a seedling to maintain P‐reserves until a gap occurs. In a newly created gap, P‐availability per seedling increases, and pioneers, with their higher P uptake and growth potential, can benefit from these relatively higher levels of P‐availability. This is an important advantage in high‐light gap environments where the tallest tree seedling is generally the most competitive one.</jats:p>",

Plants were watered with either low (0·005 %: LF) or high‐concentrated (0·05%: HF) fertilizer solution. Discs between second‐order veins in the central portion of the leaves were excised and immediately cryofixed in liquid nitrogen for low‐temperature scanning electron‐microscopy (LTSEM) at 1000 hours and 1400 hours. Stomatal width, area and density were measured by digital image‐analysis. X‐ray counts of potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) ions were determined by means of energy‐dispersive X‐ray microanalysis in guard and subsidiary cells. Accurate and fast measurements of stomatal apertures by image analysis were possible in birch leaves, because the darkness of the stomatal pore contrasts with the brightness of the guard cells and the cuticular ledges. Regression analysis showed a close relationship between the stomatal width and the pore area (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>= 0·938, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0·01). At all harvest times, the stomatal pores were significantly narrowed in the high fertilization control treatment (O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/HF vs. O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/LF), and in the ozone treatment at 1400 hours (O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/HF vs. C/LF). In addition to this fertilization effect, ozone had also narrowed the stomatal pores (O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/HF vs. C/HF at 1400 hours, O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/LF vs. C/LF at all harvest times). In addition to these functional effects, morphological effects (individual leaf area, stomatal density) were determined. Single‐leaf area was increased by high fertilization, with a tendency to decrease with O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> fumigation. The stomatal density in intercostal fields was increased by O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> but decreased by high fertilisation. Stomatal widening was accompanied by increased K count rates in the guard cells, in contrast to constant K values in the subsidiary cells, irrespective of the fumigation or fertilization regimes. Calcium counts in the guard cells were similar to those in the subsidiary cells, and were independent of the aperture width. In samples with established ozone injury, the K/Ca ratio in collapsed guard cells increased compared with turgid guard cells irrespective of the pore aperture. Collapsed subsidiary cells only differed from turgid subsidiary cells when the guard cells had also collapsed and thus closed the pore.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under conditions of limited water supply, intermittent irrigation instead of continuous flooding is necessitated in rice cultivation. To assess the response of lowland transplanted rice to intermittent irrigation vis-a-vis continuous submergence, field experiments were conducted at the Agricultural College, Killikulam during rubi seasons (Oct-Feb) of 1990 and 1991. The effect of partial substitution of inorganic nitrogen through bio fertilizers-azolla and blue green algae (BGA) - was also evaluated. The results indicated that rice yield was reduced by 3 to 19 per cent by intermittent irrigation compared to continuous submergence. The practice of irrigation immediately after disapperance of ponded water was most suitable under limited water supply. With this practice, the yield reduction was only marginal (3-5%) but it helped to save about 28.7 per cent of irrigation water compared to continuous submergence. Substitution of 25 per cent of inorganic nitrogen through inoculation of azolla or BGA maintained the grain yield of rice on par with the application of 100 per cent of N through inorganic fertilizers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies of intact hearts suggest that cardiac myocytes may have the ability to reversibly suppress metabolic activity and energy demand in states of regional hypoperfusion. However, an ability to suppress respiration in response to hypoxia has never been demonstrated in isolated myocytes. To test this, isolated embryonic chick cardiac myocytes were exposed to progressive hypoxia while their rate of O2 uptake and concentrations of lactate, ATP, ADP, AMP, and phosphocreatine were measured. Compared with the value obtained at an oxygen tension (PO2) of 120 Torr, cellular O2 uptake decreased by 28 +/- 14% (SD) at PO2 = 50 Torr and by 64 +/- 25% at PO2 = 20 Torr (P &lt; 0.05). This decrease was similar after 1 min or 2 h of hypoxia, was sustained for 16 h, and was completely reversible within 2 min after reoxygenation. The reduction in O2 uptake was associated with a decrease in the rate of ATP turnover, but no change in adenine nucleotide or phosphocreatine concentrations. In myocytes adherent to glass cover-slips, O2 uptake and contractile motion were decreased after 30-60 min at 50 and 20 Torr, compared with normoxic values. O2 uptake also was significantly decreased at 50 and 20 Torr in myocytes incubated with N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, which suggests that the catalytic activity of cytochrome-c oxidase was partially inhibited during hypoxia. In summary, these results demonstrate that embryonic chick cardiac myocytes can suppress their rates of ATP demand, ATP utilization, and O2 uptake during moderate hypoxia through a mechanism that involves a reversible inhibition of cytochrome-c oxidase. This mechanism may represent a protective response to cellular hypoxia. </jats:p>",

The analysis focused on two main teaching fields (special and general education) and five main sources of supply of public school teachers (first-time teachers who recently graduated, first-time teachers who delayed entry to the teaching profession, reentering experienced teachers, teachers migrating from private to public schools, and public school teachers continuing from the prior year). Results showed significantly, greater annual inflow of entering teachers in special education (8.5%) than in general education (5.9%). The main source of entering public teachers in 1990-91 was the reserve pool (68% in special education; 69% in general education), composed of (a) delayed entry first-time teachers and (b) reentering experienced teachers. The other sources of entering public teachers were first-time teachers who recently graduated from college (24% in both special and general education), and migrant teachers from private schools (8% in special education; 7% in general education). Although special and general education were more similar than dissimilar in their respective sources of supply of teachers, these two fields differed somewhat in the following respects: (a) there was a greater percentage demand in special education for teachers to fill open positions, and (b) special education filled a higher percentage of open positions with reentering eaperienced teachers Implications for teacher shortage, recruitment, and teacher education are discussed </jats:p>",
