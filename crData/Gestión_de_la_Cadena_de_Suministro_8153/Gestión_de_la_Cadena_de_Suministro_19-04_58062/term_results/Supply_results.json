The integration design is based on a case study of a supply chain integration of 5 companies, operating in different, but supply chain complimenting industry sectors. The case study research is applied to design and validate the architectures in a real world scenario. The supply chain integration architectures enable the conversion of individual into integrated strategies. The architectures are categorised and the process develops into a conceptual system for identifying the correlations between individual participants&amp;rsquo; strategic areas of interest and the integrated supply chain areas of interest. The novelty of this paper is a conceptual system for green-field supply chain integration architectures, which can be applied in real world by supply chain practitioners.</jats:p>"

The architecture starts with individual supply chain participants and derives insights into the complex and abstract concept of green-field integration design. The paper presented a conceptual system for depicting the interactions between business and supply chain strategy engineering. The system examines the decisions made when engineering the business strategy, with regards to the supply chain design. The system derived with a new understanding of how strategies are integrated, and what are the implications for engineering successful strategies. The study revealed that supply chain design is not considered in great detail before architecting the business strategies. Thus, companies consequentially experience supply chain problems that are likely to be detrimental to the growth potentials. The paper also derived with the findings that proactive and pre-emptive involvement of supply chain participants in the strategy engineering process, would lead to a more robust strategic design. </jats:p>"

Unfortunately, our learnings from traditional manufacturing, and to some extent other service supply chains, do not always easily port to the downstream healthcare delivery supply chain due to regulatory issues and distinctive characteristics present in this network. Grounded in Institutional Theory, this study conceptualizes the downstream healthcare delivery supply chain, highlights important regulatory pressures that influence this supply chain, and examines the effects of government regulation and the unique characteristics of this network on coordination.

A conceptual framework is presented here for the evaluation of risks in the ornamental fish supply chain. With a prolonged study and deliberations with field experts, various types of risks are brought out of the ornamental fish supply chain. From the study, the types of risks associated are clustered into six categories, namely macro level risk, demand risk, supply risk, quality risk, risk on asset and infrastructure and financial risk, to find out the major risks in this supply chain. Friedman's ranked data test is applied to find the significant difference in various risks clustered in the categories. The study allows a supply chain member to develop a clear view of risk related to the entire supply chain. The article can help the members of the ornamental fish supply chain to make use of the study and information to make more efficient and effective supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Health insurance depends on labor market activity more in the U.S. than in any other high-income country. A majority of the population are insured through an employer (known as employer-sponsored insurance or ESI), benefiting from the risk pooling and economies of scale available to group insurance plans. Some workers may therefore be reluctant to leave a job for fear of losing such low-cost insurance, a tendency known as ‚Äújob lock,‚Äù or may switch jobs or work more hours merely to obtain it, known as ‚Äújob push.‚Äù Others obtain insurance through government programs for which eligibility depends on income. They too may adapt their work effort to remain eligible for insurance. Those without access to ESI or who are too young or earn too much to qualify for public coverage (Medicare and Medicaid) can buy insurance only in the individual or nongroup market, where prices are high and variable. Most studies using data from before the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 support the prediction that ESI reduced job mobility, labor-force participation, retirement, and self-employment prior to the ACA, but find little effect on the labor supply of public insurance. The ACA profoundly changed the health insurance market in the U.S., removing restrictions on obtaining insurance from new employers or on the individual market and expanding Medicaid eligibility to previously ineligible adults. Research on the ACA, however, has not found substantial labor supply effects. These results may reflect that the reforms to the individual market mainly affected those who were previously uninsured rather than workers with ESI, that the theoretical labor market effects of expansions in public coverage are ambiguous, and that the effect would be found only among the relatively small number on the fringes of eligibility.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background:¬†In South Africa, the export of coal is a large contributor to the gross domestic product. Statistics indicate that the export of coal is stagnant or declining, which indicates a risk for coal as a foreign exchange earner. A study into the risks facing the bulk coal export logistics chain is therefore of great importance. Any risk to this logistics chain will directly affect its efficiency and contribution to foreign exchange. The nature of a logistics supply chain is such that risks to one stakeholder (partner or node) affect not only that stakeholder‚Äôs own operations but also those of the other partners and the whole supply chain‚Äôs efficiency and sustainability.Objectives:¬†The objective of the study was to identify and explore the risks and risk management practices in the bulk coal export logistics chain from a stakeholder theory perspective.Methods:¬†A qualitative research design was used, and in-depth, structured interviews were conducted with different stakeholders in the chain. A total of eight interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed by means of a thematic analysis.Results:¬†Many risks were identified in the bulk coal export logistics chain, and of these risks, it was found that the most important ones were infrastructure, the macro-economy and people-related risks. The findings revealed evidence of underlying tensions between different stakeholders with regard to investment to mitigate infrastructure risks. The findings suggest that there is a lack of communication and an aligned vision among the stakeholders in the logistics chain and that they strategise for their risks separately.Conclusion:¬†Close cooperation on a high level between the stakeholders in the logistics chain is needed to strategise for risk mitigation in an integrated, holistic manner.</jats:p>"

The expected growth in population, urbanization and economic activity, as well as the impact of climate change, will exacerbate the situation in the coming decade. In developed countries, conventional water supply and wastewater disposal systems ensure safe access to drinking water, sanitation and wastewater services. The worldwide application of conventional systems is, however, only possible to a limited extent. The reason for this is that these systems are designed for certain climatic conditions and also do not consider the varying requirements regarding water supply and wastewater disposal typical for developing countries. Although there are alternative water supply and wastewater disposal systems that have proved to be successful throughout the developing world, there are still several barriers to their worldwide adoption. To increase the establishment of these approaches this paper focuses on aspects of particular relevance for developing countries, namely: water reuse (untreated wastewater), alternative sewerage (settled and simplified sewerage), alternative wastewater treatment (waste stabilization ponds, constructed wetlands and up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors) and management of water losses (real and apparent losses).</jats:p>",

Drawing on the resource‚Äêbased and relational view of the firm, we investigate how suppliers‚Äô economies of scale influence the buyer's selection decision, and we illustrate how the influence of scale is contingent upon important economic, buyer, and relationship characteristics. We test the model with a large secondary dataset of actual supplier selection decisions from the automotive industry and show that economies of scale have a strongly positive but diminishing effect on the buying firm's supplier selection decision. These effects are reinforced or extenuated by economic, buyer, and relationship characteristics, with characteristics that are more specific to the buyer‚Äêsupplier situation (e.g., relationship duration and power balance) having a stronger moderating effect than do characteristics that are more global (e.g., economic cycle). Our research helps suppliers to better understand how to manage selection probabilities with buyers and provides buying firms with a better understanding of how contextual factors affect the benefit of supplier‚Äêprovided economies of scale.</jats:p>",

In order to partition systems with various degrees of disorder and take appropriate methods to refrain systems from falling into a chaos state, numerical simulation methods are conducted to find the stability range, bifurcation range and the chaos range.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Engineering the supply chain requires a design that possesses the flexibility of a complex adaptive system, consisting of interlinking architecture, with external dimensions and system germane internal elements. The complexity of the subject, the multiple environments, dimensions, elements and concepts, require a research that does not set any limits to the conceptual, analytical or empirical nature of the existing approaches present in practice. This present the rational for applying a taxonomy approach to investigate the integration engineering of supply chain architecture, design and engineering, and building a framework for integrating the existing supply chain approaches. The objectives of this paper are to critically analyse the key supply chain concepts and approaches, to assess the fit between the research literature and the practical issues of supply chain architecture, design and engineering, and to develop a methodology that could be used by practitioners when integrating supply chain architecture and design with strategy engineering. Taxonomy approach is applied to consider criteria for strategy architecture, hierarchical strategy design, strategy engineering, and integration of supply chain architecture, design and engineering as a conceptual system. The results from this paper derived with the findings that the relationship between supply chain architecture, design and engineering is weak and challenges remain in the process of adapting and aligning operations. This paper also derived with a novel approach for addressing these obstacles, based on a new methodology. The novelty that derives from this paper is a methodology for integrating supply chain architecture, design and engineering, with criteria that enable decomposing and building a digital (new and non-existent) supply chain as a system. The paper revealed a number of tools and mechanism which enabled the development of a new methodology for integrating the architecture, design and engineering of a supply chain. The review derived with improvements to current and existing theories for analysing interdependencies within and between their individual contexts. This issue is addressed with a hierarchical method for network design, applied for building and combining the integration criteria.</jats:p>"

Law Number 7 of 1996 concerning Food, mandates that the government and the community are responsible for realizing Food Security. The Government organizes the regulation, guidance, control and supervision of sufficient food availability, both in quantity and quality and safety and nutritious, evenly distributed and affordable by the purchasing power of the people. The rate of increase in food demand is faster than the rate of increase in production capacity. Surabaya as a city of trade and services does not have sufficient agricultural land so that the supply of strategic commodities highly depends on supplies from outside the region which cause vulnerability to supply availability and price instability. Based on the description above, intensive monitoring of food price volatility in several markets and food wholesalers in the city of Surabaya is needed in order to maintain supply stability and price stability. One alternative to overcome the problems as above is with the development of the Supply Chain Management logistics city. In the long run according to the results that will be obtained in this study, it is expected to increase the role of PD.

The methodology consists of external architecture and internal design that anticipates the business strategy in the development process. The methodology is designed to anticipate the impact of developments in new road transport technologies, such as Tesla Truck or Tesla Pickup. Since the methodology is designed to anticipate the impact of non-existing technologies, it represents green-field analysis. Green-field is defined as a new and non-existent operation. Green-field strategy architecture in this paper is presented as a process of accepting the world and acting upon that version of the world. The results of the analysis are presented as pathways and outcomes, emerging from the interrelated relationship between AEV and IoT. The emerging methodology is applied through two case studies to evaluate the impact to environment, performance and operationalisation. The methodology proposes architecture and design for integrating AEV and IoT in the supply chain strategy, and a set of new evaluation criteria that promote acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design process. The main contribution to knowledge is a new methodology for integrating AEV and the IoT to the supply chains. The paper applies interplay between inductive and deductive case study and grounded theory approach to build upon the concept of supply chain architecture and contribute to knowledge to the topic of formulating green-field integrated AEV- IoT supply chain strategy.</jats:p>"

The analysis considers four measures of ODA, including the total net aid transfers (NAT), ODA allocated to all sectors in the recipient-countries (ODAALLSECT), ODA allocated to the trade sector and ODA provided for the non-trade sector. The empirical results show that greater fiscal space in donor-countries influences positively donors‚Äô NAT, their ODA allocated to all sectors as well as their ODA allocated to the non-trade sector in recipient-countries. At the same time, greater fiscal space in donor-countries does not influence ODA relating to the trade sector. Furthermore, the impact of fiscal space on ODA supply to the trade and non-trade sectors depends on donor-countries‚Äô level of economic wealth. </jats:p><jats:p> Jel Classification: E62, F35 </jats:p>",

In countries with a continuous water supply, the population mostly relies ingenuously on the permanent availability of tap water due to high supply standards. In case of a disruption in the drinking water infrastructure, minimum supply standards become important for emergency management during disasters. However, wider recognition of this issue is still lacking, particularly in countries facing comparably fewer disruptions. Several international agencies provide guideline values for minimum water provision standards in case of a disaster. Acknowledging that these minimum standards were developed for humanitarian assistance, it remains to be analyzed whether these standards apply to disaster management in countries with high supply standards. Based on a comprehensive literature review of scientific publications and humanitarian guidelines, as well as policies from selected countries, current processes, contents, and shortcomings of emergency water supply planning are assessed. To close the identified gaps, this paper flags potential improvements for emergency water supply planning and identifies future fields of research.</jats:p>"

By means of literature synthesis, we build new knowledge about the mechanisms AM induces to improve SC design and performance, as well as the disruptive changes AM can cause. We investigate opportunities to optimize SC design for manufacturing purposes by exploiting the characteristics of AM, e.g., its freedom in terms of shape design and complexity and the absence of a need for object-specific tools. We study the roles of demand, assortment, IT systems, sourcing, manufacturing, knowledge, warehousing, and transportation, and explore the effects and tradeoffs on various SC performance outcomes, including cost, assets, and responsiveness. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, through literature synthesis, we construct six AM SC mechanisms that can be used in SC design to achieve desired SC outcomes for AM production applications in certain (business) contexts. Second, we identify the disruptive ‚Äògame-changing‚Äô effects of AM for SC stakeholders. This knowledge can be used by other researchers to develop further research. Moreover, general and logistics managers can use the results to fully exploit the potential of AM for designing much improved supply chains. Innovators and policy makers can use the results to understand the potential game-changing consequences of AM.</jats:p>"

After the recent oil price downturn, the time has come to evaluate supply chain and procurement techniques and costs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Between the 1940s and 1970s, the average annual price of oil fluctuated within a 6.5% band, but from the 1980s until the last few years, the variation has widened to almost 11 times that. A range of factors has contributed to this volatility, including political crises, financial speculation, and sharp increases/decreases in demand.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Regardless of the reasons behind the initial shocks, the turn from steady-state historical demand induced the ‚Äúbull-whip effect,‚Äù in which small changes in demand cause oscillating and increasing reverberations in production, capacity, and inventory throughout the supply chain in markets for oil and gas field machinery and equipment such as generator sets, motors, turbines and electrical equipment, as well as other equipment and supplies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Small variations in demand at the retail end tend to dramatically amplify as they travel upstream across supply chains with the effect that order amounts are very unbalanced and can be exaggerated. This amplification of demand fluctuations from downstream to upstream in a supply chain is called the bullwhip effect.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Consequences of the Bullwhip This bullwhip effect has caused the following types of economic inefficiency at oil company equipment suppliers:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Equipment manufacturers held excess inventory during the boom¬†and took a long time to draw¬†it down when the recession hit.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Equipment manufacturers made¬†excessive capacity investments near the peak and suffered a low or¬†negative return on¬†investment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Component and parts suppliers lost orders that they were not able to fulfill at the peak due to inadequate capacity and long lead times caused by large backlogs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It is estimated that the bullwhip effect costs the oil industry about $2.8 billion per year. Over the long term, this volatility is the equivalent of 9% of the cost of producing a barrel of oil. Equipment and component suppliers bear even more of this cost than oil companies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The initial increase in demand for oil raises the production levels of crude oil and refinery products, which translates into increased demand for oilfield equipment such as pumps, compressors, and turbines. Excess output is higher at the refiner level than at the producer level, higher at the original equipment manufacturer than at the refiner, and higher at the component supplier than at the equipment manufacturer.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Refiners and producers pay higher prices that are set when markets are overheated and are not readily de-escalated when recession hits. Moreover, equipment and service prices keep rising even as the price of oil falls, equipment orders drop, capacity utilization drops, and lead times to manufacturing decline. Capacity adjusts, with a lag, as orders and production fluctuate, which causes capacity utilization to behave erratically.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Smoothing this volatility in demand and prices would result in steadier and more profitable capital expansion and a higher return on assets. Steadier prices would translate to higher operating profits and lower operating costs as companies would go through fewer waves of layoffs and subsequent rehiring. Perhaps most important, more stable R&amp;D investments would result in greater oilfield productivity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using the data from 1974/75 to 2017/18, this paper intended to find out the relationship between money supply, income and price level in Nepal. The paper has established the relationship between real money supply (both M1 and M2) with respect to real GDP, nominal money supply (both M1 and M2) with respect to price level and nominal GDP with respect to price level separately. The econometric tools such as ADF for unit root tests, SIC for lag length selection, bivariate Johansen Cointegration tests followed by VECM has been used for long-run causality. Further, VEC as well as VAR Granger Causality/Block Exogeneity Wald tests for short-run causality are used. The paper found bidirectional longrun causality between the real income with respect to both type of money supply in real terms. But there is no evidence of short run causation between these variables. Likewise, the study found the unidirectional long-run relationship runs from narrow money supply to consumer price. However, there is no short-run relationship from either side. Accordingly, there is no evidence of long-run as well as short-run relationship between broad money supply and consumer price level. Lastly, there is no evidence of long-run causality between nominal GDP and general price level. But the study found unidirectional short-run causality running from general price to nominal GDP. The results suggest that Nepal should focus on growth of time deposit component of broad money supply in long-run for economic growth and control of inflation.</jats:p>"

As a result, PETRONAS has embarked on a series of enhancement to its procurement process, which includes the introduction of Contractors Code of Conduct on Human Rights and inclusion of human rights in the General Terms and Conditions of all contracts. PETRONAS also intensified its capability building efforts for both employees and contractors to ensure that the human rights requirements are cascaded effectively and well-understood across the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Exploiting the U.S. interstate branching deregulation between 1994 and 2005, we find that an exogenous expansion of bank branches increases low-income household financial inclusion. We then show that financial inclusion fosters household wealth accumulation. Relative to their unbanked counterparts, banked households accumulate assets in interest-bearing accounts, invest more in durable assets, such as vehicles, have a better access to debt, and have a lower probability of facing financial strain. The results suggest that promoting financial inclusion for low-income populations can improve household wealth accumulation and financial security.</jats:p><jats:p>Received April 13, 2017; editorial decision November 14, 2018 by Editor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh.

If we define two resources as serving the same list of ends, then whether these items can be subsumed under the rubric of the ‚Äúsame good‚Äù revolves around how we conceive of ends. If ends are at least partly language-dependent, that is, the way of individuating ends depends on the level of generality with which we refer to them, then the notion of the same good seems trivial. In extreme cases, we can specify ends in such a manner that no two items would fall into the-same-good category. Or, we can construe ends so generally that all resources would be conceptualized as the same good for they would serve the same general ends; e.g., of benefitting their owners. After presenting the problem in detail, we study the implication of our construal of ends. We conclude by showing that the triviality objection cannot undermine Austrian subjectivism.</jats:p>"

Such technologies can shift CTs to a model in which real-time information gathering, analysis, and decision making are possible. This can be achieved by leveraging these technologies to better manage decision complexity and execute decisions at levels that cannot otherwise be managed easily by humans. Some of the key points identified are in the areas of the fundamental capabilities that need to be supported and the improved level of decision visibility that they provide. We also consider some the challenges in achieving this, which include data quality and integrity, collaboration and data sharing across supply chain tiers, cross-system interoperability, decision-validation and organizational impacts, among others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

However, with increasing carbon costs, the optimal reverse supply chain (RSC) system is being required to adapt and has undergone many distinct shifts in character as it seeks out new configurations through which costs may be effectively managed and minimized. The model was studied comprehensively in terms of quantitative performance using orthogonal arrays. The results were compared to top-down estimates produced through economic input-output life cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) models, providing a basis to contrast remanufacturing GHG emission quantities with those realized through original equipment manufacturing operations. Introducing a carbon cost of $40/t CO2e increased modeled remanufacturing costs by 2.7%, but also increased original equipment costs by 2.3%. The research presented in this study puts forward the theoretical modeling of optimal RSC systems and provides an empirical case study concerning remanufactured appliances, an area of current industrial literature in which there is a dearth of study.</jats:p>"

However, in the long run, the yield responds positively to technological change in animal breeding, feed supplies, veterinary services and markets. These findings lead us to argue that the dairy policy should focus on pushing up adoption of yield-enhancing technologies, provision of animal health, breeding and extension services, and strengthening of market linkages.</jats:p>"

In order to improve overall supply chain service quality by allowing companies' agents to evaluate the service quality of their partners through the history of their transactions, this article proposes a service quality agent model. The model is designed using MCDM tools to suit different approaches to supply chain management. Consequently, since more informed procurement decisions are taking place continuously and autonomously at each node of a supply chain, supply chain service quality is being improved along the whole supply chain. At the end, the service quality valuation model of the supply chain is empirically evaluated.</jats:p>"

In addition, it can happen that packaging devices originally designed for one way are used multiple times, because the technical condition of the packaging ensures the repeated usage and the other way around. Transport distance is an important aspect while choosing the right packaging system, but according to our investigation the ratio between the purchasing cost of a new device and the cost of backwards transportation should also influence this decision. Therefore, the scope of this paper is to give a model of the cost structure of returnable industrial packaging operating in a closed loop system.

The approach consists in training an MLP-ANN to predict nitrate concentrations based on a set of indirect measurements, such as pH, electrical conductivity, temperature and groundwater level. These are simpler and more economical than direct measurements, and they can be continuously collected on-site, rather than by performing laboratory tests. The approach has been validated in the nitrate vulnerable zone of the Arborea plain (central western Sardinia, Italy) by comparing the results obtained with different MLP-ANN models in order to find the most efficient model. The results show that the MLP-ANN-based model is a time- and cost-efficient method for predicting nitrate concentration.</jats:p>",

However, subjective voting by industrial experts and Gartner consultants are likely to be influenced by financial market variables, such as a firm's market value, alpha, beta, and market return. This article investigates whether the Gartner list is a true reflection of a firm's SCM excellence and how market variables affect the Gartner list, especially its subjective quality dimensions. Correlation and regression analysis show that the Gartner list is largely affected by a firm's market value and alpha, but is not associated with the firm's beta and market return. Moreover, the Gartner list is influenced by a firm's prior market information, but is not capable to predict its future performance.</jats:p>",

This article considers a dyadic supply chain composed of one fair-minded manufacturer and one fair-minded retailer and investigate their pricing decisions under two different non-cooperative game-theoretic frameworks: manufacturer-led Stackelberg game and Vertical Nash game and provide a comparative analysis. The results show that the prices of the Stackelberg game model are always higher than that of the corresponding prices of the Vertical Nash game. We also find that the prices gap between the two models decreases with the retailer's fairness concern, and is uncertain with respect to manufacturer's fairness. In addition, the manufacturer's (retailer's) profit in the Stackelberg game is decreasing (increasing) in its own fairness and is uncertain in the Vertical Nash game. Furthermore, findings are illustrated through a numerical example.</jats:p>",

We construct behavioural tax and benefit microsimulation model and simulate labour-market responses of singles and couples had remittances not existed in their households. This is a novel methodological approach avoiding the usual trap of utilisation of inappropriate instruments to remittances. Our results suggest that remittances are prevalently associated with lower labour-market activity, especially for women. However, the labour-supply response is found quite feeble and only in single families. Hence, while previous findings are not entirely rebutted, they may have been overstated and are highly dependent on the construct of the receiving household.</jats:p>"

The objective of this article is to conduct an analysis on the international literature about the SCM sustainability topic, by employing a systematic review protocol, covering the period from 2011 to 2016. The content analysis technique was performed, following the procedures of categorical thematic analysis proposed by Bardin (1977), which considers the creation of categories a posteriori, based in the direction senses related to the content analyzed. Besides to present the main characteristics of the articles related to distribution of publications per year, most studied sectors, main methods and approaches used main countries and journals of publications, we categorize the results at the systemic approach level of the sustainable development dimensions. We found that some dimensions are prominent when compared with the others: For example: the environmental one, on the other hand, the social one is approached few times in the papers considered in our analysis. These results also indicate that this type of discussion needs to be extended to other sectors that have not yet been explored. The contribution of this paper lies on the synthetization of the state-of-the-art related to sustainable SCM in the period considered, highlighting the environmental, social and economic dimensions, in order to identify a research agenda. By identifying possible research gaps, the results of this research contribute to guide future investigations on sustainable SCM, aiding researchers and practitioners in this field.</jats:p>"

The NHWAVE (non-hydrostatic wave) model was applied to simulate the detailed interface structure between a lock-release gravity current and the ambient fluid. The simulated structures, including the front height, front position and velocity of the current, are consistent with the results of laboratory experiments. However, the internal structure of the current is different from that revealed by previous research. The Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz phenomenon in the interface and the interface vortices were successfully captured by the NHWAVE model. The difference in velocity between the front and rear vortices leads to entrainment, further causing changes in the shapes and amount of vortices. Flow field results obtained by the NHWAVE model reveal the existence of a significant circular flow, as well as some small eddies within it. The significant circular flow supports the forward movement of the current, whereas the small eddies reflect interface vortices. In contrast, hydrostatic simulation with the same model settings fails to capture the vortices. This research shows that the NHWAVE model performs better than a hydrostatic model when simulating the Kelvin‚ÄìHelmholtz instability phenomenon and vortex entrainment in a lock-release gravity current.</jats:p>",

This study specifically sought to establish the influence of relationship management, strategic sourcing, adoption of information technology, and procurement methods on performance of state corporations.Methodology: The study employed descriptive research design with target population of 146 State Corporations in Kenya and using census. The study used primary data which was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. Quantitative data collected was analysed by the use of descriptive statistics using SPSS (version 23). Multiple regression analysis was used to establish the relation among the variables.Results: The study concludes that the set of independent variables are very significant and they therefore need to be considered in any effort to enhance perfomance of the state corporations in Kenya. From the study findings there is need for the organization to enhance supplier appraisal to improve performance of its suppliers. The organization should focus on building long lasting relationships with suppliers.There is need for the top management in the organization to emphasize the strategic role of the strategic functions. Sourcing long-range plan includes developing relationship with the key suppliers. It was concluded that supplier relationship management, adoption of IT, strategic sourcing and procurement methods had a significant¬† positive relationship with the perfomance of state corporations in Kenya.Recommendations: The study recommends that there is need for the adoption of the IT to enhance performance of the state corporation. The study recommends for the organization to ensure that there is adequate IT infrastructure; adequate level of automation for the procurement staff in the organization, enhanced e-procurement to facilitate reduction of costs and the organization should have adequate procurement usage to enhance implementation of rules and regulations.The study recommends that the organization need to adopt the appropriate procurement methods to reduce in average inventory held. Procurement methods can lead to improved quality for goods, works and services. Effective procurement methods¬† can match the demand and supply for goods and lead to the reduction of complaints from the users. The competitive procurement methods can reduce the overpriced bids and reduce unethical behaviour among the procurement staff.</jats:p>"

Thus, climatic and economic factors affecting the annually aggregated supply of top-marketed mushrooms (ceps, milk caps, and chanterelle) and berries (bilberry, cowberry, and cloudberry) in Finland were studied. Data on mushroom and berry market prices (‚Ç¨/kg) and quantities (kg) were obtained from the statistics on annual quantities of berries and mushrooms bought by organized trade and industry in Finland (1978‚Äì2016). The species-specific supply functions were described as linear regression models, where annually aggregated quantities were predicted as a function of climatic and economic variables. Our results suggested that climatic variables influenced the marketed quantities of NTFPs through the biological yields of berries and mushrooms, and that the market price had a negative effect on the marketed quantities of ceps, milk caps, and berries. The markets for NTFPs have become more international at the second half of the study period (1999‚Äì2016), modifying the price-quantity relationships of ceps, milk caps and cloudberries. Additionally, the number of visas issued to Thai pickers increased the marketed quantities of bilberries and cowberries.</jats:p>"

The literature suggests that there is value in synchronised cooperative and competitive interactions between firms as such interactions incentivise the pursuit of shared interests.Research design, approach and method:¬†Through a cross-sectional survey, data were collected from 388 SMEs in Zimbabwe, and structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data.Main findings:¬†The study specifically found that there is a positive and significant relationship between collaboration-oriented capabilities and supply chain competence.Practical/managerial implications:¬†The results of this study demonstrate the critical role of organisational capabilities in achieving supply chain competence. The study proves that collaborative capabilities are central to the supply chain success of SMEs, with the possibility of influencing also the firm‚Äôs sustainable competitive advantage in line with the dynamic capabilities theory.Contribution/value-add:¬†This study sheds light on the possibility of enhancing the overall supply chain competence of SMEs by establishing and empirically testing the relationships between COOC and supply chain competence.</jats:p>"

For this paper and according to accessible and processed sources, had not been found research that determine and treats concept of sport comprehensively, by the sub-areas of sport. Sport tourism in theory represents a selective form of tourism and should be based, in accordance with contemporary trends, on comparative competitiveness and sustainable development. Sustainable development includes a wide range of relevant platforms. These platforms influence the sustainable planning of sport tourism supply. The question is what are the resources and factors that are important for the planning of sport-tourism supply and fit into comparative competitiveness and sustainable development? The practical and theoretical purpose of this paper are the determination of resources and factors important for the planning and development of sport tourism in those destinations that want to develop this form of selective tourism. In these destinations such created supply of sports and recreational amenities and facilities should resulted with increase in consumption. Previously defined resources and factors should be the basis for the planning of the overall development of a particular destination and, consequently, for decision-making process on potential investment engagements. Such structural changes should also reflected on the structure of the supply and potentially define changes in the guests structure/profile and their demand or consumption. Thus, in this paper determined resources and factors, if applied, should affect directly or indirectly the planning and decisions development in each particular destination.</jats:p>",

The machines will be able to use algorithms that will enable them to automate the supply chain formation process and to quickly react to disruptions. The current approach proposes a mechanism based on a message passing inference scheme in order to address the automated supply chain formation problem in a closed-loop supply chain by integrating forward and reverse supply chains. Forward supply chain imply a series of activities required to produce new products from virgin materials and distribute them to consumers while reverse supply chains require collecting used products from consumers and reprocessing them to either recover their leftover market values or dispose of them. It has become common for companies involved in a forward supply chain to also carry out collection and reprocessing of used products. Strict environmental regulations and diminishing raw material resources have intensified the importance of reverse supply chains at an increasing rate. The proposed mechanism is evaluated using two type of supply chain configurations from textile and automobile industry, demonstrating that automated integration of reverse supply chains along with forward supply chains, lead to benefits for the participants in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Our analysis using national databases through 2016 predicted an estimated annual teacher shortage of approximately 112,000 teachers in 2017-18. Our recent review of state teacher workforce reports estimated 109,000 individuals were uncertified for their teaching positions in the US in 2017, roughly approximating our projections.

The supply chain network interest coordination model analyzes the relationship between the dominant manufacturer behavior and the supply chain network green index and network profit. The results show that fulfilling green contracts helps improve the profitability and sustainability of supply chain networks. A counter-intuitive but interesting result is that the dominant manufacturers increase the cost-sharing ratio or penalties of the logistics network, which will reduce the profit level and green index of the logistics network, and increase the cost-sharing ratio or punishment of the suppliers. Strength will increase the profitability and green index of the logistics network. Finally, we validate the relevant conclusions of the model through numerical simulation analysis.</jats:p>"

This study specifically sought to establish the influence of relationship management, strategic sourcing, adoption of information technology, and procurement methods on performance of state corporations.Methodology: The study employed descriptive research design with target population of 146 State Corporations in Kenya and using census. The study used primary data which was collected using a comprehensive questionnaire. Quantitative data collected was analysed by the use of descriptive statistics using SPSS (version 23). Multiple regression analysis was used to establish the relation among the variables.Results: The study concludes that the set of independent variables are very significant and they therefore need to be considered in any effort to enhance perfomance of the state corporations in Kenya. From the study findings there is need for the organization to enhance supplier appraisal to improve performance of its suppliers. The organization should focus on building long lasting relationships with suppliers.There is need for the top management in the organization to emphasize the strategic role of the strategic functions. Sourcing long-range plan includes developing relationship with the key suppliers. It was concluded that supplier relationship management, adoption of IT, strategic sourcing and procurement methods had a significant¬† positive relationship with the perfomance of state corporations in Kenya.Recommendations: The study recommends that there is need for the adoption of the IT to enhance performance of the state corporation. The study recommends for the organization to ensure that there is adequate IT infrastructure; adequate level of automation for the procurement staff in the organization, enhanced e-procurement to facilitate reduction of costs and the organization should have adequate procurement usage to enhance implementation of rules and regulations.The study recommends that the organization need to adopt the appropriate procurement methods to reduce in average inventory held. Procurement methods can lead to improved quality for goods, works and services. Effective procurement methods¬† can match the demand and supply for goods and lead to the reduction of complaints from the users. The competitive procurement methods can reduce the overpriced bids and reduce unethical behaviour among the procurement staff.</jats:p>"

Although the use of the Penman‚ÄìMonteith equation often appears in the literature, a performance assessment was conducted on the dynwbm by using 21 PET equations. The implementation was performed on different river branches in the Gediz Basin, Turkey. The satisfactory PET equations have been selected by means of statistical techniques. As a result of the evaluation, it was observed that one of the radiation-based equations, McGuinness‚ÄìBordne, provided the most consistent performance. Alternatively, the presence of parsimonious equations requiring less meteorological variables has been questioned, thus locally calibrated temperature-based PET equations reflecting the PET estimations of McGuinness‚ÄìBordne have been proposed so as to be practically utilized in water balance modeling experiments for the basin.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain is an expanding piece of technology helping us in designing and development of decentralized distributed solutions. It has impacted many industries by reducing intermediate authorities. So, we decided to explore its feasibility in the Food supply industry. The Food Agro sector has been responsible for several catastrophes, and as the industry expands globally it is strenuous to keep check and credence of and certify the food data. The fertile land for agriculture is diminishing and more yields need to be produced to content the need of the country. We propose a Blockchain based Decentralized market place where we implement a collaborative agro model between farmers and consumers. The farmers will be able to record the potential crops and the anticipated output on his farm land on the decentralized ledger. The consumers can check the information and the farmer integrity based on the previous supplies. This creates a far open and full proof digital market framework for agro-products and will help to reduce hoarding. This research paper explores one possible model of blockchain in the Food Supply Market by creating a breach proof ledger of records. We have used HTML, CSS, Javascript for frontend, Ethereum and Solidity based frameworks for backend working of this model.</jats:p>",

While most government institutions at the capital/provincial levels were crippled, the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority (PPWSA) was able to provide excellent water service to most of the capital's residents, even the extremely poor. This case represents a traditional utility that was able to creatively experiment with new management practices and solicit community involvement in the administration of its work. It also illustrates the fact that under certain conditions, urban water services can actually generate revenues to subsidize other functions of the government. Specifically, it provides a useful illustration of a resilient governance of infrastructure able to adapt to rapidly changing and challenging circumstances.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the introduction of a non-radial DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) model for the evaluation of different components of SCM, primarily in terms of sustainability, is the main contribution. However, in order to confirm the novelty and benefits of this new model in the field of SCM, a literature review of past applications of DEA-based models and methods are also presented. The non-radial DEA model was applied for the selection and evaluation of the environmental efficiency of suppliers considering undesirable inputs and outputs resulting in a better ranking of suppliers.

During a hydrological drought episode, irrigators receive insufficient water to meet their crops‚Äô water needs, giving rise to the so-called ‚Äòwater supply gap‚Äô. In such circumstances, agricultural production and irrigators‚Äô incomes are considerably reduced. In order to minimize the negative effects associated with water supply gaps, a new index-based drought insurance scheme for irrigation is proposed, linked to the variable ‚Äòstock of water available in reservoirs‚Äô. The proposal, although tailored to Spain, could be easily adapted to other countries or regions because the features of hydrological drought risk are similar worldwide. It is expected that the proposed scheme will improve drought risk management in irrigated agriculture, stabilizing irrigators‚Äô incomes and guaranteeing the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the face of global change.</jats:p>"

The introduction of sustainability in supply chains introduces more complexity to coordination. Thus sustainable supply chain coordination is the organization, integration and control of all supply chain activity and business aiming to achieve environmental, social and economic objectives. This study aims to analyze how the sustainable supply chain coordination is understood in papers published in Brazilian journals. We conducted a bibliometric analysis and content analysis of national publications on the topics of supply chain, sustainability and coordination. Results pointed to a total of 61 papers that contribute to the understanding of sustainable supply chain coordination. According to paper analysis, sustainable supply chain coordination is understood as a control mechanism of the focal firm. In general, supply chain coordination is highlighted as a benefit for focal companies to maintain control of sustainable strategies and operations. Moreover we verified that most of the papers emphasized discussions about economic benefits of coordination mechanisms used by focal companies, even if these papers propose to discuss environmental and/or social issues. This study contributes to identify the evolution of Brazilian publications related to sustainable supply chain coordination, as well as to support Brazilian researchers to explore gaps and research opportunities.</jats:p>"

Such a database would also be useful in bio-assessment and in the modeling of processes that are related to riparian vegetation surrounding a water body such as a stream network. With the help of easily measurable data, it would be easier to come up with database-intensive numerical and computer models that explain the stream water quality distribution and biological integrity and predict stream water quality patterns. Statistical assessments of nutrients, stream water metallic and non-metallic pollutants, organic matter, and biological species data are needed to accurately describe the pollutant effects, to quantify health hazards, and in the modeling of water quality and its risk assessment. The study details the results of statistical nonlinear regression and artificial neural network models for Upper Green River watershed, Kentucky, USA. The neural network models predicted the stream water quality parameters with more accuracy than the nonlinear regression models in both training and testing phases. For example, neural network models of pH, conductivity, salinity, total dissolved solids, and dissolved oxygen gave an R2 coefficient close to 1.0 in the testing phase, while the nonlinear regression models resulted in less than 0.6. For other parameters also, neural networks showed better generalization compared with nonlinear regression models.</jats:p>",

For the second stage, the effective roof catchment areas, together with roof area connection percentages, were analysed against different types of water demands in individual households. The individual systems were investigated for yield capacities, costs and water security using a modified Roof Runoff Harvesting Systems average annual yield model based on daily water balance procedures. The Life Cycle Costing analysis of the systems using the model was based on the Capital Recovery Method by taking into consideration the capital costs as well as ongoing costs for maintenance, replacement and operation of the systems. The analysis established the optimal sizing requirements for the studied rainwater tanks and their corresponding roof area connectivity.</jats:p>"

This is because the concept of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) is a concept that aims to minimize the negative impact of an organization and its supply chain on the environment related to climate change, pollution and non-renewable resources. In order to support GSCM, it is necessary to evaluate the extent to which this concept is carried out by Culinary SMEs in Palembang City. This evaluation is expected to identify the constraints and barriers facing SMEs in doing GSCM. By conducting a survey of 36 culinary SMEs, it was found that culinary SMEs in Palembang City have not implemented GSCM practices. This can be seen from the low mean value. Therefore, there needs to be support from related parties in this case the government to conduct socialization and dive and assistance in GSCM.</jats:p>"

A review of the supply chain network design (SCND) literature shows that most of the provided solutions lack the measurement and incorporation of the company's financial performance. This study extends the SCN redesign model, introduced by Jahani et¬†al. (2018), in order to allow financial performance optimization instead of profit maximization. The model uses essential accounts existing in the basic financial statements of an SCN company to delineate how the strategic financial considerations can influence the network structure and its operational flows. It ascertains the future financial position of the company, as well as the optimal levels of loans and the proportion of available cash required for financing the new design. We examine the applicability of the model by consolidating financial data with the case study used in Jahani et¬†al. (2018). We evaluate the resulting financial ratios of the new model with existing ratios aimed at representing the reliability of the model and introducing future targets. This study offers several managerial insights. For instance, consideration of inventory values as a current asset in designing an SCN leads to a realistic design aligned with financial statements that are also reportable to creditors and¬†investors.</jats:p>",

It generates necessary guarantees to sustain the continued operations of vulnerable farmers while enabling the manufacturers to manage the aggregate supply and price risk. We consider a single manufacturer who owns several manufacturing plants, each with a random demand for the crop. The manufacturer selects a set of farmers to offer a menu of contracts, which is exogenously specified or endogenously determined. Each ‚Äúselected‚Äù farmer chooses a contract from this menu in advance of the growing season. After the growing season, under known demands and supplies, the manufacturer minimizes the distribution costs from the selected farmers to the production facilities. We formulate this problem as a Stackelberg game with asymmetric information, where the manufacturer is the leader and the farmers are the followers. The manufacturer‚Äôs problem is a two-stage stochastic planning program for which we develop two solution approaches. We have applied our model to problem instances anchored on data from a large manufacturer of potato chips contracting with thousands of small farmers in India. We report on the performance of the solution methods compared with a lower bound based on the Lagrangean dual of the problem and show that the optimality gap is below 1%, for problem instances with 1,000 potential farmers. We also show how our model can be used to gain various managerial insights. As an example, when constructing the contract menu endogenously, often a small number of contract options suffices, depending on the degree of heterogeneity among the farmer pool. Thus, relatively simple menus often suffice.</jats:p><jats:p>The online appendices are available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2018.0735 .</jats:p><jats:p>This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Issue on Value Chain Innovations in Developing Economies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Iron (Fe) delivery by the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) through ice shelf and iceberg melting enhances primary productivity in the largely iron-limited Southern Ocean (SO). To explore this fertilization capacity, we implemented a simple representation of the AIS iron source in the global ocean biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES. We evaluated the response of Fe, surface chlorophyll, primary production and carbon export to the magnitude and hypothesized vertical distributions of the AIS Fe fluxes. Surface Fe and chlorophyll concentrations are increased up to 25‚Äâ% and 12‚Äâ%, respectively, over the whole SO. The AIS Fe delivery is found to have a relatively modest impact on SO primary production and C export which are increased by 0.063‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.036‚ÄâPgC‚Äâyr‚àí1 and 0.028‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.016‚ÄâPgC‚Äâyr‚àí1, respectively. However, in highly fertilized areas, primary production and C export can be increased by up to 30‚Äâ% and 42‚Äâ%, respectively. Icebergs are predicted to have a much larger impact on Fe, surface chlorophyll and primary productivity than ice shelves in the SO. The response of surface Fe and chlorophyll is maximum in the Atlantic sector, northeast of the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, and along the East Antarctic coast. The iceberg Fe delivery below the mixed layer may, depending on its assumed vertical distribution, fuel a non-negligible subsurface reservoir of Fe. The Fe supply is effective all year round and seasonal variations in iceberg melting have regional impacts which are almost negligible for annual-mean primary productivity and C export at the scale of the SO.\n                        </jats:p>"

Although several classes of primary afferent fibers terminate or decussate in this area, little is known about organization and functional significance of the afferent supply of lamina X neurons. Using the hemisected ex vivo spinal cord preparation, we show that virtually all lamina X neurons receive primary afferent inputs, which are predominantly mediated by the high-threshold AŒ¥- fibers and C-fibers. In two-thirds of the neurons tested, the inputs were monosynaptic, implying a direct targeting of the population of lamina X neurons by the primary nociceptors. Beside the excitatory inputs, 48% of the neurons also received polysynaptic inhibitory inputs. A complex pattern of interactions between the excitatory and inhibitory components determined the output properties of the neurons, one-third of which fired spikes in response to the nociceptive dorsal root stimulation. In this respect, the spinal gray matter region around the central canal is similar to the superficial dorsal horn, the major spinal nociceptive processing area. We conclude that lamina X neurons integrate direct and indirect inputs from several types of thin primary afferent fibers and play an important role in nociception.</jats:p>",

Replacing of old boilers with these boilers within Ukraine will provide an economic effect of about 100 thousand tons of fuel equivalent per year. NOx reduction will be up to 35%;&#x0D;\n- The new temperature mode for heating networks 115/70 o–° has been developed, which provides the amount of heat that is adequate to the needs of consumers, and is appropriate for use in cities of the country from an economic point of view. However, the implementation of such reduced temperature mode requires a corresponding change in the general requirements when issuing \"Technical Specifications\" for connection to district heating systems, necessitates changes in the temperature mode values in other documents, for example the general plan of the city, as well as the possible need to change the calculated heat loads in concluded contracts for heat supply to consumers. ¬†Nevertheless, the correction of temperature modes of cities should be considered as one of the possible measures to improve the energy efficiency of heat supply systems;&#x0D;\n- The expediency of partial replacement of natural gas in the municipal heat supply systems of large cities of Ukraine with municipal solid waste (MSW) has been proved. The ways of improving the efficiency of mixed MSW combustion in conditions of country, including the extraction of \"wet\" biowaste from the total mass of mixed MSW with using a separate collection. are determined;&#x0D;\n- To achieve compliance with the new more stringent European environmental standards, the highly efficient devices for cleaning combustion products from particulate matter and sulfur oxides have been developed. The efficiency of dust removal in centrifugal filters is 90...98%, in cyclone dust collectors - 90...93%. Desulfurization efficiency is up to 50%.</jats:p>"

Growing too rapidly can sacrifice financial soundness, causing a business to effectively grow broke. The objective of this study is to examine whether or not U.S. grain marketing and farm supply cooperatives are able to manage their recent growth. To do so, we apply the sustainable growth rate (SGR) and sustainable growth challenge (SGC) metrics to a unique panel data set of United States cooperatives. Examining the SGRs for these cooperatives suggests that positive net profit margins are key to positive growth. When actual growth exceeds sustainable growth, most cooperatives are able to rapidly alleviate this difference through increasing leverage or operational efficiency. However, some cooperatives face more persistent growth challenges and are thus the most at risk of growing broke. Large cooperatives and cooperatives more dependent on farm supply sales rely heavily on leverage for managing growth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last several decades, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) reverse supply chain management has increasingly gained more attention due to the development of an environmental awareness, the rapid raise of e-wasted products and the EU regulations. In particular, although the new EU WEEE collection target has not been reached by many EU countries, several studies show that an optimized WEEE wastes management processes could represent a relevant way to achieve economic, environmental and social benefits expected by the adoption of circular economy approaches. According to this, the paper aims to evaluate the extent to which the current Italian organization of the WEEE management system and the related legislation are able to support the achievement of the targets defined by EU with a specific focus on the collection centers (CCs) which play a key role being the initial point of the WEEE reverse logistic cycle. An illustrative analysis based on the transition probability matrix regarding both the e-waste collecting performance and the distribution of collecting centers in the Italian provinces is illustrated. Furthermore, we have analyzed the presence of a correlation between the WEEE collection rate and the presence of the CCs in different provinces in order to better comprehend the role that can play both the investments in CC system and other soft measures in achieving the WEEE collection targets. Results show that the current Italian organization of the WEEE management system and the related legislations are not so effective in supporting the achievement of EU WEEE collection targets at the national level, although some geographical areas and provinces outperform the EU targets.</jats:p>"

Integration may be described as any activity, or group of activities, concerning interaction and collaboration, in which individuals, and or organizations, work together in cooperative ways, to achieve mutually acceptable outcomes. Consistent with this notion, this paper proposes a unique, innovative, comprehensive, multidimensional environmental social governance (ESG) sustainability framework to inform on the relationships among integration concepts, ESG sustainability initiatives, distinct management processes, and key supply chain members. Using stakeholder theory as the underlying referent theoretical base, this manuscript informs on the alignment and integration of sustainability reporting and financial reporting to help researchers and practitioners overcome many of the shortcomings of current sustainability frameworks, as well as enable companies, which do not yet have an established sustainability strategy, to define potential initiatives and interventions towards sustainability.</jats:p>",

Ecosystems experience fluctuations in resource supply on a range of timescales, but we have a poor understanding of how multiple frequencies of resource supply affect the maintenance of diversity and community structure. Here we explore this question using a model of phytoplankton competition for a limiting nutrient, parameterized using empirical tradeoffs between rapid growth, nutrient storage capacity and nutrient uptake affinity. Compared to a single frequency of nutrient supply, we find that multiple frequencies of nutrient supply increase functional diversity, by permitting the coexistence of strategies adapted to different frequencies of supply. Species richness is also promoted by multiple modes of nutrient supply, but not as consistently as functional diversity. Although this model is parameterized for phytoplankton, the fundamental dynamics and tradeoffs likely occur in a variety of ecosystems. Our results suggest that the spectrum of temporal variation driving communities should be further investigated in the context of the maintenance of diversity and the functional composition of communities under different environmental regimes.</jats:p>",

Groundwater is becoming an increasingly attractive and viable option as a supplementary water source, but its economic background must be understood before implementation. Employing the basic frameworks of the British and US Geological Surveys, we examined the economic viability of groundwater monitoring networks in South Korea, based on an analytic hierarchy process (AHP), pairwise comparison, and cost‚Äìbenefit analysis. The total cost including installation, maintenance and servicing over the next 50 years is estimated to be US$ 0.79 billion, while the benefits are valued at US$ 2.31 billion. The monitoring network should provide benefits worth 292% of the costs, with the monitoring project thus clearly being economically viable. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the monitoring project is still economical, even if the network installation schedule is delayed slightly. As this study combines both economic and scientific perspectives, it might provide a concrete economic background for implementing groundwater utilization projects elsewhere.</jats:p>"

The traditional way of using optimization methods, e.g. stochastic meta-heuristic algorithms, have come along with various constraints to explore an optimum solution. In this study, a newly developed meta-heuristic algorithm called the Simple Benchmarking Algorithm (SBA) is used to optimize pipe size. A modified approach with SBA having interfaces with the EPANET 2.0 hydraulic simulation model is used to compute the minimum cost of the two-loop network and the Hanoi benchmark WDN. Results show that SBA is more efficient in obtaining the least possible cost with fast convergence.</jats:p>",

We find that when the supplier's capacity is either too low (below the lower threshold) or too high (above the higher threshold), there is no excess procurement as compared to the case when supplier has infinite capacity.

Neglecting dynamic reactions and not considering the possible chemical decay of most of the contaminants leads to an overestimation of the exposed population. Therefore, unlike the available event detection models, this study considers the interrelated change of several water-quality parameters such as free chlorine concentration, pH, alkalinity, and total organic carbon (TOC) resulting from the pollutants blending. In fact, starting from regular WDS monitoring, the baseline thresholds for each of the mentioned parameters are established; then, significant deviations from the baseline are used as indication for contaminations. For this reason, the purpose of the research was to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based smart monitoring system that will effectively enable water operators to ensure a quasi real-time quality control for early chemical and/or bio-contamination detection and preemptive risk management. Advanced pattern recognizers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and innovative sensing technology solutions, such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have been used for this purpose, identifying the anomalies and the severity-level assessment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: Supply chain has become an essential element for any organization but risks are the major obstacles in achieving the performance even it can disrupt not only the organization but a whole system. Thus it is compulsory to manage the risks efficiently and effectively. Risk cannot be managed until properly identified, there are numerous studies on risk identification, after comprehensive literature, it has been revealed that the study that identifies overall supply chain risk is scaring. The manufacturing sector of any country is considered as the backbone of any economy, in Malaysia it is the second largest sector in economic contribution and highest in productivity level. The aim of this study is to provide a reliable tool to assess the overall supply chain risks of Malaysian manufacturing through a systematic process.Design/methodology/approach: A detail literature review has been done for categorization of overall supply chain risk sources. Then an instrument has been developed from a pool of items. The questionnaire was purified through pretesting, pilot testing (by the exploratory view) and reliability and validity tests. The data were collected by email from Federation of Malaysian Malaysia (FMM-2017) through systemic probability sampling. Total 132 final responses have been considered for exploratory factor analysis through SPSS 23.Findings: The finding of this study revealed that overall supply chain risks can be categories into seven constructs that are supply side risks, process side risks, demand side risks, logistic side risks, collaboration side risks and environment side risks and the final questionnaire is consisting of 57 items.Research limitations/implications: This study covered tier 1 members of the supply chain. Secondly, the supply chain of manufacturing organizations only has been considered.Practical implications: This study will help the managers to understand what kind of risk sources they can face and which type of risks under these risk sources they should consider while decision making.Originality/value: This article will justify the need for Malaysian manufacturing by providing a validated and reliable instrument for the identification and assessment of their risks under major supply chain risk sources.¬†</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dairy business is characterized by generally low profit margins due to a very competitive market environment. Dairy farmers and milk processing companies, therefore, constantly seek to optimize their technical production processes in pursuit of further cost reductions, e.g. by means of improving herd management, milking and feeding practices. In addition, innovative business strategies may create competitive advantage in response to market conditions. While vertical coordination or even integration have been established successfully in most sectors of animal husbandry including poultry, pork and beef production, this strategy is mostly limited to supplying contracts and input support within the dairy sector. Various organizational models of increasing vertical coordination in dairy production exist, with great variation in terms of operational performance and profitability. Using the example of 3B Agro LTDA‚Äôs dairy production located in the municipality of Toledo, Brazil, the case study illustrates the significant efficiency potential that currently exists in the Brazilian dairy supply chain. The prevalence of short-term contractual commitments and an influential role of independent intermediaries give room to considerable opportunism of market participants, various principal-agent problems and severe issues regarding milk quality. The case study illustrates that, vertical coordination can increase control and efficiency along the supply chain. It also points out the importance of strong managerial competencies and capabilities of dairy farm managers in order to exploit fully the efficiency potential provided by vertical coordination.</jats:p>",

We formulate the stochastic differential game-theoretic models and resolve the feedback Stackelberg equilibriums without and with fairness concern. We also derive the evolutionary paths of the stochastic return rate and the value functions of the supply chain members under the optimal control strategies. We find that the feedback equilibrium exists only under a specific condition, and the expectation and variance of the return rate both approach the stable state for a specific closed-loop supply chain system. We further discussed the impact of fairness concerns on the supply chain system. The manufacturer would shift profit to the retailer by lowering the wholesale price, and the stable expected return rate will be lower in the supply chain with fairness concerns, as the third party will have less incentive to collect used products, considering unfairness. The manufacturer should set a higher transfer subsidy to incentivize the third party to collect when the third party is concerned with fairness.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, researchers and practitioners have increasingly paid attention to food waste, which is seen as highly unethical given its negative environmental and societal implications. Waste recovery is dependent on the creation of connections along the supply chain, so that actors with goods at risk of becoming waste can transfer them to those who may be able to¬†use them as inputs or for their own consumption. Such waste recovery is, however, often hampered by what we call ‚Äòcircularity holes‚Äô, i.e., missing linkages between waste generators and potential receivers. A new type of actor, the digital platform organization, has recently taken on a brokerage function to bridge circularity holes, particularly in the food supply chain. Yet, extant literature has overlooked this novel type of brokerage that exploits digital technology for the transfer and recovery of discarded resources between supply chain actors. Our study investigates this actor, conceptualized as a ‚Äòcircularity broker‚Äô, and thus unites network research and circular supply chain research. Focusing on the food supply chain, we adopt an interpretive inductive theory-building approach to uncover how platform organizations foster the recovery of waste by bridging circularity holes. We identify and explicate six brokerage roles, i.e., connecting, informing, protecting, mobilizing, integrating and measuring, and discuss them in relation to extant literature, highlighting novelties compared to earlier studies. The final section reflects on contributions, implications, limitations and areas for further research.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, buyers sometimes struggle to persuade suppliers to adopt SCF quickly. To craft more effective supplier onboarding strategies, buyers need to know which suppliers are likely to adopt SCF faster. Drawing on the theoretical perspective on organizational motivation, we develop a research framework that uncovers the key drivers of supplier adoption speed. Our framework combines efficiency motive drivers, identified by recent analytical studies on SCF, with legitimacy motive drivers, which stem from a supplier's institutional environment and are new to the SCF literature. We test our hypotheses using a unique data set from a leading financial technology platform provider. We find that suppliers with more limited access to financing tend to adopt SCF faster. In addition, suppliers adopt SCF faster if such adoption is associated with more pronounced reductions in their financing costs. Legitimacy motive drivers also impact supplier adoption speed. Specifically, our results suggest that mimetic and normative pressures accelerate the speed at which suppliers adopt SCF, while coercive pressures seem to have such an effect only when the buyer's stakes are high.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Managers introducing new innovative technological products frequently face the dual task of managing both revenues and profits. This task is made challenging in part because of the tendency of new technologies to traverse a sequentially downward path of gradually lowering costs and prices, which limits their initial availability and affordability, crimping market coverage and revenues. Academic/practical relevance: We focus on the product management challenge of juggling revenues and profits, show how it is amplified in a supply chain, and propose a new degree of freedom in a supply chain, namely innovation investment anchoring, that offers product managers and their firms the ability to expand market coverage and improve both revenues and profits. Methodology: We adopt a sequential game theory approach to analyze the investment anchor decision for various objectives from investments in innovation to market coverage to profit. Results: We find that the investment anchoring approach can lead to greater investments in innovation, revenues, and profits. We also compare the investment anchoring for two types of innovation, product quality improvement and cost reduction, and show that the investment anchoring is more effective for product quality improvement. Managerial implications: Our findings have subtle but important implications for firms launching innovative products and aspiring to expand product sales and profits. Specifically, innovating firms in a supply chain by broadening the quest for an investment anchor and offering them incentives to invest as well as fine tuning the level of innovation investment with the market context can make innovation more inclusive, alleviate supply chain distortions, and streamline revenues and profits. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2018.0746 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Issue on Value Chain Innovations in Developing Economies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is now widely accepted that a retailer‚Äôs use of strategic inventory can mitigate double marginalization and improve the coordination of a supply chain, potentially benefiting both the downstream retailer and an upstream manufacturer. However, this conclusion has typically been based on the assumption that the manufacturer can observe the retailer‚Äôs level of inventory before making wholesale pricing decisions. In reality, there are many situations in which neither the retailer‚Äôs sales nor inventory are observable to the manufacturer, effectively concealing the action taken by the retailer. We investigate the implications of such a lack of observability on the use of strategic inventory in a supply chain consisting of a single retailer and a single manufacturer. We find that the manufacturer‚Äôs inability to observe inventory has significant implications for the amount of inventory and the range of holding cost for which it is held in equilibrium. In addition, we find that, in the absence of any form of uncertainty, which the manufacturer could benefit from responding to, he may prefer not to observe the retailer‚Äôs inventory. On the other hand, the retailer‚Äôs willingness to make her inventory visible depends on the holding cost. </jats:p><jats:p> The electronic companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2018.3033 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Gad Allon, operations management. </jats:p>",

The proposed converter comprises one bidirectional port for a battery and several unidirectional input power ports. Battery can be charged by input sources, discharged into load or bypassed while charging/discharging durations are independent of switching duty ratios for input sources. In the presented BI‚ÄêMISUC, higher voltage gains with lower duty ratios are achieved not only by increasing the number of inputs but also using the switched inductor (SI) modules. It therefore enables BI‚ÄêMISUC to be used for a wide range of applications from low to high voltage/power. Furthermore, input sources can be operated individually or simultaneously to supply load energy at the desired output voltage. The converter operation is described for three scenarios (i.e. no battery, battery charging and discharging). A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control is also used to regulate the output voltage and output power of input sources at the desired references for different scenarios. Finally, the performance of the BI‚ÄêMISUC is validated by simulations and experimental results.</jats:p>",

The presented scheme displays the virtues of a finite-time convergence control (FTCC) and a discrete grey prediction model (DGPM). The FTCC, derived from a terminal sliding-mode (TSM) design principle, can produce the finite system-state convergence time and evade the singularity. It is noteworthy that the chattering/steady-state error around the FTCC may occur because of the overestimated or underestimated uncertainty bound. The DGPM with the bound estimate ability is integrated into the FTCC to cope with internal parameter variations and external load disturbances. The less chattering and steady-state error can be obtained, providing more robust performance in the AC power supply. The combination of the FTCC and the DGPM extends the standard TSM design for the purpose of faster singularity-free convergence, as well as introducing the grey modeling method in the case of a more exact uncertainty estimate. The modified control technology has a high-precision tracking performance and a fast convergent speed. Simulated and experimental results point out that the modified control technology can effectuate low total harmonic distortion (THD) and fast dynamic response in the presence of rectifier loads and abrupt step load changes.</jats:p>"

Specifically, key healthcare supply chain processes include product recalls, monitoring of product supply shortages, expiration, and counterfeits. Implementing and executing these processes in a trusted, secure, efficient, globally accessible and traceable manner is challenging due to the fragmented nature of the healthcare supply chain, which is prone to systemic errors and redundant efforts that may compromise patient safety and impact health outcomes adversely. Blockchain, combined with the Internet of things (IoT), is an emerging technology that can offer a practical solution to these challenges. Accordingly, IoT blockchain offers a superior way to track and trace products via a peer-to-peer distributed, secure, and shared ledger of the blockchain network. This article highlights key challenges related to healthcare supply chains, and illustrates how IoT blockchain technologies can play a role in overcoming these challenges now and in the near future.</jats:p>",

However, the increase in the number of tourists does not correlate with the increase in the production of total electricity. Considering the constant growth of economic activity and increased number of residents, the analyzed data show that the increase in the number of tourists actually has a negative impact on the security of energy supply. In this paper, the authors analyze the available data and point to the need for urgent planning of the security of energy supply, bearing in mind that the results indicate a huge increase in electricity consumption directly caused by the growth of consumers, where the growing number of tourists actually represents a variable that is itself a risk to the security of supply</jats:p>"

Drought events for 2011‚Äì2040, 2041‚Äì2070, and 2071‚Äì2100 were analyzed based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and were compared with the adopted baseline period (1976‚Äì2005). The SPI and SPEI were calculated using the precipitation and temperatures obtained from the second-generation Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5 as optimistic and pessimistic scenarios respectively. The results of SPI analyses revealed that under RCP 2.6 the frequency of droughts is almost constant while under RCP 8.5 drought frequency increased especially in the period 2071‚Äì2100. The calculated SEPI under both scenarios and during all future periods predict that the frequency and duration of droughts will increase. Generally, the difference between the SPI and SPEI is related to the input to each index. SPI is solely based on precipitation while the SPEI accounts for both precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET). Under global warming and changing climate, the significant role of PET was highlighted. It was concluded that the SPEI outperformed the SPI for drought studies under a changing climate.</jats:p>",

To empirically study and cope with deep uncertainty and dynamic complexity in a CLSC context, a conceptual framework and related methodological toolbox are developed, together called the ‚Äòclosed-loop integration: collective keystones methodology‚Äô (hereinafter CLICK methodology). The conceptual framework entails six maturity stages, which have been defined based on the well-known capability maturity framework and the concept of double-loop learning.

Several studies have demonstrated, the positive and the significant relationship between supply chain integration and firm performance. Other studies have focused on the factors that affect this relationship. Supply chain complexity is a contingency factor that affects this relationship. Based on the literature review and through a confrontational approach, the authors propose a conceptual model to show how the complexity of supply chain affects the benefit of integration. Propositions are posited with suggestions for further research. Authors suggest that there are three dimensions of supply chain complexity which moderate the effect of supply chain integration on the firm performance: upstream, internal and downstream complexity; that there is a taxonomy of firm's group based on their level of each dimension of complexity and the effect of integration differs from one group to another.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With an increasingly open global economy and advanced technologies, some third-party logistics providers (3PLs), such as Eternal Asia, have emerged as supply chain orchestrators, linking buyers with manufacturers worldwide. In addition to their traditional transportation services, these orchestrators provide procurement and financial assistance to buyers in the supply network, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries. Oftentimes, the 3PLs can obtain payment delay arrangements from the financially stronger manufacturers, which in turn can be partially extended to the SME buyers, alleviating their high costs of capital. To illustrate the efficiency improvements of the aforementioned practice, we use a model to explicitly capture the cash-flow dynamics in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a buyer, and a 3PL firm and explore the conditions under which this innovation benefits all parties in the supply chain so that the business model is sustainable. We characterize these conditions and show that the supply chain profit can be higher under leadership by the 3PL than by the manufacturer. The intermediary role of the 3PL is crucial, in that its benefit may vanish if the manufacturer chooses to directly grant payment delay to the buyers. We demonstrate that the benefit is more likely to occur with more buyers. We further identify the unique Nash bargaining solution for the transportation time and the payment delay grace period. </jats:p><jats:p> The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/msom.2017.0667 . </jats:p><jats:p> This paper has been accepted for the Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management Special Issue on Value Chain Innovations in Developing Economies. </jats:p>",

The primary data were collected from the survey of six households providing vegetable production in the region. 40 households growing safe vegetables (20 households per ward), 40 households growing vegetables normally (20 households per ward), 10 traders purchasing processed products to provide safe vegetables for supermarkets, 5 retailers, and 10 consumers are involved in the study. The results show that Huong Tra Town is one of the main areas for growing vegetables in Thua Thien Hue province, which mainly provides safe vegetables for Hue City and neighbouring provinces. Safe vegetable products are mainly supplied for the markets in the province, especially supermarkets, restaurants, hotels and clean vegetable shops in Huong Tra Town and Hue City. In this supply chain, safe vegetable households play an important role when creating the greatest added-value. However, their real income is low due to facing the highest risks. Other actors in this supply chain receive higher benefits and facing lower risks than the producers. Households‚Äô income depends mainly on the price and weather conditions.Keywords: safe vegetables, supply chain, Huong Tra Town</jats:p>"

Using a collaborative mixed‚Äêmethods research with an international humanitarian organization, this paper sheds light on the causes of unsustainable operations in HSCs and investigates the impact of regional hubs on the environmental sustainability. First, an in‚Äêdepth focus group was conducted involving the organization's employees and the research team to identify the main causes contributing to unsustainable HSC in the organization. Five categories of causes were identified, namely, <jats:italic>supply chain configuration (SCC)</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>transportation</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>donors</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>material and waste</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>humanitarian specificities</jats:italic>. Then, based on respondents' prioritization, SCC was selected as the most important category. Carbon footprinting for three SCC scenarios was conducted: the current SCC and two conceptual SCC with two hubs in East and West Africa with different replenishment windows. The results reveal that the SCCs with hubs outperform the current SCC in terms of carbon footprint. Finally, the challenges of implementing the conceptual SCCs and possible solutions to address them were discussed through follow‚Äêup individual interviews.</jats:p>",

Although both concepts consider the interactions between humans and the environment, spatial relationships between ESs and sustainability have been rarely addressed. Therefore, this study aims at analyzing spatial congruencies and mismatches between ESs and sustainability in the greater Alpine region. Using hot spot and overlap analyses, we overlaid maps of supply, demand and flow of eight key ESs with the spatial distribution of sustainability based on 24 indicators. Our results reveal that, in most cases, supply of and demand for ESs are greatly dislocated. These mismatches are reflected also in the spatial distribution of sustainability. In contrast to ES demand hot spots, supply hot spots are generally characterized by high sustainability levels, especially in relation to the environment. However, due to discrepancies in the social and economic dimensions, it cannot be assumed that ES supply hot spots always correspond to high sustainability. Hence, using ES indicators for measuring sustainability provides rather limited insights. We conclude that both concepts should be applied in a complementary way to maximize ecological, social and economic benefits in land management and planning processes.</jats:p>"

Oil supply system plays a pivotal role in high efficiency and good reliability of a variable speed rotary compressor. This paper presents an investigation of the effect of inlet structures on the performance of oil supply system of a variable speed rotary compressor by means of numerical simulation and experiment. The method of volume of fluid (VOF) has been employed in the simulation model and a novel experimental test rig is designed to perform oil flow rate measurements in order to validate the simulated results. With the help of numerical simulation, oil flow patterns in oil pump can be visualized and oil supply rate under different working conditions can be predicted. Good agreement between the simulated oil flow rates and the experimental data has been achieved. The results indicate that oil supply rate increases with an increase in oil level height, oil viscosity as well as the rotating speed. Vertical oil suction pipe with a tapered port contributes to oil pumping in comparison with a straight suction pipe and no suction pipe. Additionally, the minimum rotational speed at which oil starts to flow out of the oil pump increases with the oil inlet diameter and the increment of oil inlet diameter allows the improvement oil pumping performance at a high rotating speed.</jats:p>",

Dampers sealed with piston rings (PR), common in aircraft engines, are proven to boost damping generation, reduce lubricant flow demand, and prevent air ingestion. This paper presents the estimation of force coefficients in a short length SFD, PR sealed, and supplied with a light lubricant at two feed pressures, Pin-1 ‚àº 0.69 barg and Pin-2 ‚àº 2.76 barg, i.e., low and high. Two pairs of PRs are installed in the test SFD, one set has flow conductance CS1 = 0.56 LPM/bar, whereas the other pair has CS2 = 0.89 LPM/bar. The second set leaks more as it has a larger slit gap. Dynamic load tests show that both dampers, having seal flow conductances differing by 60%, produce damping and added mass coefficients of similar magnitude, differing by at most 20%. Other experiments quantify the effect of lubricant supply pressure, Pin-1 and Pin-2, on the dynamic film pressure and force coefficients of the PR-SFD. The damper configuration with CS1 and operating with the high Pin-2 shows ‚àº20% more damping and added mass coefficients compared with test results for the damper supplied with Pin-1. Film pressure measurements show that the air ingestion and oil vapor cavitation coexist for operation at the low Pin-1. Computational predictions accounting for the feed holes in the physical model agree with the experimental coefficients. On the other hand, predictions from classical formulas for an idealized damper geometry, fully sealed at its ends, largely overpredict the measured force coefficients.</jats:p>",

Likewise, the importance of concentrating on FLW produced within specific food supply chains has emerged as an effective starting point for quantifying the overall amount of wastage produced, emphasizing possible prevention actions as well as re-using and valorising waste. From this perspective, our study focuses on the tomato-sauce supply chain with a threefold aim. Firstly, to quantify the amount of FLW generated along the tomato-sauce supply chain from cultivation to retail; secondly, to understand the most important related causes; and thirdly, to assess if and to what extent FLW can be reused according to the Circular Economy (CE) approach. By adopting the Food Loss and Waste Accounting and Reporting Standard, the analyses focused on the production of the Barilla Tomato and Basil sauce in Italy, as well as the related inventory. It was revealed that this supply chain can be considered an example of a true circular economy, in which almost nothing is lost because more than 85% of the total FLW are valorized into alternative sectors or activities.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the article is to determine the influence of beyond-design modes on the functioning of the entire steam supply system. Beyond-design modes of industrial steam supply pose a serious problem for all elements of the system: they make it difficult to fully load the turbines, lead to high excess losses of heat and coolant, and also lead to disruption in technological processes. Analysis of statistical data on reduction of industrial steam extraction has been carried out, archived data on heat supply and consumption have been processed and analyzed over the period from 2007 to 2017. A methodological error is found in the accounting of thermal energy and coolant by variable pressure drop flowmeters designed to handle superheated and dry steam. Calculation of heat network quality indicators is carried out, maximum permissible lengths of steam pipeline sections are determined, enabling to transport superheated steam to consumer regardless of the load reduction. The influence of the extent of wear of insulation and the diameter of the pipeline on the change in the aggregate state of the coolant has been analyzed, and the maximum load for steam networks has been found as being 30% of the designed one. It has been established that, with industrial extraction decreased, the CHPP is forced to disengage the turbine from operation, since a load drop of more than 50% brings the turbine to the condensation mode and reduces the technical and economic performance of the CHPP to the threshold permissible values. The obtained results enable to draw a conclusion that such a problem as beyond-design modes, especially in steam supply systems, requires an integrated approach, since the influence on an individual element in isolation from the system leads to a change in the performance of the remaining elements.</jats:p>"

This research considered groups of offshore wind turbines as energy hubs to provide electricity to nearby offshore platforms, including the evaluation of energy deficits caused by wind wakes. The proposed research idea allows platforms to improve energy efficiency, save fuel, reduce air pollution, and increase income by selling surplus energy. The energy output of these wind turbines was estimated considering wake effects. Diverse layouts were modeled applying meteorological and geographical data integrated with wind wake models to solve a realistic wind farm layout optimization problem. The research created a methodology to optimize a group of offshore wind turbines performance in the Gulf of Mexico, minimizing negative interference while maximizing power output. Results indicated that an important number of locations of offshore oil and gas platforms were able to provide adequate levels of wind energy. Variable wind directions cause changes on the behavior of the turbulent wakes. Therefore, the layout of wind turbines needs to be optimized to minimize negative interaction while maximizing power output under different wind conditions. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the feasibility of installing, in particular optimal locations, wind farms that would simultaneously serve several offshore platforms in close proximity (as hubs) while the system remains connected to the onshore grid.</jats:p>",

Consequently, firms need to develop upstream visibility to exercise control over their supply chains. An emerging body of work has recognized the importance of supply chain visibility and has examined it using analytical models, behavioral methods, and case studies. Still, large‚Äêsample empirical evidence on the benefits of supply chain visibility remains elusive. We seek to bridge this gap by examining conflict minerals disclosures (mandated by the 2010 Dodd‚ÄêFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) and financial reports to evaluate whether firms with greater visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains achieve improved operating and market performance. We use the data from conflict minerals disclosures (Form SD) to distinguish between firms that have high or low visibility into their conflict minerals sources. Then, we use event study methods to analyze differences in operating and market performance between firms with high visibility and firms with low visibility. We find that firms with high visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains achieve higher profitability than comparable firms with less visibility. In addition, we find that firms with high visibility into their conflict minerals supply chains realize improved sales performance and stock market valuations. Our results are relevant to managers because they show that firms can attain operational and market benefits by improving visibility in their supply chains.</jats:p>",

They are also less aware in the regular repair and maintenance of water supply systems. Furthermore, the expectation of community is always financial support from local body and donor agency. The governance part of water user‚Äôs committee was also found unsatisfactory.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we consider a two-period closed-loop supply chain which is comprised of a single manufacturer and a single retailer for trading a single product. At the retailer, the demand in the first period depends on the selling price, product quality and refund price, whereas in the second period, it depends on the selling price and the product quality. The retailer sets the selling prices with variable markups on the wholesale prices of the manufacturer and offers a return policy (immediate return and used product return) limited to the first period only. The immediate return is dependent on the refund price and the product quality, and the amount of returned used items is a fraction of the first period‚Äôs demand. The retailer sends the returned items to the manufacturer who reproduces/repairs those items and sells in the second period. We assume that the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader and the retailer as the follower. We study the impacts of return policy, product quality and pricing strategy on the optimal decisions under two decision strategies (I and II). In the decision strategy I, both the players optimize their total profits over the entire selling season, whereas in the decision strategy II, they optimize each period‚Äôs profit sequentially. With the help of a numerical example we explore that the decision strategy I gives better result than the decision strategy II in terms of all decision variables except the product quality. We also investigate the effects of key model-parameters on the optimal decisions.</jats:p>",

Circular economy in agriculture deals with the production of agricultural commodities making an efficient use of resources and avoiding unnecessary waste and carbon emission generation. Disruptions in the production and supply of critical agricultural products can have serious negative repercussions for firms and consumers of the food supply chain. In recent decades, disruptions generated by natural disasters such as hurricanes, thunderstorms and floods have greatly impacted social communities and industrial sectors. Supply chain risks approaches are seen to contribute key elements to address the impacts of natural disaster toward the implementation of circular economy in agriculture, helping to prevent collapses in the production and supply of food. The purpose of this paper is to study and identify flood risk drivers and their effects on the sustainability of an agriculture supply chain in connection with a circular economy strategy. By using an extended Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis method combined with a multi-criteria decision analysis, the most essential flood drivers with a degree of importance are reported here. Then, the authors propose an Evaluation of Data based on average ASsessment method, to rank different agricultural projects that pretend to mitigate the flood risks and its impacts on crop areas. The application of this research lies within the framework of a real agricultural project founded by the European Commission Scientific Section, called RUC-APS.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The authors use management science-based tools to address circular economy in agriculture.

An effective selection of vendors is heavily responsible for the success of any organization. Vendor selection problem (VSP) reflects a more practical view when the decision makers involved in the problem are present on different levels. Moreover, vendor selection consists of various random parameters to be dealt with in real life. The purpose of this paper is to present a decentralized bi-level VSP where demand and supply are normal random variables and objectives are fuzzy in nature. Decision makers are present at two levels and are called as leader and follower. As the next purpose, this paper extends and presents a solution approach for fuzzy bi-level multi-objective decision-making model with stochastic constraints. Different scenarios have been developed within a real-life case study based on different sets of controlling factors under the control of leader.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study uses chance-constrained programming and fuzzy set theory to generate the results. Stochastic constraints are converted into deterministic constraints using chance-constrained programming. Decision variables in the bi-level VSP are partitioned between the two levels and considered as controlling factors. Membership functions based on fuzzy set theory are created for the goals and controlling factors and are used to obtain the overall satisfactory solutions. The model is tested on a real-life case study of a textile industry and different scenarios are constructed based on the choice of leader‚Äôs controlling factors.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Results showed that the approach is quite helpful as it generates efficient results producing a good level of satisfaction for the decision makers of both the levels. Results showed that on choosing the vendors that are associated with worst values in terms of associated costs, vendor ratings and quota flexibilities as controlling factors by the leaders, the level of satisfaction achieved is highest. The level of satisfaction of solution is lowest for the scenario when the leader chooses to control the decision variables associated with vendors that are profiled with minimum vendor ratings. Results also showed that higher availability of materials and budget with vendors proved helpful in obtaining quota allocations. Different scenarios generate different results along with different values of satisfaction degrees and objective values which shows the flexible feature of the approach based on leader‚Äôs choice of controlling factors. Numerical results showed that the leader‚Äôs control can be effectively incorporated maintaining satisfaction levels of the followers under various scenarios or conditions.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The paper makes a certain contribution toward the study of vendor selection existing in a hierarchical manner under uncertain environment. A wide set of data of different factors is needed which can be seen as a limitation when the available time is short for the supplier selection process.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>VSP which is generally adopted by most of the large organizations is characterized with hierarchical decision making. Moreover, dealing with the real-life concern, the data available for some of the parameters are not complete, representing an uncertainty of parameters. This study is quite helpful for decentralized VSP under uncertain environment to reduce the costs, improve profit margins and to create long-term relationships with selected vendors. The proposed model also provides an avenue to explore the decision making when the leader has control over some of the decision variables.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Reviewing the literature available, this is the first attempt to present a multi-objective VSP where the decision makers are at hierarchical levels considering uncertain parameters such as demand and supply as per the best knowledge of authors.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industrial applications nowadays are facing the complexity of the problem of finding an optimal energy supply composition. Heating and electricity needs vary throughout a year and need to be addressed. There is usually power available from the market, but a company has other investment options to consider, such as solar power, or utilization of local biomass. Fixed and proportional investment and operational costs must be compared to long-term cost-efficiency. The P-Graph framework is an effective tool in the design and synthesis of process networks, and is capable of showing optimal decisions. In the present work, a new P-Graph model was implemented to address the synthesis of the energy supply options of a manufacturing plant in Hungary. Compared to the original approach, a multi-periodic scheme was applied for heating and electricity demands. Also, the pelletizer and biogas plant investments are modeled in the P-Graph with a new technique that better reflects equipment capacities and flexible input ratios. The best solutions in this case study in terms of total costs are listed. It can be concluded that a long-term investment horizon is needed for the incorporation of sustainable energy sources into the system to be cost-efficient.</jats:p>"

Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer‚Äôs optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer‚Äôs optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer‚Äôs blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer‚Äôs order quantity is low, the manufacturer‚Äôs blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer‚Äôs order quantity is high, the manufacturer‚Äôs blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved. Finally, the specific numerical simulation is adopted to analyze the weighted proportion, risk aversion and the impact of blockchain technology on the supply chain, and verify the relevant conclusions.</jats:p>"

One of them is the ESSENZ method (comprehensive method to measure and assess resource efficiency of products in the context of sustainable development) developed by the authors. Due to newly available data (e.g., production statistics) the characterization factors (CFs) of the ESSENZ method were updated (based on data from the years 2011 to 2015, with focus on 2014 and 2015) and compared with the original CFs (based on data from the years 2009 to 2013, with focus on 2012 and 2013) for six of the overall eleven categories. The goal of the paper is to analyze if changes in the underlying data are adequately reflected in the CFs of ESSENZ for the considered categories. Further, the updated CFs are provided. The six categories are analyzed by comparing original and updated CFs and clustering them into four groups: declining, emerging, persistent, and non-occurring potential supply risks. Significant differences in the CFs are evaluated by analyzing changes in the underlying data as well as the steps to determine the CFs. It could be shown, that for most of the considered categories and resources changes in the underlying data are reflected adequately in the CFs.

In this study, one older city zone in Guangming new district, north-western Shenzhen, China was selected to meet the combined treatment of vehicle lane rainwater and roof rainwater, and four typical rainfall events were selected to analyze the water quantity and water quality control effect of this combined rainwater treatment system under different rainfall intensity and rainfall duration. Results showed that under the treatment of initial treatment facility and biological filtration facility, the runoff volume of vehicle lane and roof were all controlled effectively, and the discharge amount of different pollutants was also reduced effectively although initial treatment facility and biological filtration facility could not effectively decrease pollutant concentration. Therefore, this combined treatment of vehicle lane rainwater and roof rainwater can provide reference for the popularization and application of different kinds of combined rainwater treatment systems.</jats:p>",

In this study, we developed an optimal allocation model for a large complex system of water resources by considering both water supply and river ecological benefits. The water supply benefit is defined as the minimum water deficit for different water users, while the ecological benefit involves making the reservoir release as close as possible to the natural streamflow. To solve this problem, the combination of decomposition-coordination (DC) and discrete differential dynamic programming (DDDP) methods were proposed. The proposed methods first decomposed a large system with multi-objective programming into subsystems, and the optimal solution of each subsystem was accomplished by the DDDP method to solve the system efficiently. Then the subsystems‚Äô solutions were coordinated to figure out the near global optimal solution. The proposed models were tested in the Lingui and Yongfu County, Guilin City in China. Results show that the optimal reservoir release is close to the natural flow regime and there is a slight water deficit ratio in both level years. The water supply objective is more sensitive to the system model compared with the ecological objective, and the result of water allocation is optimized when the reservoir release is as close as possible to the natural flow based on the minimum water deficit. The proposed system model could facilitate sustainable water use and provide technical support for water resources management in economic development.</jats:p>"

The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design, with five replicates.&#x0D;\nPlace and Duration of Study: The experiment was carried out between October 2015 and August 2017 at Instituto Federal Baiano, Guanambi Campus, Brazil.&#x0D;\nMethodology: Productivity of green and dry matter, amount of macro and micronutrients applied in the soil by wastewater and by organic fertilizer, macro and micronutrient contents present in the cladodes tissues, and macro and micronutrient contents in the soil were evaluated. The wastewater used was collected in the stabilization pond of the campus.&#x0D;\nResults: Green matter yield was significantly higher in irrigated treatments. Regarding dry matter, its value was higher in T5 and it did not differ statistically in the others.&#x0D;\nConclusions: RDI, using common water, provided a yield of green matter 2.47 times higher than in non-irrigated treatment with the same fertilization; in the absence of organic fertilization, RDI, using wastewater, provided a yield of green matter 1.96 times higher than in non-irrigated treatment; in the absence of irrigation, organic fertilization does not provided a yield higher than in non-fertilized treatment; and the contribution of N, K, Cu, Zn and Mn only by the wastewater is not enough to sustain the crop's productivity in the long term.</jats:p>"

An optimization model with multiple objectives is proposed. In this article, a multi-objective optimization model is proposed and used to design a near-optimal reverse supply chain network that satisfies economic, environmental, and societal objectives, which are combined into one multi-objective function. An end-of-life proton-exchange membrane fuel cell battery collection in Riyadh city is the subject of the designed network. This model is found to be capable of choosing collection centers (drop-off) from a set of available centers and selecting a facility location for the remanufacturing plant. The model also serves as a tool to carry out analyses under different scenarios, as well as future changes in the factors that influence the designed reverse supply chain network, such as the hydrogen tax credit and the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions cap. The output of this research facilitates the transition from oil-dependent to renewable energy transportation by providing a solution for its end-of-life products. The output of this article is considered as preparedness plan to help countries who seek transition from oil-dependent transportation to a system that uses renewable energy. </jats:p>",

The improvement of aqueous solution coexisting with arsenite and arsenate using iron mixed porous clay pellets was investigated in batch and fixed-bed column systems. Batch studies showed that the removal rate occurred in two main phases with an equilibrium time of 52 h. The pseudo-second-order model well described the experimental data. Isotherm data were well fitted by the Langmuir‚ÄìFreundlich model. The removal efficiency was significantly reduced in alkaline solution and the presence of phosphate ions. The column study revealed that the breakthrough time and saturation time increased with lower feeding flow rate, higher bed height, and lower initial adsorbate concentration. The Thomas model provided good performance for predicting the column experimental data.</jats:p>",

We develop a two-period pricing model for the supply chain which is consisted of one manufacturer and one retailer who involve in trading a single product. The manufacturer being a Stackelberg leader, decides the wholesale price, the retailer acts as a follower and sets the selling price. As a leader, the manufacturer has two pricing options: (1) sets a common wholesale price for the entire selling season; (2) sets two different wholesale prices for the two selling periods respectively. Based on the manufacturer‚Äôs pricing options, we develop four pricing cases considering the effect of conspicuous consumption and compare the equilibrium outcomes. In addition, we study the impacts of the main parameters on the equilibrium results under different cases in the numerical study and obtain some managerial insights.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose a novel model-based flow estimation method for diaphragm-actuated globe valves based on three pressure signals, namely the valve inlet pressure, valve outlet pressure and control chamber pressure (the 3P flow estimation method). The proposed flow estimation method relies upon the accurate determination of a valve stem position based on a force-balance analysis for the diaphragm of a valve, the measured pressure differential across a valve and the flow coefficients of a valve (, ). A novel stem position estimation model for diaphragm-actuated globe valves has been formulated and experimentally validated. The non-linear parameterised valve stem position estimation model results in multiple solutions. We combine advances in signal processing with support vector machine classification to find a correct solution. We compare the proposed flow estimation method with a method that uses stem position sensor measurements of a valve and two pressure signals. A unique set of experimental data have been acquired for performance validation. We derive uncertainty bounds for the proposed flow estimation method and demonstrate its application for robust pressure control in water supply networks.</jats:p>",

The advantage of this thermal stimulation technique lies in its continuous nature, which will allow keeping the clear opening of the tubing constant. The scheme of the autonomous system for down-hole electric heating of oil is presented. A tubular or induction heater can serve as an electric heating element placed in the well. The heating element of the system can be used in the wells exploited by freeflow, gas lift and mechanized methods, while its installation does not require an overhaul. The paraffin oil saturation temperature and temperature distribution over the depth of the well were defined. The amount of heat, which must be transferred to the oil mixture in the tubing in order to ensure effective operation of the well, taking into account the dynamic state of the system, is calculated. The optimal depth of the heating element's location in the well and its power was determined. The calculation of the required power for wind-electric installation to maintain the set temperature in the wellbore was performed. Having conducted the studies, it was revealed that in order to prevent the asphalt-resin-paraffin deposits formation on the tubing walls of oil wells, it is expedient to use the in-line heater, which maintains the average steady-state temperature along the wellbore and at the wellhead above the initial crystallization point of the asphaltresin-paraffin deposits. The application of the developed electrothermal system is relevant in the conditions of formation of asphalt-resin-paraffin deposits in the wellbore shaft at the fields, which do not have a connection to the centralized power grid.<jats:bold /></jats:p>"

We conduct a systematic review of the literature of behavioral operations and supply chain management (BOSCM) across eight key operations and supply chain management journals, with publication dates through the end of June 2018. Collected articles are categorized into 12 operations contexts as well as emerging topic considerations. Key research trends, theoretical foundations, and methodological choices are discussed in each context. The results show that supply chain management, inventory management, and procurement/auctions have been the most popular operations contexts for BOSCM researchers. The results of our co‚Äêcitation analysis shows that the fundamental research areas that have informed and shaped the field include supply chain risk management, marketing, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. Based on these findings and a survey of the most prolific authors in the field, we discuss possible avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

Increasing water demand and consumption have caused the water supply, wastewater pollutant management and hydropower generation sectors to be interlinked and to reinforce each other in the system. A physical nexus across water supply, wastewater management and hydropower generation sectors for a river‚Äìreservoir system was developed based on the analytical water quality and hydropower generation equations. Considering the Jinghong hydropower reservoir, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Lancangjiang River Basin, as a case study, both the wastewater pollutant management target and water inflow from the upstream as the external and boundary conditions, were employed to establish the effects of the external and boundary conditions on the nexus. It was demonstrated that the nexus of water supply and hydropower generation sectors does not vary with the water quality indicators and its protection target, without the separation of environmental flow in hydropower generation flow. In addition, the amount of hydropower generation decreases with increasing water supply. However, the lapse rates of allowable wastewater pollutants‚Äìwater supply differ based on the water inflow and the wastewater pollutant management sectors, while the efficiency of hydropower generation and the sensitivity of allowable wastewater pollutants per amount of water supply are considered to be unrelated to the water inflow and wastewater pollutant management target conditions. The quantitative nexus developed through the proposed equation not only contributes to a more complete understanding of the mechanism of cross-connections, but also in creation of specific water protection and utilization measures, which is also the focus of the water‚Äìenergy nexus.</jats:p>"

To test the moderating effect, survey data gathered from 329 manufacturing firms in China were analysed using a moderated regression analysis. The results indicate that DDSCO has a significant positive effect on financial performance, and that capabilities for product and process innovation function as complementary assets moderating the DDSCO‚Äìperformance relationship. The findings suggest that innovation‚Äêfocused complementary assets are performance differentiators when paired with a DDSCO and explain why some firms obtain financial benefits from the development of a DDSCO while others do not. Specifically, competitive advantage from a DDSCO may not be realized unless CA‚ÄêI and potentially other complementary assets are harnessed, thus providing useful practical guidance to managers. Hence, the study provides empirical support for the complementary assets framework.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in any of the genes encoding the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase system, responsible for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). CGD is marked by invasive bacterial and fungal infections and by autoinflammation/autoimmunity, of which the exact pathophysiology remains elusive. Contributing factors include decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired apoptotic neutrophil clearance, increased proinflammatory protein expression and reduced ROS-mediated inflammasome dampening. We have explored a fundamentally different potential mechanism: it has been reported that macrophage-mediated induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) depends on ROS production. We have investigated whether numerical or functional deficiencies exist in Tregs of CGD patients. As the prevalence of autoinflammation/autoimmunity differs between CGD subtypes, we have also investigated Tregs from gp91phox-, p47phox- and p40phox-deficient CGD patients separately. Results show that Treg numbers and suppressive capacities are not different in CGD patients compared to healthy controls, with the exception that in gp91phox-deficiency effector Treg (eTreg) numbers are decreased. Expression of Treg markers CD25, inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS), Helios, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) did not provide any clue for differences in Treg functionality or activation state. No correlation was seen between eTreg numbers and patients' clinical phenotype. To conclude, the only difference between Tregs from CGD patients and healthy controls is a decrease in circulating eTregs in gp91phox-deficiency. In terms of autoinflammation/autoimmunity, this group is the most affected. However, upon culture, patient-derived Tregs showed a normal phenotype and normal functional suppressor activity. No other findings pointed towards a role for Tregs in CGD-related autoinflammation/autoimmunity.</jats:p>",

Given this phenomenon, we build a stylized model to investigate the role of revenue sharing schemes in supply chain coordination and product variety decisions. In our model, a monopolistic manufacturer serves two segments of consumers, which are distinguished by their willingness to pay for quality. In the scenario with exogenous revenue sharing ratios, when the potential gain from serving the low segment is substantial (e.g., the low‚Äêsegment consumers' willingness to pay is high enough or the low segment takes a large enough proportion of the market), the retailer is better off abandoning the revenue sharing scheme. Moreover, when the potential gain from serving the low (high) segment is substantial enough, the manufacturer finds it profitable to offer a single product. Furthermore, when revenue sharing ratios are endogenous, we divide our analysis into two cases, depending on the methods of cooperation. When revenue sharing ratios are negotiated at the very beginning, the decentralized supply chain causes further distortion. This suggests that the central premise of revenue sharing‚Äîthe coordination of supply chains‚Äîmay be undermined if supply chain parties meticulously bargain over it.</jats:p>",

The ordering decisions and coordination of a dual-channel supply chain under the online-to-offline (O2O) business model are studied. Nash equilibrium solutions exist for the channel order quantities in all three scenarios, and the inventory transshipment strategy can be used to coordinate the dual-channel supply chain under the O2O business model. Numerical examples are used to analyze the effectiveness and feasibility of coordination. The inventory transshipment strategy can be used to directly coordinate the dual-channel supply chain when only the manufacturer is concerned with fairness. The retailer feels unfair in the other two scenarios, which affects cooperation. To maintain cooperation with the retailer and achieve optimal supply chain efficiency and channel coordination, the manufacturer must compensate the retailer or choose one with fewer expectations regarding its channel status or fewer fairness concerns. </jats:p>",

Methods: We used time series data on Food Balance Sheets of Korea and the National Health and Nutrition Survey from Korea Statistics. Regression analysis was performed for trends of food supply and demand, and t-test for the gender difference in nutrient intake. Results: The annual supply of cereals, rice and starch roots per person has decreased, while that of meat, fish and shellfish, eggs, milk, and fats and oils has increased\n(p &lt; 0.05), respectively. These changes effect on nutrient intake: rice consumption has declined to one-third of total energy intake, however, the energy intake from lipid sources has increased up to 20% in the 2000s.The nutrient intake levels are mostly sufficient to meet the recommended intake, but calcium intake is below the recommended level and sodium is three times above the recommended level. These problems are found in both genders, and males take in more calories and sodium than females (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: These changes in food consumption and supply resulted in lowering both quantities based food self-sufficiency rate and self-sufficiency of nutrition supply. It is therefore suggested that the supply of agricultural products should be stable and quality competitiveness in supply should be improved. Also, measures and strategies in promoting rice consumption are required, such as promoting healthy diet via nutrition education and disseminating healthy traditional Korean food.</jats:p>",

To address potential endogeneity, the share of tobacco farms in a community is instrumented by the change in tobacco buyers following termination of the intermediate buyer system. We find that, as tobacco cultivation is labor‚Äêintensive, children in communities with more tobacco growers spend more time as casual laborers and are less likely to advance to the next grade. Adverse health effects, measured by the likelihood of suffering from illnesses related to green tobacco sickness, are estimated to be larger than previously documented. This affects not only ‚Äúworking‚Äêage‚Äù children but also children too young to work on tobacco farms. Moreover, exposure to large‚Äêscale tobacco cultivation is estimated to reduce the height‚Äêfor‚Äêage z‚Äêscore of children aged 6‚Äì60‚Äâmonths. These findings highlight the importance of raising awareness and taking measures to protect children against green tobacco.</jats:p>",

There are many studies which model the biomass supply chain and its environmental impact. However, animal waste sourced biogas supply chain has not received much attention in the literature. Biogas from animal manure not only provides energy efficiency, but also minimizes carbon emissions compared to existing biomass products. Therefore, this study proposes a mixed integer linear program that minimizes total supply costs and carbon emissions from an animal waste sourced biogas supply chain while it also incorporates carbon price in the model to see the impact of a carbon policy on tactical and strategic supply chain decisions. To validate the model proposed, a case study of North Dakota is adopted where there is a high potential for a biogas plant to be developed. The results of our optimization experiment indicate that supply chain performance in terms of both costs and emissions is very sensitive to a carbon pricing mechanism.</jats:p>",

The traditional shape of such vessels is cylindrical. In this paper, an innovative spherical air vessel is proposed to improve the force characteristics of the tank. A mathematical model of the spherical air vessel was established using the method of characteristics. A comparison was performed of water-hammer protection performance between the spherical air vessel and the cylindrical air vessel based on a practical water supply project. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the spherical air vessel was performed. The results showed that the spherical air vessels had better protective performance compared with the cylindrical air vessels. Under the same protection requirements, the spherical air vessel can reduce the total volume and surface area by more than 10%. In addition, for a fixed volume of the spherical air vessel, the protective effect improves with the increase of the initial gas volume. Increasing the connecting pipe diameter of the air vessel is beneficial for low-pressure protection, whereas it is adverse to high-pressure protection; in contrast, altering the installation elevation has little effect on water-hammer protection.</jats:p>",

While investigating the theoretical and empirical aspects of operational and supply chain implications of pure bundling is essential, this paper determines the optimal pricing decisions in a centralized three‚Äêlevel supply chain that consists of multiple raw material suppliers, a manufacturer and a retailer, and analyzes the impact of raw material suppliers and manufacturer operations and market characteristics on selecting the best pricing strategy. A general supply chain structure is considered, in which the manufacturer receives different raw materials from the suppliers, produces two different products, and then sells them separately, called no bundling strategy, and sells two products in a package, called pure bundling strategy, with uniformly distributed customer valuations. The proposed model finds the optimal pricing decisions of the mentioned supply chain under pure and no bundling strategies and derives the closed‚Äêform solutions to explore the impact of each strategy on the performance of the chain due to its profit. Computational results and sensitivity analysis explain how pure bundling can be utilized as an operational strategy to improve the integrated supply chain profit through a case study. Accordingly, the final results indicate that small market size, low costs, and small amounts of required raw materials, bundling basic products with the premium ones makes the pure bundling strategy profitable even when the cost of the packages is more than the sum of the costs of two products.</jats:p>",

To establish a sustainable solution that resists accidents and disasters, a distributed system is required. To supply high-quality tap water using the existing water-supply network, rechlorination facilities must be installed to secure residual chlorine at the pipe end. In this study, a process is developed to determine the injection points and dosages of rechlorination using the latest pressure-driven analysis. The method was compared to the results of demand driven analysis methods. The proposed model was applied to P City in Korea to draw results. A detailed evaluation was performed to study how water pressure head and demand-based hydraulic and water quality analysis results impact the injection points and dosages of rechlorination. Thus, the existing demand-based model shows significant spatial deviations in the pressure head in the presence of water pressure drops, which subsequently lead to over-estimation of chlorine injection dosages for maintaining the concentration of residual chlorine. However, the proposed model involves a numerically validated theory and draws more reasonable results for hydraulic, water quality, and rechlorination dosages. The proposed model can be used as a decision-making tool based on hydraulic analysis for the supply of water of a stable quality.</jats:p>"

However, its operation is strongly dependent on the chemical structure of compounds of this element. The influence of newly synthesized vanadium compounds on biochemical processes is also unknown. The paper presents the influence of eight new vanadium compounds on organ weights of animals (mice NZO) in whom diabetes was induced by a high-fat diet during 8 weeks. Tested vanadium complexes were administered by 5 weeks. After this time organs were collected and weighed. Tested complexes had a remarkable different effect on organ weights, despite having similar composition ([VO(L)(phen)] and the same co-ligand (1,10-phenanthroline) . This indicate on separate metabolic pathways of these compounds in the body of tested animals and role of the tridentate L Schiff base ligands. The compounds C2, C3 and C5 shoved biggest influence on organs weight and these results suggest influence on the metabolic pathways and therefore are interesting for further investigations.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the effects of pre-ozonation on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation from four drinking-water sources during subsequent chloramination. Moreover, relationships between NDMA and water-quality parameters (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), hydrophobic fractions (HFs), positive-charged fractions (PCFs), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength (UV254), ammonia) were determined. The results indicated that NDMA formed directly by ozonation, but the concentrations (5.7‚Äì37.8 ng/L) were much lower than during chloramination (25.3‚Äì193 ng/L). Pre-ozonation slightly augmented NDMA formation from reservoirs, while it facilitated NDMA precursor destruction in the lake and river. The river was rich in organic matter, its DOC concentration was up to 4.97 mg/L, while the DON/DOC ratio (4.68%) was low; the lake possessed the most organic nitrogen and highest DON/DOC ratio (10.76%). HFs in reservoir #2 were low (1.27 mg/L), and the HFs/DOC ratio was especially high (73.4%). PCFs constituted 48.5‚Äì72.1% of DOC. UV254 values were in the range 0.081‚Äì0.175 cm‚àí1. The ammonia concentration was high in the lake water (0.29 mg/L), while that in reservoir #2 was only 0.08 mg/L. There was a strong correlation between NDMA formation and the removal of ammonia, DON and PCFs.</jats:p>",

A thin CB floating film was assembled under solar light irradiance with the assistance of the water's surface tension and the water molecules' thermal motion. The formation of a thin floating film with suitable CB dose significantly enhanced the water evaporation rate, which was 1.9, 3.0, and 7.2 times higher than that without formation of a CB film, CB nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in water, and pure water, respectively. The temperature difference between the two air‚Äìwater interfaces with and without the CB floating film was as high as 20.1 ¬∞C, which strongly confirms the interfacial heating behavior. There was no decrease of water evaporation rate over the whole measured period of 30 days, which undoubtedly reveals the excellent stability and durability of the CB floating film. Finally, a real seawater sample was used for solar distillation and the typical water-quality indexes before and after solar distillation were compared.</jats:p>",

Its impact on urban settlements depends on both level of exposure and preparedness; two factors that are responsible for severe cuts on millions of people in developing countries, where urban water supply relies almost entirely on rainfall‚Äêdependent sources. To understand whether information on the ENSO state could help mitigate the effects of droughts, we use Metro Manila's water supply system as exemplifying case study, for which we design ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and adaptive management policies. The former are based on information typically available to operators, such as reservoir storage; the latter complement such information with the Oceanic Ni√±o Index (ONI)‚Äîan indicator used for monitoring El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a state. Results obtained by comparing the policy performance on a large set of stochastic streamflow and ONI replicates show that ENSO‚Äêinformed policies are more robust, meaning that they attain a minimum performance level across a broader set of replicates. We show that the primary cause of this behavior is the information on the ENSO state. To further quantify the value of the ONI, we then compare the performance of a representative ENSO‚Äêinformed policy and the system's current operating rules on the period 1968‚Äì2014. The comparison shows that the severe water supply restrictions caused by the existing management system could have been partially avoided through a sequence of smaller restrictions implemented at the onset of the main El Ni√±o events.</jats:p>",

The bioeconomy proposes a development model aimed at reducing impacts and risks associated with the use of non-renewable resources considering the life cycle of products. The European Union is promoting products from renewable sources focused on biochemicals and bio-based plastics, which are high added value products when compared to biofuels. The aim of this paper is to consider sustainability in terms of the environmental, economic, and social aspects of use of bio-based plastics in the fruit chain, considering the case study of raspberry supply chains in northwestern Italy. Different analyses (life-cycle assessment (LCA), life-cycle costing (LCC), and externality assessment (ExA)) were used to assess the impacts along the whole chain by means of an integrated approach. The results show that the bio-based plastic scenario has lower environmental and social impacts than the conventional one, whereas the latter is the best choice according to a classic economic approach. The introduction of bio-based plastics as a replacement for traditional plastics in agri-food chains is the first step toward the use of renewable resources with a low impact on society.</jats:p>"

There are supply-push and demand-pull directions of technology transfer, and recently Korean research institutes have paid increasing attention to demand-pull technology transfer in an attempt to improve public research institutes‚Äô technology transfer performance (TTP). However, our view is that simply adopting a demand-pull or a supply-push model does not always guarantee improved TTP. We argue that technology marketing strategies, such as mass marketing and target marketing, should also be considered. This study aims to investigate the relationship between technology transfer directions and TTP, and the role of technology marketing strategies. We collected a Korean research institute‚Äôs technology transfer data from 2014 to 2015, and then employed a two-way ANOVA to analyze the data. The result of the analysis shows that TTPs differ by technology transfer directions and technology marketing strategies. More importantly, we found that the demand-pull model yields higher TTP, especially when the model is associated with target marketing strategies rather than mass-marketing strategies. This result implies that marketing strategies, such as market segmentation and customer targeting, are needed if an organization wants to improve TTP by implementing the demand-pull technology transfer model.</jats:p>"

The competition among these multiple objectives reflects the competition among various agencies with different interests. There has been a certain degree of conflict between ‚Äòpower scheduling‚Äô, which aims at obtaining greater power generation from the cascade reservoirs, and ‚Äòwater regulation‚Äô, which is currently being implemented. Questions of how to reasonably use the comprehensive regulation capacity of the cascade reservoirs, in order to relieve the conflicts among multiple objectives, and understand the nature of the competition between ‚Äòpower scheduling‚Äô and ‚Äòwater regulation‚Äô, require urgent research and solutions. Based on an analysis of the current situation regarding water supply, electricity demand, flood control, ice control, and ecology, a multi-objective optimal operation model for the cascade reservoirs in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River has been constructed to reveal the relationships between power generation and other objectives. This study provides theoretical evidence for the informed operation of the cascade reservoirs and will be of great significance for coordinating the relationship between power generation and water regulation.</jats:p>",

Faced with the trade‚Äêoff between the supplier's and outlet's profits, it is highly crucial to design and coordinate a supply chain in a way that determines to what extent each level should hold inventories by considering classification of spare parts. Therefore, in this paper, a system dynamics approach is used to design a three‚Äêlevel supply chain simulation model consisting of one business unit, one distribution center, and one maintenance outlet. The business unit and distribution center belong to one company, so we consider them as one supplier. Therefore, we focus on the coordination between the distribution center and the maintenance outlet. The objective is to propose a contract to enhance these two parties‚Äô profits. Through numerical analysis, we provide a contract with which the spare parts in class A are differentiated in their normal and emergency procurement prices and the spare parts in class B and class C have a prescribed customer service level. Using this type of contract, both distribution center's and maintenance outlet's profits can be enhanced, and the management process can be simplified.</jats:p>",

The impacts of Big Data business on the profit of the supply chain and its members were analyzed and it was confirmed that a coordination scheme could achieve supply chain coordination. The results indicated that when the Big Data cost met a certain threshold, the profit of the supply chain and its members would increase whether supply chain members choose to invest in Big Data business individually or jointly. A reasonable cost allocation of Big Data business between supply chain members was provided when both members invest in Big Data.

In this paper, we consider that a capital‚Äêconstrained manufacturer can borrow money from either a bank (bank credit financing) or a retailer (trade credit financing). Our analysis compares supply chain performance under these two financing schemes. Furthermore, we extend our model to evaluate the impacts of retail competition and supply chain member's risk aversion on supply chains, which consist of one capital‚Äêconstrained manufacturer and two competing retailers. We consider three financing schemes: only bank credit financing, dual trade credit financing, and bank and trade credit mix financing. We find that without retail competition, the retailer is always willing to use the trade credit financing; whereas with retail competition, if one retailer provides the trade credit but the other does not, the credit provider could receive the superior profit. Thus, providing an appropriate trade credit financing scheme is critically important for retailers. Moreover, we find that without retail competition, when a trade interest rate is relatively low, both the retailer and manufacturer could reach a win‚Äêwin situation in the trade credit financing. However, with retail competition, supply chain members (i.e., two retailers and one manufacturer) will not have an all‚Äêwin situation no matter which specific financing scheme is adopted and only a win‚Äêwin‚Äêlose situation exists when using the credit mix financing scheme or the dual trade credit financing in supply chains. Last but not least, regardless of risk neutrality or aversion of supply chain members, their pricing decisions among three financing schemes are similar. This implies that the impacts of supply chain members‚Äô risk aversion are limited in supply chain financing scheme selection. More managerial insights are discussed.</jats:p>",

Nonetheless, proximity to the main markets provides an opportunity to sustain agriculture in highly urbanized areas. In this sense, an increasing number of local initiatives is arising within the context of Short Food Supply Chains (SFSCs). The economic impact of these initiatives, however, is limited by problems and inefficiencies that hinder their capacity to scale up. The present paper sets forth the results of a research project developed in Madrid and Catalu√±a. The study is based upon documentary and empirical research addressing the main problems periurban farmers are facing in relation to local food distribution. Among other factors, these refer to regulatory barriers, logistics, competition and dealing with consumers‚Äô preferences. We conducted a questionnaire with a representative group of farmers from each region in three towns presenting different demographic sizes along with another questionnaire extended to the owners of small grocery stores, who play a vital role in the supply of fresh food in these municipalities. Our research demonstrates that most of the problems arising when dealing with SFSCS can be solved by introducing new forms of cooperation among the different agents of the food chain.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we study how such financial incentives affect individuals‚Äô decisions to pursue careers in innovation. We first present empirical evidence on inventors‚Äô career trajectories and income distributions using deidentified data on 1.2 million inventors from patent records linked to tax records in the United States. We find that the private returns to innovation are extremely skewed‚Äîwith the top 1% of inventors collecting more than 22% of total inventors‚Äô income‚Äîand are highly correlated with their social impact, as measured by citations. Inventors tend to have their most impactful innovations around age 40 and their incomes rise rapidly just before they have high-impact patents. We then build a stylized model of inventor career choice that matches these facts as well as recent evidence that childhood exposure to innovation plays a critical role in determining whether individuals become inventors. The model predicts that financial incentives, such as top income tax reductions, have limited potential to increase aggregate innovation because they only affect individuals who are exposed to innovation and have essentially no impact on the decisions of star inventors, who matter most for aggregate innovation. Importantly, these results hold regardless of whether the private returns to innovation are fully known at the time of career choice or are fully stochastic. In contrast, increasing exposure to innovation (e.g., through mentorship programs) could have substantial impacts on innovation by drawing individuals who produce high-impact inventions into the innovation pipeline. Although we do not present direct evidence supporting these model-based predictions, our results call for a more careful assessment of the impacts of financial incentives and a greater focus on alternative policies to increase the supply of inventors.</jats:p>",

In this article, we explore electronics computer-aided design (CAD) software as a threat vector that can be exploited to introduce vulnerabilities into the SoC. We show that all electronics CAD tools‚Äîhigh-level synthesis, logic synthesis, physical design, verification, test, and post-silicon validation‚Äîare potential threat vectors to different degrees.

The tunable behaviour of the coupler was demonstrated experimentally for addition/subtraction and splitting (with experimental coupling ratios of 77:23/14:86 and 50:50, respectively) through phase control. The use of the developed InP PIC enables a low footprint structure design together with the high‚Äêquality active components (lasers, photodetectors and phase modulators) of Fraunhofer Gesellschaft Heinrich Hertz Institute design toolkit. The proposed study provides a full experimental characterisation of the AAC, exploring its tuning properties and enabling further usage in a plethora of applications in high processing computing and data communications.</jats:p>",

To prevent transfusion‚Äêtransmitted B19V infection of at‚Äêrisk patients, B19V antibody screening of blood donors was implemented. The cost‚Äêeffectiveness of this intervention is unclear, as the likelihood of transmission through blood and subsequent complications for recipients are unknown.

Parasites were quantified by the USEPA Method 1623.1/2012. Annual risk was estimated using the quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) approach. Genotyping was performed using specific primers based on the 18S rRNA gene for Cryptosporidium and gdh gene for Giardia. Giardia was detected in 83.3% of the samples (&amp;lt;0.1 to 8.6 cysts/L) and Cryptosporidium in 37.5% (&amp;lt;0.1 to 2 oocysts/L). In general, annual risk values for Giardia were 1 log higher when compared with those obtained for Cryptosporidium. Giardia intestinalis A and B were present as well as C. hominis and C. parvum. The lack of protection measures for the water supply catchment point put the population's health at risk. The results provide data to support decision-makers to take actions to improve environmental quality resulting in a positive impact on consumers' health.</jats:p>",

In all likelihood though, single‚Äêfactor explanation of population dynamics is inadequate, leaving gaps in our knowledge of the multitude of potential influences on small mammal abundance and occupancy patterns in time and space. Here, we investigated floristic gradients across four potential refuge sites of the central rock‚Äêrat, <jats:italic>Zyzomys pedunculatus</jats:italic>, a granivore rodent (50‚Äì120¬†g) that is endemic to central Australia and is categorised as critically endangered. The study took place in Tjoritja/West MacDonnell National Park in the MacDonnell Ranges bioregion. Floristic sampling was allocated across the four sites, the locations of which were predetermined by an established monitoring and management programme for the central rock‚Äêrat. Our aim was to examine the relationship between environmental gradients and floristic composition across the four sites, and thereby test the extent to which the patterns of food type and food availability can inform central rock‚Äêrat spatio‚Äêtemporal dynamics. We found high site‚Äêscale floristic patterning that related foremost to elevation and then to antecedent rainfall and time‚Äêsince‚Äêfire and fire‚Äêseverity effects. To interpret these results, we applied the principles of refuge theory and we described a gradient from core refuge habitat to intermittent and then marginal habitat within the current central rock‚Äêrat stronghold area. Overall, our results implied a strong floristic basis to central rock‚Äêrat site occurrence, and they thus compel us to take explicit account of spatial (elevation) and temporal (rainfall‚Äìproductivity and fire‚Äêdisturbance) influences on the food axis of potential refuge sites of this critically endangered species.</jats:p>",

Global trade regimes have protected developed market economies at the expense of developing countries, and lead firm consolidation in agriculture and apparel supply chains has created downward pressure on wages and working conditions. However, it is precisely in these more precarious sectors of the global economy that an innovative strategy of binding cost sharing accords is emerging. This dynamic of the sourcing squeeze and a binding, cost-sharing accord to address the problem of exclusion of worker‚Äôs rights is illustrated by the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, which is the focus of this article. The Bangladesh case is then briefly compared to working conditions in agriculture and the Fair Food Program in the United States. This article argues that these efforts have been more successful than other state and non-state initiatives because they bind lead firms in supply chains to share in the cost of better conditions of labour. </jats:p>",

We describe and compare three methods explicitly developed for this purpose‚ÄîGeopolitical Supply Risk (GeoPolRisk), Economic Scarcity Potential (ESP), and the Integrated Method to Assess Resource Efficiency (ESSENZ)‚Äîbased on a set of criteria including considerations of data sources, uncertainties, and other contentious methodological aspects. We test the methods on a case study of a European‚Äêmanufactured electric vehicle, and conclude with guidance for appropriate application and interpretation, along with opportunities for further methodological development. Although the GeoPolRisk, ESP, and ESSENZ methods have several limitations, they can be useful for preliminary assessments of the potential impacts of raw material supply risks on a product system (i.e., ‚Äúoutside‚Äêin‚Äù impacts) alongside the impacts of a product system on the environment (i.e., ‚Äúinside‚Äêout‚Äù impacts). Care is needed to not overlook critical raw materials used in small amounts but nonetheless important to product functionality.

This intervention included the rehabilitation and expansion of a piped water system, revitalization of water committees, and creation of and capacity building for small-scale private water enterprises. Quantitative results suggest that the intervention led to an immediate significant increase in the use of piped water supply at the expense of unprotected wells and other non-revenue generating forms of unimproved water supply with more than a 2.5-fold increase in the usage of yard taps and water kiosks/standpipes and a two-fold decrease in the use of unprotected wells. Family water consumption also increased by approximately 40 L/d, and the point-of-use treatment of water nearly tripled. Economic opportunities were generated for business and small enterprise owners due to the new water supply infrastructure, and piped water infrastructure had additional positive effects for both public and private sanitation facilities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This article has been made Open Access thanks to the generous support of a global network of libraries as part of the Knowledge Unlatched Select initiative.</jats:p>",

Understanding the relationship between impervious surface and direct runoff is important for urban planning to protect the urban hydrological system. In this study, we used a mixed spectral decomposition method to interpret the long-term series of impervious surface of Shenyang, China. Direct runoff was evaluated by an improved SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service curve number) model, and the relative influences of five underlying surface factors on the direct runoff of each period were analyzed by boosted regression trees. The overall impervious area was significantly increased in both the study area and built-up area from 1984 to 2015. The impervious ratio showed a decreasing trend in the built-up area and increasing trend in the whole study area. The runoff coefficient of the built-up area showed a significantly decreasing trend. The runoff ratio of the built-up area to the whole study area was increased dramatically, reaching 0.26 by 2015. NDVI (normalized distribution vegetation index), vegetation, and impervious surface were the most important urban surface conditions in the study area for direct runoff generation. The relative influence of impervious surface showed a rapidly increasing trend and then gradually decreased from 2000.</jats:p>",

Here we use coral skeleton isotopes (Œ¥<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N and Œ¥<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O) and element/Ca ratios to identify the sources of nitrogen to a late Pleistocene coral reef in the SPSG (Cook Islands); we then compare these results to modern corals in the same region.

For the modern corals, N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation supplies nitrogen to the island reefs during cool dry periods with groundwater providing nitrogen during wet periods. We propose that the subsurface supply of nitrogen to the modern reefs has declined as a result of reduced upwelling but this supply has been replaced with increasing nitrogen discharge from groundwater and an increase in island‚Äêinduced N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fixation.</jats:p>",

At the same time, according to the idea of restricting water supply by water users in turn, improved hedging rules (IHR) are applied to the urban water supply in Tianjin. The conclusions achieved from this study are as follows: (1) IHR increased water supply assurance rates for domestic water with high-priority and avoided destructive water shortages in agricultural water with low-priority. (2) IHR can better reduce the destructive loss caused by a large number of water shortages and the loss of production caused by a small numbers of water shortages than traditional hedging rules, which ensures high efficiency of water supply during the dry period. The results show that the IHR can improve the operational performance of the urban water supply.</jats:p>"

We measured nutrient availability (DIN, total N [TN], total P [TP]), nutrient imbalance (TN:TP, DIN:TP, N:P<jats:sub>seston</jats:sub>), species richness, and abundance of the whole phytoplankton community, as well as those specific for cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates in Cau Hai lagoon in Vietnam. We determined the correlation among these variables, using structural equation modeling. The models applied to the whole phytoplankton community indicated that the nutrient availability (particularly TP and DIN) drove variation in phytoplankton abundance and richness, and that abundance also depended on species richness. The models applied to different functional groups differed considerably from the entire community and among each other, and only a part of the models was significant. The relationship between nutrient availability (mainly TP) and abundance was driven by cyanobacteria, and the relationship between nutrient imbalance (only with N:P<jats:sub>seston</jats:sub>) and species richness was driven by diatoms. Remarkably, the positive relationship between species richness and abundance, as consistently observed for the whole phytoplankton community, was only observed for one of the three functional groups (diatoms), indicating that resource complementarity occurs particularly among species of different functional groups. Our results emphasized that nutrient availability (TP and to a lesser extent DIN) as well as nutrient imbalance (albeit only with N:P<jats:sub>seston</jats:sub> as proxy) were driving factors for the phytoplankton community in the Cau Hai lagoon and hence alterations in both of these factors leading to a shift in phytoplankton species composition and productivity.</jats:p>",

Results show that the maximum backwater height occurs at the cross-section where the permeable spur dike meets the concave bank of the bend. A formula for the maximum backwater height was derived by the employment of the principle of momentum conservation, and the formula indicates that the height is influenced by the geometric parameters of the permeable spur dike and the bend, the layout of the spur dike in the bend, and the inflow discharge. Based on experimental data, a regression analysis was implemented on the water depth coefficient in the formula. Furthermore, the maximum backwater height can be obtained through the water depth at the concave bank of the end of bend when the parameters and installing pattern of the permeable spur dike are determined.</jats:p>",

Data collected from 215 firms in China reveal that explorative IT capability positively moderates the relationship between information sharing and firm performance but exerts no moderating effect on the association between collaborative planning and firm performance. By contrast, exploitative IT capability positively moderates the impact of collaborative planning but negatively moderates the influence of information sharing on firm performance. Furthermore, building upon the ambidexterity perspective, we develop and test a three‚Äêway interaction hypothesis that explorative and exploitative IT capabilities would interdependently moderate the relationship between supply chain information integration and firm performance. Our results indicate that explorative and exploitative IT capabilities are complementory in moderating the link between collaborative planning and firm performance but substitutive in moderating the relationship between information sharing and firm performance. By integrating insights from both information systems and operations management, our study thus provides an in‚Äêdepth understanding on how and when IT business value can be created in supply chain information integration context.</jats:p>",

However, with this test only rifampicin resistance is diagnosed, leading to presumptive diagnosis of resistance to isoniazid and maybe other drugs. In addition, culture on monthly sputum samples is currently recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for follow-up of RR-TB patients under treatment. Unfortunately, culture is often not locally available, and samples need to be shipped from field to culture laboratories. The associated transport delays lead to high rates of contamination and false-negative culture, particularly in laboratories in low-resource settings. Many gaps for the diagnosis and management of RR-TB patients still need to be addressed and the DIAMA project (Diagnostics for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Africa) aims to address some of them.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>The TB Supranational Reference Laboratory of Benin leads a consortium of 11 partners involved in multiple-drug resistant TB care in Africa.

We also examined the effects of numbers of legume species (from zero to four) in four‚Äêspecies mixed plots on soil N cycling. We hypothesized that legumes would increase N mineralization rates most in those treatments with the greatest diversity and the greatest relative limitation by and competition for N. Results partially supported these hypotheses. Plots with greater dominance by legumes had greater soil nitrate concentrations and mineralization rates. Higher species richness significantly increased the impact of legumes on soil N metrics, with 349% and 505% higher mineralization rates and nitrate concentrations in four‚Äêspecies plots containing legumes compared to legume‚Äêfree four‚Äêspecies plots, in contrast to 185% and 129% greater values, respectively, in pure legume than nonlegume monoculture plots.

The decision-making that occurs within the green supply chain for energy-saving products under government subsidies is an area of great academic interest and game theory is becoming a popular tool in such research. In this paper, we examined centralized and decentralized decision-making models for the green supply chain and a coordinated decision-making model for revenue-sharing contracts based on game theory. We studied the effects of government subsidies on retail prices, energy conservation levels, market demand, supply chain profits, and social welfare for energy-saving products. We then compared the effectiveness of the three models using a numerical example. Our results revealed the range of contract parameters for which manufacturer and retailer profits increase. Our results show that government subsidies can significantly improve social welfare and promote the improvement of energy-saving products. Centralized decision-making generates higher profits than decentralized decisions and government subsidies were positively correlated with the level of energy conservation, product prices, and market demand. Revenue sharing contract coordination decisions can coordinate the supply chain and achieve the same effect as centralized decisions.</jats:p>"

An improved support vector machine (SVM) was used to analyze the resilience level of each farm for the selected time period. The test results showed that the indicator optimization model had the advantage of eliminating redundant indicators and ensuring the maximum content of screening indicators. The indicator system reflected all original information by 34% of initial indicators. The results showed that the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) model had higher accuracy for the evaluation of agricultural water resource resilience through the analysis of stability and reliability of each model. The spatial pattern of resilience over selected farms was generally characterized by ‚Äòlow in the southwest and high in the northeast‚Äô. The research achievements may provide technical and theoretical support for solving problems of index optimization and analysis methods of system resilience, and have an important theoretical and practical significance for promoting the sustainable development of regional agricultural water resources systems.</jats:p>",

This was done during flow mediated dilation (FMD) studies in 26 chronically transfused SCD, 75 non‚Äêtransfused SCD, and 18 control subjects. Chronically transfused SCD patients were studied prior to and following a single transfusion and there was no acute change in rSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or perfusion. Laser Doppler estimates of resting perfusion were 76% higher in non‚Äêtransfused and 110% higher in transfused SCD patients, compared to control subjects. In contrast, rSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was 12 saturation points lower in non‚Äêtransfused SCD patients, but normal in the transfused SCD patients. During cuff occlusion, rSO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> declined at the same rate in all subjects suggesting similar intrinsic oxygen consumption rates. Upon cuff release, laser doppler post occlusive hyperemia was blunted in SCD patients in proportion to their resting perfusion values. Transfusion therapy did not improve the hyperemia response. FMD was impaired in SCD subjects but partially ameliorated in transfused SCD subjects. Taken together, non‚Äêtransfused SCD subjects demonstrate impaired conduit artery FMD, impaired microcirculatory post‚Äêocclusive hyperemia, and resting hypoxia in the hand despite compensated oxygen delivery, suggesting impaired oxygen supply‚Äêdemand matching. Transfusion improves FMD and oxygen supply‚Äêdemand matching but not microcirculation hyperemic response.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Resilient suppliers can reduce supply chain risk, effectively avoid supply chain disruption, and bring profits to enterprises. However, there is no united measuring index system to evaluate the resilient supplier under supply chain environment, and the assessment language sets are usually crisp values. Therefore, in order to fill the research gap, this paper proposes a hybrid method, which combines triangular fuzzy number, the best-worst method (BWM), and the modular TOPSIS in random environments for group decision-making (GMo-RTOPSIS) to solve the above problem. Firstly, the weight of decision-maker is calculated by using fuzzy BWM which can deal with triangular fuzzy numbers. Secondly, triangular fuzzy number is introduced into GMo-RTOPSIS, and combined with fuzzy BWM, alternatives are sorted to select the best resilient supply chain partner. Finally, the feasibility and universality of this method are proved by illustrative examples.</jats:p>",
