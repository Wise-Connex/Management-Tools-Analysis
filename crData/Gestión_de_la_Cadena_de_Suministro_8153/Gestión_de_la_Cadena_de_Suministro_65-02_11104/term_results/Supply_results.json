A (3 x 3 x 2) factorial experiment with three replications using an upland rice variety, Agbede, was carried out in the open on the College Farm between January and May 1963. Ten-litre plastic buckets 25 cm. deep and holding 11 kg. of soil, which was thoroughly mixed and the pH brought to 6.0 by liming, were used in growing the plants. These buckets were left standing on the ground, and there was no rain during the experimental period.</jats:p>",
