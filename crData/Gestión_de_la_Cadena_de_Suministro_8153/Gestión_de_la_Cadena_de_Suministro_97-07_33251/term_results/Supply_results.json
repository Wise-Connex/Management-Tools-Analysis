Smaller firms are part of a larger supply chain(s), and also experience market uncertainties and difficulties in maintaining efficient material and information flow. This paper reports on a study of the use of SCM techniques in medium‐to‐small manufacturing (MTSM) firms. The study consisted of interviews with executives, and a mail questionnaire asking participants to indicate the extent of their firm's use of specific techniques identified in the literature as contributing to the success of SCM. The study found that the use of SCM techniques vary in extent and between industries, and that the organizational structure of MTSM firms has both helped and hindered the implementation of SCM. Greater education about the benefits, costs, and techniques of SCM is required at all levels of organization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Concern about environmental issues and pressure on manufacturing firms to decrease their environmental impact have both intensified since the early 1980s. At present legislation is the most significant source of environmental pressure on firms, but it is the government's intention that voluntary nonlegislative measures will play a much greater role in the future. Pressure through the supply chain is one possible mechanism for achieving this objective, although relatively little is known about its environmental role or importance for manufacturing firms. The author outlines the supply-chain concept, and examines its current significance as a source of environmental pressure. The nature of any supply-chain pressure experienced by a cross section of manufacturing firms in Yorkshire and Humberside, and their actual responses to it, are considered. This investigation reveals that, because of their economic importance, environmental pressure from customers has the potential to be significant. However, in practice such pressure only tends to affect chemical firms and those firms in the consumer-goods sectors which have experienced green consumer pressure directly. Industrial customers, with the exception of a minority of large firms and multinational corporations, generally show little interest in the environmental implications of their sales and purchasing. Environmental legislation is confirmed as by far the most important pressure forcing firms to mitigate their environmental impact. The policy implications of these findings for any move away from reliance on environmental legislation towards voluntary controls are explored. </jats:p>",

There were no N by GA interactions. Treatments did not significantly influence days to sprouting, number of sprouts, or number of leaves per sprout. N rates did not affect sprout length, whereas increasing GA rates enhanced sprout elongation. The effect of GA was described by the linear equation Y = 14.59 + 0.27X. Results indicate that GA sprays can be used to enhance sprout elongation to promote the desired round shape in canopies of `Keitt' mango plants.</jats:p>",

More recently, the mechanism by which the improved control is achieved has been the subject of theoretical analysis. In turn, this has led to recommendations for good parameter settings which may be used with confidence when applied to a particular generic decision support system (DDS) known as the “to make” model. One consequence of utilizing pipeline feedback is the enhanced damping capability of this system. In our experience, many supply chains may be represented by the coupling together of a series of To‐Make models. In this paper, we show that the use of supply chain feedback within each echelon greatly reduces the order amplification as it proceeds upstream from the market place. Using as an example a model of the Beer Game Supply chain, it is concluded that demand amplification is readily reduced by a factor of 2:1.</jats:p>",

In a single voltage design, the critical path length, clock period, and number of control steps limit minimization of voltage and power. Multiple supply voltages permit localized voltage reductions to take up remaining schedule slack. MOVER initially finds one minimum voltage for an entire datapath. It then determines a second voltage for operations where there is still schedule slack. New voltages con be introduced and minimized until no schedule slack remains. MOVER was exercised for a variety of DSP datapath examples. Energy savings ranged from 0% to 50% when comparing dual to single voltage results. The benefit of  going from two to three voltages never exceeded 15%. Power supply costs are not reflected in these savings, but a simple analysis shows that energy savings can be achieved even with relatively inefficient DC-DC converters. Datapath resource requirements were found to vary greatly with respect to number of supplies. Area penalties ranged from 0% to 170%. Implications of multiple voltage design for IC layout and power supply requirements are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Using ion‐exchange resin capsules for assessing nutrient supply in lowland rice (<jats:italic>Oryza sativa</jats:italic> L.) fields requires strategies for estimating field means of resin adsorption quantities (RAQs). To develop recommendations for on‐site use of capsules, we conducted two experiments in rice fields on Typic Tropaquepts and Tropaqualfs in the Philippines. Resin capsules were placed in situ (ISI) or inserted into composite soil samples for on‐site incubation (OSI). Capsules were retrieved after 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 d and RAQs of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, and Mn were measured. In ISI or OSI of single soil cores, coefficients of variation in RAQs of N, P, and Fe ranged from 17 to 71%, whereas those for K and Ca ranged from 10 to 20%. Between one and five capsules per 0.25‐ha field were required to estimate the average RAQ of P, K, and Ca after 14 d with a precision of ± 10%, compared with four to 10 capsules per field for estimating the RAQ of NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N and Fe after 14 d. Soil core sampling and OSI of composite soil samples reduced microvariability in RAQs. About eight to 10 soil cores (0–15‐cm depth) were required per field for resin capsule OSI. Because of soil physical changes, degassing, and oxidation during soil mixing, RAQs of P, Fe, K, and Ca were lower for OSI than for ISI. The ISI method is recommended for routine soil testing in lowland rice fields. The OSI requires fewer capsules but more labor. Its reliability depends on the extent to which mechanical disturbance, degassing, and exposure to air can be minimized.</jats:p>",

Rat fibroblasts genetically modified to secrete rat HGF were implanted in syngenic rat spleen 7 days before administration of the hepatotoxins. Rats with HGF‐secreting fibroblasts in the spleen showed a dramatic resistance to CCl<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐ and LPS‐induced liver injury. In the LPS‐induced liver injury model, blood chemical analysis revealed that the increase in serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase level and the decrease in blood sugar level were remarkably suppressed in rats with HGF‐secreting cells in the spleen. Most importantly, their survival rate was greatly improved compared to other control groups of rats. Thus our results indicate a new role of HGF in liver protection during endotoxemia and convey important clinical implications for developing new therapeutic modalities in the treatment of liver failure caused by endotoxemia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Six normal untrained men were studied during the intravenous infusion of a balanced amino acid mixture (approximately 0.15 g.kg-1.h-1 for 3 h) at rest and after a leg resistance exercise routine to test the influence of exercise on the regulation of muscle protein kinetics by hyperaminoacidemia. Leg muscle protein kinetics and transport of selected amino acids (alanine, phenylalanine, leucine, and lysine) were isotopically determined using a model based on arteriovenous blood samples and muscle biopsy. The intravenous amino acid infusion resulted in comparable increases in arterial amino acid concentrations at rest and after exercise, whereas leg blood flow was 64 +/- 5% greater after exercise than at rest. During hyperaminoacidemia, the increases in amino acid transport above basal were 30-100% greater after exercise than at rest. Increases in muscle protein synthesis were also greater after exercise than at rest (291 +/- 42% vs. 141 +/- 45%). Muscle protein breakdown was not significantly affected by hyperminoacidemia either at rest or after exercise. We conclude that the stimulatory effect of exogenous amino acids on muscle protein synthesis is enhanced by prior exercise, perhaps in part because of enhanced blood flow. Our results imply that protein intake immediately after exercise may be more anabolic than when ingested at some later time. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Previous experiments have shown that the anatomy and chemical composition of leaves of inherently fast‐ and slow‐growing grass species, grown at non‐limiting nitrogen supply, differ systematically. The present experiment was carried out to investigate whether these differences persist when the plants are grown at an intermediate or a very low nitrogen supply. To this end, the inherently fast‐growing <jats:italic>Poa annua</jats:italic> L. and <jats:italic>Poa trivialis</jats:italic> L., and the inherently slow‐growing <jats:italic>Poa compressa</jats:italic> L. and <jats:italic>Poa pratensis</jats:italic> (L.) Schreb. were grown hydroponically at three levels of nitrate supply: at optimum (RGR<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) and at relative addition rates of 100 and 50 mmol N (mol N)<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (RAR<jats:sub>100</jats:sub> and RAR<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>), respectively.</jats:p><jats:p>As expected, at the lowest N supply, the potentially fast‐growing species grew at the same rate as the inherently slow‐growing ones. Similarly, the differences in leaf area ratio (LAR, leaf area:total dry mass), specific leaf area (SLA, leaf arear:leaf dry mass) and leaf mass ratio (LMR, leaf dry mass:total dry mass) disappeared. Under optimal conditions, the fast‐growing species differed from the slow‐growing ones in that they had a higher N concentration. There were no significant differences in C concentration. With decreasing N supply, the total N concentration decreased and the differences between the species disappeared. The total C concentration increased for the fast‐growing species and decreased for the slow‐growing ones, i.e. the small, but insignificant, difference in C concentration between the species at RGR<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> increased with decreasing N supply.</jats:p><jats:p>The chemical composition of the leaves at low N supply, analysed in more detail by pyrolysis–mass spectrometry, showed an increase in the relative amounts of guaiacyl lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, whereas those of syringyl lignin and protein decreased.</jats:p><jats:p>The anatomy and morphology of the leaves of the four grass species differing in RGR<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> were analysed by image‐processing analysis. The proportion of the total volume occupied by mesophyll plus intercellular spaces and epidermis did not correlate with the amount of leaf mass per unit leaf area (specific leaf mass, SLM) at different N supply. The higher SLM at low N supply was caused partly by a high proportion of non‐veinal sclerenchymatic cells per cross‐section and partly by the smaller volume of epidermal cells.</jats:p><jats:p>We conclude that the decrease in relative growth rate (and increase in SLM) at decreasing N supply is partly due to chemical and anatomical changes. The differences between the fast‐ and slow‐growing grass species at an optimum nutrient supply diminished when plants were growing at a limiting nitrogen supply.</jats:p>",
