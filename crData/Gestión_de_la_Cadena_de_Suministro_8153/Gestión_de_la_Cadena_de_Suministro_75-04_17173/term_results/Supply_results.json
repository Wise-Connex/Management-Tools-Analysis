Permission to copy is restricted to an abstract of not more than 300 words. Illustrations may not be copied. The abstract should contain conspicuous acknowledgment of where and by whom the paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY or the SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS JOURNAL is usually granted upon request to the Editor of the appropriate journal provided agreement to give proper credit is made. provided agreement to give proper credit is made. Discussion of this paper is invited. Three copies of any discussion should be sent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers office. Such discussion may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This paper presents the development of the North Sea supply vessel as from the past, present and future. It gives a brief present and future. It gives a brief statement concerning an anchor handling procedure in the North Sea of a semi-submersible and a large North Sea type tug/anchorhandling/ supply vessel. Special attention is required for a better cooperation between the drilling companies and the supply boat company, in particular during the designing stage.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The history of the North Sea supply boat cannot be described as being a very long one but at the same time it has seen the introduction of many unique innovations in marine technology.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The actual number of supply ships operating in the North Sea area today cannot be accurately assessed as ships are constantly being moved into the area from overseas and assigned to other operational areas. The arrival of new buildings on the scene can also confuse the figures as can the seasonal demands of the construction contractors. However I would estimate that approximately 250 supply boats of varying capability will find employment in the North Sea area during the Summer of 1975. Most offshore support craft activities are nowadays concentrated on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf where the majority of oil and gas discoveries have been made. My own Company has always favoured international involvement and in the 10 years of the Company's history, we have serviced drilling operations offshore Denmark, The Irish Republic, Holland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>I propose to divide this paper into 3 sections, the past, the present and the future.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>1.

Sugar beet given factorial dressings of these elements was sampled periodically to determine whether they increase yield by similar effects on growth. Three experiments were made at Broom' Barn on a calcareous loam in 1971–73 and the results suggest that the two elements affect growth similarly. Both increased leaf area early in the season, improved the root: top ratio and increased sugar percentage in fresh and dried roots, all factors contributing to increased sugar yield. Analysis of the roots during September to December showed that neither element affected their processing quality; although each element increased its own concentration in the root juice, it proportionately decreased the harmful α‐amino nitrogen concentration.</jats:p>",
