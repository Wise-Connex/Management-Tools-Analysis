      "abstract": "<p>In today's supply networks, characterised by increased complexity and uncertainty, fast flow of information and decisions across the supply network is fundamental for improving efficiency and customer service in the global market. In such a complex, dynamic environment, the overall performance of the supply network can only be improved through better coordination of inter-related, boundary-spanning business processes in the network. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for enhanced coordination of production planning and control activities across the supply network. The framework consists of seven business processes, among which four key business processes focusing on the short to medium term are chosen for design and modelling and subsequent implementation.</p>",

The high number of potential supply chain options provides AM service providers with a significant challenge when making decisions on powder procurement. This paper provides an overview of the metal powder supply chain for the AM market and aims to give AM service providers the information necessary to make informed decisions when procuring metal powders. The procurement options are categorised into three main groups, namely: procuring powders from AM equipment suppliers, procuring powders from third party suppliers and procuring powders directly from powder atomisers. Each of the procurement options has its own unique advantages and disadvantages. The relative importance of these will depend on what the AM equipment is being used for, for example research, rapid prototyping or productionisation. The future of the metal AM powder market is also discussed.</jats:p>",

Because of the multi-dimensional characteristics; the selection of appropriate SCCS in a given situation remains a challenging task for supply chain managers. This study explores relevant factors that influence this selection process. A structural model is proposed to capture relationships among these factors for development of Impact Relationship Maps (IRM) by applying Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Maximum Mean De-Entropy (MMDE) algorithm. A study has been conducted and the outcome leads to add significant value to the decision making process with knowledge on the roles of the factors and inter-factor relations which helps in taking meaningful decision on SCCS selection and implementation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transportation and logistics are increasingly relevant to the rapid economic growth of emerging economies. Decision makers in the transportation and logistics industry require a comprehensive understanding of the institutional business environment and factor markets in emerging economy countries to formulate accurate supply chain strategies for the future. Although extensive studies on prospective scenarios in emerging economies are available, research has largely neglected the future evolution of transportation and logistics. This study addresses this gap by applying a multiple method research approach and relying on institutional theory and factor‐market rivalry theory to create scenarios of the development of transportation and logistics in emerging economy countries by 2030. We do so by collecting qualitative and quantitative data through a <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">D</jats:styled-content>elphi survey and applying fuzzy clustering to group the results into meaningful and interpretable scenarios. Our results suggest that emerging economies will take advantage of free trade zones to consolidate their position in the international market and encourage investment. Consequently, logistics will experience rapid growth and value‐added services will expand, propelling new players from developing economies onto the international stage. Our findings also suggest that the logistics service industry in emerging economy countries will undergo a significant consolidation process, leading to the possibility of factor‐market rivalry among shippers. This suggests that shippers' social networks and personal contacts will increase in importance in the future.</jats:p>",

As part of the identification procedure, the input variable selection algorithm based on partial mutual information is implemented. It is shown that meteorological data on a daily basis are not relevant for the water demand prediction in the sense of partial mutual information for the analysed water distribution systems of the cities of Tavira, Algarve, Portugal and Evanton East, Scotland, UK. Water demand prediction system is modelled using artificial neural networks, which offer a great potential for the identification of complex dynamic systems. The adaptive tuning procedure of model parameters is also developed in order to enable the model to adapt to changes in the system. A significant improvement of the prediction ability of such a model in relation to the model with fixed parameters is shown when a certain trend is present in the water demand profile.</jats:p>",

Because of the external pressure and the property of porous material, the load capacity of hydraulic bearing can be promoted without decreasing precision.

In this context, the reliability of an inventory system is defined as the probability that the available inventory level meets all population demand during crisis period. Inventory support for emergency operations is complicated by uncertainties of demands and duration of crisis period. The inventory system is considered as a structure that undergoes an external load represented by the demand of population during crisis period. Moreover, the supply chain resists to this load by its strength represented by the quantity of products available at the distribution center. Reliability based design optimization approach is proposed to perform an optimal design of inventory system in emergency operation without making any particular assumption on distribution of population demand and duration crisis period. The simulation software SIMIO is used to validate the proposed method by conducing simulation analysis using several examples with different distributions of population demand and duration crisis period. The results indicate clearly that the proposed method gives an optimal design with reliability much closer to target value.</p>",

The subject of this study was to determine the effect of salinity and water stress on sugarcane yield in Iran with an operational and planning distribution model (OPDM) for 7 years (2002–2008). Irrigation scenarios consisted of the full irrigation (I1), 85% (I2) and 70% (I3) of the sugarcane water requirement, and salinity scenarios were the average salinity of the Karun River, S1 (dS m−1), S2 = S1 +2 and S3 = S1 +4. The root mean square error and mean bias error (0.04 and 0.02, respectively) show the low error percentages and the values of EF = 0.65 and d = 0.71 indicated the high accuracy of the yield simulation with OPDM. Significant differences were observed among the different irrigation levels and this difference in I3 was more than in I2. The effect of different salinity levels on yield reduction was not significant. Overall, results showed that there was an individual and combined effect of salinity and water deficit on sugarcane yield; however, the effect of different irrigation levels on the yield was more than the salinity.</jats:p>",

Iron impregnated granular activated carbon (AC-Fe) composites were prepared with different ferric (Fe+3) concentrations, ranging from 0.09 to 3.0 M. These AC-Fe composites were able to remove 92–98% of the arsenate [As(V)] and 42–65% of the arsenite [As(III)]. The composite containing the lowest iron concentration (1.54%) was the most effective at arsenic sorption. Langmuir model fit indicated that the maximum 125 mg As(V)/gFe and 98.4 mg As(III)/gFe can be sorbed by the composite. The kinetics of arsenic sorption is well explained by pseudo first-order kinetics. The arsenate removal efficiency was found to decrease with increasing solution pH, while the As(III) removal efficiency was found to increase. The background ionic strength (IS) had no significant effect of on As(V) removal, but As(III) removal increased when the IS was greater than 50 mM NaCl. Our results indicate that a small amount of iron embedded efficiently in AC may have considerable potential in removing arsenic from water.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Based on the theoretical underpinnings of the relational view of competitive advantage, the current study investigates the performance implications of three critical relational resource elements in supply chain partnerships: resource specificity, resource complementarity, and supply chain collaboration. The research also explores the interrelationship dynamics among these sources of relational rent—critical to the understanding of superior supply chain performance. The study models environmental dynamism and complexity to investigate the nature of the relationships among relational resources as they interact with technological and market turbulence factors. Operational productivity improvements are the primary outcome measures in the current research. Empirical evidence, based on the survey data of a cross-section of US manufacturing firms from a wide range of industries, supports a majority of our arguments, thus providing critical theoretical and managerial insights. The findings reiterate the importance of collaborative initiatives in the supply chain for operational benefits and high levels of customer service. The results also shed light on the interrelationships among relational resource elements, filling inadequacies in previous literature: resource specificity and complementarity are found to be antecedents of collaboration. The findings also suggest that complementary resources facilitate coordinated partner activities under highly turbulent technological environments.</jats:p>",

While a number of such studies on understanding this nexus have been carried out in the recent past, there have been virtually no studies that have done so for Asian cities. This study aims to plug this gap by analyzing the water–energy–carbon (WEC) nexus for Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand. Using mostly secondary data, and through interactions with concerned stakeholders, the study revealed that more than 335 GWh of energy is used per year for water supply (0.22 kWh of energy to drive 1 m3 of water from source to tap). About 276 million litres of water is consumed for total power production in Thailand; almost 16% of water supplied annually by the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA). Of this, 0.625 million litres is consumed by electricity, utilised for water supply in Bangkok. In addition 82.2 billion kgCO2-eq is emitted by the power sector annually and energy associated with water emits 187 million kgCO2-eq/year, equal to 0.11 kgCO2-eq of GHG emission from each 1 m3 of water supplied by the MWA. This study provides information on the WEC nexus in cities as evidenced by Bangkok, which can contribute to the formulation of a policy in water and energy sectors to fulfil the objective of reducing GHG emissions.</jats:p>",

Site visits and phone interviews are conducted with six healthcare providers to document common product validation practices and procedures. Based on observations and collected data, a simulation model is developed. Different scenarios are compared for patient safety, care delay, and system efficiency. The results show that validation points during PAR picking or bedside product administration, and warehouse picking operations provide optimal overall system performance.

Given the limited research on wetting front migration under a surface drip irrigation emitter, soil water movement under a double-point-source irrigation emitter was investigated. An experimental soil bin was designed and filled with silt loam soil, and time domain reflectometry and tensiometers were used to measure soil moisture contents and soil water potential, respectively. The results show that under the conditions of 6 hours of irrigation with two drippers each delivering 1.05 L hr−1 and spaced at 45 cm, the soil moisture content of the 0–30 cm layer increased rapidly and reached 0.29 cm3 cm−3, and was greater than that in the 30–60 cm layer as irrigation proceeded. After 6 hours the irrigation was stopped, such that in the redistribution phase, soil moisture of the top layer gradually decreased, while that of the sublayer gradually increased. The results indicate that 6 hours of irrigation under given emitter flow conditions produced adequate soil moisture down to 30 cm for most shallow-rooted crops.</jats:p>",

With Carbon Tax regulation, we consider four scenarios resulting from two ways in form of adopting transfer price contract and/or introducing third-party emission-reduction service (TPERS) to enhance the efficiency of systematic emission reductions. We refine four models from these corresponding scenarios, which in turn constitute a decision-making framework composed of determining vertical incentives and choosing supply chain structures. By exploiting Stackelberg games in all models, we compare their emission reduction efficiencies and profitability for each pair of settings. Theoretic analysis and numerical studies show that adopting vertical transfer payment schemes can definitely benefit channel carbon footprint reduction and Pareto improvement of supply chain profitability, regardless of whether the emission-reduction service exists or not. However, whether introducing TPERS or not is heavily depending on systematic parameters when the transfer payment incentive is adopted there. We also provide insights on the sensitivity of carbon tax parameters with respect to the supply chain performance, overall carbon emission reduction, vertical incentive and TPERS adopting decision-makings.</jats:p>"

Although deterministic trend and seasonal price movements are present, a stochastic large‐amplitude cycle with a period of 3.3 years is the predominant source of variation in the U.S. all‐milk price during the period analyzed. These cycles are consistent with the hypothesis that supply chain managers make decisions based on bounded rationality, with limited supply chain coordination. The presence of price cycles in the U.S. dairy industry has management implications for dairy farmers, dairy processors, exporters, and food retailers. Forecasting and analytical models of U.S. farm milk prices should be designed to account for cyclical farm milk price behavior.</jats:p>",

A considerable part of water losses occurs either because of the incorrect assembly of joints or because of the fatigue and ageing of the material used to ensure a watertight seal. Moreover, such a leakage is very difficult to detect and to assess. In this work, we present a novel formulation for modelling the pressure effect on the background leakage through the joints. The proposed approach is based on the preliminary evaluation of the enlargement Δω, due to pressure, of the existing space between the outer side of the spigot end of a pipe and the inner wall of the hub end of the adjacent pipe (which is characterised by the area ωatm at atmospheric pressure). Furthermore, the whole procedure is based on the evaluation, by field data or calibration, of a parameter ξ representing the rate of enlarged area ω that, for several reasons, may be not covered by the gasket, ω being the value, at pressure p, of the area above defined.</jats:p>",

Data collection was through in-person administering of hardcopy questionnaires in Riyadh, Jeddah and Albaha, collecting responses from a wide range of stakeholder groups, including teachers, policy makers, water professionals and managers, environmental managers, technical practitioners and engineers, industrial managers, lecturers and researchers, and from the general public.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. It has been suggested that oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) will expand in the tropical oceans as a result of global change with potential consequences for marine element cycling, such as an increase in anaerobic nitrogen loss, resulting in a lower supply of nitrate relative to phosphate to the euphotic zone. So far, the effects of changes in nutrient ratios on organic matter recycling and export fluxes are not well understood. Here, were investigated how different phosphate (Varied P: 0.15–1.58 μmol L−1) or nitrate (Varied N: 1.9–21.9 μmol L−1) concentrations affect the abundance and size distribution of polysaccharidic transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), which are suggested to enhance particle aggregation and export fluxes, and on proteinaceous coomassie stainable particles (CSP), a supposedly good substrate for heterotrophic bacteria. Two series of mesocosm bloom experiments were conducted with natural plankton communities collected from the Eastern Tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) close to Cape Verde in October 2012. Until bloom peak, a positive correlation between gel particle abundance and Chl a concentration was determined, linking the release of dissolved gel precursors and the subsequent formation of gel particles to autotrophic production. After bloom peak, gel particle abundance remained stable or even increased, implying a continued partitioning of dissolved into particulate organic matter after biomass production itself ceased. During both experiments, differences between TEP and CSP dynamics were observed; TEP were generally more abundant than CSP. Changes in size distribution indicated aggregation of TEP during the bloom, while newly formed CSP decomposed. Abundance of gel particles clearly increased with nitrate concentration during the second experiment, suggesting that changes in [DIN]:[DIP] ratios can affect gel particle formation with potential consequences for carbon and nitrogen cycling as well as food web dynamics in tropical ecosystems.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Horizontal supply chains is the term used when suppliers competing at a particular level of the chain form a coalition to benefit from their cooperation rather than the usual competitive strategies used by them to become part of the supply chain. Such horizontal cooperation among competitors is studied by Wood, using qualitative research methodology, based on case studies done in New Zealand. The term \"coopetition\" is used in the literature to describe such a cooperative behavior among competitors. In this paper we examine the coopetition phenomenon from a game theoretic perspective and give a model that brings out the equilibria that will lead to optimal participation among the coalition partners. The model considers a set of growers who can choose to form a coopetitive alliance to market their production in some external regions, while competing within the internal regions. By means of a general analytical framework of competition, we show the strategies that could provide solutions, in a coopetitive perspective, for the growers. These solutions offer a win–win outcome for the growers, letting them share the pie fairly within a growth path of games. We determine the proportion of resources they'll use and how the gain will be shared.</jats:p>",

However, there are numerous types of commercial adsorbents potentially capable of treating arsenic-contaminated groundwater. The present paper compares arsenic uptake efficiency of two different commercial media, one (FerriXTM) using mainly the adsorption process, and the other (IRA 400) working as an ion-exchange resin. Firstly, batch studies with artificially contaminated solutions were run to determine the isotherm equations and the theoretical uptake capacity. The following values of the equilibrium coefficients were determined: for IRA 400, using a two-site model K = 1.749; for FerriXTM, using the Freundlich isotherm model n50 = 3.02 mg L/g and k50 = 12.07 mg L/g, and n100 = 2.32 mg L/g and k100 = 6.75 mg L/g, for 50 mg L/g and 100 mg/L initial arsenic concentrations, respectively. Then, a series of experiments were carried out on column plants using real contaminated feeding solutions to determine the breakthrough curves. Both media showed very high duration of the cycle run. However, performance of IRA 400 was negatively affected by the presence of interfering ions, such as sulfates, which accelerated the achievement of the breakthrough condition. Instead, FerriXTM removed arsenic for a much higher number of bed volumes than IRA 400, but it was ineffective against the other contaminants of the solution.</jats:p>",

This study examines multiple issues regarding the relationship between I-IT investment made in support of value chain management and organizational performance as judged by profit and productivity. Conclusions are offered regarding the strength of this type of investment as a performance predictor, the types of firms for which it does improve performance and what modes of I-IT investment produce the greatest results. Data from 165 firms indicate that investment in I-IT can positively impact performance depending on the type of industry and the type of supply chain function being supported. In particular, results indicate that firms in industries such as banking and insurance stand to benefit most from the use of I-IT. This study also provides useful recommendations for how firms should design and deploy their I-IT resources for value chain management that maximizes their return on investment.

These types of errors could have been prevented if safety instructions had been correctly followed and supported in the maintenance system. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – A paper mill plant mainly consists four sections namely the head box, wire part, press part and dryer. All these four parts are connected in series configuration. The authors have developed a mathematical model for the plant in which power supply is in standby mode. The designed system can fail in five ways, i.e. by the failure of head box failure, wire part failure, press part failure, dryer failure and power (electricity) failure. So to make proper functioning of paper machine and no interruption in power supply, the authors have considered that power supply is in standby mode. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Using the supplementary variable technique, the Laplace transformations and Markov process theory, the reliability indices of the paper mill plant model are determined. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – In the present paper, the authors have developed a mathematical model based on a paper plant machine.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Correlates of glucose intolerance are risk factors for delayed secretory activation, but it is not known if glucose intolerance is associated with persistent low milk supply. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to diabetes in pregnancy is greater among women with low milk supply as compared to women with latch problems in a Breastfeeding Medicine Clinic (BMC). We conducted a case‐control analysis of electronic medical records. We defined cases as low milk supply, but without latch or nipple problem; and controls as latch or nipple problem without low milk supply. We calculated odds of exposure to diabetes in cases versus controls in an unadjusted model and after adjusting for covariates (maternal and infant age, Cesarean delivery, preterm birth) and comorbidities (PCOS, hypothyroid or infertility). After excluding 74 with dual diagnoses, 14.9% of cases (26/175) versus 6.2% of controls (14/226) were exposed to diabetes (OR [95%CI], 2.6[1.3‐5.2]), a relation that remained robust after adjustment for covariates and comorbidities (AOR [95%CI], 2.4[1.2‐4.9]). Thus, women with low milk supply were significantly more likely to have been exposed to diabetes than those with latch or nipple problems. Identification of physiologic parameters that underlie the association between glucose intolerance and low milk supply is needed to enable more effective therapy options.</jats:p>",

It is necessary to estimate the ability of drought mitigation on the basis of water allocation. In this research, the drought mitigation ability index (DMAI) was constructed by the ratio of theoretical water supply and demand obtained from the optimal water allocation. Then, the DMAI was applied to Daqinghe watershed for temporal-spatial validation compared with the agricultural affected areas and the distribution of groundwater overexploitation. In addition, the historical (1961–2010) and future (2020) DMAI in Daqinghe watershed were analyzed. The results show that DMAI can overall represent the temporal-spatial characteristics of the drought mitigation ability. Furthermore, the DMAI of Daqinghe watershed is significantly decreased in the last  50 years, and groundwater resources play a prominent role in drought mitigation. Although the water from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) can improve DMAI of Daqinghe watershed, the drought risk continues to be serious in the future.</jats:p>"

The research was conducted in one of the top ten trade companies in the emerging Serbian market. Simulation modelling was performed for one supply chain category, followed by quantification of time and cost performance of the current logistic processes (AS-IS model). Then, in accordance with the capabilities of RFID system, improvements are proposed and integrated into a new simulation model (TO-BE model).

This study is conducted by collecting thorough data of fire operation department over a period of five years and accordingly creating a valid simulation model to analyse the system under current operational conditions nationwide. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify factors that were statistically proven to have positive effects in reducing response time. A simulation model was used as a medium to carry out these experiments. The results of simulation model were validated at 95% confidence level. The effectiveness of the analysis is examined by incorporating related parameters from the ANOVA model into simulation model. The response time was reduced from seven minutes to three minutes on average per incident per fire station.</p>",

In this study, the parameters for dry season assessment are defined in terms of ‘no water days’ (NWD) and rainwater usage ratio. A simple socio-technical operational strategy making use of a water level monitoring system is proposed for NWD reduction. This involves water level monitoring, whereby daily water demand varies with user cooperation, as based on the available water in a tank. The results of our study show that an NWD as low as 10 can be achieved as compared with the current value of 115 days, before considering investment on additional roof catchments and tank volume. These parameters are useful for analyzing any type of rooftop RWH system. Furthermore, this operational strategy can be made practical and simplified by incorporating an easily visible and understood guideline onto the RWH system. This strategy is replicable anywhere in the world, with consideration of site-specific conditions such as rainfall amounts, roof sizes, and population.</jats:p>",

Using balanced panel data of seven countries covering 1991–2006, the study employs panel cointegration estimators, namely FMOLS and DOLS to estimate the long-run rice yield supply function and using one-step Blundell-Bond system GMM to estimate the short-run acreage supply function in the region. While the empirical findings from both estimators provide similar results, the estimates show that price of maize is a key determinant of rice yield and acreage and there is rice-maize substitutability in both the long-run and short-run in the study. The short-run Granger causality runs only from maize price to rice acreage, while long run causality of joint effect of the prices on the acreage supply is also evident in the study. Our results also show that the rice yield and acreage supply functions are unresponsive to own price in the short -run and long -run, respectively.</jats:p>",

Through an empirical study, the purpose of this paper is to identify a multitude of drivers that facilitate or hinder the implementation of ERP in business environments. Also, this paper determines its role in supply chain operations and assesses its impact on supply chain performances. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – To examine which factors drive the ERP adoption and gauge the level of the ERP success, the authors develop a research framework based on two well-known theories in the strategy literature: a contingency theory; and a resource-based view of the firm. This research framework allowed us to develop a series of hypotheses regarding the use of ERP for strategic sourcing. To test hypotheses, the authors carried out the study in three phases: a pre-pilot; a pilot; and a large-scale questionnaire survey. In the pre-pilot phase, the authors generated potential survey items through theory development and a literature review. In the pilot phase, the authors develop a structural equation model along with the identification of valid constructs based on structural interviews and the Q-sort method. At the last stage, the authors conducted a large-scale survey via mail questionnaires primarily targeting the Korean industry comprised of manufacturers and their suppliers and customers. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The firm’s ERP adoption and implementation decision is mainly affected by its internal environment. Defying the conventional wisdom, the firm’s external environment has little influence on its decision to adopt and implement ERP. However, through the mediating role of an internal environment, an external environment still indirectly influences the ERP adoption and ERP implementation decision. Also, the authors found that ERP could enhance the ERP adopter’s organizational capability and supplier capability. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study is one of a few attempts to investigate the role of ERP in the supply chain and identify important determinants influencing the ERP adoption and implementation decisions. Especially, in contrast with the previous literature which often gauged the benefits of ERP from an ERP adopter’s standpoint, this paper is one of the few to assess the benefits of ERP from the ERP adopter’s supply chain partners standpoints. Also, it is one of the first to assess the impact of ERP on supplier capability, organizational capability, and customer value.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Using the example of water demand throughout, ‘people oriented’ approaches are shown to deny complexity and homogenize ideas of the consumer and supply systems. The way in which this is enacted in current, dominant forms of water management and water demand is discussed. New and more responsive conceptual and methodological approaches are needed to address the existing and future uncertainties facing water sectors worldwide. ‘Practice‐oriented’ approaches are explored and shown to open up understandings of current diversities and complexities of demand and the patterns of these demands across populations. Such a conceptual and methodological reorientation reflects a need—potentially counter intuitively for those in the water industry—to <jats:italic>let go of the focus on water</jats:italic> and to instead focus on the <jats:italic>services such resources provide in everyday lives</jats:italic> and how these services could be more sustainably provisioned. Such an approach will assist in understanding current demand profiles, potentially improve the forecasting of future trajectories of change, and open up new routes for intervention to both water demand and water supply systems at various scales.

Using 1,144 unique focal firm‐years for U.S. firms from Compustat, we find that a supplier's and a customer's dependency both increase the focal firm's performance in terms of return on assets (ROA) and return on sales (ROS) by increasing asset turnover (ATO). As levels of supplier and customer dependency on the focal firm increase, however, the economic benefits of customer dependency diminish beyond a certain point, while those of supplier dependency continue to increase above that threshold. Thus, our findings show the paradoxically differing risks of the supplier's versus the customer's dependency, while establishing the unequivocal economic benefits of supplier and customer relations for focal firms in the middle of concentrated triadic relationships.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The purpose of researches is Kiev’s territory estimation from the point of view of hydrochemical groundwater changes security. Methodology The published scientific information about hydrogeology conditions of Kiev’s drinking groundwater horizon and complex changes for the period of their operation was analyzed. The groundwater complex (J2-3iv + K1-2zg-br) and groundwater horizon (J2or) were considered. They are used for drinking water supply from the end of XIX century. Were assembled and processed the groundwater chemical analyses actual data which used for drinking water supply. Data are accumulated and processed in geographic information system medium. Finding The problem of security for drinking groundwater in natural conditions and in conditions of anthropogenic influence is investigated. From the end XIX – beginning XX of century the groundwater complex (J2-3iv + K1-2zg-br) chemical structure has changed. The class of quality of water on ДСТУ 4808:2007 (State standard) as a whole has changed from first (excellent) up to third (satisfactory). The changes are unequal on the area and differ in various geomorphologic areas. The areas, on which there is an infringement of hydrogeology conditions under anthropogenic factor influence, are revealed with help of GIS-systems. The anthropogenic changes are fixed in the groundwater horizon (J2or) too. The researches of spatial mineralization change in the groundwater horizon (J2or) show that it essentially differs for different regions of city (fig. 1) and reaches the large meanings on the left coast of Dnieper. It also testifies to necessity of detailed researches of security of groundwater in view of geological and hydrogeological structure features.Results The areas of the anthropogenic violation hydrogeology conditions are revealed. The urgency of detailed studies of groundwater protection taking into account the geological and hydrogeology characteristics of the structure territory are proved. The received results may be used at designing system of hydrogeological monitoring</jats:p>"

This study measures and models THMs formation at two drinking water distribution systems (WDS1 and WDS2) in Ahvaz City, Iran. The investigation was based on field-scale investigations and an intensive 36-week sampling program, from January to September 2011. The results showed total THM concentrations in the range 17.4–174.8 μg/L and 18.9–99.5 μg/L in WDS1 and WDS2, respectively. Except in a few cases, the THM concentrations in WDS1 and WDS2 were lower than the maximum contaminant level values. Using two-tailed Pearson correlation test, the water temperature, dissolved organic carbon, UV254, bromide ion (Br−), free residual chlorine, and chlorine dose were identified as the significant parameters for THMs formation in WDS2. Water temperature was the only significant parameter for THMs formation in WDS1. Based on the correlation results, a predictive model for THMs formation was developed using a multiple regression approach. A multiple linear regression model showed the best fit according to the coefficients of determination (R2) obtained for WDS1 (R2 = 0.47) and WDS2 (R2 = 0.54). Further correlation studies and analysis focusing on THMs formation are necessary to assess THMs concentration using the predictive models.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The continental shelf adjacent to the Río de la Plata (RdlP) exhibits extremely complex hydrographic and ecological characteristics which are of great socio-economic importance. Since the long-term environmental variations related to the atmospheric (wind fields), hydrologic (freshwater plume), and oceanographic (currents and fronts) regimes are little known, the aim of this study is to reconstruct the changes in the terrigenous input into the inner continental shelf during the Late Holocene period (associated with the RdlP sediment discharge) and to unravel the climatic forcing mechanisms behind them. To achieve this, we retrieved a 10 m long sediment core from the RdlP mud depocenter at a depth of 57 m (GeoB 13813-4). The radiocarbon age control indicated an extremely high sedimentation rate of 0.8 cm per year, encompassing the past 1200 years (750–2000 AD). We used element ratios (Ti / Ca, Fe / Ca, Ti / Al, Fe / K) as regional proxies for the fluvial input signal, and the variations in relative abundance of salinity-indicative diatom groups (freshwater vs. marine-brackish) to assess the variability in terrigenous water and sediment discharge. Ti / Ca, Fe / Ca, Ti / Al, Fe / K and the freshwater diatom group showed the lowest values between 850 and 1300 AD, while the highest values occurred between 1300 and 1850 AD.  The variations in the sedimentary record can be attributed to such regional and global climatic episodes as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA), both of which had a significant impact on rainfall and wind patterns over the region. During the MCA, a northward migration of the Intertropical Confluence Zone (ITCZ) could explain the lowest element ratios (indicative of a lower terrigenous input) and a marine-dominated diatom record, both indicative of a reduced RdlP freshwater plume. In contrast during the LIA, the southward migration of the ITCZ accompanied by El Niño-like state conditions may have led to an expansion of RdlP river plume far to the north, as indicated by higher element ratios and a marked freshwater diatom signal. During the current warm period (i.e., after 1900 AD), the highest values in the element ratios and a pronounced marine to marine-brackish diatom record was found. This discordance between diatom record and sediment supply during the last century could be the consequence of an anthropogenic impact on the drainage basin and the RdlP system, expressed by the artificial increase in metal concentrations in the offshore sediments.\n                        </jats:p>"

The current paper addresses constraints in combating cultivar depreciation of wheat in India. National level data on quoted demand for breeder seeds and breeder seed production indicated a slowdown in the rate of cultivar turnover of wheat, with average varietal age increasing from 9 years in 1997 to 12 years in 2009. Analysis of cultivar adoption patterns among farmer households of Haryana State also indicates that farmers prefer cultivars that were released a decade ago over the recent ones. Cultivar turnover rates are found to be particularly low among marginal farmers. While the structure of India's wheat breeding and seed delivery systems might be the primary cause of slow cultivar turnover, a number of social and economic factors at the micro-level are also responsible. Many of the constraints to technology adoption and wheat productivity growth, identified during the Green Revolution era, persist even today.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Moringa oleifera leaf was investigated for nutritional quality, presence of tannins and its activity using polyethyelene glycol (PEG) and in vitro study of protein degradation in the rumen. The antibiotic growth promoter (AGP), Monensin was used as an external control to compare with the degradation of Moringa leaves. The different forms of tannin content in Moringa leaves were very negligible. Total phenol, total tannin, condensed tannin and hydrolysable tannin contents of Moringa leaves were 3.92±0.42, 1.19±0.14, 0.57±0.06 and 0.07±0.02 mg/g, respectively. The in vitro gas production, organic matter digestibility (OMD%) and metabolizable energy (ME) content of Moringa leaves were 54.39 ml, 77.44% and 11.14 MJ/kgDM, respectively. There were no significant differences in gas production, in vitro OMD% and ME content in the presence of tannin binding agent PEG. These results indicated that the different forms of tannin present in Moringa leaves are not active tannins, therefore, feeding Moringa leaves are safe for the ruminant animals. The kinetic study of in vitro gas production with Moringa leaves and Monensin showed almost similar results and there was no significant difference among them but higher values were found in the control indicated that Moringa leaves have the ability to inhibit the breakdown of protein in the rumen as of Monensin. On the contrary, soluble protein concentration was increased 182% with the addition of Moringa leaves compared to control and the values were almost close (213%) with Monensin during the 12h incubation period. The pellet protein concentration was also increased (119%) with Moringa leaves and Monensin (115%) compared to control although there was no significant difference between them. Therefore, it can be concluded from the present findings that feeding Moringa leaves appeared to be an alternative source of protein and are safe for ruminant animals. Moringa leaves have been shown to alter favorably ruminal protein fermentation characteristics thus spare protein by a decreased breakdown/deamination of protein/amino acids that functions as of Monensin.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjas.v44i1.23142              Bang.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main objectives of this socio-technical study are to investigate the Indian farmers’ biomass production capacities and their perceptions and willingness to supply their surplus biomass to fuel an envisioned biomass-based power plant in three selected Indian states: Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. For doing so, 471 farmers (about one-third from each state) have been interviewed in the field with info-sheet filled in by the field investigators. The farmers from all of the states appeared very much willing to sell their surplus biomass directly to a power plant. The farmers seem to depreciate the involvement of a middleman in the biomass procurement process. The farmers, however, appeared to highly appreciate a community-based association to regulate the biomass prices, with varying perceptions regarding government intervention. The majority of the farmers perceived the establishment of a biomass-based power plant in their region with positive economic outcomes. The farmers identified several barriers to supply biomass to a power plant where transportation logistics appeared to be the main barrier. The study recommends considering biomass collection, storage and transportation logistics as a fundamental segment of any envisioned investment in a biomass-based power plant. Biomass processing, such as pelletization or briquetting is recommended for efficient transportation of biomass at longer distances to reduce the transportation costs. The study further encourages the establishment of a farmers’ association aimed at collecting and selling biomass in agriculture areas predominant for small land holdings.</jats:p>"

WECC assessments can provide helpful information for resolving water issues. Since WECC involves a wide range of influence factors, indicator-based methods are useful tools for this type of evaluation. However, there are still some imperfections in the existing indicator-based methods for WECC evaluation, primarily in the aspects of index frameworks, indicator selection and evaluation criteria. Based on the pressure-support force-state index framework, this paper presents an indicator-based WECC evaluation method (PSSM). Using PSSM, overall WECC evaluation can be obtained by assessing the pressure of socio-economic development on the water ecosystem, the support from the water ecosystem for human development, and the health status of the water ecosystem. PSSM is directly focused on the pressure-support effect, and fully considers the determinant influence on WECC of the health status of the water ecosystem. The application of PSSM in Tieling City shows that further reduction in the pressure that comes from socio-economic development is still required, and the health status of the water ecosystem should be further improved.</jats:p>",

As per the latest and most recent data available, in 2012-2013 India’s total export of Ayush, Medicinal herbs and their value added products was USD 395.58 million. State of Uttarakhand in India is a natural habitat of the prosperous varieties of herbs, medicinal and aromatic plant species. The Government of Uttarakhand state has also realised this big potential and is continuously trying to tap this wealth. In 2012-2013 the state exported culinary herbs, Aromatic products and medicated products worth ` 29.0 crore. The aim of this study of MAP products in Uttarakhand state is to evaluate the impact of cultivation of MAP products, in relation to the new employment generation and also to study the supply chain management in context to the activities of various agencies engaged in collection, distribution and auction. This paper focuses on the cultivation program running in Uttrakhand by HRDI and its importance in employment generation in the hilly districts. It is very evident in today’s time that a strong supply chain is basic necessity for every organised business to sustain and to be successful in long run. This paper also studies the existing supply chain for MAP products and investigates the loopholes for further improvement so that the cultivators of MAP get maximum monetary benefits with minimum problems. In addition to that, role of different corporations like KMVN, GMVN and Bhesaj Corporation in marketing of these MAP products has also been discussed under the presented study.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/ijssm.v2i2.12396          Int.

The article aims to illustrate important impacts of the new rules on the VAT Law of the different EU Member States with particular regard to Germany. E-business as well as local tax authorities are faced with significant challenges in order to apply the new rules governing the place of supply of eservices correctly. The article deals especially with the definition of electronically supplied services, the determination of the location of the customer including presumption rules, the service commission framework and the mini One-Stop Shop ('MOSS') scheme. Some important weaknesses of the new rules are pointed out. Precisely, potential double taxation situations, technical, economical and legal difficulties in connection with the determination of the location of the customer and potential infringements of EU Law are discussed. The author analyses potentials for improvement not only on EU but also on German Level. Finally, useful information regarding the new introduced MOSS scheme is provided.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

The applied model follows the principle of aggregating all the costs of producing, transporting, and processing food crops on the different levels of the supply chains and increasing the non‐GM price premium of the final product for each level. Results indicate that ensuring coexistence results in a price some 7.4% to 13.8% higher for non‐GM food products depending on assumed segregation strategies in the two agri‐food supply chains analyzed. Altogether this study substantiates the suggestion that costs of GMO‐related coexistence in the food sector can only be traced by a case‐by‐case analysis and are influenced by multiple, dynamically changing factors [EconLit Subject Descriptors: L660, Q180].</jats:p>",

Currently, it is difficult for operators to make decisions in relation to water efficiency due to the lack of information about the relationship between pool operation and water use. This study has started to address this issue by reviewing water use at a fully operational facility. The analysis of the consumption data has led to a proposal for a new water performance indicator, the water exchange deficit. Modifications to the method of estimating water consumption have also been proposed to enable enhanced water management guidance to be developed.</jats:p>",

The data are treated with various methods: exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, SEM, cluster analysis, ANOVA, MANOVA and post hoc analysis. The results are as follows. First, external collaboration and internal collaboration have positive effects on each other, which have a positive effect on performance. This means that efficiency of internal processes is the cause of promoting connection with external processes and information generated from the market is the basis of a variance of internal processes, followed by high performance. Second, service performance improvement is more definite than cost performance improvement among different levels of supply chain collaboration. Firms can achieve more definite results in service performance when they perform supply chain collaboration. Third, this research verifies both the viewpoint of directions of supply chain collaboration and the strategic choice viewpoint of supply chain collaboration to better understand supply chain collaboration. Both viewpoints approach supply chain collaboration from different viewpoints but they do explain the methods for performance improvement.</jats:p>",

The proposed modulator consists of a parallel combination of linear class AB and switching class D power amplifiers that are controlled digitally. In the previous analog architectures, the requirements needed for the AB operational amplifier such as high‐current driving capability, high bandwidth and large output swing is usually obtainable at high overall static power dissipation. The digitally controlled power opamp presented here not only provides the aforementioned requirements but also reduces power dissipation compared with previous work. Furthermore, the digital control of the modulator makes it adaptive to the input signal variations in comparison with conventional analog parallel hybrid envelope modulators. The digital processor of the modulator is evaluated with a 45‐nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. The overall power consumption of the digital processor is around 142 mW at 1.5‐GHz clock frequency. As an application, the designed digital class AB is incorporated in a complete envelope modulator architecture. The overall efficiency of the modulator, including the digital processor power consumption, is around 82% at an average 32 dBm output power for a 5‐MHz input signal.

Aqueous solutions of the polymer at different concentrations were applied to modify the polyamide membranes through an in situ surface coating procedure. After membrane modification, cross-flow filtration testing was used to test the antifouling potential of the modified membranes. The obtained data were compared with experimental data for unmodified membranes. Each test was done by cross-flow filtering tap water for 60 hours. Yeast extract was added as a nutrient source for the naturally occurring bacteria in tap water, to accelerate bacteria growth. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, contact angle, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and permeation tests were employed to characterize membrane properties. The results confirmed that modifying the membranes enhanced their antifouling properties and cleaning efficiency, the fouling resistance to bacteria improving due to the increased hydrophilicity of the membrane surface after coating. In addition, the water permeability and salt rejection improved. This in situ surface treatment approach for RO membranes could be very important for modifying membranes in their original module assemblies as it increases water production and reduces the salt content.</jats:p>",

Sediments were collected from a river in Beijing, China and the suspended particles &amp;lt;62 μm were separated out and mixed with FC suspensions. The experimental mass specific concentration of attached FC linearly increased with the free-floating FC concentration, with the partition coefficient for four different sediment concentrations ranging from 0.2286 to 0.2695 L/g. Actually, the results can be well described using a single partition coefficient of 0.2565 L/g. The rate of sediment particle surface covered by attached FC was in the range of 0.32 × 10−5–0.58 × 10−5, and the relatively low rate gave a possible explanation of the linear relationship. The experimental fraction of attached FC significantly increased with increasing sediment concentration, ranging from 7.5 to 54.2%, and this was well explained by the linear partition model. These results proved that the linear partition model was valid in describing FC attachment to suspended sediments in surface waters and the attached fraction was sediment concentration dependent, while the impact of suspended sediment concentration on the partition coefficient was insignificant.</jats:p>",

A complete description of the fluoroscopic arterial anatomy of the canine abdominal cavity has not been published. This information is essential for performance of IR procedures to allow for improved preparation before and during a particular procedure. The primary purpose of this study was to provide a fluoroscopic description of the vascular branching from the abdominal aorta in a ventro‐dorsal projection with a secondary goal of producing pictorial reference images of the major abdominal arterial blood vessels. Five healthy female hound type dogs were enrolled and underwent fluoroscopic arteriography. During fluoroscopy, both nonselective and selective arteriography were performed. The nonselective arteriograms were obtained in the aorta at four locations: cranial to the celiac artery, cranial to the renal arteries, cranial to the caudal mesenteric artery, and cranial to the branching of the external iliac arteries. Selective arteriography was conducted by performing injections into the following arteries: celiac, splenic, common hepatic, cranial mesenteric, left and right renal, and caudal mesenteric. Fluoroscopic arteriography allowed for excellent characterization of the aortic ostia and the location of the lower order vascular branches. Future evaluation of vascular‐based treatment options will likely increase as the understanding of the normal and pathologic anatomy improves.</jats:p>",

A significant number of laboratory and field studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the BSF if utilized properly. However, our prior work suggests that multiple factors contribute to the effectiveness of the BSF in a community setting. These factors include: household education levels (HELs), socio-economic status (SES), additional interventions for sanitation and hygiene, water sources, and the relationship between treatment and storage. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to evaluate the contribution of these factors to diarrheal occurrence in impoverished households in two Brazilian communities along the Amazon River. The results of this study showed that HEL was the most important factor in reducing diarrhea, and the presence of a BSF was near ineffective. Furthermore, interventions for sanitation and hygiene as well as SES all contributed to a reduction in diarrheal occurrence. This study demonstrates that SEM can provide a platform to evaluate the complex interaction among factors contributing to a reduction in the occurrence of diarrhea. Furthermore, the results of this study highlight the importance of a holistic approach to the deployment of technology-driven solutions such as the BSF.</jats:p>",

These engines are mainly used in aeronautics, but many of them are also used in other, non-aeronautical areas, including marine navigation. Specific conditions in which fuels are combusted in turbine engines used in these applications are the reason why fuel mixtures of kerosene and FAME type should reveal relevant low temperature characteristics. The article presents results of tests of low temperature properties of mixtures of the jet fuel Jet A-1 and methyl esters of higher fatty acids (FAME). The prepared mixtures contained different contents of FAME. The obtained results present changes of: viscosity, cloud point, pour point, crystallising point, and cold filter plugging point, depending on the percentage by volume of FAME. They also prove that the course of changes of low temperature properties of these mixtures is affected by chemical structure of the biocomponent.</jats:p>",

The water relations of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OSR</jats:styled-content> and wheat were compared in lysimeter and controlled environment experiments to test the hypothesis that the growth of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OSR</jats:styled-content> is restricted to a greater extent by soil drying than wheat and to determine whether the greater sensitivity results from differences in root or shoot traits. Plants were grown, with or without irrigation, in 1.2 m tall lysimeters packed with a sandy clay loam soil. The experiment was conducted in an open‐sided glasshouse to encourage air flow and to resemble a field environment as far as possible; plant population densities were equivalent to commercial crops. Irrigated <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OSR</jats:styled-content> (evapo)transpired more water than wheat (498 vs. 355 mm), but had a comparable water use efficiency (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">WUE</jats:styled-content>; 4.1 vs. 4.4 g DW mm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O</jats:styled-content>). Oilseed rape showed a greater reduction in above‐ground growth (52% vs. 21%) and a smaller increase in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">WUE</jats:styled-content> (27% vs. 45%) when water was withheld. Oilseed rape also responded to soil drying at a lower soil moisture deficit than wheat; transpiration rates fell below the potential of irrigated plants when plant available water remaining in the soil profile declined from 54 to 23% compared to 38 to 9% for wheat. The root hydraulic conductivity of young <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OSR</jats:styled-content> plants, measured on root surface area basis, was about twice that of wheat, and was comparable on a root length basis. The results show that <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OSR</jats:styled-content> was more sensitive to a restricted water supply than the benchmark species wheat and that the greater sensitivity resulted from differences in shoot, rather than root, characteristics. The root system of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OSR</jats:styled-content> was at least as efficient as wheat at extracting water from soil.</jats:p>",

We have evaluated the effect of water quality and discharge between drippers used in sugarcane crop. Three trenches were opened and 21 three-rod TDR probes were setup in a mesh and a dripper was buried at 0.30 m, for each constant discharge of 1.0 L h-1and 1.6 L h-1. Comparing results from different wetted soil profiles it was observed that the vertical and horizontal dimensions of the wet bulb are similar for both MWS and TSE, being peculiars according to the discharges used and volume applied. Regardless the water quality, an increase of 60% in discharge decreased the deepest infiltration.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to measure the impact of the water supply and sanitation system on diarrheal diseases among children aged under five. The global burden of diarrhea was calculated based on the attributable population fraction, using information on prevalence and relative risks from the 2000/2010 censuses and a study by Pruss et al. The north of the State of Minas Gerais, the Northeast and Jequitinhonha regions had the highest disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates and ratios. The fraction of diarrhea attributable to the water supply and sanitation system was 83%, decreasing to 78.3% where sanitation had 100% coverage. An inverse relationship was found between DALY rates and attributable fractions and per capita GDP. Broadening the scope and coverage of services and improving the quality of water available in homes is an urgent requirement. These measures will bring economic and social benefits related to the reduction of diarrheal diseases and consequent improvement of the quality of life of children aged under five.</jats:p>",

For the intravenous (i.v.) application of capsaicin (Cap), substance P (SP), or histamine may induce endothelial gaps formation in the venules of airway mucosa, resulting in an extensive plasma leakage in normotensive SD rats. The aim of this study is focus on the mild hypertensive effects on neurogenic and immunogenic inflammation. The femoral artery of the commercial supply SDrat was cannulated for monitoring arterial blood pressure, and femoral vein was cannulated for injecting Cap, SP, histamine, or vehicle. The plasma leakage of trachea was evaluated by Evans blue extravasation. Five min after application of Evans blue and blood pressure recording, rats were perfused with saline and phosphate‐buffered paraformaldehyde. Evans blue content in the trachea was extracted with formamide and determined with an ELISA reader at 620nm. There is a significant negative linear regression on the degree of plasma leakage of trachea with blood pressure in neurogenic inflammation, but a positive regression in immunogenic inflammation. It is suggested a desensitization on neurogenic inflammation in airway of spontaneously hypertensive SD rat, but rat with hypertension may promote immunogenic inflammation that increased the histamine‐induced plasma‐leakage in airway.</jats:p>",

That is, it intends to analyse if the adoption of Information Technologies contributes to improve costs, time and customer service. To attain this objective a case study and content analysis methodology is used. Results indicate that there is a positive relation between the adoption of technologies, namely RFID, A.R. and the competitiveness of companies/supply chains. By the use of these technologies it is possible to improve several processes across the supply chain, as well as the reduction of costs related to labor, improvement in inventories and management of transport channels as well as an improvement on customer service. The improvement of these indicators has as consequence a gain in competitiveness allowing the companies to respond to the market needs in a differentiated way increasing by this way the customers’ satisfaction. As the information technologies have been considered very important for businesses it is crucial to improve our understanding on the main advantages associates with them and their contribution for competitiveness improvement of companies and supply chains, so this paper represents an important contribution for academics and professionals in this field.</jats:p>",

We develop a two‐period model in which a firm launches its product at the beginning of the first period, before it observes sales in the two periods. The product is successful with an exogenous probability, or unsuccessful with the complementary probability. The hype in the second period is observed only when the product is successful. The firm learns the actual status of the product only after observing the first‐period demand. The firm must decide the stocking level and price of the product jointly at the beginning of each of the two periods. In this article, we derive some structural properties of the optimal prices and inventory levels, and show that (i) firms do not always exploit hype, (ii) firms do not always increase the price of a successful product in the second period, (iii) firms may price out an unsuccessful product in the first period if the success probability is above a threshold, and (iv) such a threshold probability is decreasing in the first‐period market potential of the successful product. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is acknowledged that natural forest fires cannot and even should not be eliminated from the North American boreal forest. Forest fires produce immediate losses of wood volume, disrupt the conversion of the actual forest age structure into a target structure, and prevent planned timber supply (PTS) levels from being achieved. In this paper, we explore the extent to which periodic shortfalls in available timber under various burn rates can be mitigated through salvage logging and the tolerance of forest managers to a given level of shortfall, both as a function of forest age class structure. Simulations are done using both a deterministic and a stochastic representation of burn rate over time. Results show that the frequency of shortfall events can be reduced by salvage logging and by the introduction of measures that generate a tolerance to shortfall and that this mitigation potential is influenced by initial forest age class structure and burn rate. Results also show that even a 100% rate of salvage logging cannot fully compensate for timber losses to fire and eliminate fire-induced timber shortfalls. Furthermore, interannual burn rate variability reduces the efficiency of both mitigation measures. As the PTS is never realized under fire risk, the real cost of opting for different PTS scenarios should be estimated not from the difference in PTS but rather from the more realistic difference in realized timber harvest. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> On-chip capacitors are used for various purposes in electronic devices, for example, AC coupling capacitors, bypass capacitors, sample and hold circuits for analog signals, and so on. For these purposes, a high capacitance density is required for on- chip capacitors in order to shrink the chip size or to reduce the thermal noise. However, it has been difficult to minimize the capacitor size with a same capacitance owing to stagnation of capacitance density improvement [1]. To maintain the capacitance with a small capacitor size and a same dielectric material used, the dielectric film thickness must be thinner. However, an excess shrinking of the thickness of dielectric film causes the large leakage current and degrades the reliability. Therefore, an introduction of high-k material is a very efficient way to increase the capacitance density. In particular, Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, HfO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and ZrO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>have been extensively studied as candidates for dielectric materials of metal-insulator-metal capacitors [2-4]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is one of the most promising methods, because a good step coverage is obtained and the process temperature is relatively low. Most ALD is carried out at around 300 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C [4][5] , it is considered that the temperature of ALD is one of important parameter in relation to supply the metal organic (MO) gasses, such as Trimethylaluminum (TMA). </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> In this paper, using the developed ALD process equipment with high accurate gas flow system adapted to high temperature usage, the impact of the process temperature on the electrical characteristics was investigated. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Experiment </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Cz-n type 33mm Si wafers (8-12Wcm) were used. MOS capacitors were fabricated as follows. Si wafers were cleaned to remove native oxide film by diluted HF (DHF 5%), and after that Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>films were deposited on Si surface directly by ALD, followed by forming gate and bottom electrodes of Al by the evaporation, respectively. Electrical characteristics (I-V, C-V) were measured at five points on each wafer. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Figure 1 shows the ALD sequence. At first H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O was injected 1sec to make Si surface OH-terminated, after that the following ALD cycle was started. TMA was injected 1 sec, and H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O was injected 1 sec for oxidation. This cycle was repeated until the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> film thickness is about 20 nm. The following gas purge was repeated 4 times every time before TMA or H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O was injected. Ar was purged, by changing pressure in the reactor chamber from 133 to 27 Pa, and getting back to 133 Pa. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Here, TMA gas was accurately supplied as follows. TMA was supplied as vaporized gases, with heated to 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C (TMA vapor pressure: 9 kPa). In addition, the tube supplying the TMA gas was also heated to 60 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C to keep TMA gaseous. The TMA gas flow rate of 3 sccm was controlled by flow control system (FCS) adapted to high temperature usage [6]. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> We prepared three kind of Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3 </jats:sub>films formed at (a)room temperature (RT), (b)150 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C, and (c)300 <jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Result and Discussion </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Figure 2 shows J-E characteristics of Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> films formed at (a)RT, (b)150<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C, and (c)300<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. The variation of J-E characteristic increases, with the temperature increasing. As the result, The RT sample has small variation and high breakdown field intensity. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> Figure 3 shows growth rate per cycle as a function of temperature. The average, maximum, and minimum values are also plotted on respectively. It is found that the growth rate and its variability increase, with the temperature increasing. Only RT case, the uniformity of the growth rate is good and the value is about 0.3 nm/cycle , which is almost as same as the monolayer Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. However, the growth rates of the others are larger than the thickness of monolayer, and theirs variability is very large. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> These means that the complete ALD was performed at only RT, while the others’ deposition mechanisms were occurred at relatively high temperature. It is suggested that the decomposition of TMA occurred not only at over 300<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C but also at 150<jats:sup>o</jats:sup>C. And almost no decomposition occurs at RT, so that the high quality Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>films are formed. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p> These data indicated it is important that maintaining the process temperature in order to go on the ALD reaction on the surface, and not to decompose MO gasses. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Reference </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>[1]M.

Chapter 7.

Adopting realist review principles, the research questions and emerging findings were sense-checked and refined with an advisory group of 16 people. An initial key term search was conducted in October 2013 across relevant electronic bibliographic databases. To ensure quality, the bulk of the search focused on peer-reviewed journals, though this criterion was relaxed where appropriate to capture NHS-related evidence. After a number of stages of sifting, quality checking and updating, 879 texts were identified for full review.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-4\"><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Four literatures were identified: organisational buying behaviour; economics of contracting; networks and interorganisational relationships; and integrated supply chain management (SCM). Theories were clustered by their primary explanatory focus on a particular phase in the P&amp;SCM process. Evidence on NHS commissioning and procurement practice was found in terms of each of these phases, although there were also knowledge gaps relating to decision-making roles, processes and criteria at work in commissioning organisations; the impact of power on collaborative interorganisational relationships over time; and the scope to apply integrated SCM thinking and techniques to supply chains delivering physical goods to the NHS. Evidence on P&amp;SCM practices and techniques beyond the NHS was found to be highly fragmented and at times contradictory but, overall, demonstrated that matching management practice appropriately with context is crucial.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-5\"><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>We found that the P&amp;SCM process involves multiple contexts, phases and actors. There are also a wide variety of practices that can be used in each phase of the P&amp;SCM process. Thinking about how practice might be improved in the NHS requires an approach that enables the simplification of the complex interplay of factors in the P&amp;SCM process. Portfolio-based approaches, which provide a contingent approach to considering these factors, are recommended. Future work should focus on conflicting preferences in NHS commissioning and procurement and the role of power and politics in conflict resolution; the impact of power on the scope for collaboration in health-care networks; and the scope to apply integrated SCM practices in NHS procurement organisations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-6\"><jats:title>Funding</jats:title><jats:p>The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

However, the control performance is significantly affected by unknown time-varying load flow requirements. To improve the supply pressure tracking performance in the presence of unknown time-varying load flow disturbances, a nonlinear controller is designed based on the control-oriented mathematical model presented in this article. First, a disturbance observer is used to estimate the unknown time-varying load flow; a nonlinear feedforward controller is then derived using the differential flatness property of the system based on the estimated load flow; in addition, a feedback controller is implemented to stabilize the system. Sliding mode control is also used to compensate for load flow estimation error. The stability of the whole system is proved using Lyapunov theory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy has good supply pressure tracking performance. </jats:p>",
