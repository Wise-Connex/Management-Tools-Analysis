These approaches and assumptions are valid for some aspects of SCM but may also neglect or be unsuited to other questions and concerns that are distinctive to the SCM domain. Actor–network theory (ANT) provides an alternative perspective that addresses some of the blind spots of established approaches. We begin by describing the main theoretical assumptions and the dominant ontological position of ANT, in terms of three principles: relationality, heterogeneity, and performativity. We then show how adopting these principles allows an alternative conceptualization of the supply chain and of SCM itself and discuss the methodological implications of adopting these principles for research in SCM. ANT‐inspired research can make four major contributions to the development of new SCM theory. First, ANT can provide new theoretical insights into the dynamic and fragile character of supply chains, specifically regarding how SCM systems and devices are implemented, constructed, and transformed in practice. Second, ANT can enable the development of SCM theory that leads to a better understanding of how people in SCM roles really act when managing in the supply chain space. Third, the question of what and who manages the supply chain can be explored in radically new ways. Finally, ANT can provide a complementary perspective on power in the supply chain, serving as a good lens for researchers interested in exploring the politics of representing, interpreting, and stabilizing SCM practices and systems.</jats:p>",

By using a large, frequently-updated, publicly-available archive – O*NET, this research contrasts SCM and other business professionals to highlight the unique competencies that define the SCM profession. We find that SCM professionals need greater functional knowledge about operations (e.g., transportation, production), higher general knowledge in geography and foreign language, extensive interpersonal skills, and a person-oriented management style.   Furthermore, while limited differences exist between purchasing and logistic managers in the SCM profession, they exhibit certain competencies that distinguish them from operation managers.  Such results inform efforts at curriculum design, recruitment, career development, and corporate training by suggesting areas where it may well be advantageous to customize efforts toward ensuring that requisite competencies are addressed.</jats:p>"

Often, traffickers exploit legal supply chains to secretly move endangered species and protected wildlife to end consumers. Serendipitous discoveries of wildlife trafficking attempts raise concerns that existing efforts to prevent wildlife trafficking and other criminal exploitation of legal supply chains brought about by international laws, regulations, and voluntary initiatives may often fail. Indeed, most supply chains are designed for economic purposes such as efficiency or responsiveness rather than security. Scholarship in supply chain management has thus far dedicated scarce attention to the overarching phenomenon of illegal exploitation of otherwise legal supply chains, referred to as “supply chain infiltration.” Because we were unable to speak with perpetrators directly, we obtained insights from expert stakeholders in order to study the delicate and covert topic of what makes supply chains vulnerable to wildlife trafficking, as well as how this vulnerability can be mitigated. Our data set comprises 37 semi‐structured interviews with knowledgeable stakeholders concerning wildlife trafficking, specifically in maritime supply chains. This research develops a model that explains supply‐chain‐related vulnerabilities to wildlife trafficking and elaborates regarding how respective actors can contribute in addressing this understudied issue. We introduce the concept of “societal supply chain risk” to refer to hazards that emanate from or materialize within supply chains, which primarily affect actors in the supply chain context—and possibly even humanity in its entirety. Our research calls for more supply chain research, exploring situations in which individual firms may not be affected but can contribute to the solution.</jats:p>",

The potential for supply chains to facilitate the introduction of innovative management practices is seen as crucial to the sector's future success. Three ideas, “lean,” “green,” and “agile,” deserve serious consideration because of their potential to significantly improve supply chain efficiency. However, combining agile and lean principles to lessen environmental consequences is a relatively new issue that is not well-defined in terms of structure. Through a comprehensive analysis of the literature on lean, green, and agile paradigms, this chapter hopes to identify potential future lines of inquiry and identify knowledge gaps.

This paper aims to investigate the way in which blockchain technology is likely to inﬂuence future supply chain practices in energy sector.&#x0D;\nMethodology: A systematic review of both academic and nonacademic literature was conducted to gain a deep insight on the possibilities of leveraging the blockchain technology to create a more resilient supply chain for oil &amp; gas industry. Toward this goal, the theoretical foundations of numerous research papers published in high-profile scientific journals over the past few years, along with several reports generated by well reputable and prestigious consulting firms that have been used to outlook the potential and relevance of blockchain technology for energy industry applications.&#x0D;\nResults: Blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil &amp; gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil &amp; gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: This paper offers valuable insight for supply chain practitioners into how blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt existing supply chain provisions as well as a number of challenges to its successful spreading. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to explore the possibility of leveraging the blockchain technology to create a more resilient supply chain for oil &amp; gas industry. Blockchain is a promising breakthrough technology and is highly applicable to vast businesses. However, it is still hard to find empirical evidence to show the comparison between blockchain approaches and traditional approaches. In view of this, businesses should realize that blockchain technology has not yet reached an optimal level of maturity, and therefore thorough feasibility studies should be conducted before using this technology.</jats:p>"

The respondents of the study included managers in all 234 selected manufacturing firms. This research utilized a structured questionnaire to collect data. The study used SPSS version 25.0 to code, process and to carry out descriptive and inferential analysis. The analysed data was displayed using tables, graphs, and bar charts.&#x0D;\nResults: Supply chain technical alliances has positive and significant relationship with performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya at p&lt;0.05. This implies that upholding and enhancing supply chain technical alliances activities leads to improvements in performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya. The regression model established that the R value was 0.651 while the R2 was 0.423 which indicated that the variability of the supply chain technical alliances on the performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya could be explained by up to 63.1% of the model and the P-value was 0.000&lt;0.05. This implies that the model was fit to determine the relationship between supply chain technical alliances and performance of manufacturing firms in Kenya and therein make conclusions and recommendations.&#x0D;\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: While the existing Social exchange theory of supply chain technical alliances used in this study was validated, the study recommends that managers in each manufacturing firm need to consider having supply chain technical alliances strategies in place as it leads to high organizational performance. The firms should ensure they collaborate with other firms on technical skills, sharing technology and acquired knowledge.  The study recommended that manufacturing firms policy makers need to establish a policy framework to expedite effective strategies for supply chain technical alliances adoption to facilitate performance of their business operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: An effective and efficient last-mile delivery service plays a critical role towards the growth of global online retail sales. In Kenya, online customers have often been unwilling to shop online again, mainly because of delivery issues. However, the extent to which customers are satisfied with the last-mile delivery service remains unknown. This is despite the significant potential that the sector has, which remains unrealised in the country’s economy.Objectives: The key objective of this study was to establish the extent of customer satisfaction with the different elements of last-mile delivery service offered by online retailers in Kenya.Method: A quantitative approach was utilised. An online survey collected data from 467 online customers (‘users’ and ‘nonusers’) in Nairobi. The data were subjected to descriptive statistics and the mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the outcome of the study.Results: ‘Users’ were most satisfied with delivery options while ‘nonusers’ were most satisfied with delivery fees. However, both ‘users’ and ‘nonusers’ were least satisfied with returns. This study also found that ‘users’ were more satisfied with delivery options, delivery tracking and returns compared with ‘nonusers’. There was a significant difference in satisfaction with delivery options for ‘users’ and ‘nonusers’.Conclusion: Online retail managers are advised to improve the way in which they offer returns to their customers. This involves offering more options for returning the ordered goods, making it easy to locate the returns procedure on their websites and having a clear returns policy.Contribution: This study advances the understanding of last-mile delivery service, after comprehensive empirical evidence of customer satisfaction with the different elements of last-mile delivery service in Kenya.</jats:p>"

To study the impact of green supply chain management on enterprise value and its path of action, this paper examines the impact of green supply chain management on enterprise value, explores the moderating effect of the risk-taking level, and further analyzes the dual moderating effect played by technological innovation capability and supply chain concentration. Based on the micro data of 131 Chinese listed enterprises from 2014 to 2021, a panel-regression model is used to illustrate how green supply chain management affects enterprise value, and the results show that: 1) green supply chain management can promote enterprise value; 2) the level of risk-taking strengthens the promoting effect of green supply chain management on enterprise value enhancement; and 3) the technological innovation capability negatively regulates the moderating effect of risk-taking, while the supply chain concentration positively regulates the moderating effect of risk-taking. The research results of this paper enrich the path of the effect of implementing of green supply chain management on enterprise value enhancement, i.e., the process of green supply chain management to enhance enterprise value is regulated by the level of enterprise risk-taking, while technological innovation capability and supply chain concentration will also regulate the level of enterprise risk-taking and thus promote enterprise value enhancement. This research not only extends the research perspective and enriches the existing research, but also provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to implement green supply chain management to promote value enhancement and improve the level of green supply chain management implementation and the green development of enterprises.</jats:p>"

Countries with excellent health systems struggled to ensure essential supplies of food, medicines, and personal protective equipment which were vital to a fast and effective response. Using geo-legality, which maps the constitutive relations between law and space, we argue that the failure of supply chains in many western countries during the crisis reveals a fundamental tension between their role as facilitators of care and caring, and the logistic logics by which they operate. While supply chains link the intimate, domestic concerns of providing medical care with the globalised geographical concerns of moving goods across different jurisdictions at the right time, their contemporary organisation and regulation does not reflect the caring relations and public goods they are meant to support. Drawing on analysis of examples from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this article argues that a reconfiguration of supply chains in accordance with feminist approaches that place care at the centre of supply chain operation and organisation will be important to amendments of both domestic and global health law.</jats:p>",

The analysis carried out, using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modelling among other techniques, showed an increase in the importance of low-flow outflow from the upper Ropa catchment and a negative balance of inflow to the reservoir (Q&lt;2 m<jats:sup>3 </jats:sup>s<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>), manifested by a prolonged duration of low flows and an increase in outflow deficit during the year. The duration of flood flows and the runoff excess during these periods show a constant or decreasing tendency, while the length and excess of runoff increase during large floods. Thus, in the upper Ropa catchment, an increase in the intensity of extreme hydrological phenomena is observed. The prepared forecasts indicate an increase in annual runoff from the catchment in the decades 2021–2030 and 2031–2040 and a marked decrease in the decade 2041–2050. In the annual cycle, the projected changes in the coming decades will take different directions. In December only, throughout the entire period 2021–2050, the outflow will increase, whereas in May it will systematically decrease.</jats:p>"

By applying the PLS-SEM method through the survey of 290 managers come from travel agencies, hotels, and restaurants,  the results show that all four factors: internal environment of the business, external environment, pressure from environmental regulations, and green marketing both have a positive impact on green supply chain management practices at tourism businesses . In addition, the research results also show that the external environment and pressure from local, central, and international regulations directly impact the corporate image of tourism businesses. However, the results showed no impact of the internal environment and green marketing on corporate image. On the other hand, the research results also show the low impact of creating awareness from the internal environment of the business on GSCM. This study also discusses the conclusion, recommendations, limitations, and suggestions for further study.</jats:p>"

As the intermediary of the market, the enterprise gathers the supply and demand information of knowledge demanders and knowledge suppliers together through the virtual network platform, so as to achieve the maximum matching of the interests of both sides. For the actual knowledge service supply and demand matching problem, considering that the cardinality of matching objects may be large. Firstly, we propose a multi-attribute ordered clustering method based on probabilistic linguistic information, which makes the two-sided matching problem in the same ranked class. Secondly, considering that the preference information is affected by the subject’s psychology, based on the disappointment theory, the disappoint-satisfaction function is constructed to modify the preference information. In addition, the expected preference value is defined to ensure that the matching parties are mutually satisfied. An example shows that the method is effective and practical. The method proposed in this paper extends the application of knowledge service supply and demand matching method, and provides a theoretical basis for improving the efficiency and personal satisfaction of knowledge service supply and demand matching.</jats:p>"

This problem is relevant not only in terms of reducing the irregularity in the amount of electricity consumed by the iron ore mine, but also will increase the efficiency of energy consumption, which in turn will increase the volume of products (iron ore raw materials).

It is critical to understand how stakeholders perceive these actions to achieve the intended CSR advantages. The nature of CSR motivation has been extensively discussed, yet there are still gaps in the literature, including CSR orientation. Individual enterprises are no longer pitted against one another in modern global competitiveness; instead, a company’s supply chains (SCs) are opposed to those of its competitors. To be competitive, SC partners must be aware of stakeholders’ expectations, which are increasingly focused on sustainable practices. Apart from financial performance, organizations are increasingly held liable for the environmental and social impacts of not just their own operations, but also the operations of their whole SCs, which may include second, third, or higher-tier suppliers. As a result, from raw material extraction through product recycling, an integrated approach to SC management necessitates the development and maintenance of relational capacities across SC partners. In SC collaborations, a company’s commitment to CSR can be a critical aspect. Managing CSR becomes more difficult as SCs get more sophisticated and multitiered, and it attracts greater attention. In this paper, the key drivers that shape CSR orientation are identified based on the literature and are classified into three categories: internal, external, and SC related. A conceptual model is formulated using interpretative structural modeling and MICMAC to identify interrelationships among these drivers, based on the opinions of experts from the Greek market and academia.\r\nKeywords: supply chain, corporate social responsibility, drivers, interpretive structural modeling, Greece</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article explores the work of scientists in organizing marketing activities in a company, specifically in managing the distribution policy that involves organizing distribution channels, forming a portfolio of contractual obligations within the product portfolio, and developing a supply plan for each contractor. It is noted that the organization of distribution channels in a company must ensure: the creation of a system for delivering products to the point of sale or operation at an exactly specified time and with the highest level of service; minimizing costs for organizing the movement of goods, which should in no case affect the level of service. It has been proven that the advantages of including a wholesale intermediary in the distribution system are: ensuring product distribution in the absence of contact with the consumer; bulk purchasing reduces supply costs; reducing the risk of unsold products; favorable pre-payment conditions, etc. However, the negative factors that arise as a result of the inclusion of intermediaries in the product distribution channels are: a large number of intermediaries significantly reduces market control and complicates the interaction process with the consumer; dependence on a small number of intermediaries in the future can cause serious commercial losses. Therefore, in practice, in order to reduce risk, mixed forms of product movement organization should be used, which in turn requires the development of new methods and approaches to this process. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the need for re-organization of the existing distribution channel system arises when the company's production capacities are not fully supported by the capacity of the trade network. To diagnose such a situation, graph theory, in particular the adapted maximum flow problem, is used within the framework of this research. The authors stated that the result of applying the proposed models and methods is optimization of the existing distribution channel structure and development of further management methods for the company's distribution policy, including formation of its portfolio of contractual obligations and construction of a map of competitive advantages.</jats:p>"

In order to reduce these losses and support local water supply, subsurface dam construction projects are at the forefront in many countries, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, even in subtropical climate regions. In the literature, there are classical methodological explanations for underground dams with quite insufficient and restrictive interpretations. In this paper, two very similar but different new alternatives are proposed as longitudinally and laterally supported underground dams with inspirations from historical qanat groundwater subsurface structures. Both types are supported by artificial trenches with higher hydraulic conductivity than the surrounding Quaternary alluvial deposits to increase external and meanwhile to support internal areal recharge possibilities between the trenches and the surrounding natural porous, weathered and fractured layers. It is noticed that trench-supported subsurface dams are more effective, affordable, sustainable and manageable than classical alternatives available in the literature. It is recommended that a more refined subsurface groundwater movement mathematical formulation should be developed in the future.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is necessary to identify the risk and implement appropriate risk management strategies based on the impact factors of the risk. This study analyzed the impact of supply chain risks on the domestic automobile production network and maritime car carrier market. We quantified supply chain risks that arise in domestic automobile production processes and employed the vector auto regression models to analyze the effects of these risks on the automobile supply chain and pure car carrier market. In addition, using impact reaction function, we analyzed the process through which the risk in the supply chain extends to automobile production and pure car carrier market.

To this end, this study seeks to identify the impact of supply chain integration (SCI) on information sharing (IS) and the operational performance (OP) of Korea’s container-shipping industry from the perspective of social capital.\r\nDesign/methodology - We established the research model for this study based on previous studies. In administering the survey, we obtained 149 valid responses from employees working in liner-shipping companies and freight forwarders in Korea. With the collected questionnaires, the study’s hypotheses were tested using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0 Findings - The results indicate the existence of a mediated relationship where the impact of SCI on OP is mediated by IS. The effect of external integration (EI) on OP is fully mediated by information quality (IQ) and information-sharing content (ISC). Furthermore, EI, IQ and ISC partially mediate the relationship between internal integration (II) and OP.\r\nOriginality/value - This study expands SCI contexts, where ISC and IQ respectively serve as bridges between EI and OP which has crucial implications for container-shipping companies in terms of improving their performance.</jats:p>",

They are important for a bioeconomy to mitigate climate change effects by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The purpose of this paper is to assess Europe’s potential wood supply by harvesting system. Gridded forest characteristics data are combined with other European spatially-explicit data. A set of eight mechanized harvesting systems is applied to assess the “forest available for wood supply” (FAWS) in Europe. The results show that 74.9% of the total forest area in Europe can be considered FAWS and has the potential to be harvested under the current economic and technical harvesting conditions. The remaining forest area is under legal protection (4.3%) or has limited accessibility with the current mechanized harvesting systems (20.8%). Around 79% of the FAWS can be accessed with ground-based machinery, and another 16% if their operation range is extended using special attachments (e.g., chains or band) or winch-assisted systems. Around 5% of the FAWS is only accessible by cable yarding machinery. With the fully mechanized harvesting systems (i) harvester and forwarder and (ii) winch-assisted harvester and winch-assisted forwarder, about 80% of the harvestable forest area and growing stock can potentially be utilized.</jats:p>"

Objective was to reduce the involvement of man power for field irrigation monitoring purposes and reduce water requirement. This method can insure the proper use of water without wastage and save water for future. With the konwledge of moisture value in soil, we can estimate how much and when to irrigate crops. When the moisture content level on the output of the sensor or soil becomes less than 30% (desired value), then sensor generated an alarm and turns the motor on automatically. Displayed as ‘motor On’in the LCD display and soil level was shown as ‘dry soil’. Per hour machine data was received and shown in data table. A digital LCD Thermometer hygrometer Humidity Temperature sensor was also used to detect the temperature and relative humidity of the atmosphere with moisture content level was shown. Different field tests with crop and without crop were done. Total design cost was 4790 taka. Wet soil was tested with oven dry method to get accurate moisture level of the soil. Almost similar moisture percentage with moisture sensor was found. Temperature and relative humidity was also observed with weather station and found similar with sensor reading.

Contemporarily, agricultural development and the environment have reached a dilemma — providing more agricultural products for a growing population while decreasing hazardous gas emissions in the whole agriculture supply chain. A comprehensive analysis of the current research results that focus on contradictions between agricultural production and climate change is the central concern of this thesis. Several studies have explained climatic influences on agricultural products’ nutrition, quantity, and sustainability. And types of existing research papers explained how modern agricultural supply chains contribute to climate change. Current studies studying agricultural supply chains and climate change mainly use linear regressions with historical data from different countries and projections of future data. There are also some articles based on historical data demonstrating the main factors influenced by the environment in each part of the entire supply chain flow chart through a logical flow. This article focuses on analyzing the limitations of current research on climate change and the agriculture supply chain and developing potential future research directions to guide current research in this field. The significance of this article is the expanding consciousness of the side-effects of growing agricultural products’ yields and the urgency to consider climate change as a crucial fact to food security based on analyzing existing papers.</jats:p>"

This concerns, e.g., war, epidemics, natural disasters, accidents, strikes, political instability, and political sanctions. These are generally grouped under the term “disruption”. In order to avoid the risk of supply chain disruption, major disruption of supply networks, or loss of customers associated with disruptions, it is necessary to take preventive and proactive measures in supply chain management in terms of planning. This paper is intended to briefly summarise the current state of knowledge with the most important facts and derive a new definition from it. In addition, an analogy to maintenance is established for the first time. In doing so, a comparison of the concepts and a listing of the important proactive measures derived from them for increasing resilience are made. In the course of this, the field of action considered is extended from the exchange of suppliers through the entire supply chain network to the exchange of customers.</jats:p>"

Combined with the rise in population, this will impose substantial pressure on the water supply for vegetation, food production, and human consumption. Based on global measurements of water and energy fluxes and meteorological conditions, we find that ecosystems are efficient and conservative users of rainfall irrespective of biomes&amp;amp;#8217; type, location, and climate. It results in annual ET remaining at ~450&amp;amp;#177;200 mm, except in dry conditions where ET&amp;amp;#187;P. &amp;amp;#160;As a result, changes in the residual ecosystem water yield (WYe=P-ET) &amp;amp;#160;are greatly amplified relative to changes in precipitation. For example, at a site with a mean annual P of 700 mm, a decrease to 500 mm in annual P (28% decrease, well within expected climate change scenarios) would result in WY dropping from 200 to zero (100% decrease). Such changes could drive local ecosystems to their limit of sustainability and eliminate residual water for runoff and consumption. The causality underlying the conservative nature of ET is not entirely clear at present. But we can nevertheless conclude that the unsustainable state of WY&amp;lt;0 will be reached in many ecosystems much faster than expected based on predictions focusing on changes in P. This must be followed by drought-related tree mortality, land cover type, and density adjustments. It will also have a significant impact on water availability&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

In this investigation, the physio-chemical characteristics of water samples were assessed using tried-and-true techniques. To gauge the degree of bacterial contamination, the total number of coliforms was measured using a conventional membrane filtering method. Random water samples were taken and examined from a number of locations close to Baglung Bazar. The mean water sample’s temperature was 22.3°C. Maximum and minimum temperatures were reported in S6 (24.7°C) and S10, respectively (18.9°C). In filtered water samples, the pH was found to range from 7.29 to 8.1, which is within the acceptable range at the time of the study. The S7, S3, and S8 taps’ electrical conductivity measurements showed minimum and maximum values of 70 S/Cm and 145 S/Cm, respectively. All of the samples were within the 20 to 35 mg/L range for hardness. The iron readings typically recorded ranged from 0.10 to 0.35 mg/L. The S2, S4 and S8 contained the highest concentrations (0.30 mg/L and 0.35 mg/L, respectively). It was found that none of the samples in the current investigation contained Arsenic. Out of 10 sources examined, six (60%) were Coliform-free, while 40 (40%) were determined to be contaminated with total Coliform. The results of the investigation back up the claim that the drinking water in Baglung Bazar is currently unsatisfactory and unsafe for direct consumption. To prevent the spread of waterborne diseases, drinking water must be frequently tested and cleansed before use.</jats:p>"

This research optimizes COVID-19 pandemic logistics management as well as a green closed-loop supply chain design (GCLSCD) by basing it on carbon regulatory rules. This research looks at three of the most common types of normal CO2 restrictions. In the models that have been proposed, both costs and emissions are optimized. When it comes to supply chain (SC) activities, there is a delicate balance to strike between location selection, the many shipment alternatives, and the fees and releases. The models illustrate these tensions between competing priorities. Based on the numerical experiment, we illustrate the impact that a variety of policies have on costs in addition to the efficiency with which they reduce emissions. By analyzing the results of the models, managers can make predictions concerning how regulatory changes may affect overall emissions from SC operations.</jats:p>"

Government intervention (e.g, subsidy for green production, Cap-and-Trade Policy (CTP)) is a crucial component for diminishing carbon emissions due to the manufacturing of new products and recycling of used products. In this study, we investigate the long-term decentralized behavior of supply chain members and the evolutionary stable decision of the government to intervene in price and sales effort competition among retailers. More precisely, through an evolutionary game theoretic framework, we look for the non-cooperative behavior of the population of retailers who compete with each other over price and sales effort under government intervention and CTP. The model is further extended to analyze the evolutionary behavior of the population of government whether it intervenes or not in the same situation. Our study demonstrates that the whole population of retailers adopts the retailer-led Stackelberg strategy to deal with the manufacturer, and the most significant finding is that, in such a situation, government intervention is always favorable regardless of what the supply chain decides. Numerical results exhibit that whenever retailers dominate the market, it becomes beneficial for both retailers as well as the entire supply chain, and the environmental performance of the product also increases compared to the Vertical Nash scenario.</jats:p>"

The term “states” defines periods of low and high rates of economic variables of interest. Markov-switching dynamic regression (MSDRM) and time-varying parameter structural vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) are used in this paper. The contribution of this paper is not only based on the long run but also on the examination of the impact of the money supply in different states of inflation and economic growth. Moreover, the use of shock accounts for time-varying elasticity. It is found that there is a 0.70% decrease in the gross domestic product for a 1% increase in money supply in state 1, while in state 2, the money supply was insignificant. The money supply had a negative and a positive impact on inflation in states 1 and 2, with rates of 0.05% and 0.35% in the respective states. The money supply had a high multiplier effect on gross domestic product and inflation. More than 5 years were spent in each state for both gross domestic product and inflation, while the transition probability of moving and returning to each state is significant. The trade-off of using the money supply for economic growth and inflation is evident in South Africa. It is recommended that the state of the economy be considered when using the money supply in an effort to stimulate economic growth or stabilise inflation.</jats:p>"

To this end, a case study has been carried out in KCB on reclaimed water (RW) use for sugar beet and corn production. The first-term results revealed no adverse impacts on soil conditions irrigated with RW. Corn production increased by 7% with RW irrigation. Although a drop of 9% was observed in sugar beet yield with RW, the overall results obtained for the first-term period, both for corn and sugar beet, indicate that better yields could be attained through RW in addition to providing an alternative water resource, particularly in water-scarce regions.</jats:p>",

In Indonesia commercial vehicle distributor is the center of sales distribution, thus the marketing and sales team must be able to offer their product according to each customer needs. In the common practice, the offering is only based on customer budget of the vehicle price (owning cost) for the required specifications, without providing an understanding of the total cost of ownership which includes operating costs. The team's lack of knowledge aboutvehicle specifications and operating costs is the main cause, for this reason it is necessary to analyze the calculation of owning &amp;amp; operating costs and determine the offer for the type of commercial vehicle. The purpose of this study is to determine the type of commercial vehicle that must be selected in order to earn more profit for the customer, as well as to provide an investment feasibility analysis of the type of commercial vehicle selected based on the calculation of the vehicle's owning &amp;amp; operating cost. Vehicle selection analysis is carriedout using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) by comparing alternative vehicle options by considering the specification criteria, purchase price, and maintenance costs. In addition, an investment feasibility analysis is carried out using NPV and IRR analysis to find out whether the investment made is profitable or not.</p>"

Turbulent motions play a major role in the total mechanical energy of the flow field. It is difficult to evaluate total mechanical energy balance and energy loss for 3-D turbulent flows in irregular open channels due to the formation of vortices and the presence of secondary currents. In 3-D turbulent flows, the effect of these phenomena has often been considered as the empirical coefficient of energy loss. In this study, these details in the total mechanical energy budget are investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, a new form of the total mechanical energy equation and a relationship for the energy loss in 3-D turbulent flows are derived, and their applications are examined in open-channel transitions. For this purpose, the Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically, and the results are used to obtain the various terms in the total mechanical energy balance equation and analyze the details. The relationships derived in this study generally support the concept of the total mechanical energy budget to comprehend the turbulence parameters affecting the mechanical energy balance in various open-channel flows.</jats:p>",

Method. To achieve this goal used a wide range of general and special methods of scientific knowledge: dialectical method, graphic, trend, technical analysis, method of induction and deduction, analysis and synthesis, monographic. Results. The study revealed a downward trend in the supply of wheat on the world food market in the 2022/23 marketing year, which, according to experts, will significantly affect price growth and could cause a global food crisis. The reason for this situation is the decline in wheat production in major exporting countries, government restrictions on exports to some countries, weather conditions in France, the blockade of Black Sea ports by Russian troops in Ukraine. Thus, the dynamics of wheat prices in Ukraine shows that on May 9 the price of wheat fell to UAH 6,000 / t, but on May 16 it increased by UAH 500 / t, and on May 23 it fell below UAH 6,000 / t. In general, the slump in grain prices is very significant and reaches about 30% of the initial price. According to technical analysis, the forecast prices for wheat in December 2022 on the Paris Stock Exchange Euronext may reach 440 euros / ton, and on the Chicago Stock Exchange - up to 1360 c $ / bu. The scientific novelty lies in a comprehensive study of the situation on the world wheat market and highlighting the main trends in its development. The practical significance of the obtained results lies in the technical analysis of the wheat grain market on the two main world exchanges and the formulation of sound conclusions about the current price movement and further trend, support and containment lines.</jats:p>"

In this paper I evaluate the causal effect of the policy change on affordable housing starts in 2019/20. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design I estimate the treatment effect at 0.74 additional social rent starts per 1,000 dwellings in a local authority. Disaggregating by provider type, the treatment effect was 0.36 additional social rent starts by housing associations per 1,000 dwellings in a local authority. However, I find no causal effect for social rent starts by local authorities, or affordable housing starts irrespective of tenure. The findings suggest the policy was an effective, albeit limited, intervention for expanding affordable housing supply.</p>"

Data mining using observation methods, interviews, scoring key performance indicators in each perspective, and study of company operational administration data. Based on the results of study, the supply system based on 4 balanced scoredcard indicators still has shortcomings, namely in the value of debt-to-equity ratio, quantity and customer quality, internal business organization, and personnel accountability. The recommendation is that this study can have an improving effect on the object company and also be a reference for other companies specifically with the same segmentation.</jats:p>"

The problem of SC unsold product remanufacturing is investigated under the influence of efforts on recovery quality and information sharing within blockchain technology. Firstly, a functional model describes how the recovery quality affected by the added effort and demand of the remanufactured products is affected by the price. Secondly, the downstream SC faced market uncertainty with consumer sensitivity analyzed, and the SC information-sharing systems were reconsidered in order to improve consumer satisfaction. Then, under the conditions of information sharing and recovery quality efforts, the decentralized SC decision-making mode is discussed. The above demonstrates that the SC unsold products remanufacturing under the decentralized decision-making mode cannot be coordinated. To prove the efficiency of unsold products remanufacturing we investigated the centralized SC mode as a benchmark, which is known as the most efficient system. Finally, in order to effectively coordinate the whole chain, a mechanism of “cost and revenue sharing” is proposed, and the constraints of supplier’s choice of remanufacturing are given. The results show that the “cost and revenue sharing” mechanism can effectively coordinate the SC and the expected profits of downstream and upstream will be in win–win condition. Moreover, the “cost and revenue sharing” mechanism in a sustainable SC unsold product remanufacturing essentially builds an incentive among members to improve the efficiency of existing resource usage and the environmental implications.</jats:p>"

At the same time, the pandemic revealed how the World Trade Organization (WTO) must change to become more useful in the face of a public health emergency. This paper describes the market failures—especially on the supply side—justifying the domestic subsidies and contracting arrangements used to accelerate vaccine research and development and to increase the scale of vaccine production to save lives, livelihoods, and economic activity during a pandemic. It highlights the trade-offs associated with the US subsidies and the priority-rated contracts written for vaccines through the Defense Production Act under Operation Warp Speed. This case study reveals a rich environment in which cross-border supply chains exacerbate input shortages in ways that constrain vaccine production, highlighting the need for the WTO to embrace new forms of international policy coordination for pandemic preparedness and response. As part of a pandemic treaty, the paper proposes a plurilateral agreement on vaccine supply chain resilience that would include novel and enforceable disciplines for export restrictions, provisions to trigger coordinated subsidies across countries to jointly scale up vaccine output and input production capacity, and market surveillance initiatives on supply chain transparency.</jats:p>",

Data was collected from semi-structured interviews with procurement managers from Portuguese manufacturing industry and from reports, websites and companies’ internal documentation. To analyze the impact of green purchasing practices on company overall performance a conceptual model was proposed.Findings: The results support three out of five propositions of this research, and evidence reveals that green purchasing practices improves company overall performance. Provides evidence that the implementation of those practices positively influences overall company performance, it also identifies the most frequent green purchasing practices that may help businesses in adopting environmental initiatives.Research limitations/implications: While the sample included organizations from several economic sectors, it was based on just a sample of eight case studies and the findings may not be valid in different sectors. This research focuses on green procurement from a country's perspective, which reduces the ability to generalize the findings to other countries.Practical implications: Managers might utilize the results of this study to develop and implement green purchasing practices and enhance organizations' overall performance via their adoption.Social implications: This research contributes to the current discussion in green supply chain literature.Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing body of research on the effects of implementing green purchasing practices into the procurement function.</jats:p>"

Over the last two decades, the regional government of Tigray in Ethiopia has invested extensively in developing surface and groundwater resources for water supply leading to 61% of rural and 57% of urban populations having access to safe drinking water by 2020. However, the Ethiopian Government and its allies&amp;rsquor; invasion of Tigray in the early November 2020 led to considerable damage and devastation of Tigray's water infrastructure. This study assessed the damage to Tigray's water supply systems and determined the impact on its people. The study, conducted between late 2021 and early 2022, found that the destruction reduced the rural and urban water supply coverage of the region by over 50% (i.e., reduced to 28% and 25%, respectively). The war exposed more than 3.7 million people in Tigray to a shortage of drinking water supply and water-related risks, such as disease and food insecurity. Over the past 15 months of the war, the damage to the water supply infrastructures in Tigray was considerably higher than in other regional conflicts, with the damage in Tigray being 15% higher than the damage to Syria's drinking water supply infrastructures over 10 years of conflict and 6% higher than the damage to Yemen's water supply infrastructures over seven years of conflict. This study shows the significant and long-term impacts armed conflict can have on a developing country's water infrastructure and people. In future conflicts, monitors and aid agencies must assess this more adequately to limit the impact on civilian populations.</jats:p>"

Choosing the right packaging system can reduce the environmental impact and make logistics processes more efficient. These aspects are key factors for the competitiveness of companies. It can be concluded that in practice, the selection of a right packaging system in a company is mostly based on experience. In the literature, the choice of such a system is based on the analysis of the processes of a single company, i.e., no method has been developed to integrate the processes of several companies to optimize the choice of a packaging system. Consequently, several losses can occur, both at the system boundaries and within the company processes, for example, losses from unnecessary material handling, operations, product damage, etc. The aim of this paper is to present the concept of an innovative packaging management framework that can be used to select the optimal unit load handling equipment based on the company’s needs defined by simulation-based optimization. The application of the concept is also presented through a case study. It is demonstrated that the application of the developed concept can be a significant step towards the realization of sustainable supply chains through more efficient process design.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis paper analyzes the constraints on supply chain processes within the poultry industry in West Java, Indonesia after COVID-19 pandemic. During the upstream process, poultry feed costs fluctuates greatly and lacks of storage which causing feed supply constraint, the  mortality rate of chickens often surpasses 5% due to several factors including stocking density. Another identified problem adversely affecting the upstream process is the inability of small-scale farmers to procure their own Grand Parent Stock (GPS) since they remain dependent upon corporations to supply it, leading to inefficiency and increased production costs. Meanwhile, in downstream processes, the lack of a cold supply chain system and adequate storage capacity presents other challenges with regard to product durability. Consumer awareness regarding the relationship between food safety and health, and shifting in consumer preferences, especially during COVID-19 pandemic is also considered as a constraint in West Java poultry supply chain. To cope with those problems, several solutions such as technology and policy were offered to improve and solve problems in the supply chain process. Technology can be a powerful tool in addressing challenges in the poultry supply chain by providing efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions. While policy play a crucial role in addressing problems in the poultry supply chain by setting standards, promoting best practices, and providing a framework for action, regulate the behavior of the actors, promote transparency and hold actors accountable for their actions. A causal loop diagram is also made to assess the relationship between technology and policy in poultry supply chain process&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Interruption in the normal functioning of the chain may result in the risk of inability to meet the requirements of stakeholders. Given this, the aim of this paper is to define a conceptual model of supply chain resilience management. The paper is based on the conducted secondary research and analysis of the achievements of other researchers in this field.

Each agent geometrically discounts additional units by a constant factor. We show that when goods are complements, the incentive problem—measured as the ratio of second-best to first-best social surplus—becomes less severe as the degree of complementarity increases. In contrast, if goods are substitutes and each agent’s distribution exhibits linear virtual types, then this ratio is a constant. If the bilateral trade setup arises from prior vertical integration between a buyer and a supplier, with the vertically integrated firm being a buyer facing an independent supplier, then the ratio of second-best to first-best social surplus is, in general, not monotone in the degree of complementarity when products are substitutes and is increasing when products are complements. Extensions to profit maximization by a market maker and a discrete public good problem show that the broad insight that complementarity of goods mitigates the incentive problem generalizes to these settings. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Joshua Gans, business strategy. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: Financial support from the Samuel and June Hordern Endowment, the University of Melbourne Faculty of Business &amp; Economics [Eminent Research Scholar Grant], and the Australian Research Council [Grant DP200103574] is acknowledged. </jats:p>",

This study develops a multi-agent-based model of the e-platform supply chain to analyse manufacturers’ channel encroachment strategies and supply chain evolution. Through both direct sales channels and e-commerce platforms, manufacturers can sell two complementary products of varying quality. Consumers who have preferences compare the pricing information gathered from manufacturers through different channels before selecting the one that generates the best utility. At the end of each period, the manufacturers make a price adjustment using the genetic algorithm. We look at the supply chain evolution process through multi-period simulations and discuss the factors that influence encroachment decisions. We find that manufacturers’ channel encroachment is detrimental to the profitability of the e-commerce platform. Consumers’ channel preferences and quality preferences benefit the e-commerce platform and can discourage manufacturers’ encroachment decisions. In addition, increases in encroachment costs and commission rates can reduce manufacturers’ propensity for channel encroachment.</jats:p>"

Taxonomy clarifies decision models and research gaps with a deeper examination. The electronic database Web of Science is examined to uncover relevant articles. In total, 265 articles are analyzed in detail. The findings reveal that the blood supply chain gathers more interest from researchers, and despite the continuing dominance of the inventory stage, there is an upward trend in the literature for the research of the blood supply chain as a whole.

Wind energy turbines can be built in agricultural fields for groundwater exploitation and reduce the cost of energy supply for the pumping system. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of wind energy and economics on sustainable planning of agricultural water resources. A multiobjective framework was developed based on the nondominated sorting principle and water cycle optimizer. Maximization of benefit per cost ratio for the total cropping pattern and minimization of energy consumption for the growing season were addressed as the objectives of the nonlinear problem. The prediction of biomass production was made by simulating a hybrid structure between the soil moisture balance in the root zone area and the development of the canopy cover of each crop. The results showed that the objectives of the problem have been met by irrigation planning using climatic constraints and drought stresses. About 35% of the total water requirement of plants with a higher harvest index (watermelon, melon, etc.) is in the maturing stage of the shade cover.</jats:p>",

The need to perform repair and debugging work in the emergency mode is not always consistent with the current labor protection requirements, which were developed for the conditions of operation of engineering networks in peacetime. Given the existing and delayed impact of damage to the operation of engineering systems, it is necessary to take into account the existing conditions in the normative documents, which can be used in the future in major circumstances. Explosions near gas pipelines generate dynamic vibrations similar to pile driving during construction. In this case, the \"Safety Rules for Gas Supply Systems\" require inspection of welded joints along the entire length of the damage plus 20 m. Often, damage to a gas pipeline caused by an explosion leads to its displacement vertically and horizontally. Therefore, it becomes necessary to check the welded joints closest to the place of damage by a physical control method. If a defect is detected in the joints, it is necessary to check the next joint of the gas pipeline. In addition to through damage, there is a possibility of damage to only the insulating layer. Since it is physically impossible to check an underground gas pipeline, it is necessary to use an instrumental method to detect such damage. Not eliminated insulation damage will lead to intensive corrosion of the steel gas pipeline, and subsequently to the gas leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct an extraordinary instrumental examination, on the basis of which areas that need additional isolation are determined. An inspection and additional sealing of engineering inputs and outputs of underground utilities should be carried out. The buildings should be monitored for the presence of micro-concentrations of carbon monoxide and control of pre-explosion concentrations of methane.</jats:p>"

This study introduces a linear programming evaluation model that can simulate optimized facility configuration and operation, based on the power supply and demand. The novelty of the proposed model is the consideration of geographic characteristics, which influences parameters dependent on gas transportation infrastructure and electricity. A sensitivity analysis was conducted considering the number of units and location of SOFC-CHP introductions in the National Capital Region of Japan. As a result, it was predicted that SOFC-CHP would likely begin to be introduced in areas where there is a large shadow price difference between electricity and gas at each node. The total power generation will decrease, as transmission and distribution losses decrease, owing to the diffusion of SOFC-CHP installed in the vicinity of demand. The widespread use of SOFC-CHP is an economically feasible CO2 emissions reduction pathway. These results will help assess the introduction of various distributed power sources in addition to SOFC-CHP to reduce CO2 emissions.</jats:p>"

This system participates in decreasing the temperature of the brain and thus protects the body from thermal stress. Moreover, it influences body–water balance and has a crucial role in the retrograde transfer of neuropeptides.

Resilience-based decision-making requires a resilience evaluation process. However, the suggestions on resilience options can vary with the definition of the system's functionality considered in the resilience evaluation. Thus, this study characterized resilience and its attributes (i.e., robustness, loss rate, recovery rate, failure duration, and recovery completeness) in multiple functional dimensions for a WDN to contamination events. The resilience evaluation was performed using a resilience measure based on a time-dependent functionality variation during contamination events. This study considered the functionalities in four dimensions: the contaminated node, compromised demand, biodegradable dissolved organic carbon concentration, and consumed mass. The hydraulic and water quality models were simulated using EPANET-MSX to evaluate the functionality variation under bacterial intrusion events. The results noted that the resilience levels significantly varied with the functional dimensions and relatedness and contamination event conditions. The results also identified that different profiles of resilience attributes could characterize similar levels of multi-dimensional resilience. The findings suggest insights on incorporating the concept of multi-dimensional resilience in decision-making processes, therefore achieving the goal of improving the overall resilience of the system in diverse aspects of functionality.</jats:p>",

The Rippl method (RM) is used for optimal storage tank estimation. The net present value (NPV) and the discounted payback period (DPP) are used for economic analysis. Two scenarios were assessed using RM for (I) residential buildings and (II) public buildings. Optimal storage tanks for scenarios I and II were estimated by the selection of minimum roof areas to supply the demand for toilet flushing water for above 90% volumetric reliability. ArcGIS 10.2 was used to illustrate nationwide results of (1) roof areas and storage tank volumes, and (2) the economic analysis. The average DPP of rainwater harvesting system is 36 years for residential buildings and 23 years for public buildings. Based on NPV analysis, 17 out of 81 provinces are economically feasible for residential buildings. The feasibility status in public buildings is 43 economically feasible and 38 infeasible. More savings in public buildings can be obtained in a relatively shorter DPP. Furthermore, regularization is more effective in public buildings than residential buildings.</jats:p>",

The results suggest that the proposed model decreases the dimensionality of the input layer and consequently the complexity of the FFNN model with acceptable efficiency in the spatiotemporal simulation of GL and groundwater quality parameters. Also, the application of wavelet-based de-noising for modeling GL, pH and HCO3− parameters with ANN increases the accuracy of predictions, respectively, up to 11.53, 11.94 and 38.85% on average.</jats:p>",

Sequential Data Assimilation (DA), as an online method, is used to estimate complex hydrological models' states and parameters simultaneously. Although DA was applied for estimating the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model's state and/or parameter, the previous research did not pay attention to the model calibration by DA or the comparison between DA and popular SWAT calibration methods. This paper compares Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), a well-known DA method, with Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI2), a popular SWAT calibration method, to calibrate the model. We test the impact of the selected objective function in the SUFI2 application. We evaluate the results based on the multiple deterministic and uncertainty-based Goodness of Fit (GOF) measures and compare all scenarios based on the simulation accuracy, computational burden, uncertainty assessment, and parameter ranges. Results show that under the SUFI2 application, some GOFs might be located in unsatisfactory ranges while the algorithm obtains (very) good results concerning the objective functions. On the other hand, EnKF simultaneously locates most GOFs in (very) good ratings. Moreover, we found that the selection of SUFI2's objective function and the specification of uncertainty's error in EnKF have significant effects on the results.</jats:p>",

A synchromodal supply chain can be defined as a multimodal transportation planning system, wherein the different agents work in an integrated and flexible way that enables them to dynamically adapt the transport mode based on real-time information from stakeholders, customers, and the logistic network. The potential of synchromodality for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry is related to the nature of business. The FMCG market is characterized by relatively low margins and high turnover, which is especially important in export supply chains. However, for a company, it may be challenging to objectively evaluate the costs and benefits, not to mention the design of a synchronized supply chain. In order to facilitate the adoption of the concept and guide the practitioners, our study put forward the following research questions: What should be considered in incorporating synchromodality in the export supply chain for FMCG? How should companies approach tradeoffs among factors affecting the supply chain? To answer these questions, we propose an adaptable framework, which should be considered a primary contribution of our study. The framework incorporates the center of gravity model, mixed integer linear programming, and sensitivity analysis. The framework is validated using a real-world problem from a multinational FMCG company. The problem involves the optimal volume allocation and the selection of the most efficient transportation mode for inland freight. Our study demonstrates that incorporating synchromodality in the export supply chain could reduce the overall cost by 9% and enhance flexibility by allowing multiple modes of transportation.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, blood transfusion to needy patients must be effective and timely, requiring adequate transportation and supply chain policies. A weak transportation system could lead to blood shortages, delivery inefficiencies, and even contamination during the process. There are few blood donors globally; therefore, any wastage due to a poor delivery solution is ineffective.

In order to confirm this view, the effect of different power supply modes on the oxygen content and inclusions in electroslag ingot has been studied by adopting the self-designed electroslag remelting furnace as experimental equipment. The pulse heating inert gas fusion-infra-red absorption method is used for analyzing oxygen content. The analysis of non-metallic inclusion is conducted using an automatic SEM (i.e., scanning electron microscope) made by the American ASPEX Company, where the inclusion type and the inclusion size are determined. Results show that the oxygen content in the electroslag ingot increase significantly compared with that in the consumable metal electrode, whether under the frequency of 50 Hz, low-frequency, or DC. When DCSP (i.e., the consumable electrode is connected to the cathode of the DC power supply), DCRP (i.e., the consumable electrode is connected to the anode of the DC power supply), 2 Hz, 10 Hz, and 50 Hz power supply modes are adopted, the oxygen content in electroslag ingot is 155.3 ppm, 100.4 ppm, 75.8 ppm, 66.3 ppm, and 43.2 ppm respectively. With the increase in oxygen content, the number of inclusions in electroslag ingots increases significantly, and the increased inclusions are mainly Al2O3 inclusions. Regardless of the power supply mode, the largest diameter of inclusion is less than 20 μm. The electrolysis of Al2O3 is the direct reason for the increase in oxygen in the electroslag ingot when CaF2-Al2O3 slag is used. With the decrease in frequency, the electrolysis trend increases, and the oxygen content and the number of inclusions also increase. However, most of the inclusions are regenerated with the decrease in metal pool temperature and solidification, so the size is fine.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the conditions of growing interest in indoor air cleaning and strengthening WHO recommendations regarding the concentration of suspended particles in the air (should not exceed 5 μg/m3), there is a need to create clear rules for placing cleaning equipment on ventilation and air conditioning systems. This applies not only to objects that are just being designed, but also to already operated objects with a functioning ventilation system. After all, it is precisely at such objects that there are limited opportunities to intervene in the work of not only engineering systems, but also the operation of the building itself during repairs. The goals of the study were to obtain data on the efficiency of air purification in a given volume with the available air exchange rate of a functioning supply-exhaust system. A separate task was to check the data declared by the manufacturer regarding the pressure drop on the built-in HERA channel filter. The most effective way to clean indoor air from pollutants is considered to be its removal from places of permanent residence of people. Using a general exchange ventilation system equipped with modern filtering equipment, you can achieve significant results in improving air quality. In this case, the ventilation system in an office building in the city center is considered, which was equipped with an additional channel filter with a MERV16 (or HEPA 11) class filter cassette. This modernization of the ventilation system in half a year of operation made it possible to reduce pollution with particles in the size range of 0.3-10 microns in the air environment of office premises by 70...76 % with an insignificant multiplicity in compliance with the norms of the minimum value of air exchange in terms of the amount of fresh air according to the sanitary norm and allowed to avoid significant capital investments for the repair of engineering networks and losses due to the impossibility of operating the building during the repair. The conclusions of the study need to be checked in office premises with an existing ventilation system when recording a gradual decrease in the concentration of pollutants in the premises during the operation of the system in order to determine the optimal multiplicity to achieve the specified air quality when using filters.</jats:p>"

The focus of the text is a diachronic overview of wells and “cisterns” within the Samian Heraion. At the site 50 wells have been recorded so far. Three different types can be distinguished: shaft wells (including stair and so-called trial wells), groundwater flowing wells (“Grundwasserlauf­brunnen”) and flowing wells (“Laufbrunnen”). Round shaft wells with masonry lining are the most common type. Groundwater flowing wells, with a spatially and chronologically limited distribution, are so far only known from the Heraion. Although up to now only two flowing wells are known, it has to be assumed that there were more, since at least from Hellenistic to Roman times the water supply of the Heraion depended largely on a terracotta pipe system bringing water from farther away to the sanctuary. A closer look at the structures so far often referred to as “cisterns” reveals that they are in fact collecting tanks of wine presses.</jats:p>",

Product quality, service quality and market price are improved. In addition, we also discuss the influence of sensitivity coefficient on product quality and service quality. The smaller the cost coefficient of product quality and the larger the importance of product quality are, the better the effect of product quality improvement is.

Through the connection of the tested object adapter and the tested object, a circuit fault expert diagnosis and test platform are formed. Based on the traditional fault simulation model, this paper improves the fault logic circuit of switching power supply, designs the system model of fault simulation, deals with the logic structure and circuit hierarchy respectively, and produces the final output through the logic gate circuit by comparing the results of the fault logic circuit and the fault-free logic circuit. The designed switching power supply fault logic circuit works in the switching state, which has the characteristics of low loss and high energy conversion efficiency. Through the simulation analysis, the output is connected to the comparator, which plays the role of the whole wave. The simulation results are in line with the parameter indicators. The functional test results of the chip show that the function of the module is basically normal, which has practical application value and good portability and can be used as a reference for similar electrical designs.</jats:p>",

The small size of the island and the limited rainfall allow the formation of only seasonal streams. The only natural water resource of the island was the underground water. Consequently, the inhabitants of Delos used wells, cisterns and infiltration wells to secure the water supply. Wells are more numerous than cisterns and infiltration wells are rare. All of these installations are usually found in the courtyard of the house, but they can also be found in other locations, which generally indicates that they were kept there after a rearrangement of the house. The shape and size of these installations vary according to the nature of the ground in which they were dug, the needs of the house and the means at the disposal of its owners. The distribution of water supply installations in the houses is generally equal in the different neighbourhoods of the city, even if not all houses had their own water resource. The inhabitants of the houses of Delos seem to have used the limited natural resources of the island to secure the water that was necessary to a household.</jats:p>",

The causes of HAI are influenced by a complex combination of gaps in policies, infrastructure, organization, knowledge, healthcare worker behavior, and patient-related factors. Through knowledge, best practices, and infrastructure improvement, the infection prevention and control (IPC) team aims to prevent harm to patients and healthcare workers due to HAIs. The most common HAIs are surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by harmful device-reuse practices, inadequate sterilization, and/or inadequate decontamination procedures. Disinfection and sterilization of instruments and medical devices play very important roles in HAI and SSI prevention. World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre in Quality Improvement Program certification, the first pilot project in Thailand, included the Central Sterilizing Services Association of Thailand and 15 hospital central sterile supply departments (CSSDs). This quality improvement program for sterilization reprocessing aimed to prevent harm to patients and healthcare workers due to HAIs. <jats:bold>Objectives:</jats:bold> We sought to reduce damage to instruments caused by inadequate reprocessing sterilization to zero incidents. We sought to reduce inadequate packing to ≤3 events per month. We sought to reduce the need to resterilize instruments by &gt;80%. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> A root-cause analysis meeting was held by CSSD staff, and an IT vendor was consulted about developing an electronic alert system. The following changes were implemented: Staff packed instruments using a list of pictures for each set. Sticker labels were applied showing the proper number of pieces in the set. Identification O-rings were added to instruments with inventory dates, serial numbers, and instructions for use. Stickers were added to indicate the method of sterilization, such as ethylene oxide gas only or hydrogen peroxide only. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Reports of damage due to the sterilization process decreased to zero. No events related to the packing process were reported, and resterilization of instruments decreased by 98.94%. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> In this project, we implemented a quality improvement process and tracking system, reduced defects, and increased healthcare worker competency to improve patient safety.</jats:p>",

According to the degree of damage to the environment, methane is considered the second most harmful greenhouse gas emitted into the Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, improving the dependence of the efficiency of landfill gas extraction on the main impact parameters in order to increase the prevalence of the use of renewable energy sources, save fossil energy sources and simultaneously reduce the intensity of environmental pollution is an urgent scientific and technical task. The purpose of the study is to improve the mathematical model of predicting the efficiency of landfill gas extraction with the aim of increasing the use of renewable energy sources, saving fossil energy sources and simultaneously reducing the intensity of environmental pollution. The research was carried out by second-order experimental design using the Box-Wilson method using a rotatable central composite design using the developed software, which is protected by a copyright certificate. An improved mathematical model for forecasting the efficiency of landfill gas extraction in different countries was obtained, which, unlike the basic model, provides greater convergence with actual data, contains a significantly smaller number of coefficients. It was established that, according to Fisher's test, the hypothesis about the adequacy of the obtained regression model can be considered correct with 95 % confidence. The correlation coefficient was 0.99992, which indicates the high reliability of the obtained results. The resulting improved regression dependence can be used to increase the prevalence of renewable energy sources, save fossil energy sources, and simultaneously reduce the intensity of environmental pollution. The response surfaces of the target function - the efficiency of landfill gas extraction in different countries and their two-dimensional cross-sections in the planes of influence parameters are constructed, which allow you to visually display the obtained dependence and the nature of the simultaneous influence of several factors on the target function.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Risk management is an ongoing process that includes several stages of mapping and identification, analysis, and evaluation, planning, and implementation to reduce risks and ensure ongoing control. Risk management along the supply chains has become more significant in recent years due to an increased complexity of the relationships between components in the chain as well as various disruptions such as climate change, COVID-19, or geo-political scenarios. The current literature alongside the increase in complexity and frequency of risk events, leads us to the single, most prominent challenge in risk management today: the auditor’s subjectivity in determining the risk levels. Simply stated, two different auditors may assess a given situation differently due to their specific history and experience. Specifically, it seems to be extremely difficult to find cases in which different auditors, working on the same organization, made the same risk assessment. With that in mind, this research aims to reduce the human subjectivity bias and reach a risk evaluation that is as objective as possible, by using the machine learning approach. For this aim the paper introduces a new risk assessment framework based on factors analysis and artificial neural network as the predictive model. We first introduced a new approach of deconstructing the risk factors into their basic elements and analyzing them as a feature vector. Next, we collected unique, real-world data of risk surveys and audit reports from 60 industrial companies of various industries (from plastic and metal factories to logistic and medical devices companies). Lastly, we constructed a neural network to predict the risk levels of operational processes in the industry. We trained our model on 42 samples and managed to achieve a R2 score of 0.9 on the test set of 18 samples. Our model was validated and managed to predict the risk accuracy with R = 0.95 in accordance with the human auditor results.</jats:p>"

The rise in foreign exchange and prices of goods and services are among the key factors that causes fluctuation in the economic growth of a country. Thus, this paper adopted the ARDL model to examine whether real effective exchange rate, economic growth and money supply causes Inflation in the Gambia for the period 1985 to 2021. The finding reveals that all our variables causes inflation positively and negatively in the long run and short run respectively at a significant level of 1% except real effective exchange rate and money supply which is significant at 5% level in the long run. The recursive cumulative sum shows that the relationship was stable and the square recursive cumulative sum reveals instability in the relationship of our dependent and independent variables which could be as a result of exogenous shock in output and increase amount of public debts. The study recommends the Gambian government to be caution in taking increase amount of public debts and also the central bank of the Gambia to move from monetary targeting to inflation targeting so as to maintain economic growth and price stability. However, the central bank of the Gambia should assess the entire economy before implementing the policy.</jats:p>"

However, the challenge lies in tracking the asset among different blockchain-based supply chain systems. The model proposed in this paper has been designed to overcome the identified challenges. Specifically, the proposed model enables: (1) the asset to be tracked among different blockchain-based supply-chain systems; (2) the tracked asset’s supply chain to be cryptographically verified; (3) a tracked asset to be defined in a standardized format; and (4) a tracked asset to be described with several different standardized formats. Thus, the model provides a great advantage in terms of interoperability between different blockchain-driven supply chains over other models in the literature, which will need to replicate the information in each blockchain platform they operate with, while giving flexibility to the platforms that make use of it and maintain the scalability of those logistic platforms. This work aims to examine the application of the proposed model from an operational point of view, in a scenario within the pharmaceutical sector.</jats:p>"

Taunsa Barrage, Pakistan, was constructed in 1958 and remodelled in 2008. In remodelling, baffle and friction blocks were replaced by chute blocks and dentated sill. After remodelling, sounding, and probing data during 2010–2014 revealed that flexible apron in front of some bays was washed away. This study quantified hydraulic parameters such as free surface, flow depth, Froude number, roller length, velocity, hydraulic jump efficiency, and turbulent kinetic energy for stilling basins before and after remodelling using FLOW-3D. Comparing results with the literature showed that results in the old stilling basin were closer to the literature results. The results of old stilling basin showed linear trends of tailwater depths with Froude number and roller lengths. Results of the new stilling basin deviated from the literature results because relatively weak trends of tailwater depths with the Froude number and roller lengths were revealed; velocities were higher on the basin's floor; energy dissipation was less, and there was more turbulent kinetic energy on downstream. In conclusion, hydraulic studies for other discharges, tailwater levels, and turbulence models have to be conducted to analyze hydraulic issues in the new stilling basin.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Digitalization is essential for supply chain (SC) systems to thrive in the extremely dynamic and competitive business environment of the present day. The purpose of this study is to examine the role and the importance of absorptive capacity (ACAP) on supply chain innovation performance (SCIP), mediated by digital capability (DCAP), supply chain resilience (SCR), supply chain agility (SCA), and digital innovation (DI). The study has been designed to empirically investigate the hypothesized relationships on a sample of 116 firms across industries in Saudi Arabia, using a partial least-squares-based structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Based on the findings, all the hypothesized paths are supported, justifying that ACAP positively and significantly impacts DCAP, SCA, and SCR. Moreover, SCA and SCR partially mediated the relationship between ACAP and SCIP. This study contributes to the resource-based view (RBV) and a dynamic capability (DC) theories by examining how the innovation of digital technologies affects SCIP, providing empirical support to the ACAP and SCIP interaction through numerous mediators to develop SCIP, from which also many practical implications emerged. For instance, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses must improve their SC performance by building and integrating their ACAP to make the most of their digital-platform-based dynamic capabilities.</jats:p>"

Proactive movement, understanding, and empowerment have fostered the beneficial results of supply chain optimization, cooperation, and operational resilience. These pioneering activities are critical to achieving a paradigm shift in the supply chain, even agility in response to changing demand. However, sophisticated analytics such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are supposed to overcome these challenges to make smarter decisions on a daily basis. Due to these facts, this study aimed to model AI’s and blockchain’s role in supply chain optimization by conducting a systematic literature review based on the idealized framework of Rejeb et al. (2022) and the SALSA mechanism. In addition, this paradigm-shifting approach will provide fairer views and options for managing forecasting, planning, monitoring, and reporting across the entire supply chain. The emphasis remains on real-time accuracy, easy access, and optimization of operational indicators such as sales, visibility, and end-to-end supply chain operations at all times and from any location. It will be an eye-opening experience to enable stakeholders and partners to communicate information collaboratively, consistently, and efficiently.</jats:p>"

One specific bottleneck frequently encountered in the stacking yard is referred to as yard clash. This phenomenon results in longer loading times for containers and is caused by the stacking of containers with the same loading time for different vessels within the same limited yard block and the limited availability of yard equipment. To address this issue, a binary integer optimization model was developed and implemented at a major container terminal in Turkey to minimize yard clashes. The results indicated a significant decrease of 92% in yard clashes during the loading of outbound containers, which in turn led to an increase of 2% in the total number of containers handled per vessel per hour.</jats:p>",

This article took a consolidative literature review method where secondary information and data were collected. Numerous journals, research article, publications written on rural retailers were collected, analysed and evaluated. Renowned database and search engines like Google scholar, Elsevier, Emerald, and JSTOR were reviewed for collecting relevant journal articles and research papers. This study later presented a synthesized discussion on how as a vital link of the urban to rural supply chain, rural retailers act as a ‘lifeline’ of daily necessities. The realities that contributes to their success and failures are discussed as well. Subsequently, as the rural retailers have a very important role to play in the developing economy, the unmistakable need of further, in-depth research on them became very evident.</jats:p>"

The production, distribution and utilization of energy have become an indispensable pillar in the world economic structure and influence the development of international relations. However, due to the deterioration of the earth's environment, issues such as climate change have become a common concern all over the world. The international community needs to build a new order of energy transformation, from the use of fossil energy to the choice of natural gas as a transitional energy, and finally make renewable energy become dominant. In this context, carbon neutrality has been proposed and has gradually become a political chip in the new pattern since the 21st century, which is highly colored by geopolitical games. Regional power system integration, control of mineral resources and energy trade layout become the trend, so the traditional energy exporters try to realize the energy as possible diplomatic leverage before the energy transition, and countries and organizations trying to become leaders of the energy transition put forward the new concept of carbon border tax, trying to further implement new forms of international intervention of carbon intervention. This phenomenon has been demonstrated incisively and vividly in the Russia-Ukraine full-scale conflict since February24, 2022, that is, the impact of international security situation and relations on energy supply, among which the most severely damaged is undoubtedly the European Union. This paper will analyze the adverse effects of the outbreak of Russia-Ukraine conflict on the energy supply system of Europe from three perspectives.</jats:p>"

At the same time, non-kinetic warfare, destruction of functional society, attack on the logistics infrastructure and supply chain disruptions are observed. Civil Logistics and Supply Chains acquired the specifics of working in wartime conditions – constant danger, brittle, anxious, nonlinear, incomprehensible. The following two research questions were asked in the paper. First – how was it possible to ensure the functioning of the supply chains, overcoming logistics obstacles. Second – how are the events unfolding and what strategic consequences will the war have for Ukraine's logistics landscape. To answer the first research question, the focus group method was used (the representativeness of which was ensured by top managers of logistics companies). The answer to the second research question was obtained by the method of summarizing and systematizing figures and facts about the events that have a direct impact on the logistics industry of Ukraine, supplemented by the method for graphical visualization of research results – Futures-Wheel. As a result, the highlighted strategies that were used in managing supply chains when facing logistics obstacles caused by war can potentially be useful in other crises.

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct sufficient research on the market and user needs before setting the framework of digital twins for industrial symbiosis. We interviewed six companies in the Norwegian wood industry that could potentially share one symbiosis network. Based on the interviews, we analyzed the needs of potential digital twins for industrial symbiosis, aiming to understand the user’s point of view on digital twins for industrial symbiosis. The research is expected to provide intellectual support for future digital twins’ design from the user perspective. This paper not only promotes the design of digital twins for industrial symbiosis from the user perspective, but also provides an analytical framework for the user perspective analysis before the development of digital twins-based supply chain collaboration in the industrial symbiosis network.</jats:p>"

As the pandemic disruption of the global supply chains reached its peak in the Middle East region, with approximately 22 percent decline in turnover of goods transport companies in 2020, we empirically assess the impact of this decline on the revenue, demand of services, operation, wages, and employments in the logistics companies in the Sultanate of Oman. Methodologically, we employ the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, McNemar’s test, and Wilcoxon Signed- Ranks test to analyze the primary data collected from 61 survey questionnaire responses and 20 interviews of senior executives of these companies. Our results reveal unfavorable pandemic externalities on the surveyed companies’ balance sheet, demand for services, operational capacity, wage payments, and employee layoffs. We also observed strong correlations between the timely goods delivery and customs clearance and material shortages, and between customs clearance and material shortages. Our findings have practical implications for company executives to lessen the effects of the pandemic on the reduction of company income, service demand, operational capacity, salary payments, and employee layoffs.

Nesse sentido, os movimentos de empoderamento feminino atualmente são muito atuantes sobre a equidade em relação a carreiras nas organizações, mas em buscas rápidas na internet ao procurar por “Lideranças femininas” evidencia-se que os conteúdos se referem à baixa porcentagem de mulheres em cargos de gestão e liderança. Algumas áreas organizacionais são ainda muito masculinas, a exemplo da cadeia de suprimentos (supply chain). Esta pesquisa trata de um estudo de caso exploratório que objetivou identificar os motivos pelos quais a presença feminina é reduzida nesse setor. O estudo indica que há necessidade de ações afirmativas para estimular mais mulheres a ingressarem na área de supply chain e de maior divulgação das atividades dessa área dentro e fora das empresas de modo a alcançar o público feminino ainda nas instituições de ensino, de forma que direcionem suas carreiras para essa importante área das organizações.

In recent years, the dairy farming industry has generally improved in terms of equipment and product performance, but innovation must be linked to traditional product specifications. During cheese ripening, the storage areas and the direct contact of the cheese with the wood must be carefully managed because the proliferation of contaminating microorganisms, parasites, and insects increases significantly and product quality quickly declines, notably from a sensory level. The use of ozone (as gas or as ozonated water) can be effective for sanitizing air, water, and surfaces in contact with food, and its use can also be extended to the treatment of waste and process water. Ozone is easily generated and is eco-sustainable as it tends to disappear in a short time, leaving no residues of ozone. However, its oxidation potential can lead to the peroxidation of cheese polyunsaturated fatty acids. In this review we intend to investigate the use of ozone in the dairy sector, selecting the studies that have been most relevant over the last years.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a satellite supply chain framework, the Cybersecurity Supply Chain (CSSC) Framework, for the DoD in the evaluation and selection of commercial satellite contracts. The proposed strategy is informed by research on cybersecurity threats to commercial satellites, national security concerns, current DoD policy, and previous cybersecurity frameworks. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive approach for safeguarding commercial satellites used by the DoD and ensuring the security of their supporting components. Inspired by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800-171 requirements and the DoD’s future Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) process, the two-part framework significantly streamlines the NIST requirements to accommodate small businesses. It also extends key NIST requirements to commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) suppliers. The CSSC Framework complements the CMMC certification process by addressing the need for cybersecurity requirements for all subcontractors supporting a commercial space asset. The framework incorporates a scoring process similar to CMMC scoring, granting points to a subcontractor for meeting the cybersecurity requirements outlined by the framework. In addition, the framework creates a space architecture overview that details the overall bid score and establishes a matrix based on individual requirements. This model and matrix allow DoD acquisition personnel to closely analyze each contract bid, comparing the subcontractor's strengths and weaknesses to other bidders. The CSSC Framework will allow the DoD to apply NIST standards to subcontractors who do not meet the requirements for CMMC certification.</jats:p>"

To maintain the supply chain’s stability and sustainability, the dominant retailer tends to employ altruistic preference policies towards the manufacturer. The optimal decision, carbon emission reduction and supply chain profit are compared and analyzed under three decision models: (i) centralized decision, (ii) decentralized decision without altruistic preference and (iii) decentralized decision with altruistic preference. The results indicate that the carbon emission reduction rate, market demand and profit in the centralized model are higher than in the decentralized model. The retailer’s altruistic preference is beneficial to the improvement of carbon emission reduction, market demand and the profit of the manufacturer and the supply chain. Under certain conditions, carbon trading can effectively reduce the cost pressure of manufacturers and improve the level of carbon emission reduction and the overall profit of the supply chain. These results will guide low-carbon supply chain decision-making and provide insight into the research of irrational behaviors in supply chain decision-making under carbon policies.</jats:p>"

Yet, little research has been done on their construction, function and use. This prompted the organization of the workshop Going against the flow. Wells, cisterns and water in ancient Greece, held at the Swedish Institute at Athens on 28–29 September 2017, and subsequent publication of the contributions in this volume. This chapter begins by providing a background to why cisterns and wells should be studied, followed by the aims of the volume, i.e. to collect studies on Greek cisterns and wells that bring the empirical evidence into focus. Following this the chapter provides a background to the contributions by discussing the definitions of the terms “cistern” and “well”, previous research, and suggestions for future work. Finally, the chapter presents the individual contributions in the volume.</jats:p>",

The goal is to explore the relationship between SCMM and business performance from the financial and customer, innovation and learning, and internal processes perspectives. Industry characteristics (technological dynamism and the level of state support) are examined to determine their moderating effects. The survey was carried out on a sample of organizations from Bosnia and Herzegovina to test if the BSC approach can be a relevant framework for assessing the effects of SCMM on performance, and whether, as in many countries’ political legacies, the role of the government is significant in this relation. PLS-SEM was used to test the proposed hypotheses. The obtained research results confirm a positive relationship between SCMM and business performance from the BSC perspective. This relation is strengthened when an organization operates in an industry with higher technological dynamism. Interestingly, the results confirm that the level of state support does not influence the contribution of SCMM to business performance. This paper provides a more comprehensive view of the role of SCMM and an additional understanding of its contribution to multiple perspectives of business performance. Furthermore, the relevance of industry characteristics for SCMM and business performance has been illustrated by testing the moderation effect of technological dynamism and the level of state support.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current era that is characterised by growth in science and technology, free market beyond borders and globalization effects has compelled every  construction industry globally to struggle to resolve the increasing and overwhelming challenges raised by increase in clients' demands and needs. The  rise in demands and needs has led to a serious worldwide competition of which the construction industry and firms in particular from emerging economy  countries can no longer escape from. In the domestic competitive atmosphere, construction competitors have attempted to identify the  strategic competitive environment and potential adaptable market features targeting to lower unnecessary construction costs and time overrun,  improving quality, safety, and environmental sustainability while attaining value for money. Thus, to tolerate within a global competition environment,  supply chain management has been pointed to ease the construction projects’ performance. This study aimed at examining the impacts of supply chain  management on construction projects’ performance. One hundred thirty-eight (138) respondents were randomly sampled from three cities in Tanzania.  Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire, and the data were analysed descriptively. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to  validate the questionnaire. Afterwards, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted, and structural equation modelling (SEM) technique was used to  determine the validity of the study. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyse the data. The findings provided pragmatic  factors necessary for improving construction projects’ performance. Also, it was found that fourteen supply chain impacts had a positive significant  contribution to improving the construction projects’ performance. Moreover, the findings showed direct and statistically significant influence of supply  chain management on collaboration, integration, risk sharing and management as well as configuration. Thus, the findings suggested that supply chain  management cannot be isolated from other potential factors when one needs to attain an adequate construction project’s improved performance. Both  social and practical implications of the study are recommended to construction industry practitioners and policymakers in Tanzania to understand the  impact of supply chain management on construction projects’ performance to enhance performance improvement. Therefore, increased use of  information technology (IT) in supply chain management is recommended to improve construction projects’ performance.  </jats:p>"

Designing an efficient supply chain network that fulfills the expectation of both business owners and customers and, at the same time, pays attention to environmental protection is becoming a trend in the commercial world. This study proposes a theoretical model incorporating vehicle routing problems (VRPs) into the typical CLSC (closed-loop supply chain) network architecture. This combination assists all operators to act more efficiently in terms of environmental protection and profitability. A mixed-integer-linear-programming model for CLSC network design with fuzzy and random uncertain data is developed to achieve the goals. The parameters of the CLSC network are also programmed using hybrid fuzzy-stochastic mathematical programming. The model is for a single product and a single timeframe. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed mixed-integer-linear-programming (MILP) model. This study also investigated probabilistic possibilities for recourse variables with a trapezoidal fuzzy number using a problem size of four cases. The result indicates that the model performed well in the numerical test, suggesting it can help the operation to be more profitable if this model is implemented in their daily routines.</jats:p>"

Complex production networks were created with the goals of efficiency, closeness to markets, and output, but not always with openness or resilience in mind. This chapter examines how businesses in the value chains of manufactured products must rebalance their operations to better manage the inherent risk in their operations. Indicators of the risk in any given industry's value chain include the industry's susceptibility to various shocks and the inherent weaknesses of companies and the overall chain.

This paper develops a new hybrid NSGA-II algorithm augmented with a random multi-point crossover operator and a local search denoted by RLNSGA-II to design the multiobjective WDN. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm (RLNSGA-II) is tested on three benchmark problems, namely New York, Hanoi and Balerma networks. The results obtained are compared with the best-known algorithms available in the literature. The results have shown that the proposed algorithm RLNSGA-II has found better converged and distributed solutions for all three representative benchmark problems considered in the literature consistently and evidently when compared with the best-known approximation of solutions published. Furthermore, as the complexity of the WDN increases, its advantages over other algorithms become more significant.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, data on the volume of the suspended load was used. Diversity in its transport is mainly caused by the presence of damming structures. Correlation of morphological and hydraulic indicators was carried out, preceded by the identification and characteristics of all transverse and longitudinal structures located in catchments upstream of individual reservoirs. Analysis of the geological structure, as well as the structure of land use in the basins of the reservoirs, was also performed. The obtained results allowed for the preparation of recommendations for further work, allowing, among other things, an increase in water retention. The key factors for maintaining the capacity of retention reservoirs were defined, which may be useful in national plans or programs in the field of counteracting the effects of drought or flood protection.</jats:p>"

After a solid selection, the analysis includes 122 empirical articles from 2006 to 2021. The actors and competencies addressed in the relevant literature were identified and strategies used in their assessment were discovered. The identified competencies were then categorized and framed in the five constructs presented by Kroon and Alves. This approach evidenced that mismatches remain between competency expectations and competency supply in the accounting profession. Investigators may consider the results to improve the consistency of research in this field of study, contributing to a theory that is still lacking. Using the identified concepts and the constructs’ components, empirical studies can bring substantial practical implications to reduce or eliminate existing competency gaps. This study provides an integrated understanding of the literature on the fit between higher education institutions and the labor market of the accounting professional’s competencies. The framing of actors, strategies, and competencies will assist other researchers in augmenting knowledge in this area.</jats:p>"

The experimental results show that the undecoupled FO-DDPG algorithm has a faster dynamic response and more stable static performance compared to the fuzzy PID, DQN, traditional DRL algorithm, and decoupled controllers, demonstrated by a dynamic response time of 0.15 s, an overshoot of less than 5%, and a steady-state error of 0.00003.</jats:p>"

Drawing on a comprehensive panel dataset covering 284 cities in China from 2006 to 2020, the results of panel regressions reveal a U-shaped correlation between mayors’ tenure in office and the quantity and proportion of land leased to the service sector for the 2006–2013 period, when economic growth was the overwhelming indicator of political performance. Newly appointed mayors are more motivated to stimulate long-term economic growth and supply more land to the industrial sector. As their tenure in office increases, mayors become less concerned with maximizing long-term economic growth and opt to lease more land to the service sector for immediate one-off proceeds. However, the U-shaped relationship has disappeared since 2013, when the cadre evaluation system was amended to prohibit using GDP growth as the primary criterion for evaluating local officials’ performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To meet the demands of Oil Country Tubular Goods (OCTG) in PTEP, the company made a Long-Term Contract – Call Off Order (LTC-COO) with several OCTG manufacturers/suppliers in Indonesia. Since 2021, there have been two significant problems related to the supply of OCTG. First, two contractors in WA 6 could not fulfil the tubing demand totaling 10,581 joints with a value of USD 2,850,839. The second is four contracts LTC-COO at PTEP could not supply for 2022 needs, worth USD 28,579,436. The problems above are closely related to the price increase of global OCTG price. The proposed price increase could not be approved. As a result, contractors are unwilling to meet supply demand at the original contract price. Long Term Contracts are not fully effective if dealing with fluctuating material prices. The contract failed to supply the needs of OCTG as expected initially. In the end, six LTC-COO contracts had to be terminated early, with an unrealizable value of USD 33,982,587. The company is in critical because it does not have a contract to meet the OCTG demands. This study aims to find the best alternative to solve the OCTG supply failure problem. Several methods and analysis tools are used to simplify the study. BPMN, price, and risk analysis are used for business situation analysis. To determine the root cause using the Current Realty Tree method. Furthermore, for selecting the best alternative solutions using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Based on the research that has been done, the best alternative solution to overcome OCTG supply failure in PTEP is using a Technical Framework Contract (TFC) as a contract model for providing OCTG. TFC has main advantages: it binds a minimum of two contractors in a technical aspect and has flexible prices following market prices. The price is formed when there is an OCTG request. With these advantages, the TFC OCTG contract will resist to supplier failure, price increases, and open other optimization opportunities in inventory management. The TFC contract is expected to be effective in overcoming OCTG supply failures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vibrating equipment provides various technological processes, such as transportation, separation, compaction of mixtures. The electromagnetic drive is usually used in vibrating conveyors, feeders and other devices where vibration parameters are automatically controlled. Increasing the energy efficiency of such devices is an important task. The paper examines the influence of the power supply voltage on the energy characteristics of the electromagnetic vibration drive and determines the most effective voltage form. To do this, an analysis of factors affecting the efficiency of the drive was carried out. It was found that one of the factors is the time interval between the maximum current and the minimum value of the air gap, and increasing the efficiency is possible by reducing this interval by forming bipolar rectangular voltage pulses with maximum amplitude, which create narrow sharp pulses of the vibrator coil current. As a result of the numerical modeling of the processes in the drive, it was found that with increasing power, current pulses cause short-term deep saturation of steel, which leads to increased losses and reduced efficiency. Therefore, a zero voltage interval was added between the positive and negative voltage pulses, which limits the peak current values. The simulation of the processes in the vibration drive with the voltage supply of the proposed form was carried out, its energy characteristics were calculated: the dependence of the efficiency on the frequency at different load values, the dependence of the maximum values of the efficiency on the power. It was established that the use of pulsed power supply makes it possible to increase the efficiency of the drive up to 80% in the power range from 0.25 of the nominal value to the nominal one, which is on average 10% more compared to sinusoidal voltage. The dependences of frequency and zero voltage interval optimal values (according to the criterion of maximum efficiency) on power, which can be used in automatic control of the drive, have been obtained.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The opioid crisis in the United States has had devastating effects on communities across the country, leading many states to pass legislation that limits the prescription of opioid medications in an effort to reduce the number of overdose deaths. This study evaluates the impact of two categories of PDMP and Pill Mill regulations on the supply of opioid prescriptions at the level of dispensers and distributors (excluding manufacturers) using ARCOS data. The study uses a difference-in-difference method with a two-way fixed design to analyze the data. The study finds that both of the regulations are associated with reductions in the volume of opioid distribution. However, the study reveals that these regulations may have unintended consequences, such as shifting the distribution of controlled substances to neighboring states. For example, in Tennessee, the implementation of Operational PDMP regulations reduces the in-state distribution of opioid drugs by 3.36% (95% CI, 2.37 to 4.3), while the out-of-state distribution to Georgia, which did not have effective PDMP regulations in place, increases by 16.93% (95% CI, 16.42 to 17.44). Our studies emphasize that policymakers should consider the potential for unintended distribution shifts of opioid drugs to neighboring states with laxer regulations as well as varying impacts on different dispenser types.</jats:p>"

To maintain the stability of the emergency supply, risk prevention and contingency measures must be prepared. In this paper, the authors first obtain the initial risk value of 0.4 using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach and then build an improved SIR model based on a complex network to investigate the risk propagation law of the ESC. The simulation results show that (1) the high number of nodes becomes the initial risk source, the risk propagates faster and the peak value arrives two days earlier on average; (2) the initial infection rate gradually increases from 0.2 to 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, and the risk spread speed also accelerates; (3) the recovery rate of network nodes increases gradually from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, and the influence range of risk propagation decreases inversely; (4) appropriately increasing the deletion rate of network nodes is conducive to improving the stability of the ESC network. Given the above ESC risk propagation law, this paper proposes relevant risk prevention measures and suggests that a risk early warning system of node enterprises should be established in combination with the target immunization strategy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The climate crisis and the increasing temperature of the earth have highlighted the need to reduce carbon emissions in supply chains, which has gradually become a global consensus. The focus has often been on traditional carbon emission industries, such as energy and transportation, while the pharmaceutical industry has received little attention. This paper, therefore, aims to fill that research gap by exploring the carbon emission reduction mechanisms of the pharmaceutical supply chain, specifically the role of public participation. We constructed a quadrilateral evolutionary game model, based on evolutionary game theory, consisting of local government, pharmaceutical manufacturers, wastewater treatment plants, and the public. By finding the equilibrium point of the system of replicator dynamics, evolutionary stable strategies are obtained. Our numerical simulation shows the impacts of the principal strategy change and the key variables. This paper also identifies some management implications: 1) When local governments implement a combination policy (carbon subsidies and carbon tax policy), the key is to formulate a subsidy level satisfactory to the four parties. If the subsidy level is in the middle level, the four parties are at their most willing to participate in carbon emission reduction. 2) When local governments implement a single policy (carbon tax policy), the carbon tax rate becomes the key variable. A high level of carbon tax accelerates carbon emission reduction in the pharmaceutical supply chain. 3) No matter what policies local governments implement, the free-rider effect between pharmaceutical manufacturers and wastewater treatment plants always hinders their low-carbon decisions. 4) Public reporting is an effective measure for promoting carbon emission reduction in the pharmaceutical supply chain. When local governments implement a combination policy, it can reduce the cost of reporting and improve the willingness of the public to report. Finally, we put forward suggestions for rationalizing carbon emission reduction.</jats:p>"

The motivation is to create a solar collector design that would combine the functions of both a building cover and a solar collector. It is necessary to investigate and compare different types of solar collector coatings (traditional and modern) and pipe diameters. The purpose of the article is to solve aspects of energy efficiency for new eco-friendly solar collectors. The most effective result occurred with the solar collector covered with the rubber–graphite composition of Grafplast PDA, and when using Prandelli/Tuborama pipes with a diameter of 0.016 m. Their efficiency increased by 8% compared to the second version of the collector made using a more traditional solution. The influence of the distance between the pipes and the flow rate of the heat carrier on the efficiency of the solar collectors was evaluated.</jats:p>"

Logistics, which operates in the background, has been significantly affected by the enormous number of firms engaging in E-commerce. Examining the critical role of sustainable e-commerce logistics in SCM, this review article explores the importance of reducing the environmental implications of online shopping. It explores a spectrum of sustainable logistics facets, from green sourcing and efficient production to smart inventory management, sustainable warehousing, green transportation, eco-friendly packaging, and effective reverse logistics. By integrating these practices, businesses can optimise their supply chains, reducing environmental footprints while enhancing operational efficiency and brand reputation. The paper discusses key environmental challenges facing e-commerce supply chains, including carbon emissions, packaging waste, energy consumption, and resource depletion, proposing strategies such as green sourcing, efficient production, and eco-friendly packaging to address them. It also reviews existing literature, covering topics like intelligent logistics management analysis, sustainability in attended home delivery, semantic similarity for fashion recommendations, and sentiment analysis of public views on e-commerce. This comprehensive examination provides valuable insights for businesses and researchers aiming to bolster the sustainability of e-commerce supply chains.</jats:p>"

This research scrutinizes the Bule Hora town’s status of water and the practices and challenges of good governance in the water supply. The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methods. A researcher selected a sample of 99 participants from Bule Hora town households through a systematic random sampling technique. Findings show that the Bule Hora town's water coverage is 53.3%. The inefficiency of labor and ineffectiveness of the office to supply sufficient water challenge the town's water supply good governance. Moreover, the participation of the community in water governance could be higher besides problems of electric fluctuation, shortage of skilled workforce and manager rotation, financial constraints, and political interference in the water governance activity affecting the water provision of the town. It concluded that the level of effectiveness could be higher because Bule Hora town cannot supply pure water for residents with minimum cost, effort, and time. It recommends that the town diversify the water sources to increase the inhabitants' effective and efficient water supply. Further, the town needs to raise the participation of residents in water governance and activity.</jats:p>"

With this strategic behavior, this paper investigates a downside-risk-averse retailer’s integrated stock and pricing problem using a single case study method. Analyzing effects of the downside risk aversion and strategic customers is our purpose. By exploring a two-phase newsvendor model with a retailer selling to strategic customers, our work determines the downside-risk-averse retailer’s equilibrium ordering level and selling price. On this basis, effects of the downside risk aversion and the strategic behavior on the retailer’s optimum decisions and profit are analyzed. We find that the reverse effect of the strategic behavior can be mitigated by the retailer’s downside risk constraint. We also extend the model to a decentralized supply chain case. It is found that a low (high) downside risk aversion would mean that the supply chain profit in the decentralized case can (cannot) dominate the centralized under some (any) wholesale price contracts when customers are strategic. In addition, for different risk aversions, we also construct contracts to optimize the supply chain profit. Our results will provide reference evidence of making operational management decisions for the downside-risk-averse retailer in the case of strategic customers.</jats:p>"

Some researchers have pointed out the long and short-term impact of the epidemic on the fresh produce supply chain, but there is a gap in research on the prevention and control of risks at the end of the fresh produce supply chain. Therefore, this paper uses a case study approach to analyze the challenges encountered by fresh produce e-commerce in the context of the epidemic from multiple perspectives and provide recommendations for risk prevention and control. It is found that the risks at the end of the fresh food supply chain are mainly in the areas of environmental risk, supply and demand risk, and transport risk. In response to the above risks, companies need to improve the following aspects: cost reduction and loss, product quality control, and sales channel innovation to seize the opportunity to develop fresh food e-commerce and improve risk response mechanisms at the end of the fresh produce supply chain to drive its own development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to explore which attributes of logistics service quality (LSQ) are associated with the superior LSQ in rural territories of the developing economy of Ukraine. The data were collected from 52 Ukrainian agrarian companies. Ukraine was chosen because of the high potential of its agricultural sector, which has been one of the world’s largest exporters of agricultural goods for years. This paper investigates LSQ from the perspective of agri-businesses and addresses sustainability. The primary data were obtained in a survey of clustered samples of agri-businesses in rural Ukraine. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted with the Stata 16 software to test one hypothesis. This study builds on the expectancy–disconfirmation paradigm in service management research and the related service quality in order to compare the perceived and expected quality of social and environmental sustainability-related aspects of LSQ to test two hypotheses. The findings revealed that service quality in agricultural logistics is a five-dimensional construct. Its five dimensions are reliability, digital transformation, corporate image, environmental sustainability, and quality of customer focus. Furthermore, the study delivers evidence that the perceived and expected quality of the social sustainability-related aspects of LSQ are substantially different. As the study’s data collection process was interrupted by the Russian–Ukrainian war, the proposed model was only tested with 52 enterprises in an agri-food supply chain in rural Ukraine. Such a small sample is one of the study’s limitations. The research has great managerial implications as managers can use the explored attributes as a basis for customer satisfaction analyses or benchmarking in agricultural logistics. This is the first work exploring LSQ in rural Ukraine. The major contributions of this paper are the explored dimensions of LSQ with EFA. The study presents the first and most current data about LSQ from four united territorial communities in the rural center of Ukraine.</jats:p>"

The proposed system directly converts power from an AC grid to high‐frequency AC for WPT. The three‐phase WPT system with the matrix converter is effectively expands the lifetime of the WPT system. A novel hybrid commutation method, which is suitable for the WPT system with a resonant characteristic, is proposed to avoid the commutation failure of the matrix converter. The strategy of the proposed hybrid commutation is based on an estimation of the current direction considering the resonant characteristics and elimination of commutation in the critical area. The proposed commutation method achieves an AC input‐current total harmonic distortion (THD) of 4.7% with the resonant three‐phase load without a current sensor on the high‐frequency side. Furthermore, the proposed WPT system achieves a system efficiency of 88.2% at a load of 4 kW.</jats:p>",

In order to analyse the emotion contained in music from the perspective of product supply chain management, the psychological model and characteristics of music emotion are introduced. Additionally, the current product supply chain and the composition of the two contracts are analysed based on the characteristics of online music products. Finally, a speech emotion recognition model based on a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is proposed. Two corpora containing five emotions (sadness, anger, happiness, surprise, and boredom) are selected to test the performance and characteristics of the network. In order to evaluate the system performance, different acoustic features are extracted, including prosodic features, formant features, marginal spectral features, and Mel‐Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). The results show that the average recognition rate of MFCC features on the Berlin emotional speech database is 70.36%, which is 0.75% higher than the second‐highest edge spectrum features and achieves better results. Meanwhile, on this database, the Musical Emotion Recognition System based on FCM (MERS‐FCM) is improved by 20.36%, 7.34%, and 4.12% compared with Back Propagation, K‐nearest neighbour, and support vector machine, respectively, which shows that MERS‐FCM has better performance. The research of the music emotion recognition system based on FCM can provide more reference paths for the use and development of music emotion information.</jats:p>",

Extensive development projects, comprising resettlements after the civil war, resulted in more groundwater extraction. This study focused to assess water quality considering drinking by developing a Water Quality Index (WQI), applying Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and developing spatial distribution maps. Findings revealed more than 50% of samples reported total dissolved solid (TDS), hardness, and alkalinity values above the Sri Lankan drinking water quality standards (SLS 614:2013). 7 and 13% of sampling sites were in the ‘Excellent’ and ‘Poor’ subclasses, respectively. PCA results explained &amp;gt;77% of variability by the first four principal components (PCs). PC1 and PC2 reflect geogenic processes while PC3 reflects natural processes like high rainfall and PC4 indicates anthropogenic pollution sources. HCA rendered 122 sampling sites into three clusters. An integrated map of the WQI and three clusters discovers a predominant analysis of potable water quality, highlighting the deterioration of groundwater quality mainly in the study area's 18 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GNDs). Artificial recharging at the household level and introducing proper sanitation facilities and regulations in agricultural practices shall be implemented to improve the WQI further.</jats:p>",

Therefore, Samarinda attracts the peoples in the surrounded areas to settle in Samarinda. As a result, populations in Samarinda grow rapidly year-by-year. Data from Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) recorded that according to population density, those populations at 10 subdistricts in Samarinda are varied, in which the highest density is in Samarinda Ulu subdistrict, 5,869 people/km2, and the lowest density is in Palaran subdistrict, 286 people/km2. Such population increase along with the increase consumers’ awareness toward food security and environmental issues. Therefore, public interest in healthy foods will increase as the increase demand for organic products. Objective of the research was to find out market segmentation of organic vegetables in Samarinda to and determine the potential target market, so that it will be able to maximize marketing, which will effect on a product sale. The research was condustec by quantitative approach, which analyzes latent variables that relate to consumers’ purchasing power for organic vegetables using a scale in which the values can be measured. Location of the research was determined by purposive sampling, which was selected in accordance with the largest sales for organic vegetables in Samarinda and used accidental sampling method to take the samples of consumers of organic vegetables. Results of the research showed that market segmentation with the age above 40-50 years old has dominated the consumption and income of each family ranges 3 – 4 million and more. Market segmentation with level of the consumers’ knowledge about organic vegetables was 52.00%.  The consumers had high level of knowledge, and 4% consumers had very low level of knowledge about organic vegetables. The consumers’ perceptions against organic vegetables were 61.00% consumers agreed, and 13.00% consumers less agreed.</jats:p>",

The study has adopted a quantitative research method. The quantitative data were collected by conducting a survey of employees who work in construction companies in Australia. A regression analysis was used to analyze the data from 113 respondents. The findings of the study reveal that the construction sector in Australia has high labour costs, but workers are still thinking they are not getting paid enough and cannot invest more in themselves to improve their skills. There is a lack of academic and vocational training programs offered to them. Insufficient recruitment and incentive policies are also main barriers to attract talents to the construction industry in Australia. The situation became more serious during the COVID-19 period due to the lockdowns, lack of skilled migrants, and Government working visa policies. The study implies that firms should have a deeper understanding of the reasons for the skill shortage. Firms also need to devise strategies for hiring the right talent. Further, it was found that quality talent can come from the local or foreign markets. More effective selection criteria should be designed so that the best-fit approach can be implemented. Doi: 10.28991/CEJ-2023-09-02-08 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

Food losses occur at all stages of the food supply chain, including agricultural produce, harvesting, transport, storage, and processing. Food loss and waste are exacerbated by a lack of adequate and effective food supply chain management (FSCM). An effective food supply chain (FSC) includes designing processing and distribution centres, managing the cold chain, and designing reverse logistics. It also includes functions like allocating warehouse storage capacity, vehicle routing and material flow issues, delivery scheduling, and inventory management issues. Adoption of new information technology such as big data and Internet of Things can improve FSC performance and have a significant impact on reducing food waste and loss. An effective system for sharing information can enhance FCC performance, and intelligence in automated retail ordering can prevent food spoilage, while machine learning, and blockchain can improve FSC traceability. However, there are several obstacles to the use of technology in the FSC, particularly in developing countries. These are classified as technical, financial, social, operational, educational, and governmental. This paper provides an in-depth review of the existing literature on the FSC, technology applications in improving FSCM, key challenges associated with technology adoption, and interventions that may help overcome these challenges. It adds to the existing literature on FSCM, especially on issues related to technology adoption in the FSC by developing countries, and is a useful resource for students, researchers and food supply chain professionals.</jats:p>"

It is because these two provinces have the largest manufacturing companies in Indonesia. From a late survey, the researchers obtained data from 250 questionnaires that were distributed. Then from all the data, there were 218 data that could be processed for further analysis. This study utilized the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis technique with AMOS 24 software in the data testing process.Findings: This study has confirmed a number of findings including: With the current COVID-19 Pandemic, Green Human Resources Management (GRHM) and Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) are needed in Business Sustainability. GSCM has a positive effect on Business Sustainability (BS). Indonesia is also facing a revolution of 4.0 and 5.0, and Green Human Resources Management (GHRM) practice has an influence on BS and is deemed having significant and positive effect. In addition, manufacturing companies support the practice of green environment so that Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practice needs Digital Skill (DS) in enhancing its performance. Also, it has been proven in this research that GSCM has positive and significant effect. Digital Skill (DS), however, has no direct effect on Business Sustainability (BS).Research Limitation/Implications: This study focuses on the scope of green human resource management, green supply chain management, and green lifestyle and their impact on business sustainability mediated by digital skills. The next study is expected to examine the concept of green human resource management in service companies in order to obtain unique findings and confirm the relevance of the green human resource management concept in various business phenomena.Originality/value: This study explains the concept of Green Human Resource Management (GHRM), Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) and Green Lifestyle (GL) towards Business Sustainability (BS) which is a different concept from the concept of Human Resource Management (HRM) implemented in manufacturing companies. In addition, this study discusses the green supply chain in its influence on business sustainability. Also, this study explains the role of the concept of Digital Skills (DS) in influencing Business Sustainability (BS).Practical and Social Implication: This study is expected to be a reference for practitioners, especially in the fields of Green Human Resource Management (GHRM), Green Lifestyle (GL), and Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) in improving Business Sustainability (BS). Furthermore, the concept of green human resource management can be used by organizations as an effective alternative to increase responsibility in increasing business sustainability. Digital skills have a very significant role in implementing the research model.</jats:p>"

Lack of access to clean water in Afghanistan is a matter of serious concern. Two decades ago, when Afghanistan was facing a major crisis, 80% of the population used drains, canals and other stagnant water, which led to various diseases. Then, after the American presence in Afghanistan, a new government was formed. In 2001, the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) launched a program called RU-WatSip to improve access to clean water in rural areas. Implement clean water supply programs and projects, which have hit every village in Afghanistan, a decade later, according to a UNICEF survey, 67% of the population in Afghanistan had access to clean water. Which were pollution-free, whereas in the early stages only 20% of Afghanistan’s population had access to clean water. [1]</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) has implemented various clean water supply projects in different rural areas, although the basic needs of the people have been met with the implementation of these projects.

In this paper, the authors conducted a systematic literature review to explore this phenomenon from a systems thinking standpoint. The findings revealed that each approach is founded on a different systemic paradigm, makes different assumptions on the nature of social responsibility issues, and has different objectives when resolving them. Therefore, employing any of these approaches alone will certainly fail given their underlying systemic limitations. The findings also revealed that these approaches are complementary from a critical systems thinking perspective, hence, researchers and practitioners can use their tools and methods together in the form of tailored interventions to better address efficiency, subjectivity, and fairness when resolving social responsibility issues. This paper concludes by proposing a practical framework based on critical systems practice which encompasses four systemic paradigms allowing the inclusion of a spectrum of perspectives, and assumptions. </jats:p>",

For this purpose, the model inputs are divided into three subcomponents with Daubechies 10 mother wavelets. Subcomponents with the highest correlation were chosen as inputs. The most suitable models were selected by dividing the inputs into 3–7 sub-sets, using 11 different lagged input combinations, and testing various membership functions. In establishing the ANFIS model, 75% of the data were used for training and 25% for testing. The performance of ANFIS models was evaluated with root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient, determination coefficients, and Taylor diagram. A model with two sub-sets, a hybrid learning algorithm, a Gbellmf membership function, and 400 iterations was selected as the most suitable. It was concluded that the W-ANFIS model used with the wavelet transform method increased the success of the established ANFIS model. Moreover, it was suggested that the W-ANFIS hybrid machine learning model established in the study can be used effectively in similar climatic regions fed by snowmelt and dominated by a semi-arid climate.</jats:p>",

The method is based on the analysis of differences that occur during double measurements of the same mass using different instruments during each delivery-acceptance operation. The analysis of these differences was performed using the least squares method (LSM) by composition and solving equations. As a result, LSM-balanced mass values were obtained for each petroleum delivery-acceptance operation and for the supply network as a whole. Balancing is performed by detecting losses that occur before the mass measurements or during the mass measurements of each measuring instrument. Additive and/or multiplicative losses can be detected. The additives have the same losses for each delivery-acceptance operation, regardless of the measured mass. The multiplicative losses increased in proportion to the measured mass. The measurement uncertainty was strictly developed according to the LSM. The simulated test example shows that the losses were determined with a sufficiently high accuracy. A key condition for this is to ensure the traceability of the mass measurements by calibrating all measuring devices involved in the network. The application of this method will allow petroleum products suppliers to find and eliminate sources of excessive natural and technological losses in a timely manner. It is of equal importance to identify weaknesses in the supply network where thefts can occur.</jats:p>",

However, drinking water is used for agriculture and other non-drinking purposes owing to the fixed tariff system. Consequently, the overall level of water services has deteriorated and generated revenue is insufficient for operation and maintenance costs. Therefore, a project aimed to improve the quality of water supply services by providing hardware support, such as construction of wells and renewal of water distribution pipes, was conducted. However, because hardware improvement alone cannot sufficiently enhance water supply services, software support to improve the capacity of Vodokanal (utility) staff, including preparation of a metered tariff system, was implemented through a technical cooperation project. The project successfully raised customer awareness of water conservation, and the water consumption rate was reduced to two-thirds of that before implementation of the project. Additionally, the water quantity, quality, pressure, and supply hours in the target area were significantly improved. Despite the resulting increase in financial burden, customer satisfaction regarding the water supply was enhanced from 51% before the project to 100% in the second half of the project. Simultaneously, the water supply revenue increased by 24% and this increase contributed to sustainable water supply management.</jats:p>"

The data were collected electronically and analysed using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) 4.0. Around 375 companies participated in the survey. The results show the positive path links from predictors (marketing data sharing, digital technology adoption, and data security governance) and criteria. It also finds that data security and marketing data sharing have impacted digital technology adoption, leading to the supply chain’s resilience. The research has concluded that the secure sharing of the data-driven supply chain can improve a firm’s resilience.

The purpose of our study is to find out whether this anti-China sentiment affected the stock return of the companies dependent on Chinese supply chain vis-à-vis the companies those do not have a Chinese supply chain link.&#x0D;\nMethodology: To analyze the impact of announcements on lockdown and relief measures by the government on stock market data, we use the dummy variable approach in the event methodology suggested by Karafiath (1988). We observe the stock market reaction to lockdown and relief measure announcements on consecutive seven days after the announcement.&#x0D;\nFindings: Overall findings show us that investors did not have a negative outlook on firms with Chinese suppliers. The investors are either not aware of the companies' Chinese supply link or do not consider these at the time of investing. The potential problems associated with supply chain disruptions are overlooked if we do not consider the supply chain information when investing.&#x0D;\nOriginality: Our paper is unique because there is no study on the supply chain glitches of Indian companies’ dependent on the Chinese supply chain due to the Covid-19 breakout.</jats:p>"

We examine the underlying cause of price instability in Pakistan's broiler and chick markets. To this end, we utilize findings from our fieldwork and estimates from unobserved component‐models to formulate a theoretical model of endogenous price fluctuations in the chicken supply chain of Pakistan. Under standard assumptions, we derive hypotheses from our theoretical model that can be tested by using vector autoregressions and weekly data on broiler and chick (farm‐gate) prices in Pakistan. Our empirical estimates conform to the predictions of our theoretical model, and evidence of endogenous dynamics in observed prices is robust to alternative specifications and estimation methods. We use numerical simulations to illustrate that empirically grounded parameterizations of our theoretical model can emulate the salient features of broiler and chick price fluctuations in Pakistan. The accumulation of evidence from our descriptive, empirical, and numerical analysis builds a compelling case for the endogenous nature of price instability in Pakistan's chicken supply chain.</jats:p>",

Nowadays, with the development of behavioral economics, social preference theory has been widely used in supply chain research. These social preferences are distinct from economic motivation and will influence agents’ behaviors in the supply chain. Agents will make decisions based on not only self-interests but also the interests of others, reciprocity, and fairness. This paper introduces the relationship and status preferences in the utility function. We aim to analyze the impact of social preference on individual competition intensity in the supply chain. A Stackelberg game model (tacit collusion) is used as the theoretical framework of the choice behavior between competition and cooperation. The theoretical results and numerical simulation analysis show that under some conditions, suppliers and retailers who take the social preference factors into account can realize multiple-stage channel coordination through revenue sharing. Moreover, social preference factors will influence the choice behavior of agents in competition and cooperation. Specifically, the relationship preference promotes close cooperation among enterprises and significantly improves the supply chain and individual performance. Status preference causes fierce competition among enterprises and adversely affects supply chain performance and individual performance, making it more unstable. These findings can provide useful insights for supply chain coordination.</jats:p>",

Combinations of remote sensing techniques with ground-truth data have become available for use at the catchment level. These approaches allow us to estimate actual evapotranspiration and have the capability of monitoring crop water status and saving irrigation water in water-scarce regions. This study was conducted in the eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkiye. Fully distributed CWSI maps were generated and we assessed the relationship between CWSI and LAI for some specific crops in the winter season of 2021. Landsat 7 and 8 data were used and meteorological data were acquired from two stations in the study area. ‘Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration’ methodology was applied to estimate the energy balance components. CWSI maps displayed spatiotemporal changes in tandem with crop-type variations. Consequently, results presented a high correlation (r = 0.95 and r = 0.99 for wheat and lettuce, respectively) between CWSI and LAI, a moderate correlation (r = 0.44) for potatoes in the winter season. Thus, by utilizing remotely sensed data, the CWSI values would be directly estimated without requiring any in situ measurements of the canopy and air temperature over-irrigation scheme.</jats:p>",

Twelve environmental variables were selected from natural, landscape pattern and socioeconomic dimensions to detect the dominant factors of system resilience interactions using a geographic detector model. We found that the resilience of water yield, soil retention and biodiversity were mainly influenced by landscape pattern factors. Additionally, terrain is a main driver of soil retention resilience, precipitation plays a critical role influencing water yield resilience variations and biodiversity resilience variations remain stable influenced by landscape pattern. Larger synergy and loss occurred between water yield resilience and biodiversity resilience compared with other pairs of resilience, while greater tradeoffs occurred between soil retention resilience and biodiversity resilience. The interactions among landscape pattern, precipitation, terrain and GDP were the main driving forces of land and water resilience interactions. The interactions of landscape pattern and terrain were the main driving forces of land and biodiversity resilience interactions. The interactions of landscape pattern, precipitation and GDP were the main driving forces of water and biodiversity resilience interactions.

Unlike liquid fuel, lithium‐ion batteries are more critical when it comes to distribution into the market due to their availability in the market. Lithium storage around the world is quite limited and a solution toward its extraction, storage, and transportation is still a challenge. Several molecular science studies on lithium‐ion batteries have shown that the efficiency of lithium‐ion batteries during storage and transformation is impacted due to their cell design and structuring under physicochemical characteristics. Another problem that arises with the growth in demand for lithium‐ion batteries is its waste management and recycling procedure and how to harness the most out of the process. This paper tends to give an overview of how the supply chain for EV Lithium‐Ion batteries can be improved based on a few diagnostic and various experiment‐based studies. In this study, exploratory research based on qualitative data is conducted to better understand the various causes that impact the supply chain management of lithium‐ion batteries used in electric vehicles. This paper looks forward to better understanding the causes that act as a supply chain failure in terms of the availability, storage, and transportation of lithium‐ion batteries.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this multi‐method study is to investigate how supply chain professionals perceive and mitigate FX risk, as well as to measure how investing in supply chain flexibility strategies affect firm financial performance. Using a mixed‐method approach based on qualitative case studies and simulation experiments using the lens of Real Option Theory, we are able to show how investments in supply chain flexibility strategies can mitigate FX risk in terms of cash flows and profits.

However, Blockchain is accompanied by challenges, such as increased information technology complexity, issues of scalability, incompatibility with existing laws and regulations, and a lack of awareness among organisations and customers. This research conducts a bibliometric analysis based on a sample of 68 papers which address the barriers and enablers of blockchain adoption in supply chain management. A recurring theme in the papers was managers’ lack of understanding of Blockchain, which acted as a barrier to adoption. This study proposes a possible explanation by arguing that the academic models used in literature are too obscure from a manager’s perspective and that there is a need to synthesise literature into a framework which is easily understood and familiar. Therefore, the barriers and enablers identified in this study were grouped into the robust Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, and Environment (PESTLE) framework. A key finding from this framework was the absence of political barriers or enablers, which is surprising since blockchain adoption challenges the current status quo in multiple ways. Furthermore, the environmental enablers and barriers were scarcely discussed, with little empirical evidence.</jats:p>"

A questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China. Two independent samples with 101 and 108 responses respectively from the Chinese business buyers and suppliers were collected by visiting nine large annual exhibitions. Both samples involved buyer–supplier business relationships across three business markets: textiles, food, and consumer electronics. The data was analysed using structural equation modelling and a two-groups invariance test. The results indicate that the efficacies of trust, commitment, and RSI influencing buyers’ and suppliers’ performance are different. The paths from the relationship factors leading to performance form patterns that differ between buyers and suppliers in the Chinese business context. While trust and RSI are the direct antecedents of buyers’ cooperation performance, commitment is the immediate precursor of suppliers’ cooperation performance. Trust and commitment lead to buyer’s innovation performance directly, while RSI is a direct driver of supplier’ innovation performance. In addition, RSI is not a significant factor for buyers’ financial performance, whereas it will generate financial return for suppliers. Based on these findings, we provide differentiated relationship management suggestions to managers of buying and supplying firms for helping them improve performance in the Chinese business market in particular. For example, trust and commitment are more important relationship factors than RSI for buying firms, while RSI is as significant as trust and commitment for supplying firms.\n</jats:p>",

Root mean square error (RMSE) values are 8.3949 for training datasets and 11.6922 for testing datasets, confirming that the normalized polynomial kernel function-based GP outperformed other models in predicting Ls. Regarding predicting ds, the polynomial kernel function-based SVM outperforms other models, recording RMSE of 0.5175 for training datasets and 0.6019 for testing datasets.

In this context, the issues of applying a competency approach when training future logistics and supply chain managers and the formation of a competency model that meets the modern requirements of the labour market are considered. A review of scientific literature has been carried out regarding the main theoretical foundations of forming competences and competencies in the process of professional training of logistics and supply chain managers. Attention is focused on the need to form basic core competencies, including models of basic professional competences and competencies that are key ones in the professional activity of specialists. The main models of competencies of the company's specialists, which make it possible to ensure effective management of modern companies, are highlighted. The experience of training future logistics and supply chain managers in Ukraine is studied. The expediency of applying a competency approach when training future logistics and supply chain managers in Ukraine is substantiated. A conceptual model of a multi-level national system of professional training of logistics and supply chain specialists is proposed. A T-shaped model of the competencies of modern logistics and supply chain managers is developed.</jats:p>"

Developing supply chain capability is, hence, important for gaining a competitive advantage and overall improved supply chain performance. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of digital technologies to enhance supply chain performance and for firms to gain competitive advantage through improved supply chain capabilities. This study, through a survey questionnaire, gathered a total of 150 sample data from supply chain executives and managers in the ready-made garments (RMG) industry in Bangladesh. Findings of the study demonstrate that the digital supply chain is a significant contributor to improving the supply chain capabilities of RMG firms, and it subsequently leads to competitive advantage with a direct positive effect on firms’ supply chain performance. The findings also indicate that digital technology has a direct effect on supply chain capability and supply chain performance in RMG firms. Based on these empirical findings, the study draws conclusion that digital technology integration in the supply chain would have a positive contribution to supply chain agility and flexibility, which would enable firms to effectively engage supply chain partners in dealing with unexpected situations in business operations. This study contributes to the current literature on digital supply chain capabilities, and it also provides insights for supply chain managers, policymakers, and practitioners in the fields of supply chains, logistics, and business performance.</jats:p>"

It is hypothesized that the application of liquid-thin-film (LTF) technology can enhance the bactericidal activity of both ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and ozone (O3) treatments. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the bactericidal activity and synergistic effect of the combined UV + O3 + LTF treatment against Escherichia coli in water processing. The results showed that LTF technology significantly increased the disinfection efficiency of UV and O3 in potable water production. Thus, the combined UV + LTF, O3 + LTF, and UV + O3 + LTF treatments were more effective than the individual treatments under identical conditions. Particularly, the combined double-UV (41.7 mJ cm−2) + O3 (100% O3) + LTF (65 L min−1) treatment exhibited the highest bactericidal activity, resulting in a 5.8-log decrease in the E. coli load within 30 min. Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the synergistic effects of the combined treatments and UV dosage (r = 0.88, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and aqueous O3 concentrations (r = 0.84, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). These findings suggest that combined UV + O3 + LTF treatment could be a viable alternative method for water disinfection.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, the salt demand model is built based on past data about the number of requests for each period. The demand and supply functions for salt use a two-variable linear equation system. The salt field productivity models follow a quadratic polynomial pattern according to the difference in seasons at each time. The demand and supply of salt model follows a linear regression. The supply of salt in Indonesia is uncertain at any time. But, the demand for salt increased at the time. It is necessary to model the demand and supply of salt to meet the demand for salt</jats:p>"

In order to do this, at the onset, the most important connected factors and strategies are determined by consulting the relevant experts and body of published research. This problem has been considered a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Initially, the DEMATEL method was used to assess and prioritize the main criteria and their sub-indicators. Secondly, the CRADIS method was used to evaluate and rank the strategies used to make the supply chain more responsive.

Positive samples were prepared by spraying the corresponding pesticide standards of certain concentrations.

Samples were collected at specific time points, ground, and the pesticide residues were extracted and purified by using QuEChERS method, and then quantified by using UPLC-MS/MS. Quantitative model of pesticide residues was constructed using Minitab 17 software. Results showed that high temperature and high relative humidity accelerate the degradation of the five pesticide residues, and their degradation profiles and half-lives over temperature and relative humidity varied among pesticides. The quantitative model for pesticide degradation in the whole process from wheat to flour was constructed, with R2 above 0.817 for wheat and 0.796 for flour, respectively.

METHODS: 315 consecutive patients with definite primary peripheral lung cancers underwent CEUS examination from November 2016 to March 2022. CEUS parameters including time to enhancement (TE), time to peak (TP), time to wash-out (TW), distribution of vessels (DV), extent of enhancement (EE) and homogeneity of enhancement (HE) were obtained. RESULTS: The lesions were grouped on the basis of TE which reflects tumor vascularization: early enhancement (pulmonary arterial vascularization) (n = 91) and delayed enhancement group (bronchial arterial vascularization) (n = 224). Overall, lung tumors commonly (71.1%) manifested a delayed enhancement which indicating blood supply originated from bronchial arteries, while an early enhancement was present in less than a third of the cases. Tumors with bronchial vascularization tended to show a delayed, reduced and heterogeneous enhancement. Correspondingly, it is characterized by a shorter TE, marked EE and a relatively infrequent occurrence of necrosis in tumors with pulmonary vascularization. CONCLUSIONS: Providing micro-perfusion information, CEUS is a potentially imaging tool for evaluating blood supply in primary peripheral lung cancer.</jats:p>",

The need to shift solutions to demand-side practices and sustainable supply alternatives has been long advocated; yet this study is the first to “quantify” the impacts of such solutions on the water management system of Qatar – considered a study case of GCC countries. In this research, a scenario-based approach was utilized to predict the impact of water demand control and wastewater reuse (and the resulting synergies) on consumption of desalinated water, extraction of groundwater resources, and development needs of water and wastewater infrastructure. To this effect, country-specific models for Qatar were developed to project annual household water demand, wastewater generation and residential construction growth, up to year 2050. The outcomes showed that tariff reforms and regulated greywater reuse would reduce the annual household demand for desalinated water by up to 27% and 7%, respectively. Also, intensive reuse of Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) would reduce 40–80% of total groundwater abstraction for irrigation by 2050. Finally, adopting an integrated water strategy, with combined demand and supply management targets, creates synergies that would: (1) limit groundwater abstraction to rates close to the aquifers safe yield; and (2) delay the need for expansion of the water and wastewater infrastructure by more than a decade. Data-driven recommendations were provided accordingly.</jats:p>",

A reactive resilient strategy utilizing lateral transshipment between hospitals is adopted to make the blood platelet supply chain powerful against shortage and disruption risks. The presented model is solved using a metaheuristic based on a local search-empowered grey wolf optimizer.

This study proposes an auxiliary design system to help the designers choosing proper industrial heating supply scheme considering carbon reduction benefit. Through traversal the existing scheme database, all feasible solutions are screen out and then evaluated by calculating an proposed comprehensive economy evaluation index. The comprehensive economy evaluation index takes carbon reduction as revenue since industry users will be able to trade their carbon emission rights at the carbon markets though CCER programs in the future. Future carbon price given by the carbon price prediction module is used to calculate the revenue user can get from carbon reduction. Grid emission factor prediction module makes prediction for changing grid emission factor, which is also involved in the evaluation to consider the benefit from continuously increasing green power in the future. A case study is given with heating demand data of a food factory to shown that the proposed method can reflect the value of carbon reduction, which helps to promote low-carbon technologies in the future.</jats:p>",

By integrating the vertical distribution of the suspended sediment concentration and logarithmic flow velocity, the formula for unit width suspended sediment transport rate is presented. Based on this formula, the calculation of the near-bed relative transport rate missing in field measurement is given. Moreover, a new stratified water sampling device is invented for suspended sediment transport rate measurement by the six-point method at Mengsheng hydrological station in the Lancang River basin. Results of 24 sets of measurements show that the near-bed relative sediment transport rate ranges from 3.4 to 10.7% and is significantly positively correlated with the suspension index. The unit width suspended sediment transport rate measured by the traditional depth integrating method is on average 15.0% smaller than that calculated by the theoretical formula, which can be a reference for correcting the sediment transport rate based on the traditional method. This work provides a new device and a new method for the measurement and calculation of the unit width transport rate of suspended sediment, which has theoretical and practical significance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 has driven the formation of regional supply chains. In addition, cities became the basic units of intra-regional supply chain organization under urban administrative economies. Based on the data mining of the buyer-supplier relationship of listed manufacturing firms, this study explores the spatial characteristics of city supply networks within Shandong by the indexes of degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and a community detection algorithm using the social network analysis (SNA) method and ArcGIS software. It investigates the influencing factors of city supply networks by the correlation and regression of the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP). The results show the following: 1) Shandong has formed a multi-center city supply network with Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai-Weihai, and the distribution pattern of city centrality measured by different centrality indicators shows differences. 2) Cities belonging to the same network community show a coexistence of spatial proximity and “enclave” distribution. 3) Geographic proximity, convenient transportation links, administrative district economy, similarity of business environments represented by development zones, export-oriented or domestic market-oriented division of labor between cities, value chain division of labor between cities, and land price differences between cities promote the formation of regional city supply networks. Conversely, differences in local market size and wage levels between cities hinder the formation of city supply networks. This study attempts to apply the analysis results to regional planning from the perspective of regional industrial synergy development. Additionally, as it is based on typical Chinese provinces, it can provide policy references for national administrative regions and countries/regions at similar spatial scales for manufacturing supply chains, as well as for regional spatial layout decisions of manufacturing enterprises.</jats:p>"

In today’s turbulent and complex business environment, supply chain resilience and robustness as two critical capabilities for firms to cope with disruptions have won substantial attention from both the academia and industry. Accordingly, this study intends to explore how digitalization helps build supply chain resilience and robustness. Adopting organizational information processing theory, it proposes the mediating effect of supply chain collaboration and the moderating effect of formal contracts. Using survey data of Chinese manufacturing firms, the study applied structural equation modelling to test the research model. Results show that digitalization has a direct effect on supply chain resilience, and supply chain collaboration can directly facilitate both resilience and robustness. Our study also indicates a complementary mediating effect of supply chain collaboration on the relationship between digitalization and supply chain resilience and an indirect-only mediation effect on the relationship between digitalization and supply chain robustness. Findings reveal the differential roles of digitalization as a technical factor and supply chain collaboration as an organizational factor in managing supply chain disruptions. Paradoxically, formal contracts enhance the relationship between digitalization and supply chain resilience but weaken the relationship between supply chain collaboration and supply chain resilience. The validation of moderating effects determines the boundary conditions of digitalization and supply chain collaboration and provides insights into governing supply chain partners’ behavior. Overall, this study enhances the understanding on how to build a resilient and robust supply chain.</jats:p>",

Applying irrigation management techniques that help to save water and increase water productivity is necessary to deal with water shortage. We evaluated the growth, yield, water consumption, and water productivity responses in rice genotypes to irrigation management techniques. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with three replications at the Rice Research Institute of Iran, Mazandaran. The treatments were four rice varieties (Toloo, Tarom, Tisa, and Shiroudi) as main plots and six irrigation methods (continuous flooding irrigation (CFI) from transplanting to 20 days after 50% flowering (I1), CFI from transplanting to 15 days after 50% flowering (I2), CFI from transplanting to 10 days after 50% flowering (I3), CFI from transplanting to 5 days after 50% flowering (I4), CFI from transplanting to flowering stage (I5), and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation from transplanting to 20 days after 50% flowering (I6)) as sub-plots. The results showed that the Toloo genotype had the highest grain yield, lowest water consumption, and greatest water productivity compared with other studied genotypes. The I6 treatment with a slight reduction in yield (6% yield loss) was able to increase water-saving by 17.3%.</jats:p>",

The specifications for assessing forest ecosystem services (GB/T38582-2020) were followed to calculate the supply of forest ecosystem services in Zhuxi County using the physical quantity method and the value quantity method, and the demand was calculated using the standard value comparison method. The total supply value of forest ecosystem services in 2020 in Zhuxi County was 35,677,894,500 yuan·a−1. In terms of the value of each service, the value of water containment was the largest, accounting for 41.08%, and the value of forest recreation was the smallest, accounting for only 1.36%. The value per unit area of the local broadleaf–mixed forest in Zhuxi County was the largest, at 140,658.65 yuan·a−1, while the value of the fir forest was the smallest, at 89,181.32 yuan·a−1. The comprehensive supply–demand ratio of forest ecosystem services in Zhuxi County was 1.54, which means a moderate surplus; the supply–demand ratio of supply services was 1.27, which means a slight surplus; the supply–demand ratio of adjustment services was 1.34, which means a slight surplus; the supply–demand ratio of support services was 1.13, which means a slight surplus; and the supply–demand ratio of cultural services was 6.01, which means a high surplus. The supply–demand ratio of cultural services of forest ecosystem services in Zhuxi County was the largest and that of the support services was the smallest. From an overall perspective, the supply of forest ecosystem services in Zhuxi County in 2020 was relatively abundant and sufficient to meet local people’s demand for forest ecosystem services. In the future, some goals may include: (1) improving management capacity of forest resources and the quality of forest resources; (2) increasing the value of forest ecological services per unit area; (3) using mixed-forest planting to transform low-value tree species; (4) developing the supply capacity of forest ecological services; (5) enhancing the reprocessing industry of forest products; and (6) expanding the output of nonforest products.

Companies are using digital solutions more widely to support their logistics processes. Current studies focus mainly on the intrinsic perspective of the digital maturity of logistics processes. Rarely do previous studies consider the impact of external factors (e.g., market trends, as external drivers at the strategic level) on the digital maturity of logistics processes. In this paper, our aim is to propose a novel generic approach to measuring the level of adoption of digital technologies in logistics processes. We applied the maturity model theory to provide a generic framework for the assessment of different partners in supply chains (suppliers, manufacturers, retailers, e-tailers, logistics service providers) in a homogeneous way. We propose the five levels (Avoiding, Discovering, Adopting, Improving, Excelling) to measure the frequency of the application of the digital technologies with high intelligence in the domain of logistics processes. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the selected market trends, which are external drivers at the strategic level, and the digital maturity of logics processes. We conducted the survey among a group of 38 companies to classify their maturity level and then to test which market trends motivate them to digitalize their processes. We applied Bayesian statistics to test the level of the relationship between the digitalization of logistics processes and four market trends, namely, the sustainability, e-commerce, sharing economy, and speed-orientation of customers. The results show that all the trends tested moderately and positively influence the digital maturity of logistics processes.</jats:p>"

The results verified the practicability of the model, the global optimization ability of the algorithm to solve the problem, and the operation speed through comparing the results obtained from the basic algorithm. A reasonable comprehensive solution for the location and path optimization of the urban recycling center was also obtained. Multi-objective optimization was carried out in vehicle scheduling, facility construction, and customer satisfaction construction.

By controlling the position of the adjustable modulator ring mechanically, the total induced voltage, i.e., the amplitude of the back EMF vector sum can be effectively adjusted accordingly by the modulation effect. Consequently, the variable-speed constant-amplitude voltage control (VSCAVC) with a large speed range can be achieved. Compared to the electrical flux-weakening method, the mechanical flux-weakening method is easier to operate without the risk of PM demagnetization. The analytical model is presented, and the operation principles are illustrated. To analyze the performance of different combinations of stator/rotor pole pairs, four cases are optimized and analyzed using the finite element method for comparison. The characteristics of VSCAVC are analyzed.</jats:p>"

Moreover, we investigated how corporate social responsibility (CSR) intentions moderate the relationship between green technology and zero waste management. For the data collection, a quantitative method and random sampling technique were used. The data were collected from 450 questionnaires conducted in the energy sector. The results demonstrate that green technology has a valuable role in the accomplishment of zero waste management in enterprises. Our findings also show that the green supply chain mediates, and the CSR intentions moderate, the links between green technology and zero waste management. The current research contributes to the development of a deeper understanding of management by demonstrating that green technology and the green supply chain play considerable roles in the achievement of zero waste management.</jats:p>"

However, most of the research targeted developed countries due to better data access and enhanced information visibility. The research on supply and demand integration in Saudi Arabia is still in its infancy. This study explores this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of demand and supply chain integration in the context of sustainability. This is done by first creating a developing countries-based research framework and then validating it through surveying 162 Saudi companies operating in multiple sectors like food, fashion and retail. Results suggest that there is more emphasis on supply-side factors relative to demand-side factors in the context of integration. Demand side factors only marginally impact waste reduction efforts. Similarly, the food sector is most sensitive to integration efforts attaching high importance to sustainability and efficiency initiatives. These results can be a useful guide for managers and policymakers who are planning and executing at the interface of demand and supply chains in developing countries.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Cross-sector analysis by survey questionnaire of 162.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, ecosystems are experiencing dramatic alterations in the supply of resources, including nutrients. How the temporal regime (press versus pulse), independent of total resource supply, affects growth and species interactions of primary producers remains unexplored. Coral reefs experience anthropogenic modifications to nutrient regimes, making it critical to understand impacts on primary producers, such as macroalgae. In mesocosms, we examined how three macroalgae respond to temporal pattern in nutrient regime (ambient, press, pulse) and species interactions (alone, pairwise, or all together) in terms of their individual growth and assemblage productivity. We found nutrient regime and species interactions influenced individual growth and total assemblage productivity. Press regimes promoted the highest productivity of total assemblages. We observed species interactions ranging from competitive to facilitative varied between macroalgal species and nutrient regimes. Ours is the first study to demonstrate the temporal regime of nutrient delivery, independent of total nutrient supply, strongly impacts the productivity of species assemblages, the nature and outcome of species interactions, and the relative growth rates of individual producer species. As nutrient regimes increasingly fluctuate for coastal marine ecosystems in the Anthropocene, our findings imply macroalgal community composition may also fluctuate. More broadly, our study highlights the importance of assessing primary producer species' responses to varying nutrient regimes to understand factors structuring their communities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The interrelationships between system components are critical to improving the performance of a complex supply chain system. Thus, any improvement or development can be carried out systemically and comprehensively. The complexity of coordination grows as the number of echelons in a supply chain increases. In practice, coordination becomes more difficult to implement in a supply chain with more echelons. Through demand information sharing, this research attempts to figure out how coordination can have implications for complex multi-echelon supply chains with a modeling approach. The Aggregate Andesite Stone Supply Chain is used as an empirical model with four echelons. Changes in dimensions and values per ton of product in each echelon displacement add complexity. Total holding cost is not the only consideration. The timely completion of projects downstream is also a priority. So the system's behavior that runs and changes over time also needs to be observed. To accommodate this complexity, a system dynamics modeling approach is used. This modeling technique could capture fluctuations in volatile conditions that change in time sequences. The pattern of model behavior shows that demand information sharing in the andesite aggregate supply chain is faint, and the \"bullwhip effect\" occurs. The demand information sharing can eliminate this effect, reduce up to 73.5 % of total supply chain holding costs, and increase the percentage of project completion on time downstream of the supply chain. These results provide a scientific and practical understanding that although there are many obstacles, demand information sharing can significantly improve performance in multi-echelon complex supply chains and be worthwhile applied</jats:p>"

In addition to the underlined issues, the model captures the influence of decisions from neighboring firms in a periodical decision-making plan. A cellular automaton (CA) based approach is implemented to present the complete analysis and impact of endogenous and exogenous situations affecting the decision-making. The decision environment involves two states of selecting an efficient supply chain strategy (ESC) and responsive supply chain strategy (RSC) based on the implicit uncertainty and performance of Moore-based neighboring cells. The study contributes to the scant literature on the application of CA-based evolutionary decisions in the SC context. The simulation model characterizes the neighboring firm's influences in strategic decision-making and the implicit uncertainty in supply and demand.

The aim of this study is to determine the economic loss level with an optimization algorithm for utilities with different network characteristics, water production, operating costs and institutional capacity. Three pilot utilities with different system characteristics and water loss components were selected as application areas. The non-revenue water rates are currently calculated as 57%, 50% and 37%, respectively. The economic loss levels in the pilot utilities were calculated as 29%, 16% and 23% with the optimization model. Moreover, the most appropriate methods to be applied according to the conditions of the utilities were determined in order to reach these defined economic loss levels. It is thought that the results obtained from this study will be a reference for the development of sustainable water loss management strategies and their implementation in the field.</jats:p>",

Compared to sodium selenate, SeCys2 exerted a stronger growth stimulation of heads (1.3 against 1.14 times) and an increase of leaf concentration of chlorophyll (1.56 against 1.2 times) and ascorbic acid (1.37 against 1.27 times). Head density was reduced by 1.22 times by foliar application of sodium selenate and by 1.58 times by SeCys2. Despite the greater growth stimulation effect of SeCys2, its application resulted in lower biofortification levels (2.9 times) compared to sodium selenate (11.6 times). Se concentration decreased according to the following sequence: leaves &gt; roots &gt; head. The antioxidant activity (AOA) was higher in water extracts compared to the ethanol ones in the heads, but the opposite trend was recorded in the leaves. Chlorella supply significantly increased the efficiency of biofortification with sodium selenate (by 1.57 times) but had no effect in the case of SeCys2 application. Positive correlations were found between leaf and head weight (r = 0.621); head weight and Se content under selenate supply (r = 0.897–0.954); leaf ascorbic acid and total yield (r = 0.559), and chlorophyll (r = +0.83–0.89). Significant varietal differences were recorded for all the parameters examined. The broad comparison performed between the effects of selenate and SeCys2 showed significant genetic differences as well as important peculiarities connected with the Se chemical form and its complex interaction with Chlorella treatment.</jats:p>"

The findings provide novel insights into the challenges of enhancing resilience in the Vietnamese supply chain and categorize the barriers into three main categories: the resilience phase, strategy resilience, and the competencies required. The results indicated that a lack of financial resources and alternative sources of supply are the most pressing barriers related to the resilience phase group. In terms of strategy resilience, the lack of a skilled and competent workforce was found to be the most critical obstacle. Furthermore, government delays in supporting and enacting appropriate policies were found to be the most pressing issue related to the competencies required. These findings offer valuable recommendations for managers seeking to address these barriers and enhance the resilience of the Vietnamese supply chain after COVID-19.

Divergent renewables can be integrated into different desalination technologies, resulting in the selection of an appropriate renewable desalination being a challenge. This work proposes a multi-criteria decision-making framework to evaluate renewable desalination alternatives from the perspective of multi-dimensional consideration and data uncertainty by developing a mixed objective weighting (MOW) method and extending the method of MARCOS (measurement of alternatives and ranking according to a compromise solution) into uncertain conditions. Mathematical contributions can be found in the two methods, i.e. the MOW improves the objectivity and fairness in the weighting result by considering the dispersions and correlations among the criteria's performances, and interval MARCOS guarantees stability in the ranking result while well preserving the uncertain data. An illustrative case concerning four renewable desalination alternatives is used to test the feasibility of the framework. After implementing comparisons regarding the weighting result and ranking sequence, the effectiveness of the involved methods is confirmed. In conclusion, by fully utilizing objective data concerning renewable desalination while eliminating subjective interference, the developed framework can offer a rational and reliable decision output.</jats:p>",

Specifically, we consider a temporary increase in international trade costs similar to the one observed during the pandemic and analyze its effects on labor market outcomes using a quantitative trade model with downward nominal wage rigidities. Even omitting any health related impacts of the pandemic, the increase in trade costs leads to a temporary but prolonged decline in U.S. labor force participation. However, there is a temporary increase in manufacturing employment as the United States is a net importer of manufactured goods, which become costlier to obtain from abroad. By contrast, service and agricultural employment experience temporary declines. Nominal frictions lead to temporary unemployment when the shock dissipates, but this depends on the degree of monetary accommodation. Overall, the shock results in a 0.14% welfare loss for the United States. The impact on labor force participation and welfare across countries varies depending on the initial degree of openness and sectoral deficits.</jats:p>"

In addition, the disruption in the oxygenation systems can lead to a threat to patients’ lives. Thus, this study aimed to identify the significant deviations in the oxygen supply system as critical equipment at hospitals based on the Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) method. Despite the advantages of risk assessment techniques, hazard identification techniques are still being utilized with deterministic and unreliable values and have a completely static nature. Therefore, using dynamic techniques to overcome intrinsic ambiguity in the risk assessment process through fuzzy sets has been recommended. Additionally, we proposed the HAZOP methodology to integrate with the intuitionistic fuzzy system for assessing the medical oxygen supply system using Pressure Swing Absorbance technology as a proactive approach. The results showed that the intuitionistic fuzzy approach, combined with the risk assessment method, is a suitable tool to eliminate uncertainty, improve decision-making, and result in more detailed and accurate findings. The approach adopted in this study can be used as a needs assessment tool to optimize maintenance programs and provide the necessary training for the staff, maintenance operators, and medical equipment managers.</jats:p>"

Annual effective doses in children were calculated. A Geographic Information System technique was used for the mapping of radon concentrations, annual effective dose (AED) for ingestion, and inhalation. It was found that the average value of AED due to radon ingestion was 0.236 ± 0.020 μSv/year, while that due to radon ingestion was 0.015 ± 0.0001 nSv/year. Moreover, the range in value of the total AED in μSv/year was 0.015–1.171, with an average value of 0.236 ± 0.020. Radon concentrations in most samples of water comply with the world-wide limits that are approved by WHO and ICRP which state that safe limits (0.5 and 0.4 Bq/L), respectively. Furthermore, all results of the total AED due to radon ingestion and inhalation assessment from radon concentrations in tap water samples collected from the primary schools in Najaf city when used as drinking water were within the global limitations of the WHO. One may conclude that from the results of the AED in children (7–12 years), there is no danger of radon concentrations in the case of human consumption.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this paper develops a consumer-based agency model to study the correlation between public opinion and panic buying and simulates the influence of consumers’ panic buying behavior under different situations in a complex network. The results show that the spread of panic feelings can lead to panic buying behavior among consumers, which then shocks the retailer market. The distribution of supplies according to the type of city and the number of people can have an impact on consumer panic buying behavior, and when the government adopts a restrictive strategy, implementing a quota policy or uniform rationing is very effective in reducing the number of consumers participating in panic buying.</jats:p>"

Countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in particular depend on the production of agricultural products; thus, drought has become a critical problem in such countries. The average water level in the lower part of the Mekong River has been decreasing dramatically, resulting in the wider agricultural area of the Mekong watershed facing a lack of water for production. The construction of community reservoirs and associated water supply networks represents a strategy that can be used to address drought problems in the GMS. This study aims to solve the agricultural community reservoir establishment and water supply network design (CR–WSND) problem in Khong Chiam, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand—a city located in the Mekong Basin. The CR–WSND model is formulated using mixed-integer programming (MIP) in order to minimize the cost of reservoir construction and water irrigation. An adjusted variable neighborhood strategy adaptive search (A-VaNSAS) is applied to a real-world scenario involving 218 nodes, and its performance is compared with that of the original variable neighborhood strategy adaptive search (VaNSAS), differential evolution (DE), and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. An improved box selection formula and newly designed improvement black boxes are added to enhance the quality beyond the original VaNSAS. The results reveal that the quality of the solution from A-VaNSAS is significantly better than those of GA, DE, and VaNSAS (by 6.27%, 9.70%, and 9.65%, respectively); thus, A-VaNSAS can be used to design a community reservoir and water supply network effectively.</jats:p>"

Концепция повышения эффективности бизнеса в цепи поставок, основанная на идеологии SCM (supply chain management), предполагает развитие устойчивых долгосрочных отношений между всеми участниками цепи, базирующихся на экономически обоснованных механизмах управления взаимоотношениями партнёров. Процесс интеграции и координации взаимоотношений участников цепи поставок обеспечивает возможности создания значительных конкурентных преимуществ в случае поставки продукции точно в срок и с минимальными общими логистическими затратами по всей цепи. Учитывая тот факт, что основную часть логистических затрат составляют издержки, связанные с транспортировкой продукции от поставщика к потребителю, то изучение влияния транспортных издержек на экономические показатели деятельности участников цепи поставок представляет собой актуальную задачу. Данные и методы. Представленная публикация содержит рассмотрение параметрической зависимости величины транспортных издержек от ряда переменных, с применением метода фрагментации цепи поставок на уровне звена «поставщик - потребитель первого уровня», и её взаимосвязи с конечной прибылью участников.

The concept of increase of efficiency of business in a chain of deliveries based on ideology SCM (supply chain management), assumes development of the steady long-term relations between all participants of a chain, based on the economically reasonable mechanisms of management of mutual relations of partners. The process of integration and coordination of relationships of supply chain participants provides opportunities to create significant competitive advantages in case of just-in-time product delivery and with minimal overall logistics costs throughout the chain. Given the fact that the main part of logistics costs are the costs associated with the transportation of products from supplier to consumer, the study of the impact of transportation costs on economic performance of participants in the supply chain is an important task. Data and methods. The presented publication contains the consideration of the parametric dependence of the magnitude of transport costs on a number of variables, using the method of fragmentation of the supply chain at the level of the link \"supplier - first level consumer\", and its relationship to the final profit of the participants. By the degree of accounting and attribution of transportation costs, the variants are considered: the inclusion of transportation costs in the costs of the supplier; the inclusion of transportation costs in the costs of the consumer of the first level in the case of both non-integrated and integrated supply chain. Results obtained. The analysis of the impact of transport costs on the volume of supply and the final price has been carried out. The results have allowed to formulate the problem of maximizing the profit for all participants in the logistics chain and to obtain its solution. Conclusion. The formulation of the problem, its solution and the obtained dependencies can be of interest for supply chain participants in order to optimize their activities, increase overall efficiency and profit volumes. The presence of transport costs, in the presented formulaic expressions, in an explicit form gives useful information for improving the system of organization of transport logistics.</jats:p>",

A parallel hybrid topology is chosen for the implementation. In this topology, a voltage-controlled Class-AB linear amplifier stage and a current-controlled switching converter stage operate in parallel. A hysteretic current control scheme is employed to control the operation of the switching converter. Block-level implementation of the ETPS is done using Simulink 2017b, continuous mode simulation. Simulations are performed using a sinewave input envelope signal = 1.94+ 1.2 sin(ω∙t). The input frequency varied from 1MHz to 60MHz. As the input frequency is increased, the ETPS moves from the linear to the non-linear region of operation. During the transition, the slew rates of the load current and the switching current match at a particular input frequency of 2MHz while the efficiency peaks. The maximum obtained efficiency while tracking the sinewave input signal is 82.3%. The way the efficiency can be optimized by focusing on the matching of the slew rates of load and switching currents is explained. Also, an insight into the study of various circuit parameters and the trade-offs that the designer needs to consider while designing an ETPS, is provided.</jats:p>"

In this study, a multi-product and multi-objective model is presented considering economic and environmental concerns to design a renewable and sustainable P-fertilizer supply chain management (PFSCM) strategy. To handle the complexities of the model, an ensemble heuristic–metaheuristic algorithm utilizing the heuristic information available in the model, the whale optimization algorithm, and a variable neighborhood search (named H-WOA-VNS) is proposed. First, a problem-dependent heuristic is designed to generate a set of near-optimal feasible solutions. These solutions are fed into a population-based whale optimization algorithm which benefits from exploration and exploitation strategies. Finally, the single-solution variable neighborhood search is applied to further improve the quality of the solution using local search operators. The objective function of the algorithm is formulated as a weighted average function to minimize total economic cost while increasing crop yield and P use efficiency. The experimental results for a real case study of the P-fertilizer supply chain confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the crop yield and P use efficiency by 33% and 27.8%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed H-WOA-VNS algorithm outperforms the Heuristic, WOA, and VNS models in reducing the total objective function value of the PFSCM model by 9.8%, 2.9%, and 4%, respectively.</jats:p>"

Pig kidneys were connected to NMP for six hours. The first group (n = 6; AC500) was perfused without addition of oxygen carriers, arterial perfusate pO2 was maintained at 500 mmHg. In the second group (n = 6; RBC500) washed erythrocytes were added to the perfusate at pO2 of 500 mmHg. Third group (n = 6; RBC200) was perfused with erythrocyte containing perfusate at more physiological pO2 of 200 mmHg. Addition of RBC did not relevantly increase oxygen consumption of the kidneys during perfusion. Likewise, there were no differences in kidney functional and injury parameters between AC500 and RBC500 group. Expression of erythropoietin as indicator of tissue hypoxia was comparable in all three groups. Cell free NMP at supraphysiological oxygen partial pressure seems to be a safe alternative to erythrocyte based perfusion without adverse effect on kidney integrity and provides a less cumbersome application of NMP in clinical practice.</jats:p>"

The Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) method constituted the basis for the process of collecting research material.

Responses were mainly given by women, people with incomes in the range of PLN 1000–3000 per person, those aged 30–50, and those with a university education. The research results showed a high level of potential demand for local agri-food products, which should encourage farmers to switch from long to short supply chain models. The persisting low awareness regarding the existence of alternative distribution networks for local products, which primarily requires increased activities in the field of territorial marketing that promote local agri-food products among the residents of municipalities constitutes, from the perspective of consumers, a barrier to the development of short food supply chains.</jats:p>"

To survive the crisis, it is critical to rethink the proper setting of global supply chains and reform many related operational strategies. We hence attempt to reform the GSCM from both supply and demand sides considering different pandemic stages (i.e., pre, during, and post‐pandemic stages). In this research paper, we combine a careful literature review with real‐world case studies to examine the impacts and specific challenges brought by the pandemic to global supply chains. We first classify the related literature from the demand and supply sides. Based on the insights obtained, we search publicly available information and report real practices of GSCM under COVID‐19 in nine top global enterprises. To achieve responsiveness, resilience, and restoration (3Rs), we then propose the “GREAT‐3Rs” framework, which shows the critical issues and measures for reforming GSCM under the three pandemic stages. In particular, the “GREAT” part of the framework includes five critical domains, namely, “government proactive policies and measures,” “redesigning global supply chains,” “economic and financing strategies under risk,” “adjustment of operations,” and “technology adoption,” to help global enterprises to survive the pandemic; “3Rs” are the outputs that can be achieved after using the “GREAT” strategies under the three pandemic stages. Finally, we establish a future research agenda from five aspects. </jats:p>",

In this study, we examine the impact of MC waiting time and self-design fun from the purchase of MC products on supply chain integration. We consider a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer, one retailer, and one customizer. The manufacturer produces and sells standardized products through the retailer, whereas the customizer sells customized products to consumers directly. The customizer can decide whether to integrate with the manufacturer (i.e., manufacturer–customizer integration) or with the retailer (i.e., retailer–customizer integration). We find that manufacturer–customizer integration can achieve a win–win–win outcome for all three supply chain members when the MC waiting time is within a moderate range and the probability of consumers being satisfied with the product quality is high, but retailer–customizer integration cannot achieve such an outcome, as the manufacturer will not be benefited if it does not participate in the integration. Furthermore, integration reduces the customizer’s investment in the level of self-design fun, which implies that the negative effect owing to the low level of self-design fun in the supply chain integration can be compensated by the competition mitigation effect owing to supply chain integration. With endogenized self-design fun, the achievability of a win–win–win outcome for all three supply chain members in the manufacturer–customizer integration will remain unchanged.</jats:p>",

The Box–Jenkins methodology of forecasting is based on the identification using seasonality, stationarity, ACF, and PACF plots; and estimation based on maximum likelihood techniques; and the last diagnostic checking based on the residual and error values have been used. Later, forecasting models have been proposed separately for the snow accumulation period (October–February) as (1,1,1) (0,1,3)19 and for the snow depletion period (March–September) as (1,1,1) (1,1,2)27 after calibration of the data (2003–2015) and the same were then validated using data (2016–2018). The accuracy assessment of the models has been checked using performance criteria like AIC, MSE, and RSS. The comparison of the forecasting models with the observed data showed a good agreement with R2 of 0.83 and 0.89 for snow accumulation and snow depletion, respectively.

Based on the complex network analysis, this study analyzes the characteristics of agricultural products trade network along the B&amp;amp;R. It also combines the effects of COVID-19 with the import trade volume of agricultural products in countries along the B&amp;amp;R to build a risk supply model of agricultural products. The results show that: (1) In 2021, the spatial correlation structure of agricultural products trade along the B&amp;amp;R became increasingly sparse, and the network connectivity and density also decreased. (2) The network showed obvious scale-free distribution characteristics and obvious heterogeneity. Five communities emerged under the influence of the core node countries, but the formation of community in 2021 had obvious geopolitical characteristics. (3) Under the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic, the number of countries with medium-risk and high-risk level along the route facing external dependence risk (R<jats:sub>EDI</jats:sub>), import concentration risk (R<jats:sub>HHI</jats:sub>) and COVID-19 epidemic risk (R<jats:sub>RICI</jats:sub>) increased in 2021, and the number of countries with extremely low-risk level decreased. (4) The dominant risk type of external supply of agricultural products along the route changed from compound risk type in 2019 to epidemic risk in 2021. Hence, the results can be expected to prevent external risk impact from reducing excessive concentration of agricultural products trade and excessive dependence on the external market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Internal costs refer to the direct monetised costs for a person or organisation undertaking an activity. They are costs that a business bases its price on. External costs are not included in price and consist on the cost of disposing of the product at the end of its useful life, the environmental degradation caused by the emissions, pollutants and wastes from production, the cost of health problems caused by harmful materials and ingredients and social costs associated with increasing unemployment due to increasing automation. In such way, external costs or externalities refer to the economic concept of uncompensated social or environmental effects. The countries of the European Union have long been engaged in converting indirect losses from transport into financial units. The latest existing 2019 Handbook on External Costs of Transport considers not only marginal external costs, but also total and average external transport costs across the EU, Switzerland and Norway. Our goals in this research are: - identification of factors that have a significant impact on the total external costs of transport at the country level; - determining of the degree of such influence; - determination of interdependence (multicollinearity) of factors of influence; - determination of the direction of influence (direct or inverse dependence); - making conclusions regarding the possibility of determining the external costs of the country based on the selected factors. On the basis of correlation-regression analysis, factors were determined that have a clear relationship with the external costs of road transport - the country's GDP, the amount of transport work produced by the country in tkm and the amount invested in road infrastructure. Values of Multiple R and R-square of the regression model (very next to 1) allow us to make a conclusion that these three factors are sufficient to explain the variable (external costs) at a reliability level of 95%. All factors are statistically significant and should be involved in the model. Another important result is the sign with which the coefficients are present in the model: with an increase in % of GDP and transport work, external costs will increase, however, with an increase in investment in road infrastructure, the value of external costs of transport will decrease.  Finally, the regression equation of the country's external transport costs as a function of the three aforementioned indicators was obtained. A very good representation of the statistical data with the resulting regression model can be observed. It can be assumed that this model can be used to predict external costs of road transport and transfer the methodology to countries outside the EU, for example, Ukraine..</jats:p>"

This is a complex oxidative catabolic process, and taking the production of androstenones as example, it requires about 10 equivalent flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). As the high demand for FAD, the insufficient supply of FAD may be a common issue limiting the conversion process.\nResults\n We substantiated, using the production of 9α-hydroxy-4-androstene-3,17-dione (9-OHAD) as a model, that increasing intracellular FAD supply could effectively increase the conversion of phytosterols into 9-OHAD. Overexpressing <jats:italic>ribB</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>ribC</jats:italic>, two key genes involving in FAD synthesis, could significantly enhance the amount of intracellular FAD by 167.4% and the production of 9-OHAD by 25.6%. Subsequently, styrene monooxygenase <jats:italic>NfStyA2B</jats:italic> from <jats:italic>Nocardia farcinica</jats:italic> was employed to promote the cyclic regeneration of FAD by coupling the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and the production of 9-OHAD was further enhanced by 9.4%. However, the viable cell numbers decreased by 20.1%, which was attributed to sharply increased levels of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> because of the regeneration of FAD from FADH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Thus, we tried to resolve the conflict between FAD regeneration and cell growth by the promotor replacement. Finally, a robust strain NF-P2 was obtained, which could produce 9.02 g/L 9-OHAD after adding 15 g/L phytosterols with productivity of 0.075 g/(L∙ h), which was 66.7% higher than that produced by the original strain.\nConclusions\n This study highlighted that the cofactor engineering, including the supply and recycling of FAD and NAD<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in <jats:italic>Mycolicibacterium</jats:italic>, should be adopted as a parallel strategy with pathway engineering to improve the productivity of the industrial strains in the conversion of phytosterols into steroid synthons.</jats:p>"

Analysis and evaluation are performed on the intelligent manufacturing system (IMS) of enterprises under the Internet of Things (IoT). First, the connotation and characteristics of machine learning (ML) in the era of IoT are explained, followed by the introduction to neural networks. Second, the optimization process of the neural network is described. Since it has no memory, the traditional deep neural network (DNN) needs to be improved. Then, the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is utilized to expand the sample data. Moreover, the confusion matrix is used in the indicator evaluation. The backpropagation neural network (BPNN) is optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) to improve the network configuration and model performance. In addition, the connotation and development status of IMS are analysed, and the feasibility of applying deep learning to the evaluation of IMS is discussed. Finally, the evaluation model of IMS is designed and built via a neural network, which is ultimately verified in the simulation experiment. The experimental results indicate that the BPNN‐GA algorithm has advantages in predicting fitting accuracy, taking up less memory, and shortening training time; it can achieve generalization and accuracy in the forefront of optimal Pareto value, and the fitting accuracy attains 95.3%. The horizontal evaluation of IMS proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the evaluation model. This shows that the BPNN‐GA algorithm has an excellent evaluation effect on IMS. And the IMS evaluation model is applied to assess the IMS of sample enterprises. The evaluation results demonstrate that there are problems in the current manufacturing industry. For example, the transactions are challenging to be completed smoothly, information technology is updated slowly, and IMS is dependent on collecting resources.</jats:p>",

The authors collected information through interviews with the local community and authority of Paccekke Tourism Village and direct observation. The study reveals that local communities and village officials have the opportunity to manage and develop villages through the concept of rural tourism. There are three types of supply: existing potential supply, supply of tour packages, and alternative tourism supply. This paper divides the demand for rural tourism into two parts, including products that can meet the tourists’ needs and prepared and managed rural tourism products. This study concludes that rural tourism can be realised by combining the concepts of supply and demand. This study contributes to the management and development of the village through the concept of rural tourism.

Indeed, supply and demand relationships in the industry can reflect the running situation of the relevant companies, so the relationships would be efficient in stock choosing. In this work, we propose a midterm strategy of multifactor, named MUSU, by introducing the industrial supply chain into the multifactor model. We verify the model by taking the industry of new Energy Vehicle as Example. The results show that MUSU performs much better than the traditional models, no matter with market value choosing mechanism or not.

For 79 sequenced L. pneumophila isolates, 21 different sequence types (ST) were obtained, including 3 new types—ST2582, ST2579, and ST2580. High Legionella contamination and high genetic diversity were found in the hotel water supply systems in Latvia, which, together with the insufficient hot water temperature, may indicate that the lack of regulation and control measures may promote the proliferation of Legionella.</jats:p>"

This paper compares the two-dimensional (2D) distributions of neutral gas, plasma and wall erosion-related parameters under different neutral gas supply positions. The comparison results show that the change of the neutral gas supply position affects the radial distribution uniformity of the neutral gas and plasma in the channel. From the comparison of the density peaks, it can be found that the neutral gas density and the plasma density peak under the upper gas supply condition are relatively low, and the plasma density peak is 22.49% lower than the density peak under the middle gas supply condition. Meanwhile, as the radial position of the gas supply moves from the lower gas supply to the upper gas supply, the position of the ionization zone also gradually moves toward the anode. The results of erosion-related parameter distribution comparison show that the change of gas supply location has an obvious influence on erosion rate and erosion range. In terms of erosion rate, the wall erosion rate is relatively low under the upper gas supply condition, and the peak erosion rates of the inner and outer walls are 33.3% and 29.9% lower than those under the other two conditions. In terms of erosion range, as the gas supply position moves from the lower gas supply position to the upper gas supply position, the erosion range gradually increases from 5 to 7.5 mm.</jats:p>",

Off-Grid is one of the green transition technologies that provide great benefits to ports for the mitigation of environmental. To ensure optimal system operation, determining the proper configuration and component sizes is an important decision at the design stage. One of the important activities at the port is the transportation of mining products, B3 waste, and others by using ships operated with diesel engines which are known to be expensive and not environmentally friendly. The configuration consists of a photovoltaic system and an energy storage system as well as land electricity support at the port then optimized by considering solar radiation, temperature, and data component specifications to supply power to the ship so that do not use diesel generators on board. From the calculation results it is known that when the ship is anchored it requires 3,310.34 kWh/day of electrical energy. To meet electricity needs, 3,200 units of PV modules are designed with a power output of 1,216 kW peak and a BESS capacity of 4,064 kWh.</jats:p>"

In this regard, studies have shown that social sustainability is a crucial resource for the operational performance of supply chains in emerging contexts. Although the literature has responded to the call for research on the social dimension of sustainability in emerging economies, most research has focused on emerging Asia, leaving a void in Latin America. Two socially focused frameworks are used to address the ontological challenge of defining sustainable human well-being around the firm. Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach and the theoretical extension of the Social-Resource-Based View (SRBV) are appropriate to address social sustainability under two essential aspects: (1) the firm as a generator of social performance and (2) social sustainability as a generator of firm performance. This paper aims to analyze the predictive capacity of Social Sustainability Orientation on social performance and supply chain operational performance in the context of emerging Latin America, with representative cases from Mexico, Colombia, and Chile. The methodology was empirical–statistical and based on a structured questionnaire applied to 217 purchasing managers of large multisector companies (Mx n = 64, Co n = 100, and Cl n = 53). Hypotheses were tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results show the intrasample and extrasample predictive ability of Social Sustainability Orientation on social and Supply Chain Performance. It is concluded that socially sustainable culture and investment orientation is a valuable resource that provides the capability for Latin supply chain welfare and operational performance. A call is made to procurement and public policy managers to disseminate and care for the social aspects of sustainability as a resource that enhances business competitiveness and social justice in the Latin American region.</jats:p>"

Taking Shandong Province, China, as the study area, combined multi–source remote sensing data are used in this study to construct the index system of cold island supply capacity (CIS) and the cold island demand level (CID). We use the methods of spatial regression, quadrant division, and coupling coordination degree to analyze the correlation, matching status, and the level of coordinated development between the supply capacity and demand for the cooling effect. We also explore the change law and spatial characteristics of the blue–green spaces’ cooling effects supply and demand matching. Results show that: (1) The CIS and the CID are significantly negatively correlated and spatially heterogeneous in distribution, with a significant spatial spillover effect. (2) The dominant type of supply and demand is one of low supply and high demand, which means that the supply and demand for cool islands’ cooling effect are unbalanced, with significant problems of spatial mismatch and quantitative imbalance. (3) The coupling between supply capacity and demand level is on the verge of becoming dysfunctional because the uneven distribution of urban buildings, population, and blue–green spaces reduce the coupling between supply and demand levels. This research can provide a new perspective and scientific basis for the study of the cooling effects of blue and green spaces and the mitigation of the heat island effect in densely populated urban centers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To promote carbon emission reduction and resource reuse, this study is devoted to studying the impact of government subsidy policies on the operation decision of a low-carbon closed-loop supply chain system. In the production stage, governments can use carbon reduction subsidies and remanufacturing subsidies to reduce the green behavior costs of manufacturers; in the recycling stage, governments can use consumer recycling subsidies to increase the recycling willingness of consumers. In this study, we introduce these three subsidy policies into the target function of the subsidized members. Using the Nash non-cooperative game and variational inequality, we developed a low-carbon supply chain network equilibrium model to examine the impact of subsidy policies on the system operation decision. The results show that, under the three subsidy policies, raising the subsidy level can help to improve the recycling rate, promote the reduction in carbon emissions and improve the profits of retailers; however, manufacturers’ incomes increase only when the carbon reduction subsidy level is below a certain threshold. Notably, under the coexistence of three subsidy policies, the carbon reduction subsidy policy has a more significant impact on the system. Finally, the numerical results show that, when the subsidy level is higher than six, although the increase in carbon reduction subsidy level leads to a decrease in the profits of manufacturers, this policy has the best contribution to the environmental benefits of the system. Our results can serve as guidelines for governments when designing the optimal subsidy programs to achieve the ultimate goal of establishing an environmentally friendly supply chain network system.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, different clusters for the training step are used. The outcomes indicated that Age (0.94), City (0.79), Health Benefit Awareness (0.76) and Education (0.75) are the most effective factors in product consumption patterns, respectively. Moreover, the efficiency of the outcomes is evaluated using the Silhouette Coefficient, indicating that the proposed algorithm could provide solutions with a 68% score.

However, in the open ecological environment, Cloud ERP makes the LiB supply chain face multi-user and multi-subject interactions, which can generate sensitive data and privacy data security issues (such as user override access behavior). In this study, we take the value and information interaction into account to examine the user behaviors of the diverse stakeholders in the LiB supply chain. Therefore, a user behavior monitoring algorithm (UBMA), different from the mainstream supervised algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms, is proposed to monitor the unsafe behaviors that may threaten data privacy in Cloud ERP. The results show that the UBMA can accurately search out the user behavior sequence where the unsafe behavior is located from a large amount of user behavior information, which reduces the complexity of directly identifying the unsafe behavior. In addition, compared with the recursive unsupervised binary classification method, the UBMA model has a lower resource consumption and higher efficiency. In addition, the UBMA has great flexibility. The UBMA can be further updated and extended by re-establishing the statistical characteristics of the standard user behavior fields to quickly adapt to user changes and function upgrades in the LiB supply chain.</jats:p>"

The research took place from January to December 2019. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The monthly percentages of medical equipment that passed quality criteria before and after the implementation plan were 91.82±1.19% and 95.33±1.25% (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> ≤ .005). The average client satisfaction score increased from 76.80% to 83.40% (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .006). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The implementation of Kaizen and ECRS principles for quality improvement successfully increased the quality of equipment preparation and introduced standardized, quality guidelines. The plan–do–check–act (PDCA) process improved client satisfaction, staff performance, and operational efficiency while preventing damage to medical devices and improving readiness of use.</jats:p>",

So, the objective of this study is to examine that how GSCM influences firm performance in the textile industry. The Textile sector is being most prominent because it has much concern with GSCM so in this perspective it takes attention to conduct research on it. Accordingly, a conceptual model has been residential in distinction to previous studies and data composed by applying a Likert scale and multiple linear regressions from textile industries implementing GSCM practices using a sample size of 200 respondents from enterprises producing textiles in Multan, Lahore, Faisalabad and Multan, among other locations. The analysis described the effect on organizational performance by the aspect of customer involvement, environmental involvement, competitiveness, and economic performance. The final conclusion is that both customer involvement and economic performance are more significant and positively affect organizational performance while the other competitive advantage and environmental involvement have the least influence on organizational performance.</jats:p>"

In response to societal pressure, multinationals have taken on a certain degree of responsibility regarding workplace conditions in supplier factories, notably by adopting codes of conduct. Investigating the impact of this self‐regulatory policy, scholars have examined whether and how codes shape labor conditions at the production level, but the results of their empirical studies diverge and sometimes contradict. To bring clarity to the field and gain an overarching understanding of the impact of codes, this literature review analyzes the question of their effectiveness as examined in 33 scientific papers gathered via a systematic selection of empirical studies. The review shows that supplier codes are not deemed unanimously and evenly effective by scholars and often fail to improve labor conditions. However, a range of factors are identified that facilitate the implementation of codes and ensure its effectiveness. This article develops a taxonomy of these factors and intends to contribute to understanding codes' decoupling and recoupling processes by investigating the gap between codes provisions and their intended outcome: the improvement of labor practices in global supply chains.</jats:p>",

As such, research which includes exploration of mitigation after damage to WASH is essential to improve understanding of impacts on quantity and quality of WASH. More granular research which explores the origin of cases of WBDs and how such communities are affected by challenges to WASH is needed. One step towards research on this, is the implementation of adequate reporting mechanisms for real time tracking of the WASH attacks, damages, direct effects, and likely impact in conjunction with environmental and public health bodies and surveillance systems.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>"

Established technology adoption theories are synthesized to develop a research model that investigates the adoption of hospital ERP systems and its impact on supply chain cost performance. The framework is validated via structural equation modeling (SEM) with data collected from 107 Greek public hospitals. The results indicate that technological and organizational readiness, hospital size, governmental policies, and perceived benefits have a significant influence on the extent of ERP systems adoption. They also demonstrate a statistically significant association between the use of ERP systems and hospital supply chain costs. The present study highlights the influencing factors of ERP systems adoption in hospitals and provides empirical evidence on the resulting cost benefits., This implies greater urgency for hospitals to digitalize their supply chain by implementing and fully exploiting the ERP systems’ functionality in order to reach their goal of delivering quality care at a lower cost.</jats:p>"

In addition, when sweet potato seedlings were replanted in December and treated sewage was supplied to maintain the irrigation water temperature above 15 °C even in winter, overwintering cultivation was successful and 8.4 kg m−2 of tuberous roots were harvested in July. As a result, the annual production rate for 12 months increased to 25.3 kg m−2, about 10 times the national average of 2.4 kg m−2 for open-field cultivation.

Improved customer satisfaction and improved decision making were the most important benefits to data collection. We also find that the expected benefits and challenges for implementation of these efforts are not universal. Companies that exist upstream in the supply chain are more likely to disagree on intended benefits and challenges.</jats:p>",

The technology, which was funded by the European Regional Development Fund as an R&amp;D-project (EFRE-0400310), reduces production time and creates completely novel innovative knitting structures. This paper introduces the validation process of the innovative technology and therefore brings the theoretical considerations into a practical application. The yarn supply technology enables the production of an innovative double-layered fabric on flat and circular knitting machines. This double-faced fabric consists of two single-faced fabric sides which are knitted by a first yarn in the front needle bed and a second yarn in the rear needle bed. These two fabrics are joined by a third yarn knitting in both needle beds in the same carriage stroke. The method ensures that up to three yarns knit in one system pass. Furthermore, a fourth yarn can be implemented to insert a weft yarn. Additionally, the two single-faced fabrics can be produced simultaneously in the same carriage stroke in the front and rear needle beds. In this case, fewer carriage strokes are required for knitting standard structures such as Milano Rib. This structure can be produced one third faster than with conventional methods. The results show that the technology on the circular knitting machine produces good quality knitted fabrics. On the flat knitting machine, however, further research and development are needed to validate the technology.</jats:p>"

Recent studies have shown the protective effects of resveratrol (RSV), but the mechanism remains unknown. To address this, the effects of RSV on the structure and function of hemoglobin of adult (HbA) were preliminarily analyzed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and oxygen dissociation assays (ODA). Molecular docking was conducted to specifically analyze the binding regions between RSV and HbA. The thermal stability was characterized to further validate the authenticity and effect of binding. Changes in the oxygen supply efficiency of HbA and rat RBCs incubated with RSV were detected ex vivo. The effect of RSV on the anti-hypoxic capacity under acute hypoxic conditions in vivo was evaluated. We found that RSV binds to the heme region of HbA following a concentration gradient and affects the structural stability and rate of oxygen release of HbA. RSV enhances the oxygen supply efficiency of HbA and rat RBCs ex vivo. RSV prolongs the tolerance times of mice suffering from acute asphyxia. By enhancing the oxygen supply efficiency, it alleviates the detrimental effects of acute severe hypoxia. In conclusion, RSV binds to HbA and regulates its conformation, which enhances oxygen supply efficiency and improves adaption to acute severe hypoxia.</jats:p>"

Until the flowering stage, plants were supplied with a nutrient solution containing N-concentrations of either a, 100%, conventional standard-practice, 13.8 mM; b, 75% of the standard, 10.35 mM; or c, 50% of the standard, 6.9 mM. During the subsequent reproductive stage, inorganic-N treatments b and c were decreased to 25% of the standard, and the standard (100% level) N-application was not altered. The three different inorganic-N supply treatments were combined with two different rhizobia strains, and a control (no-inoculation) treatment, in a two-factorial experiment. The rhizobia strains applied were either the indigenous strain Rhizobium sophoriradicis PVTN21 or the commercially supplied Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899. Results showed that the 50–25% mineral-N application regime led to significant increases in nodulation, BNF, and fresh-pod yield, compared to the other treatment, with a reduced inorganic-N supply. On the other hand, the 75–25% mineral-N regime applied during the vegetative stage restricted nodulation and BNF, thus incurring significant yield losses. Both rhizobia strains stimulated nodulation and BNF. However, the BNF capacity they facilitated was suppressed as the inorganic-N input increased. In addition, strain PVTN21 was superior to CIAT 899—as 50–25% N-treated plants inoculated with the former showed a yield loss of 11%, compared to the 100%-N-treated plants. In conclusion, N-use efficiency optimises BNF, reduces mineral-N-input dependency, and therefore may reduce any consequential negative environmental consequences of mineral-N over-application.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A public health emergency of international concern, such as a pandemic, disrupts the normal operation of the global supply chain, which necessitates in-depth research on supply chain management. In this paper, we used bibliometric and content analysis to provide a systematic analysis of the supply chain industry from this background. The descriptive analysis provides insights into the publication growth trajectory, in terms of the contributing authors, countries, and subject categories, which presents an intuitive display of previous research. In addition, the existing research mainly covers three dimensions of supply chain disruption, strategies, and sustainability, which can be clustered into supply chain disruption, disruption recovery, reconfiguration, digital intelligence, optimization, and sustainability. By revisiting the supply chain industry, we explored the transformation of its characteristics in the pandemic, covering themes ranging from expansion to contraction, from traditional to digital intelligence, and from fragile to sustainability, which suggests potential research directions for future studies. This contributes to the further research of supply chain management during the pandemic and provides supply chain managers with a practical approach for dealing with supply chain disruption risks and improving supply chain sustainability in this context.</jats:p>"

Virtually in every socio-political debate, the exchange rate management is yet to be a resolved paradigm. This study empirically examined the supply side liberalization as proxy of personal diaspora remittance and exchange rate management in Nigeria. Technique of Vector Autoregression (VAR) was employed to examine the direction of shocks arising from the exchange movement with respect to diaspora remittances (REMIT), and foreign direct investment (FDI). The findings showed that, growth of remittance results in exchange rate appreciation when pass through official channel, and vice versa. While, controlling for FDI, exchange rate movement improves with growth of FDI in the short run, and decreases due to improper capital control mechanism. Policy recommendation has it that: The Nigerian Monetary Authority should harmonize the dual exchange rate aimed at maximizing the gains of capital control and achieve domestic monetary policy success; Government should implement friendly tax policies, zero charges and lowered administrative bottlenecks to clearing personal diaspora remittance inflow aimed at minimizing diversion of foreign capital into unofficial route.</jats:p>"

Determination of the influence of mining and geological conditions of drilling hydrogeological wells with backwash on the technological parameters of the airlift method of cleaning it from drilled rock and the properties of the ascending flow of aerated washing liquids.   Methodology. The tasks were solved by a complex research method, including analysis and generalization of literary and patent sources, analytical, experimental studies, using computer and mathematical modeling methods.   Findings. An algorithm for the functioning of the airlift circulation method during rotary drilling with backwash has been developed. The algorithm takes into account: hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressures, and the effect on them of the rate of drilling of the well; the effect of the sludge content in the upstream. The effective values of the airflow rate, the density of the water-air mixture and the velocity of its upward flow are established. A method for estimating the effective values of technological parameters and their changes in the upward flow of the mixture is proposed. A model has been developed that allows analyzing the dependences of the air flow rate, the density of the mixture and the rate of its ascent on the parameters of the well being drilled. The model is applied to typical drilling conditions of a large-diameter water intake well at the Samskoye groundwater deposit on the Mangystau peninsula.   Originality. A mathematical algorithm has been developed for the functioning of the airlift backwash method when drilling large-diameter water intake wells. The method is based on the analysis of the pressure balance in the descending and ascending flows of the washing agent. For the case of backwash, a formula for estimating the content of sludge in it was obtained. A method has been developed for determining the average effective density of the mixture in terms of the height of the well, as well as the air content in it. Based on the average effective values, a method is proposed for estimating changes in the density of the mixture, its flow rate and velocity along the upward flow.   Practical value. The proposed algorithm is the basis of a computer model that allows you to determine the dependences of the values of the density of the mixture, the content of air and sludge in it and the rate of ascent, from the depth of the well, the depth of the mixer descent, the speed of deepening, the specified velocity of the upward fluid flow, as well as the diameters of the well and drill pipes. Specific modeling results have been obtained in relation to the Samskoye groundwater deposit of the Mangystau peninsula.</jats:p>",

First, the relationship between AI and the attractiveness of green advertisements is investigated, and the influence of different AI technologies in green advertisements on consumers' perception of the attractiveness of green advertisements is summarized. Second, based on the green advertisement dissemination rate data set, the data visualization exploration is carried out, and the data deletion and coding processing are carried out aiming at different characteristic variables. Finally, according to the problems existing in the current green advertisement communication and the high‐dimensional and sparse characteristics of the communication rate data set. In this paper, based on Deep FM (Factorization Machine), Gradient Boost Decision Tree (GBDT) is added to assist the experiment, and the prediction performance of green advertising communication is tested. The results are as follows. (1) Different AI expressions in green advertisements will affect consumers' perception of the attractiveness of green advertisements. (2) The prediction ability of Deep FM model after feature engineering is better than that of data cleaning only. The prediction effect of the model is obviously improved. The purpose of this paper is to integrate green advertising media communication into the ecological concept of harmonious coexistence between man and nature, strengthen the political belief of ecological civilization construction, and conform to the communication trend of today's severe ecological situation.</jats:p>",

We present the case report of a 62-year-old female patient who was admitted to our emergency department in a soporous state after initial headache and dizziness. A neurological exam found left-sided spasticity and a flexor response to pain. Systemic thrombolysis was administered after an urgent computerized tomography (CT) of the brain with angiography. The interventional radiologist proposed a digital subtraction angiography which found a vasospasm in the right medial cerebral artery from the M2 seg- ment reaching distally, and a balloon dilation was done. Following the endovascular procedure, a CT scan showed ischemia in both posterior thalami. Additionally, the patient’s neurological impairment improved at that moment showing Parinaud syndrome, drowsiness, and left-sided palsy. The patient experienced a possible reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome, the cause of which is still unknown, which resulted in an ischemic stroke. The typical clinical presentation of that syndrome was lacking, probably due to the presence of the artery of Percheron ipsilateral to the vasospasm. Our goal in presenting this case study is to draw attention to the artery of Percheron syndrome as a potential clinical sign of an acute ischemic stroke that can easily lead us to be misled.</jats:p>",

Based on equivalent circuit and Kirchhoff’s current law, the feeder current characteristic in the substation, AT station and sectioning post when T–R fault, F–R fault, and T–F fault occur are analyzed and their expressions are obtained. When the traction power supply system is equipped with wide-area protection measurement and control system, the feeder protection device in each station collects the feeder currents in other two stations through the wide-area protection channel and a wide-area current differential protection scheme based on the feeder current characteristic is proposed. When a short-circuit fault occurs in the power supply arm, all the feeder protection devices in each station receive the feeder currents with time stamp in other two stations. After data synchronous processing and logic judgment, the fault line of the power supply arm can be identified and isolated quickly. The simulation result based on MATLAB/Simulink shows that the power supply arm protection scheme based on wide-area current differential has good fault discrimination ability under different fault positions, transition resistances, and fault types. The verification of measured data shows that the novel protection scheme will not be affected by the special working conditions of the electrical multiple unit (EMU), and reliability, selectivity, and rapidity of relay protection are all improved.</jats:p>",

The approach takes into account the daily energy demand variation and price curves for energy that are either imported or exported to the grid. The optimal configuration is determined by the highest internal rate of return (IRR) over a 12-year period while providing a 20% discount in electricity prices for the energy community. The approach is extrapolated to an annual period using the statistical data of sunny and cloudy days, considering 23.8% of the year as cloudy. The methodology provides a general procedure for hybridising both plants and the grid to meet the energy needs of a small rural population. In the analysed case, an optimal combination of 140 kW of rated power from the biogas generator was found, which is lower than the maximum demand of 366 kW and 80 kW installed power in the photovoltaic plant, resulting in an IRR of 6.13% over 12 years. Sensitivity studies for data variations are also provided.</jats:p>"

The population growth data for the years 1997 and 2017 was derived from four Jordan governorates, i.e., Mafraq, Irbid, Jerash, and Ajloun, as well as for the population of the Yarmouk Basin was calculated, where a part of the population of these governorates resides within Basin. The water supply and the number of wells were also determined during this study. Various physicochemical parameters of water, like pH, EC, TDS, DO, NO2, and NO3, were also evaluated. Water supply, demand, and quality issues were also identified in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. The study showed an increase in the Kingdom's population in four governorates from about 1.27 to 2.88 million inhabitants, while the population of four governorates in the Yarmouk Basin increased from about 639,992 to 1.53 million inhabitants, and it is more than doubling. Comparing the population with the water supply, the numbers of wells and their uses showed significant changes, as evidenced by the substantial increase in the water supply. The studied physiochemical parameters were within the permissible limits of the National Standards. The critical water issues reported in the study area are difficulties in law enforcement and rapid population growth, which interactively affect the water supply. The study's findings will assist decision-makers in managing future water supplies as they face challenges in securing additional water, and there is an urgent need for research and future scenarios to meet water needs.</jats:p>"

Previous studies have conducted supply network risk research from various perspectives, particularly due to the severity of supply disruption to buying firms. While the existing studies have identified those suppliers based on centrality measures of their positions in the supply network mostly from the social network perspective, there was also a limitation in quantitatively assessing the suppliers’ disruption risk in the network. Therefore, this study intended to theoretically expand and develop the study on the supply network risk from the existing social network perspective by applying the Bayesian network analysis. So we used the Bayesian network analysis to quantitatively assess the suppliers’ disruption risk in the supply network and measure their risk impact on the focal firm. Through it, we identified the network properties of the critical suppliers that the focal firm should pay attention to for its effective supply network risk management and suggested related insights.</jats:p>",

To that end, the readiness of government, citizens, and political parties needs to be assessed before using e-voting as an electoral system. The main purpose of this study is to assess the gaps in the readiness of Ethiopia for e-voting system implementation. A qualitative research method is employed, and a thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.

The results show that the proposed internet of things (IoT)-based SCF SMEs-oriented BPNN credit evaluation model reaches a prediction accuracy of 91.4%.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A sustainable biomass supply chain would require not only an effective and fluid transportation system with a reduced carbon footprint and costs, but also good soil characteristics ensuring durable biomass feedstock presence. Unlike existing approaches that fail to account for ecological factors, this work integrates ecological as well as economic factors for developing sustainable supply chain development. For feedstock to be sustainably supplied, it necessitates adequate environmental conditions, which need to be captured in supply chain analysis. Using geospatial data and heuristics, we present an integrated framework that models biomass production suitability, capturing the economic aspect via transportation network analysis and the environmental aspect via ecological indicators. Production suitability is estimated using scores, considering both ecological factors and road transportation networks. These factors include land cover/crop rotation, slope, soil properties (productivity, soil texture, and erodibility factor) and water availability. This scoring determines the spatial distribution of depots with priority to fields scoring the highest. Two methods for depot selection are presented using graph theory and a clustering algorithm to benefit from contextualized insights from both and potentially gain a more comprehensive understanding of biomass supply chain designs. Graph theory, via the clustering coefficient, helps determine dense areas in the network and indicate the most appropriate location for a depot. Clustering algorithm, via K-means, helps form clusters and determine the depot location at the center of these clusters. An application of this innovative concept is performed on a case study in the US South Atlantic, in the Piedmont region, determining distance traveled and depot locations, with implications on supply chain design. The findings from this study show that a more decentralized depot-based supply chain design with 3depots, obtained using the graph theory method, can be more economical and environmentally friendly compared to a design obtained from the clustering algorithm method with 2 depots. In the former, the distance from fields to depots totals 801,031,476 miles, while in the latter, it adds up to 1,037,606,072 miles, which represents about 30% more distance covered for feedstock transportation.</jats:p>"

This research aims to assess the quality of the surface waterbodies in the north-eastern region of Kashmir Valley. Standard analytical procedures were used to analyze the water samples taken from 11 distinct sampling stations for 14 physicochemical parameters. The results were compared with the standard permissible levels which showed that the water quality of rivers and lakes in the north-east Himalayan region has steadily declined. Furthermore, multivariate statistical techniques were used with the goal of identifying key variables that influence seasonal and sectional water quality variations. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis revealed that there is substantial spatio-temporal variability in the water quality parameters. According to principal component analysis (PCA) results, four primary components, which together accounted for 79.23% of the total variance, could be used to evaluate all data. Chemical, organic, and conventional pollutants were found to be significant latent factors influencing the water quality of rivers in the study region. The results indicate that PCA and ANOVA may be used as vital tools to identify crucial surface water quality indices and the most contaminated river sections.</jats:p>",

The novelty of this study include (i) determining significant features that have a considerable influence on electricity consumption, (ii) utilizing a Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to enhance the model’s hyperparameters, (iii) hybridizing the BOA with the machine learning algorithms, viz., support vector regression (SVR) and nonlinear autoregressive networks with exogenous inputs (NARX), for modeling individually the long-term electricity consumption, (iv) comparing their performances with the widely used classical time-series algorithm autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) with regard to the accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability, and (v) forecasting future yearly electricity consumption and validation. The population, gross domestic product (GDP), imports, and refined oil products were observed to be significant with the total yearly electricity consumption in Saudi Arabia. The coefficient of determination R2 values for all the developed models are &gt;0.98, indicating an excellent fit of the models with historical data. However, among all three proposed models, the BOA–NARX has the best performance, improving the forecasting accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE)) by 71% and 80% compared to the ARIMAX and BOA–SVR models, respectively. The overall results of this study confirm the higher accuracy and reliability of the proposed methods in total electricity consumption forecasting that can be used by power system operators to more accurately forecast electricity consumption to ensure the sustainability of electric energy. This study can also provide significant guidance and helpful insights for researchers to enhance their understanding of crucial research, emerging trends, and new developments in future energy studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Annotation. Prognosis assessment is critical for liver cirrhosis (LC). Vitamin D deficiency is considered a possible unfavorable factor. The aim of the study was to assess the level of vitamin D in LC patients, to establish the prevalence of its deficiency, and to determine the relationship with the severity of LC, nutritional status, and patient survival. 95 LC patients, 61 men, and 34 women (age 50.1±1.15 years) were enrolled in the prospective study. The nutritional status was assessed using Onodera’s Prognostic Nutritional Index (Onodera’s PNI). The serum 25(OH)D3 was determined by enzyme immunoassay. Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS v 21.0. It was established that vitamin D insufficient supply was present in 9% of LC patients, deficiency – in 74%, and severe deficiency – in 15% of patients. LC decompensation was accompanied by a worsening of vitamin D deficiency. The serum 25(OH)D3 was correlated with Child-Turcotte-Pugh and Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (r= -0.481, -0.487, respectively, p˂0.001). The lowest 25(OH)D3 levels were in patients with severe and refractory ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and significant hypoalbuminemia. Malnutrition was found in 34.7% of decompensated patients and was associated with severe vitamin D deficiency. The 25(OH)D3 was correlated with Onodera’s PNI (r=0.679, p˂0.001). The 25(OH)D3 had a good predictive value for the 1-year mortality (AUC 0.708, p=0.004). The 25(OH)D3 less than 12.5 ng/ml should be considered a marker of a poor prognosis. Thus, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in LC patients. It is associated with the severity of liver disease, malnutrition, and poor prognosis. Further studies are needed to determine whether vitamin D supplementation can improve survival in LC patients.</jats:p>"

In this paper, based on the advantages that the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) model can effectively overcome modal mixing and white noise interference, and the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model can effectively overcome gradient disappearance and other problems, the coupled CEEMDAN–ARIMA prediction model is established, and the CEEMDAN–ARIMA model is used in the runoff prediction of the Lijin hydrological station in the lower Yellow River. The results show that the coupled CEEMDAN–ARIMA model has an R2 of 0.9398 and a Nash efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.918, with a prediction accuracy of Grade A. This shows that the CEEMDAN–ARIMA model has the ability to handle complex information in hydrological factor simulations, providing a new method for non-linear, non-stationary runoff prediction that has broad application prospects.</jats:p>",

The system controls operation of the electric motor, through which the cable is unwound from the reel, and regulates the position of the guide which delivers the cable into the water. The need to create an automatic system for laying cable from a ship, which will provide the minimal deformation and minimal cable consumption, is proved. The first system is designed to control the speed of the electric motor that unwinds the cable from the reel. Adjustment is carried out due to the signal from the tension sensor (current signal is 4 - 20 mA). The signal goes to the programmable logic controller. The analog output signal from the controller (the current signal also ranges within 4 - 20 mA) is fed to the frequency converter, which, in turn, changes the rotation speed of the electric motor in accordance with the prescribed program. The second system is designed to change the position of the guide delivering the cable overboard. The proposed system compensates for the change in the position of the cable in the water under the influence of the current. The adjustment is made depending on the signal from the angle change sensor, which will go to the programmable logic controller. The first system is considered in detail, its electrical circuit diagram and electrical functional diagram are presented, as well as other elements of the system (sensor, programmable logic controller). A description of the circuit operation is given</jats:p>",

One of the indicators of the economic efficiency of vegetable production in protected soil structures is labor costs and funds per 1 hundredweight, per 100 rubles of gross production, as well as energy costs, including thermal energy. Usually, solar, biological, electric and other types of heating are used to supply thermal energy to cultivation facilities, each of which has its own disadvantages. The bio-vegetation complexes structurally distinguished by the fact that cultivation beds are located on various foundations make it possible to create an active underground heating system. The paper presents the development of a design for an active subsurface system for thermal energy supply to the bio-vegetation complex and calculations of the main parameters of the system for autonomous operation of the object at negative outside air temperatures. The design of the active subsurface system for thermal energy supply to the bio-vegetation complex is proposed in the form of a heat-accumulating sand-gravel mass, inside of which there are heat supply circuits with a heat carrier closed with a concrete screed on top. The calculation of energy consumed by the active sub-ground thermal system providing optimal parameters of the growing medium corresponding to biological rhythms of plant development at low outside air temperatures is also presented. The study determines the area of the photovoltaic unit and the number of photovoltaic modules for generating electric energy in order to cover the spent thermal energy and the effective functioning of the active subsurface system for thermal energy supply to the bio-vegetation complex.</jats:p>",

Pharmaceutical wastes are among the most dangerous polluting wastes of the environment in the world. They include expired products and unused medicines. This study aims to investigate pharmaceutical waste collection management utilizing the location-routing model in a reverse supply chain. To do so, pharmaceutical waste from pharmacies and hospitals is collected and then transfer to collection centers, where waste classification and future decisions are planned. This process is done in two stages, the first includes pharmacies and hospitals, and collection centers, and the second stage includes collection centers, disposal centers, and airports. In the first stage, pharmaceutical waste is collected, and in the second level, this waste is either safely disposed of or recycled, or medicines that can be reused are sent to third-world countries. Finally, by creating an optimization model, the transportation costs, the construction cost of collection centers, disposal costs, and the cost of producing carbon dioxide will be minimized. Reducing carbon dioxide production helps make this chain greener.</jats:p>",

In recent years, serious safety accidents have often occurred due to aging and failure of VRLA batteries, so it is urgent to accurately evaluate the health status of batteries. Accurate estimation of battery SOH is conducive to real-time monitoring of single-battery health information, providing a reliable guarantee for fault diagnosis and improving the overall life and economic performance of the battery pack. In this paper, first, the floating charging operation characteristics and aging failure mechanism of a VRLA battery are summarized. Then, the definition and estimation methods of battery SOH are reviewed, including an experimental method, model method, data-driven method and fusion method. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods and their application conditions are analyzed.

Enhancing the domestic supply of fish, the main source of local protein, can contribute to improved nutrition and food security. This research aimed to improve understanding of the policy interface between the fisheries and health sectors and identify opportunities to strengthen fish supply chain policy to improve domestic (particularly urban) access to fish in the Solomon Islands. The study design drew on theories of policy learning and policy change and analysed policies using a consumption-oriented supply chain approach. Interviews were conducted with 12 key informants in the Solomon Islands, and 15 policy documents were analysed. Analysis of policy documents and interview data indicated that there were strengths as well as opportunities in the existing policy context. In particular, community-based fisheries management approaches and explicit recognition of the links between fisheries and nutrition were key strengths. Challenges included gaps in implementation, variations in capacities across government actors and communities, and limited attention to domestic monitoring and enforcement. Improving the effectiveness of resource management efforts may result in sustainable outcomes for both livelihoods and health, which will accomplish priorities at the national and sub-national levels and support the achievement of the Solomon Islands’ commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>"

Considering the fixed line and the similarity of operation conditions between adjacent stations, this paper proposes an efficient and accurate simplified simulation method to evaluate IGBT conditions based on operating interval segmentation (OIS). Firstly, this paper proposes the framework for a condition evaluation method by segmenting operating intervals based on the similarity of average power loss between neighboring stations. The framework makes it possible to reduce the number of simulations to shorten the simulation time while ensuring the state trend estimation accuracy. Secondly, this paper proposes a basic interval segmentation model that uses the operating conditions as inputs to implement the segmentation of the line and is able to simplify the operation conditions of entire line. Finally, the simulation and analysis of the temperature and stress fields of IGBT modules based on segmented intervals completes the IGBT module condition evaluation and realizes the combination of lifetime calculation with actual operating conditions and internal stresses. The validity of the method is verified by comparing the interval segmentation simulation with actual test results. The results show that the method can effectively characterize the temperature and stress trends of traction converter IGBT modules in the whole line, which could support the fatigue mechanism and lifetime assessment reliability study of IGBT modules.</jats:p>"

In this context, the installation of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems for use in agricultural holdings can contribute to mitigating this problem. However, the use of these systems by farmers continues to be very low. This paper analyses the factors that influence a farmer's decision to adopt these systems to take advantage of rainwater. Greenhouse agriculture in southeast Spain is the case studied. For this, a binary logistic regression model based on a survey administered to farmers was used. Among the variables found to be significant, the most important variables are the quantity of water in the pond, the pond capacity and environmental awareness. The variables that least affect the adoption decision are age, education level and income. These results have allowed the development of the main lines of action for policy-makers to intervene in order to promote the adoption of these systems. These measures focus on enhancing the training of farmers, providing them with financial support and boosting their environmental awareness. The results of this study lead to improved research on farmers’ behaviour and sustainable management of water resources in agriculture.</jats:p>",

To achieve this objective, a theoretical model is proposed based on the literature review and then analyzed using structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) based on a sample of 196 Spanish wineries collected from September 2022 to January 2023. The results reveal that while GSCM partially mediates the GIC–SP relationship, GA positively but not significantly moderates the GSCM–SP relationship. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have contextualized the model proposed in the wine industry, so the study represents the generation of new knowledge about the meaning of the relationships presented. Furthermore, no previous research has analyzed the moderating role of GA in the GSCM–SP relationship, so the study advances understanding of the variables that may affect this link (GSCM–SP).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Canary Islands, located in the Atlantic Ocean, are an archipelago of volcanic origin which, for decades, has been affected by natural fluoride contamination in the water supply of some of its islands, mainly the island of Tenerife. In addition, recent volcanic eruptions in the archipelago and the increased demand for water supply have led to an increase in the fluoride content in other areas which, historically, were not affected. Fluoride content was determined in 274 water supply samples from the most populated islands of the Canary Islands (Tenerife and Gran Canaria) collected during the months of June 2021 to May 2022. The samples were analysed by fluoride ion selective potentiometry. The highest concentrations in Tenerife were found in the municipalities of Sauzal (7.00 mg/L) and Tegueste (5.39 mg/L), both water samples are over the parametric value of 1.5 mg/L set in the supply water legislation. In the Gran Canaria Island, the highest fluoride levels were found in Valsequillo and Mogán with 1.44 mg/L in both locations, but under the parametric fluoride value abovementioned. Consumption of just 1 L of water per day in the El Sauzal area would result in a contribution rate of 77% for adults and children over 15 years of age (Upper Level value of 7 mg/day) and 108% for children 9–14 years of age (UL value of 5 mg/day). The contribution rates increase considerably, reaching or exceeding 100% of the reference value (UL) with increasing consumption of 1 to 2 L of water per day. Therefore, it is considered that there is a health risk of overexposure to fluoride on the island of Tenerife. In the case of the island of Gran Canaria, it has been shown that even the consumption of 2 litres of water per day does not confer contribution rates that pose a health risk.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Pharmaceutical safety has received increasing attention from governments and corporations, and building a safe and effective pharmaceutical cold supply chain network has become an important issue. This paper proposes a two‐stage pharmaceutical cold supply chain network design problem considering drug safety, in which the drug demand, transportation costs, and drug safety risk costs are assumed to be random variables. Due to the presence of uncertainty and the fact that information about the distribution of uncertain parameters is often only partially known, a distributionally robust optimization method is used to handle the uncertainty. A two‐stage distributionally robust optimization model is constructed, in which the reliability of the estimation of the demand necessary to satisfy the entire cold chain network is ensured to be greater than a certain predetermined level by introducing an ambiguous joint chance constraint. The decision process for the problem can be divided into strategic and operational decisions with the goal of minimizing the total costs related to facility construction, the purchase of raw materials, drug production, transportation, and safety risks. By introducing an ambiguity set with mean and covariance information to describe the uncertain parameters, the two‐stage model is eventually reformulated as a standard second‐order cone program, thus making it computationally tractable. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and optimization methods.</jats:p>",

On the demand side, electric vehicles and biofuels for transportation and induction stoves and urban gas networks for households were considered. Based on the National Energy Policy, primary energy supply projections optimized NRE power plant use and increase NRE's position in the national energy mix. A Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) model evaluates 2020–2050 energy demand predictions and low-carbon energy systems. This study's sustainable transition options require two basic technical advances. First, electric vehicles and induction stoves would reduce oil fuel usage by 228.34 million BOE and LPG consumption by 24.65 million BOE. Second, power generation should be decarbonized using NRE sources such as solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal, and nuclear. In 2050, solar power (40 GW), hydropower (38.47 GW), geothermal power (10 GW), and other NRE (24.45 GW, 18.67 GW of which would be biomass power) would dominate NRE electrical capacity. Biomass co-firing for coal power plants would reach 36.35 million tons in 2050. In 2035, the Java-Bali or West Kalimantan system will deploy 1 GW of nuclear power reactors, rising to 4 GW by 2050. Under the Transition Energy (TE) scenario, by 2025 and 2050, new and renewable energy would make up 23% and 31% of the primary energy mix, respectively, reducing GHG emissions per capita. According to predictions, annual GHG emissions per capita will decline from the BAU scenario's 4.48 tonne CO2eq/capita in 2050 to the TE scenario's 4.1 tonne.</jats:p>",

As the most important transportation mode in the high-speed transportation systems, airports are playing an increasingly important role in promoting regional economic development, yielding a number of airport economic promotion areas. To boost effective development management of these areas, accurate risk assessment through data analysis is quite important. Thus in this paper, the idea of ensemble learning is utilized to propose a big data-driven assessment model for supply chains in airport economic promotion areas. In particular, we combine two aspects of data from different sources: (1) national economic statistics and enterprise registration data from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce; (2) data from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and other multi-source data. On this basis, an integrated ensemble learning method is constructed to quantitatively analyze the supply chain security characteristics in domestic airport economic area, providing important support for the security of supply chains in airport economic area. Finally, some experiments are conducted on synthetic data to evaluate the method investigated in this paper, which has proved its efficiency and practice.</jats:p>",

Given this fact, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of chlorination and photolysis to remove the estrogenic activity caused by mixtures of EDCs in water: estrone (E1: 100 ng L−1), 17β-estradiol (E2: 100 ng L−1), ethinylestradiol (EE2: 50 ng L−1), and nonylphenol (NP: 1,000 ng L−1) under operating conditions applicable for water treatment plants. The tests were performed using freshwater spiked with the following mixtures: E1 + E2, E1 + E2 + EE2, E1 + E2 + NP, and E1 + E2 + EE2 + NP). Removal efficiencies of up to 99.7% were achieved at a chlorine dose of 2.75 mg L–1 and 30 min of contact time. In photolysis, estrogenic activity removal was higher than 99.9% at a UV dose of 186 mJ cm–2. Results indicated that both chlorination and photolysis can be efficient to remove the estrogenic activity caused by the tested EDC mixtures in water. Furthermore, experiments suggested that EDC mixtures can be efficiently removed at feasible water disinfection operating conditions.</jats:p>",

We investigated the effect of two levels of Zn supply (marginal and luxury), on Zn and N concentrations in whole grain of two indica rice cvv. Differing in Zn-efficiency (IR26 (inefficient) and IR36 (efficient)), grown in sand culture at ambient (400 µL CO2 L−1 (a[CO2])) and elevated (700 µL CO2 L−1 (e[CO2])) CO2 concentrations. For both cvv., luxury Zn-supply increased vegetative growth, and the foliar and grain Zn concentrations; the increases in grain yield were greater at e[CO2]. The e[CO2] decreased grain Zn concentrations ([Zn]), as is consistently observed in other studies. However, unique to our study, luxury Zn-supply maintained grain N concentrations at e[CO2]. Our data also show that enhanced Zn uptake is the basis of the greater Zn-efficiency of IR36. Lastly, luxury Zn-supply and e[CO2] appreciably decreased the time to panicle emergence and, consequently, to maturity in both cvv. Since Zn-supply can be manipulated by both soil and foliar applications, these findings are potentially important for the quality and quantity of the global rice supply. That is, further investigation of our findings is justified. Key message: Luxury zinc supply maintains grain N concentration at 700 µL CO2 L−1.</jats:p>"

To study its value in academics, this paper focuses on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer and an online platform. This paper discusses the implementation conditions of blockchain, the impact on enterprise decision making, and manufacturer recycling channel selection, and the triple benefits of economy, environment, and society in the CLSC with blockchain empowerment are achieved. Because of the nontransparency of the supply chain, the problem of false recycling is always present. To further solve the problem of false recycling, the recycler decides whether to implement blockchain or not. Through analysis and numerical examples, it is concluded that the greater the difference between real and theoretical recycling volumes, the greater the need for blockchain implementation. At the same time, three major effects of blockchain implementation are defined as decision incentive effect, marketing leverage effect, and incentive alignment effect, which reveal the impact of blockchain on increasing the motivation of CLSC members to make efforts, expanding the market size by improving brand goodwill, and avoiding the inconsistency between the manufacturer and the platform in the preference of the recycling channel. In addition, under blockchain empowerment, a cost range of blockchain implementation is defined, where both the manufacturer and the platform are better off, as well as the optimal recycling channel, which achieves the triple benefits of the CLSC.</jats:p>"

Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient that stimulates maize growth and productivity, but the relationship between N availability and cold tolerance is poorly characterized. Therefore, we studied the acclimation of maize under combined cold stress and N treatments. Exposure to cold stress caused a decline in growth and N assimilation, but increased abscisic acid (ABA) and carbohydrate accumulation. The application of different N concentrations from the priming stage to the recovery period resulted in the following observations: (i) high N supply alleviated cold stress-dependent growth inhibition, as shown by increased biomass, chlorophyll and Rubisco content and PSII efficiency; (ii) cold stress-induced ABA accumulation was repressed under high N, presumably due to enhanced stomatal conductance; (iii) the mitigating effects of high N on cold stress could be due to the increased activities of N assimilation enzymes and improved redox homeostasis. After cold stress, the ability of maize seedlings to recover increased under high N treatment, indicating the potential role of high N in the cold stress tolerance of maize seedlings.</jats:p>",

Recently, the occurrence of odor compounds geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), in Lake Paldang has adversely affected the drinking water supply. The causative organisms of odor compounds have not been identified. Thus, this study analyzed the correlation between odor compounds and microorganisms and identified the odor-producing microorganisms in the Han River system. Odor compounds were primarily detected in the Bukhan River system but not in the Namhan River system. Geosmin was detected at high concentrations in summer, whereas 2-MIB was detected at high concentrations in summer and autumn. Microorganisms that appeared at the time of geosmin occurrence were actinobacteria (0.317, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and Dolichospermum (0.326, p &amp;lt; 0.01) among cyanobacteria, and the correlation was significant. The occurrence of 2-MIB mainly coincided with actinobacteria (0.745, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and Pseudanabaena (0.321, p &amp;lt; 0.01) among cyanobacteria, and the correlation was significant. Therefore, to manage the odor compounds in Lake Paldang, which is a drinking water source, it is important to control the appearance of actinobacteria and cyanobacteria in the Bukhan River system.</jats:p>",

Para tanto, foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa e descritiva que utilizou entrevistas com a técnica da grade de repertório para a coleta de dados. Os dados foram analisados mediante a análise de conteúdo de Honey e a análise de coincidência (CNA). Os resultados da pesquisa indicam que o capital social se mostrou fundamental para desenvolver resiliência nas redes de suprimentos na administração pública, por meio dos atributos de compartilhamento de informações técnicas; precisão na comunicação; antecipação na comunicação de informações relevantes; reciprocidade; confiança; transparência e comprometimento. A originalidade do estudo reside na utilização da teoria do capital social em estudos sobre resiliência na administração pública e na adoção de um método de coleta e análise de dados robusto e ainda não explorado em pesquisas na administração pública brasileira. As principais contribuições do estudo foram: 1) destacar o capital social como constructo multinível que influencia o desenvolvimento da resiliência; 2) ampliar os estudos sobre resiliência na administração pública; 3) fornecer informações que podem ser utilizadas por gestores públicos, a fim de evitar ou minimizar a ocorrência de riscos que comprometam a prestação de serviços públicos e 4) adotar um método de pesquisa inédito na administração pública brasileira.</jats:p>"

On the basis of the study of the unique features of the electric power industry, it is proved that diversification is an effective tool ensuring sustainable operation and development in the course of transformation. The specific directions of diversification to achieve technical, environmental and economic results are considered. The authors demonstrate that diversification can manifest itself in different forms: as a way to implement a systematic approach to energy transition management, as a complex set of organizational and technical changes in the electric power industry, and as an institutional mechanism to support innovations. Tools for managing diversification during the energy transition have been identified. In particular, the experience of implementing systems of integrated planning of energy resources is systematized, representing a set of legal and economic procedures that contribute to minimizing public costs for energy services to consumers. The key provisions of the structural maneuver have been formulated. These include specific directions of diversification, consisting of a certain increase in the specific market share of thermal power plants, in the structure of generation capacities of renewable energy sources in order to compensate for their increased production costs, and nuclear power plants under advanced development. The advantages and limitations of the developed principles of diversification in the context of the global energy crisis are discussed.</jats:p>"

The proportion of space membrane areas in the tank was further developed, by increasing the membrane areas of a single tank to 1.6 times that before the transformation, and the design production capacity of a single tank is increased from 10,000 m3/d before the transformation to 16,700 m3/d. The recovery rate of a single tank was also increased from 96.28 to 97.77%. The energy consumption per ton of water decreased from 0.06 to 0.017 MJ. The annual carbon emissions reduction reached 197.13 tons per tank. In terms of the water quality, the algae removal rate from surface water by the ultrafiltration membrane reached 100%. Further, the removal rates of 2 μm particles, turbidity, and chlorophyll were above 99%.

The forecast dataset was updated every 3 h (eight times a day). Although the simulation results showed that the proposed method could reduce the supply‐demand imbalances, it was not clear whether the forecasted or actual values made contributions. Therefore, in this study, we propose and evaluate a real‐time scheduling and operation method using the forecasted and actual PV power outputs assuming that the forecasted dataset is updated only once a day. Numerical simulations of supply‐demand operations are conducted on the power system model of the Kanto area of Japan for one year. The results show that the previous study method has a slight advantage over proposed method in terms of curtailed PV energy and operational cost of thermal generators reduction, but the difference is very small, indicating that the contribution of the actual PV power outputs is greater than that of the forecasted PV power outputs.</jats:p>",

Cameroon as a nation is equally exposed to these climate vulnerabilities, and contributing to global climate efforts is imperative. She has earmarked the integration of 25% renewables in its electricity production mix and a 32% emission reduction, all as part of her commitment to global climate action. The fresh commitments coupled with a rapidly growing power demand have paved the way for a revolutionized approach to electricity generation in Cameroon. However, the imminent changes, as well as their implications, remain uncertain. This study explores how these emission reduction targets can be achieved through the adoption of a more sustainable power transition, which provides realistic solutions for emission reduction, escaping high carbon pathways. The assessment of the level at which long-term electricity generation scenarios in Cameroon could be renewable energy intensive was done using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) tool following a backcasting approach. The study noted that there is an implementation gap between earmarked policy ambitions and existing measures. The study recommended several opportunities in aspects, such as suitable share of technologies, administrative reforms, and required adjustments within the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which the government could exploit in the electricity sector to sail across the challenging trade-offs needed to become a sustainable economy in a carbon-constrained world. It equally examines actions that could help close the gap between earmarked policy ambitions and existing pathways and proposes cost-effective methods that were identified as priorities.</jats:p>"

This study corroborates this perspective, aiming to identify which attributes of social capital contribute to explaining the development of resilience in public administration supply networks and how they combine in this explanation. A qualitative and descriptive research was carried out, using interviews with the repertoire grid technique for data collection. Data were analyzed using Honey’s content analysis and coincidence analysis (CNA). The research results indicate that social capital proved to be fundamental to developing resilience in supply networks in public administration, through the attributes of sharing technical information, precision in communication, anticipation in communicating relevant information, reciprocity, trust, transparency, and commitment. The originality of the study lies in the use of social capital theory in studies on resilience in public administration and in the adoption of a robust data collection and analysis method that has not yet been explored in research in Brazilian public administration. The main contributions of the study were: (1) to highlight social capital as a multilevel construct that influences the development of resilience, (2) to expand studies on resilience in public administration, (3) to provide information that public managers can use to avoid or minimize the risks that jeopardize the provision of public services, and (4) to adopt an unprecedented research method in the Brazilian public administration.</jats:p>"

In view of the difficulties in supervision and leakage location of the urban water supply network, based on the technology of Internet of things and artificial intelligence algorithm, a leakage detection method of the urban water supply network is proposed. First of all, low-power, low-cost terminal detection equipment and gateway monitoring equipment are developed for remote data transmission through WiFi or cellular data networks. The data organization, storage, release and control are realized by using the data center software platform. Second, the leakage location model of the water supply network is established by using remote pressure monitoring data, and the accurate location of pipe network leakage is realized. Based on ALO and PSO optimization algorithms, the water supply network in an industrial area of a city in China is solved. Finally, the performance of the two optimization algorithms is compared and analyzed. The results show that the designed intelligent monitoring system of the water supply network can monitor the pipe network well. In addition, on the problem of leakage detection, the ALO algorithm is superior to the PSO algorithm in terms of optimization ability and search efficiency. The leakage monitoring method of water supply networks proposed in this study can provide a reference for the design and management of urban water supply networks.</jats:p>",

An estimate of the error of regulation of the reactive power factor on the higher voltage side of the transformers of the main step-down substation, where settlement meters are installed, is given, with stabilization of the reactive power factor on the low voltage side of these transformers. The synthesis of the system of automatic control of the reactive power factor, built as a function of the power of consumers and power losses in transformers, and the estimation of its error are considered. The proposed control system is intended for power supply systems with a combined load, the use of which will allow the consumer to avoid penalty coefficients to the tariff for active electricity, and ultimately reduce losses in the transmission of electricity and increase the transmission capacity of the electrical network.</jats:p>"

Herein, a drug‐free biomimetic nanovehicle capable of improving cerebral ischemic tolerance and thus promoting ischemia‐reperfusion therapy is reported. The nanovehicle comprises an amphiphilic polyfluorocarbon, which delivers oxygen to alleviate the hostile hypoxic environment of ischemic brain, and Pluronic P123, which inhibits matrix metalloproteinase‐9 to protect the blood–brain barrier (BBB). When intravenously injected into ischemic stroke rats with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, these nanovehicles are able to preferentially access cerebral ischemic lesions in an inflammation‐directed manner, conferring robust ischemic tolerance and reperfusion resistance of brain tissues for ischemia‐reperfusion therapy. Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that the nanovehicle is beneficial for mice with permanent ischemic stroke induced by photothrombosis.

Specifically, we theorise and test the mediating role of employee engagement on the relationship between GSCM practices and environmental performance. Survey data from 394 manufacturing firms were used to test the model and hypotheses. Our findings show that employee engagement plays an important role in supporting the implementation of most GSCM practices. Non‐significant results in relation to eco‐design practices suggest that employee engagement is not as important for supporting product design‐based GSCM practices.

The impact of the scenarios on the water supply scheme of the Pearl River Delta was investigated. The results showed that (1) the water shortage of the Pearl River Delta is highly dependent upon the dryness combination of the upstream runoff during the dry period, in particular to the cities at the Pearl River Delta estuary, the water shortages are seriously influenced by saltwater intrusion; and (2) the water transfer projects could alleviate the water supply pressure of the Pearl River Delta when there is an extreme or more dryness encounter of upstream runoff. However, when extreme dryness events are impacting the upstream runoff of the West River, the impact of the water transfer projects is weakened and much of the critical upstream runoff for saltwater suppression cannot be satisfied, which largely impacts water withdrawals at the downstream cities in the Pearl River Delta estuary.</jats:p>",

Parameters were measured at 15 sampling locations. High values of Turbidity, pH and high concentrations of BOD5, COD, Nitrite, Ammonium and Phosphates were recorded. The results showed that the Niger River water quality was good for 4 months and poor for 5 months during the dry season in a low flow period. Moreover, the water quality was poor during the 3 months of the wet season in the high flow period. The calculated WQI average values ranged from 75 to 100, indicating very poor water quality from upstream to downstream of Bamako city. Therefore, the Niger River water is polluted and cannot be used for drinking or industrial uses without any treatment.</jats:p>",

The farmer plants and grows fresh agricultural products with yield uncertainty, the supplier is the leader of the supply chain and the designer of the contracts, and the retailer sells processed products with random demand. Under CVaR criterion, this paper discusses three option contracts between the supplier and the retailer, as well as wholesale price contracts or replenishment cost-sharing contracts between the supplier and the farmer. Results show that when the farmer is risk-neutral, option contracts with or without replenishment cost-sharing contracts can maximize the total profit and increase the profits of all members simultaneously. When the farmer and the retailer are risk-averse, only option contracts with replenishment cost-sharing contracts can ensure supply chain full coordination and Pareto improvement by adjusting the option parameters and making the farmer’s sharing ratio equal to his risk aversion coefficient. Moreover, through numerical analysis, we discovered that the interval of the Pareto improvement decreases with the retailer’s risk aversion coefficient and the quantity loss rate, and increases with the farmer’s risk aversion coefficient. The supplier will not be able to increase his own profits when the loss rate is excessively large. Therefore, the leader should consider the risk aversion degree of all parties and the quantity loss rate of fresh agricultural products before choosing contracts.</jats:p>"

Living in an urban environment for a long time can make people suffer from ‘urban disease’, which can seriously affect their physical and mental health. Forest rehabilitation is a new form of outdoor activity in many countries, which has been gradually promoted by society in recent years. Many studies have confirmed that forest environments have positive impacts on the human body and mind, so forest healthcare and treatment are crucial to the prevention and treatment of ‘urban diseases’. This study is based on artificial intelligence (AI) to carry out the planning and design of the forest health base. According to sensory design theories including air factor, somatosensory factor, and audiovisual factor, this paper proposed different landscape configuration methods to enhance health and well-being. Finally, it was found that in the planning and design of the health base, when the human comfort index is greater than 85 and less than 20, it is very uncomfortable for the human body.</jats:p>",

Using a custom-made optical slider bearing test rig, this work experimentally revealed some characteristics of LLS lubrication in a cylinder-on-disc contact, and proposed two wettability gradient patterns, namely stripe wettability and interlaced wettability, to regulate the lubricant supply to improve the lubricating properties of LLS. The effect of these two wettability patterns was evaluated experimentally according to the lubricating film thickness. The interferograms of the bearing contact under LLS show that the two patterns can augment the oil replenishment through unidirectional lubricant transport by the unbalanced interfacial force via the wettability gradient. Moreover, the interlaced wettability pattern is more effective due to the discontinuous distribution of lubricant from its hydrophilic/hydrophobic region intervals and the transfer of the hydrophobic film to the hydrophilic regions.</jats:p>"

However, the dynamical degradation characteristic of battery is necessary to be considered in optimal operation of HESS. A bi‐level model considering battery degradation is proposed to obtain optimal sizing and operation of HESS. The proposed model includes a novel real‐time energy management strategy (EMS) using average power as thresholds, to effectively reduce the demand charge and energy consumption charge. Thresholds are dynamically adjusted with the consideration of battery capacity degradation. A real measured load profile from Beijing‐Shanghai high speed railway is studied. The results demonstrate that the proposed EMS performs better than previous EMS in cost saving. The dynamically adjusted thresholds of EMS are proved to be essential under the consideration of battery degradation. With the optimal sizing of the HESS, the traction substation can achieve 8.69% annual saving of demand charge and recycle 52.33% of the RBE. The results also show that a traction substation equipped with the HESS yields higher economic benefit than the energy storage systems equipped with only a battery or a supercapacitor.</jats:p>",

However, firms require building dynamic capabilities through blockchain, which can be key to realizing circular economy model. This study introduces a framework for building blockchain‐driven dynamic capabilities for a circular supply chain. We further use the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method to evaluate three major dynamic capabilities and 18 sub‐dynamic capabilities and their interrelationships. The mining industry in Ghana sets the stage for this analysis. The study results show that although blockchain‐driven sensing dynamic capability, seizing dynamic capability, and reconfiguring dynamic capability are crucial for developing a circular supply chain, they do not strictly follow a sequence and overlap. We highlight various cause–effect relationships, providing insights into the role of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities. That information is important to firms, stakeholders, and partners to draft an appropriate strategy to build blockchain‐driven dynamic capabilities for developing a circular supply chain.</jats:p>",

Here, the effects of atmospheric changes projected in 2100 on this relationship were examined with a 5‐km resolution ocean/sea ice/ice shelf model of the Southern Ocean with different simulated dissolved iron sources and idealized biological uptake. The atmospheric changes are added as idealized increments to the forcing. Inclusion of a poleward shift and strengthening of the winds, increased precipitation, and warmer atmospheric temperatures resulted in doubling of the heat advected onto the continental shelf and an 83% increase in the total Antarctic ice shelf basal melt. The total dissolved iron supply to the surface waters over the continental shelf increased by 62%, while the surface iron supply due just to basal melt driven overturning increased by 48%. However, even though the ice shelf driven contribution becomes less important to the total iron supply on average (29% of total), the ice shelf involvement becomes relatively even more important in some locations, such as the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The modified atmospheric conditions also produced a reduction in summer sea ice extent and a shoaling of the summer mixed layers. These simulated responses to projected changes suggest relief of light and nutrient limitation for phytoplankton blooms over the Antarctic continental shelf and perhaps an increase in annual production in years to come.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Government subsidies have played an important role in the development of green agriculture. In addition, the Internet platform is becoming a new channel to realize green traceability and promote the sale of agricultural products. In this context, we consider a two-level green agricultural products supply chain (GAPSC) consisting of one supplier and one Internet platform. The supplier makes green R&amp;D investments to produce green agricultural products along with conventional agricultural products, and the platform implements green traceability and data-driven marketing. The differential game models are established under four government subsidy scenarios: no subsidy (NS), consumer subsidy (CS), supplier subsidy (SS), and supplier subsidy with green traceability cost-sharing (TSS). Then, the optimal feedback strategies under each subsidy scenario are derived using Bellman’s continuous dynamic programming theory. The comparative static analyses of key parameters are given, and the comparisons among different subsidy scenarios are conducted. Numerical examples are employed to obtain more management insights. The results show that the CS strategy is effective only if the competition intensity between two types of products is below a certain threshold. Compared to the NS scenario, the SS strategy can always improve the supplier’s green R&amp;D level, the greenness level, market demand for green agricultural products, and the system’s utility. The TSS strategy can build on the SS strategy to further enhance the green traceability level of the platform and the greenness level and demand for green agricultural products due to the advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism. Accordingly, a win-win situation for both parties can be realized under the TSS strategy. However, the positive effect of the cost-sharing mechanism will be weakened as the supplier subsidy increases. Moreover, compared to three other scenarios, the increase in the environmental concern of the platform has a more significant negative impact on the TSS strategy.</jats:p>"

They may also improve water supply for cash crops by reducing evaporation and increasing soil water storage capacity. However, their influence on plant-associated microbial communities, including symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), is less well understood. In a corn field trial, we studied the response of AMF to a four-species winter CC, relative to a no-CC control, as well as to two contrasting water supply levels (i.e., drought and irrigated). We measured AMF colonization of corn roots and used Illumina MiSeq sequencing to study the composition and diversity of soil AMF communities at two depths (i.e., 0–10 and 10–20 cm). In this trial, AMF colonization was high (61–97%), and soil AMF communities were represented by 249 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 5 genera and 33 virtual taxa. Glomus, followed by Claroideoglomus and Diversispora (class Glomeromycetes), were the dominant genera. Our results showed interacting effects between CC treatments and water supply levels for most of the measured variables. The percentage of AMF colonization, arbuscules, and vesicles tended to be lower in irrigated than drought sites, with significant differences detected only under no-CC. Similarly, soil AMF phylogenetic composition was affected by water supply only in the no-CC treatment. Changes in the abundance of individual virtual taxa also showed strong interacting effects between CCs, irrigation, and sometimes soil depth, although CC effects were clearer than irrigation effects. An exception to these interactions was soil AMF evenness, which was higher in CC than no-CC, and higher under drought than irrigation. Soil AMF richness was not affected by the applied treatments. Our results suggest that CCs can affect the structure of soil AMF communities and modulate their response to water availability levels, although soil heterogeneity could influence the final outcome.</jats:p>"

Simulation results indicate that when nature-based solutions are implemented, surface runoff is reduced and ambient storage increases during the rainy season (December–March); while the overall flow increases during the dry season (June–September). The combination of specific hydrologic components of RIOS-customized intervention scenario simulation outputs—namely surface flows and groundwater contribution to stream flows—indicate on average 33% increase in the overall water yield, or 206 hm3/year, across the study watershed when comparing against the baseline conditions. In the same modeling scenario, the water storage in the sub-watersheds adjacent to the reservoirs showed an increase of 58% (or 341 hm3/year).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We consider a three-stage fresh agricultural product supply chain consisting of a supplier, a third-party logistics service provider (TPLSP), and a retailer and discuss the coordination mechanism of “revenue sharing + double cost sharing” contracts and “two-part tariff + revenue sharing + double cost sharing” contracts between the supplier, TPLSP, and the retailer. Based on this, we not only explore the conditions for supply chain full coordination and Pareto improvement but also analyze the effect of blockchain technology application cost, consumer environmental protection awareness, freshness preference, green trust level on carbon emission reduction level, fresh-keeping effort level, price decisions, and profits by comparing three different decision-making models. Results show that the improvement of the green trust level can help to improve the carbon emission reduction level, fresh-keeping effort level, price decisions, and profits. The application of blockchain technology can reduce transaction costs and improve consumer green trust levels, thereby increasing market demand and profits. When environmental protection awareness and freshness preference are higher than a certain value, the unit retail price of fresh products under decentralized decision-making is the highest with the blockchain technology applied. TPLSP can increase the wholesale, service, and retail prices of fresh products by appropriately increasing the blockchain technology application cost-sharing ratio.

Characterized by low data requirement, strong operability and flexibility, the conventional ‘assessment based on comprehensive index’ (ACI) is used to assess the drought risk, the index obtained by which can only represent the relative risk level among the objects and has no spatiotemporal characteristic. Therefore, a new method based on the iterative transformation of spatiotemporal vector (DRST) is proposed to solve this defect. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The drought risk matrices obtained by DRS and DRT cannot quantify the drought risk level of subregions in each year absolutely. (2) The drought risk values obtained by DRST can be used to compare the drought risk from temporal and spatial dimensions at the same time, and both the drought-affected regions and the drought risk level are consistent with the statistical data. The new method expands the subsequent utilization space of the ‘assessment index’. For example, the allocation of drought-resistant resources (water resources, drought-resistant funds, etc.) can be determined according to these indexes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When natural occurrences affect populated areas and destroy local infrastructure and population, they are referred to as natural disasters and cause pain and deprivation. India is one of the world's regions that experiences disasters the most frequently because of its physiographic and meteorological circumstances. Natural disasters have been more frequent during the past ten years or more, notably in India. Increased population, urbanization, industrialization, development in high-risk areas, environmental degradation, and climate change may all contribute to increased vulnerability to catastrophe risks. Humanitarian operations are started as soon as a disaster occurs with the goal of assisting victims quickly in a variety of ways, such as rescuing those who are affected or stranded, gathering and disposing of corpses, allocating resources, providing food aid, shelter, and medical care, and reopening access to remote areas. Delays in delivery or relief during humanitarian efforts can result in lives lost. Therefore, as it guarantees the seamless flow of products and services in a convoluted supply chain, logistical efficiency is a crucial component of humanitarian success. Logistics is essential to the effectiveness and responsiveness of major humanitarian initiatives like health, food, shelter, water, and sanitation. It acts as a link between catastrophe preparedness and response as well as between procurement and distribution. Calamities, crises, plagues, and destructive actions can all be categorized as disasters depending on the logistical effort needed. Different sorts of disasters require different approaches to management: Running refugee camps is considerably different from giving the kind of aid needed after a sudden natural disaster or a nuclear accident. Aid offered to help a place develop is different from aid given to deal with famine and drought. The humanitarian supply chain (HSC) is an organization that specializes in planning the distribution and storage of supplies to impacted areas and individuals during emergencies and natural disasters. The complex environments involved in a disaster, quick design, new or unfamiliar intermediaries or participants, and thus, it faces many possible obstacles, make it highly unpredictable and tumultuous. The humanitarian supply chain is made up of many different players, each with a unique attitude, way of acting, and cultural background. In a situation involving India, the humanitarian supply chain involves foreign aid agencies, host governments, the military, local self-governments, regional aid agencies, etc., all of whom have competing interests, mandates, capacities, and logistics expertise. Due to the complexity, it is imperative to analyze key variables in order to create a humanitarian supply chain that meets the needs of donors, beneficiaries, and service providers alike. The history of India demonstrates how a lack of professionalism, cooperation between many parties, and several other cultural variables have turned the field of humanitarian logistics into one with a lot of difficulties and important considerations. When building a supply chain, from sourcing to production, storage, distribution, and all transportation links in between, a sustainable supply chain (SSC) tries to take the environment, the economy, and social and human issues into consideration. The humanitarian supply chain should be integrated with sustainable practices while it is being designed or developed. In order to handle the most difficult situations in the context of natural calamities, a sustainable humanitarian supply chain that has been optimized is necessary. With the aid of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchains, and machine learning, the domain of sustainable humanitarian supply chains in India is experiencing difficulties and obstacles with plenty of room for improvement. In the context of the natural disasters in India, the article's main focus is on the significance of an effective sustainable humanitarian supply chain. The goal of this article is to identify the obstacles and variables that affect the efficient development of a humanitarian supply chain in India that is flexible enough to fulfill the unique needs of an HSC that are completely different from those of a commercial supply chain.</jats:p>"

The aim of our experiment is to determine the effects of different amounts and proportions of nutrients and those of the seed size of winter wheat in laboratory seed tests on the seed parameters (germination percentage, germination power, seedling health and vigour), as well as in field tests of the seed parameters (emergence percentage and yield of next crop year). Laboratory seed tests of winter wheat variety GK Petur were conducted with seeds that underwent ten nutrient treatments and of three seed size fractions over four crop years, together with field experiments in three growing seasons. Compared to the untreated control group, N treatments significantly decreased the health of the seedlings in the next generation of winter wheat. PK treatments without N increased the germination percentage, vigour value and emergence percentage significantly, but the health of the seedlings decreased. In contrast, NPK treatments with a ratio of 2:1:1 improved all the tested parameters compared to those of the control group. The increase in seed sizes significantly increased the germination power, seedling health, vigour value, emergence percentage and the yield of the next crop year. It can be concluded that the factors of nutrient supply, crop year of the seed production and the seed size significantly influence the quality of the seed (germination percentage, germination power, seedling health, vigour and emergence percentage), thus also the yield of the next generation.</jats:p>"

This situation leads to a number of negative impacts on the transport network, such as traffic congestion, carbon emissions, and long queues at refueling stations. The impact of vehicles requiring energy replenishment on the negative effect is nonlinear. Therefore, the negative effect data of working days cannot be directly used to evaluate the cost, and the traffic equilibrium allocation problem also needs to be solved. An equilibrium allocation model of hybrid vehicles considering the energy replenishment demand in holidays is established, aiming at minimizing the total time cost and energy consumption cost. The Frank–Wolfe algorithm is used to solve the traffic allocation problem in advance, and the negative effect of the urban energy network during holidays is predicted by the Genetic Algorithm—Back Propagation (GA-BP) algorithm. Then, the energy-replenishing vehicles in the traffic network are induced to reduce the total cost. Finally, taking the actual road network in Jiulongpo District of Chongqing City, southwest of China, as an example, the negative effects of multiple stations are predicted. The results show that the prediction method proposed in this paper is effective during holiday periods. In addition, as the market share of electric vehicles increases, the negative cost can decrease gradually. The predicted results can provide a reference for traffic managers.</jats:p>"

The Drave mountain village (North Portugal) has, for centuries, faced harsh hydrological, hydrogeological, and hydropedological conditions. Since the second half of the twentieth century, the nature of water demand in Drave has drastically changed. The research objective is to understand the evolution of water demand and supply in the village of Drave, from the sixteenth century to the present day, and to present a possible solution to meet future water needs. A sampling network, comprising surface water and groundwater points, was established. Then, a sampling campaign took place in the dry season, and another one in the wet season. Laboratory analysis encompassed major inorganic ions, Potentially Toxic Elements, and microbiological parameters. Groundwater vulnerability to pollution was assessed through the DRASTIC index and GVTool, a Geographic Information System open-source application. Two historical periods were identified concerning the Drave water demand and supply: (i) from the foundation of the village until the second half of the twentieth century; (ii) from the mid-twentieth century on. The current scenario consists of using water resources with chemical and microbiological contamination to supply the needs of temporary inhabitants. Groundwater vulnerability to pollution ranges from extremely low to moderately low, with the most vulnerable areas corresponding to valley bottoms. A possible solution to meet the future water demand consists of abstracting and treating only surface water during the wet season and taking advantage of the hydrological regime of stream alluvial deposits during the dry season.\n</jats:p>",

Big data can be used to obtain large-scale human movement data to study hospital characteristics from a supply–demand balance perspective. Here, 182 comprehensive hospitals in three districts of Shenzhen were picked as an example, and multi-source data were introduced as a quantitative assessment tool to analyze them. First, the mobile public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) was researched and developed independently and used to collect volunteered geographic information (VGI) data, which was adopted to quantify hospital service supply. Second, the population’s demand for hospitals was characterized by the quantified point of interest (POI) data. Finally, the location entropy method was utilized to quantify the levels of supply and demand for comprehensive hospital services from a supply–demand balance perspective, which was used to guide the classification of the comprehensive hospitals. The result shows that: (1) the service scopes and the service pressure are different for the same type of comprehensive hospitals classified by the traditional method; (2) the spatial distribution of patients is related to land function; (3) the overlap area between the part with a high service pressure level in the comprehensive hospital and the part with high medical demand of the patient is prone to service blindness. This study paves a new way to optimize the spatial allocation of medical institutions or other types of public facilities, rationalize resource allocation, and alleviate urban transportation congestion.</jats:p>"

To end this, we consider a three-players supply chain involving two firms and a common retailer in which the firms sell their transparent products via a dual channel, while the retailer sells probabilistic goods by a direct channel. First, the three players’ demand functions are derived using both a Hotelling model and taking account of consumers’ price reference effects. Second, we construct a probabilistic selling model for both decentralized and centralized supply chain systems. The optimal policies for the decentralized system are determined by employing Stackelberg sequential games and an analytical approach. Third, we propose a new three-way revenue sharing contract to deal with channel conflict. Furthermore, we determine the conditions under which the dual-channel supply chain can be coordinated to achieve a win–win situation for all participants. The results indicate that the retailer adopts probabilistic selling depending upon the relative values of the two manufacturers’ production costs in the three-way revenue sharing contract. More interestingly, PS not only can improve the supply chain’s efficiency, but also can coordinate the dual-channel supply chain to achieve a win-win situation for all participants. Finally, we present a numerical analysis to verify our results and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters involved.</jats:p>"

APSS with high-frequency modular SC are characterized by a complex spectral distribution of the output energy coordinates with the dominance of canonical harmonics. Thus, the task to develop methods for analyzing the quality of generated electric power of such type of APSS in a wide range of disturbing factors with the dominance of canonical harmonics in the coordinates of the output energy is relevant. For the specified type of APSS, it is reasonable to use the time deformation method for the average values of the coordinates of the output energy under the sinusoidal modulation law on the interval of constancy of the SC structure. The procedure to investigate the influence of APSS operating modes and methods of correction of the modulation law on the quality of output energy is demonstrated by the example of two types of systems. The authors have defined the conditions of the worst value of the harmonic coefficient of the output current in APSS with cycloconverter and multiphase permanent magnets synchronous generator. The authors have demonstrated the effect of modifying the control law by shifting the modulation center and introducing negative current feedback on the possibility to improve the coefficient by 50 %. The authors have defined the conditions of the worst value of the harmonic coefficients of the internal EMF and output current in APSS with an intermediate DC voltage link and a modular two-level voltage inverter. The proposed method to analyze the steady-state operation of APSS with high-frequency modular SC makes it possible to identify the conditions of the worst quality of generated electrical energy and assess the impact of control methods of APSS in a wide range of system parameters, considering the presence of intermittent currents.</jats:p>",

(2) Methods: This study considers the impact of the spatial characteristics of farmland plots on the economies of scale of farmers in terms of farmland use and heterogeneity. The effect of plots’ area and location on the directional flow of plots in the farmland transfer market from the perspective of matching supply and demand is also investigated. An empirical test is conducted on farmer actions and plot characteristics data based on surveys from 2015 and 2018 in the Chinese provinces of Heilongjiang, Henan, Zhejiang, and Sichuan. (3) Results: The plots’ area and location affect economies of scale for different potential transfer plots. This leads to large plots and adjacent plots in the market transferring to large-scale households, while scattered small plots mainly transfer to ordinary households. (4) Conclusions: The fixed spatial characteristics of the plots determine the scattered circulation of farmland in the transfer market, hindering the centralized utilization of farmland and restricting efficiency in farmland transfer market allocation. The findings from the context of China are similar to what has been found elsewhere. This suggests the need for a unified trading platform for farmland transfer and strengthening the mutual transformation of land and agricultural machinery.</jats:p>"

Using psychometrics, American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) heat exchanger calculation, condensation and frost calculation methods, simulations models for heat recovery ventilation and energy recovery ventilation are developed. It is concluded that the risk of frost in heat exchangers is higher in northern Sweden than in southern Sweden and Denmark due to low outdoor air temperatures during the winter, however heat recovery systems in Copenhagen and Gothenburg still has a risk of frost formation even though these cities has relatively warm weather conditions. Out of several simulation models that are created during the study, the detailed model that takes condensation effect into consideration, is proven to be worthy to be used in further investigations, due to results that more accurately represent real word conditions. Risk of frost formation becomes significantly lower in every city when heat recovery ventilation is changed into energy recovery ventilation. Even though heat recovery ventilation is simulated only with the simplified model, it is safe to assume that it will still be effective in reality. Although bypass strategies were effective at eliminating the risk of frost in heat recovery units, they are not as efficient from an energy perspective. The more air is by-passed through the cross-flow plate heat exchanger, the fewer opportunities there are to recover energy from exhaust air, which leads to lower supply air temperatures and higher energy need for heating a living space.</jats:p>",

These test results revealed that: (1) the regional strata from shallow to deep are the near-surface loose layer, upper bench loess, mixed stripping material, glutenite water reservoir layer and rubble collecting ditch; and the glutenite water reservoir layer is the main water storage body of the underground water reservoir. (2) Permeability coefficient, porosity, layered and cumulative water storage of the western underground water reservoir in Baorixile open-pit coalmine increase with the elevation increase, and show a quadratic function relationship.

These industries employed thousands of employees in each country and had a major impact on the national economies of countries as they linked the countries with the rest of the world in trade. It was no secret that logistics cargo centres faced many challenges as they operated. Researchers used the survey questionnaire method as well as face to face interviews, expert panel interviews at universities and literature review in this research. Findings reveal that logistics cargo centres like container terminals, warehouses, bonded warehouses, dry ports, airports, roads and a modern Customs and Excise Department, which fully embraces e-government and is strategically linked to all importers and exporters as well as critical trade and related government departments have improved a lot, but still needed further improvement in Oman, Zimbabwe to march regional and global competitors for these countries. It was found that critical skills, ports, Customs, and investment infrastructure in developing countries needed to be improved as well as processing and turnaround time to match best practices in the regions and globally. One Stop Shop for investment was operational in Oman but was still in its infancy in Zimbabwe. Delayed deliveries and wrong documentation were experienced sometimes due to port and Customs delays or transport and loading delays in all two countries. Oman and Zimbabwe had improved a lot and Zimbabwe had some technical delays at its logistics cargo centres and ports of entry and exit as semi-manual systems were used, is not a complete smart system used with no papers at all as expected. A lot of work in progress is there to catch up with the rest of the world. At the time of the conference our work may still be work in progress and we will share part of the findings, the field research done in Oman which is complete.

In this paper, we study the impact of digital enablement on collaborative green innovation in supply chain enterprises in order to assist in reasonable strategic decision making. An evolutionary game model is constructed for both upstream and downstream supply chain companies under digital enablement, following which the model is solved and systematically simulated. Our main findings are as follows: The influencing factors of collaborative green innovation in the supply chain can be divided into driving factors, blocking factors, and regulating factors. After digital enablement, the effect of the drivers of collaborative green innovation is more obvious, the side-effects of the deterrents are weakened, and the threshold of the positive effect of the moderators is expanded. Overall, digital enablement helps to promote collaborative green innovation in the supply chain, and companies should apply digital technology to enable collaborative green innovation.</jats:p>"

To promote the recycling initiatives and construct sustainable operations, how to stimulate supply chain stakeholders participating in the online recycling becomes a challenge issue. This paper considers one supplier, one manufacturer, and one third-party recycler (3PR) in a two-echelon remanufacturing closed-loop supply chain with an “Internet+ recycling” platform, in which consumers can access the online recycling platform and make an appointment for recycling without a physical visit. The manufacturer has three choices: either do not participate or participate with one of two strategies: cost-sharing (CS) or active promotion (AP) strategy. We develop a Stackelberg game model to study the motivation of the manufacturer to participate in the “Internet+ recycling” platform and the influence mechanism of key factors. The key findings include the following: (1) compared with the case without the “Internet+ recycling” platform, when the proportion of cost sharing for the 3PR is low, strategy CS contributes to the improvement of the 3PR’s performance; (2) in the presence of two participation strategies, when the disassembly rate is low enough, the manufacturer prefers strategy AP; otherwise, he selects strategy CS; and (3) a high proportion of cost sharing for the manufacturer or low promotion effort cost can increase the whole profit of the closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>"

The vulnerabilities of the global food system have been particularly laid bare with significant disruptions to food and fertiliser supply chains instigating profound shocks on global food supply – disproportionately affecting poorer and vulnerable populations of the Global South. The immediate concerns and potential solutions to the global impacts of the Ukraine–Russia conflict were recently discussed by a panel of industry, academic and civil society experts convened by the European branch of the International Life Sciences Institute, all of whom are authors of this manuscript. The key concerns: the reduced affordability of food – focussing on those most vulnerable to its effects; the socio‐political implications of reduced food security; food safety; and nutrition security are all discussed in this Point de Vue. The authors voice the need for improved resilience to future shocks and stress on the food system.</jats:p>",

However, a high level of remanufacturing design will increase design costs for manufacturers, while also reducing the cost for remanufacturers. Moreover, manufacturers usually use patent barriers to restrict the development of remanufacturers. The main aims of this study were to explore how manufacturers and remanufacturers can benefit each other, taking into account patent protection and carbon emissions. Firstly, we adopted game theory to establish four decision-making models of the manufacturer and remanufacturer regarding DfR. Secondly, we designed a cost-sharing contract for DfR based on the decentralized decision-making model to coordinate a CLSC. The results of this study showed that under the patent-protected market environment, DfR increased the manufacturer’s profit but did not necessarily promote the remanufacturer’s profit growth. A cost-sharing contract can effectively achieve improvements in the presence of DfR, increase profits for both parties, and improve the economic and environmental benefits of the CLSC.</jats:p>"

The outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in 2018 has disrupted many activities along pig industry chain in China. The production capacity of breeding pigs has dropped rapidly, and the supply of pig is tight. The vertical integration of pig industry chain is the main driving force to ensure food supply. Based on the data of 12 listed pig companies from 2012 to 2019, we examine the ways and reasons for vertical integration of pig companies when external shocks increase by taking ASF as an example, breakpoint regression and Tobit model are used to analyze differences and determinants of the forward and backward integration of pig industry chain under ASF. The empirical results showed that the forward integration of the feed processing link and slaughter circulation link is higher than the backward integration. ASF had different effects on the vertical integration degree of each link. ASF promoted forward integration. The main factors have different influences on the vertical integration of pig industry in China. Forward integration increased mainly depending on previous asset specificity, legal system environment, market demand, and transaction frequency. The findings of the study imply that pig industry chain is taking the forward integration to cope with the ASF shock. The combination of feed link and breeding link reduces feed cost and ensures pig supply. Pig companies tend to reduce transaction costs by strengthening the control of downstream supply.</jats:p>"

This regulation can be implemented based on two rules, that is, the traditional cap allocation rule and the linear cap allocation rule. Considering the impact of online channel structure on the manufacturer's production and low‐carbon investment strategy, this paper aims to explore the economic and environmental performances of the two rules. The results show that the linear rule encourages the government to allocate less cap to each unit product as the emission abatement level increases, preventing the manufacturer from gaining a windfall profit from the free carbon credits. Besides, the government could use the traditional cap allocation rule to better control the total carbon emissions but use the linear cap allocation rule to obtain more social welfare as well as economic benefit. No matter which cap allocation rule is implemented, the manufacturer always performs better in reseller mode, and the e‐tailer might perform better in reseller (marketplace) mode given a high (low) low‐carbon investment efficiency. This study enriches the literature on the interplay between the cap allocation rule and selling mode and provides insights into decision‐making for governments and firms.</jats:p>",

It mainly consists of three services, namely Crawler Service (CS), Algorithm Service (AS), Data Service (DS). The architecture of multiple loose coupling services makes the system flexible in more data, and more advanced prediction algorithms for future energy forecasting works. In order to make higher prediction accuracy based on GM(1,1), this paper illustrates some basic enhanced methods and their combinations with adaptable variable weights. An implementation for testing the system was applied, where the model was set up for coal, oil and natural gas separately, and the enhanced GM was better with relative error about 9.18% than original GM on validation data between 2010 and 2020. All results are available for reference on adjusting of energy structure and developing alternative energy resources.</jats:p>"

To gain a deeper understanding of the impacts on the quality and safety of agricultural products, we built a three-level agricultural supply chain model comprising one retailer, one manufacturer, and one supplier. We aimed to explore the impact of blockchain traceability and retailers’ altruistic preference on pricing decisions and channel member profit, and to then examine the motivation of enterprises to participate in blockchain technology. Our study showed that: (1) blockchain technology has the potential to improve the prices and profits of supply chain members without considering the cost of blockchain; and (2) blockchain technology has the potential to improve the retailer’s price when the unit variable cost of blockchain is higher than a certain threshold. It can also reduce the manufacturer’s price and the supplier’s output. However, the excessive cost of blockchain can also aggravate the double marginalization effect of the supply chain. When both the unit variable cost and the fixed input cost of the blockchain are low, each enterprise has the incentive to participate in the blockchain. (3) In the scenario of the altruistically-preferred retailer, when the blockchain variable cost is lower than a certain threshold, the retailer’s altruistic preferences can improve the manufacturer’s and supplier’s profit, but it will reduce the retailer’s profit.</jats:p>"

Here, we pair synoptic records of particulate organic matter (POM) composition from 1990–1996 and 2007–2016 with more robust long-term monitoring program records of total suspended sediment (TSS) concentrations generally starting in the mid-1970s to better understand how POM and TSS sources and transport have shifted. Specifically, POM C:N ratios and stable isotope values were used as indicators of POM source and to separate the bulk POC pool into detrital and phytoplankton components. We found that TSS and POC sources have shifted significantly across the estuary in time and space from declines in terrestrial inputs. Landward freshwater and brackish water sites, in the Delta and near Suisun Bay, witnessed long-term declines in TSS (32 to 52%), while seaward sites, near San Pablo Bay, recorded recent increases in TSS (16 to 121%) that began to trend downwards at the end of the record considered. Bulk POM C:N ratios shifted coeval with the TSS concentration changes at nearly all sites, with mean declines of 12 to 27% between 1990–1996 and 2007–2016. The widespread declines in bulk POM C:N ratios and inferred changes in POC concentrations from TSS trends, along with the substantial declines in upstream TSS supply through time (56%), suggest measurable reductions in terrestrial inputs to the system. Changes in terrestrial TSS and POM inputs have implications for biotic (e.g., food web dynamics) and abiotic organic matter cycling (e.g., burial, export) along the estuarine continuum. This work demonstrates how human-generated environmental changes can propagate spatially and temporally through a large river-estuary system. More broadly, we show how underutilized monitoring program datasets can be paired with existing (and often imperfect) synoptic records to generate new system insight in lieu of new data collection.</jats:p>",

So the phase impedance matrix (PIM) is unbalanced and the closed‐form formula for conductor impedance is hard to get. To address these issues, firstly, the PIM is derived, and the cause of unbalance is revealed. From the perspective of structure optimization, a new flat layout (layout‐3) and an equilateral triangle layout (layout‐4) is proposed. Then, to calculate the wideband frequency self‐ and mutual impedances of the special phase conductors, a frequency‐ and current‐dependent closed‐form formula based on 4‐parameters equivalent tubular conductor (ETC) model is proposed. Furthermore, an equivalent TN circuit model at 50 Hz is established to calculate the receiving‐end voltage and its negative sequence voltage unbalance factor (NSVUF). Finally, using these two indexes, the performances of the layout‐1 to 4 are evaluated and compared. The results show that the conductor spacing and power supply frequency affect the two indexes much while the dimension of the power supply rail (PSR) not; layout‐4 can completely balance the receiving‐end voltage and improve its magnitude which can enhance the power supply capability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For cross-border e-commerce companies with high shipping costs, the existing retailer and the new entrant retailer on the platform are usually concerned with information sharing and free shipping due to the uncertainty of market demand. For this, by establishing a Stackelberg game model between two competing retailers, we analyze the strategy of retailers and explore the business strategies of the cross-border e-commerce platform. The study shows that regarding information-sharing strategies, retailer A’s willingness to share information is positively related to initial market potential and negatively related to market competition intensity. Moreover, retailer B is willing to spend higher information costs to purchase information when the necessity of the product is more elevated. As for a free shipping strategy, if the existing retailer offers free shipping, the new entrant retailer should also offer free shipping service to consumers when the initial market potential is larger. Conversely, when the initial market potential is smaller, the retailer’s willingness to offer free shipping decreases when the intensity of competition in the market increases. When the market tends to be perfectly competitive, the new entrant retailer will not choose a free shipping strategy, and the platform is most profitable when information sharing and free shipping occur simultaneously. However, when the carrier charges a higher shipping fee to customers, the existing retailer is more profitable when the new entrant does not offer free shipping. Therefore, in order to achieve a win-win situation for all parties, the platform needs to develop appropriate operational strategies to influence the decisions of retailers and carriers. Some numerical experiments are made to test the validity of the model and the effect of the parameters involved in the model.</jats:p>"

Here, we characterized Arabidopsis NLP2 as a top-tier transcriptional regulator of the early nitrate response gene regulatory network. NLP2 interacts with NLP7 in vivo and shares key molecular features such as nitrate-dependent nuclear localization, DNA-binding motif, and some target genes with NLP7. Genetic, genomic, and metabolic approaches revealed a specific role for NLP2 in the nitrate-dependent regulation of carbon and energy-related processes that likely influence plant growth under distinct nitrogen environments. Our findings highlight the complementarity and specificity of NLP2 and NLP7 in orchestrating a multitiered nitrate regulatory network that links nitrate assimilation with carbon and energy metabolism for efficient nitrogen use and biomass production.</jats:p>",

Efforts have long been devoted to balance grain production across China as a whole, and thereby the uncertainties and underlying crisis in the regional grain-producing systems are hidden. In this study, we characterize the dynamic evolution of 357 cities and explore the dominant supply and demand effects to signal early warnings of grain insecurity. Our results show that 220 cities are in unsustainable grain supply–demand conditions in comparison with 10 years ago. Additionally, the south and southwest of China have experienced enlarged disparities and more severe grain insecurity. The dual effects from both increased population and decreased grain output are substantially responsible for the unsustainable grain-producing system on the city scale. Moreover, cities identified as having grain insecurity occupy high-quality cultivated land, including 55.4% of top-grade land, 49.8% of high-grade land, and only 28.9% of low-grade land. We consequently inform the incongruity between grain productivity and regional grain conditions. It is suggested that current intensive management of cultivation and the strategy of differentiated responsibilities in grain production should be based on environmental sustainability and a degree of self-sufficiency across the region.</jats:p>"

Previous studies suggest the COVID-19 pandemic yielded uneven impacts across agri-food supply chain segments and regions. For a rigorously comparable assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on agri-food businesses, a survey was administered from February to April 2021 to five segments of the agri-food supply chain in three study regions (California, Florida, and the two-state region of Minnesota-Wisconsin). Results (N = 870) measuring the self-reported changes in quarterly business revenue in 2020 compared to businesses’ typical experience pre-COVID-19 suggest significant differences across supply chain segments and regions. In the Minnesota-Wisconsin region, restaurants took the largest hit and the upstream supply chains were relatively unaffected. In California, however, the negative impacts were felt throughout the supply chain. Two factors likely contributed to regional differences: (1) regional disparities in pandemic evolution and governance and (2) structural differences in regional agri-food systems. Regionalized and localized planning and the development of best-practices will be necessary for the U.S. agri-food system to enhance preparedness for and resilience to future pandemics, natural disasters, and human-made crises.</jats:p>"

Secondly, the manufacturer advertising mode and the retailer advertising mode are set up, and the influence of information sharing is discussed in each advertising mode. Finally, the conclusion and the proposition are verified by example analysis. The results show that in terms of advertising, manufacturers prefer retailers to undertake, and retailers’ willingness is related to the mode of information sharing.

In this study, the influence of the flow regime on the ripening time of virgin pumice medium was investigated. For this purpose, pilot-scale experiments were performed to compare the start-up of flow-through and recirculating filter columns using inherent inoculation with the same groundwater source. The systems were operated at 2 m·h−1 with gradual flow increments up to 5 m·h−1 and avoiding Fe-loading. Effective Mn removal (&amp;gt;90%) in flow-through and recirculating columns was achieved after 8 and 23 days, respectively. Flow-through columns reached compliance with a local drinking water criterion (Mn &amp;lt; 0.1 mg·L−1) at 15 cm filter depth in 11 days. Recirculating filter columns required 32 days to reach compliance at 30 cm depth. The start-up in recirculation regime resulted in a water consumption reduction of about 50% compared with flow-through regime. The intermittent provision of the Mn-loading in recirculating regime impacted the Mn-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) concentration in the pumice stone medium. Both flow regimes required a similar total Mn-loading (0.16 and 0.11 kg·Mn·m−2, respectively), suggesting that Mn-loading was the limiting factor for the ripening of pumice.</jats:p>",

As Holstein is the most predominant dairy cattle breed, these models were developed based on the phenotypic, physiological, and genetic characteristics of this breed. However, these models may not be appropriate to predict the nutrient requirements of other breeds, such as Ayrshire, that are phenotypically and genetically different from Holstein. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of increasing the metabolizable protein (MP) supply using CNCPS on milk performance, ruminal fermentation, apparent total-tract digestibility, energy and N utilization, and enteric methane production in Ayrshire vs. Holstein lactating dairy cows. Eighteen (nine Ayrshire; nine Holstein) lactating cows were used in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square design (35-d periods) and fed diets formulated to meet 85%, 100%, or 115% of MP daily requirement. Except for milk production, no breed × MP supply interaction was observed for the response variables. Dry matter intake (DMI) and the yields of energy-corrected milk (ECM), fat, and protein were less (p &lt; 0.01) in Ayrshire vs. Holstein cows. However, feed efficiency and N use efficiency for milk production did not differ between the two breeds, averaging 1.75 kg ECM/kg DMI and 33.7 g milk N/100 g N intake, respectively. Methane yield and intensity and urinary N also did not differ between the two breeds, averaging 18.8 g CH4 /kg DMI, 10.8 g CH4 /kg ECM, and 27.6 g N/100 g N intake, respectively. Yields of ECM and milk protein increased (p ≤ 0.01) with increasing MP supply from 85% to 100% but no or small increases occurred when MP supply increased from 100 to 115%. Feed efficiency increased linearly with an increasing MP supply. Nitrogen use efficiency (g N milk/100g N intake) decreased linearly (by up to 5.4 percentage units, (p &lt; 0.01) whereas urinary N excretion (g/d or g/100 g N intake) increased linearly (p &lt; 0.01) with an increasing MP supply. Methane yield and emission intensity were not affected by MP supply. This study shows that feed efficiency, N use efficiency, CH4 (yield and intensity), and urinary N losses did not differ between Ayrshire and Holstein cows. Energy-corrected milk yield and feed efficiency increased, but N use efficiency decreased and urinary N losses increased with increasing dietary MP supply regardless of breed. Ayrshire and Holstein breeds responded similarly to increasing MP levels in the diet.</jats:p>"

This affects the quality of the power supplied to consumers by distribution systems. Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices at the transmission level and custom power devices at the distribution level are used for an effective power transfer. In addition to these devices, filters play a prominent role in distribution systems. This paper aims to analyze the supply voltage in the time–frequency domain to perceive the variations in signal strength, explaining the role and significance of filters in mitigating or reducing harmonics. This paper presents the significance of harmonic filters in terms of signal-processing terminology. This depicts the prominent role of filters in improving the power quality by harmonic reduction or elimination, depending upon the requirement. The mathematical transform used in this approach is the short-time Fourier transform, which results in transforming the signal into a domain giving information about time and frequency. A MATLAB Simulink environment and ‘spectrogram’ were used to simulate harmonic signals, and we analyzed them using a short-time Fourier transform. Different windows were used with varying window size lengths.</jats:p>"

Currently, biofouling is imperfectly handled by RO feed water pre-chlorination, which is associated with the production of carcinogenic disinfection by-products. To propose a safer alternative to control biofouling in RO drinking water applications, this study investigates the efficacy of five biocides to prevent and remove Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms from RO membranes: 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT); 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA); sodium bisulfite (SBS); sodium benzoate (SB); and ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE). Experiments were conducted on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Biofilm Reactor (CBR) with biocidal dosing estimated on 96-well microtiter plates. Confocal Scanning Laser Microscopy (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the biocides' anti-biofilm efficacies under dynamic conditions relative to minimum biofilm inhibitory and eradication concentrations. The results in this study indicated that LAE presented the best anti-biofilm efficacies in treating P. aeruginosa biofilms when compared to all studied biocides; it not only prevented biofilm formation (&amp;gt;98%) but also it effectively removed pre-established biofilms (&amp;gt;99%) from RO membrane coupons. Therefore, due to safety and efficacy, LAE is an excellent candidate for controlling biofouling in drinking water RO membrane systems.</jats:p>"

Concerns regarding public health were present at the start of the new decade, and as the pandemic reached its peak in March 2020, manufacturers all over the world were forced to contend with high demand, reduced workforce requirements, subsequent lockdowns, and major disruptions to their supply chains to prevent the global spread of the pandemic. No research has been done on the interaction of these variables because the idea of VSCM is still relatively new, particularly in Malaysia’s manufacturing industry. The purpose of this study is to present management researchers with a novel idea for coping with a pandemic situation in today’s business environment. Furthermore, the purpose of this research is to determine VSCM practices that contribute to company sustainability so that such future incidents can be controlled and revamped. The report also advocated a VSCM framework to improve supply chain resilience and sustainability. This study’s objective is to analyze the relationship between viable supply chain management (VSCM) practices and company sustainability for manufacturing companies in Malaysia during the COVID-19 pandemic. 197 respondents from Malaysian manufacturing companies were surveyed using a quantitative approach. Using PLS-SEM analysis, all surveys are examined. As a result, the direct relationship between VSCM and company sustainability has demonstrated a significant positive effect. The implication of this study is to strengthen the viability and reliability of viable supply chain management and contribute further to the COVID-19 outbreak’s impact on company sustainability. Moreover, a successful supply chain model would guarantee that manufacturers are compelled to respond swiftly to safeguard and support their employees and maintain operations that are critical lifelines for consumers and communities.</jats:p>"

The ‘single index quantification-multi-index comprehensive-multi-criteria integration’ (SMI-P) evaluation method was used to calculate the WESI of the study area from 2011 to 2020. The spatial autocorrelation model and Markov chain were used to study the spatial distribution characteristics of water ecological security level and the probability of evolution over time. The results show that: (1) The overall WESI of the Huaihe River Basin has increased year by year, but the water ecological security level has been in the early warning (III) stage. Response level and environmental level are the main constraints. (2) During the study period, the spatial distribution of WESI in the Huaihe River Basin was high in the north and south ends and low in the middle. The degree of spatial agglomeration gradually changed from positive correlation to negative correlation. (3) The transfer of water ecological security level has ‘path dependence’ and, ‘self-locking’.</jats:p>",

Distributed energy management is one of the solutions that can enhance the microgrid reliability by efficiently scheduling the distributed appliances (such as diesel generator, BESS) to accommodate various scenarios. A distributed energy management model is proposed, which can help in reliable power supply by prolonging the lifetime of BESS and reducing the load loss. Considering the different energy consumption needs and dispatching capabilities of three regions of the UE microgrid, the proposed energy management model distributed dispatches the three regions in UE microgrid. In addition, considering the relationship between the depth of discharge and lifetime, the proposed energy management model also contains the BESS lifetime extension model constructed with dynamic charge‐discharge rate and dynamic bidirectional AC/DC converter efficiency. Based on the deterministic optimisation method, the optimal solution of the proposed energy management model is obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed energy management model is validated under six scenarios (that is grid connected mode, off grid mode, partial interconnection mode, interconnection mode, and independent modes with and without power exchange). The simulation results demonstrate that compared with the conventional model, the proposed model can reduce the operation cost by 6.46% and the load loss rate by 0.747%, which helps to improve the reliability of UE microgrid.</jats:p>",

Currently, most indicators in the related research field of ecological security tend to be socio-economic and neglect depicting the state of the ecosystems. This study, therefore, assessed the ecological security by constructing the evaluation index system embedded in the ecosystem service supply and demand based on the pressure–state–response model and identified the key obstacles to ecological security in the Pearl River Delta from 1990 to 2015. Our results showed that soil retention, carbon sequestration, and water yield increased with fluctuation except for grain production and habitat quality. The grain demand, carbon emission, and water demand increased sharply by 10.1%, 769.4%, and 17.5%, respectively. The ecosystem service supply areas were mainly located in the low hills, while the demand regions were mainly in the low plain areas. The ecological security index’s decline in vitality was caused by the decrease in the pressure index, indicating that the ecological security showed an inevitable deterioration and increased pressure on the ecosystem. During the study period, the source of the five key obstacle factors changed from the state layer and response layer to the pressure layer. The accumulative degree of the five top obstacle factors was above 45%. Therefore, governments should grasp the key indicators to improve ecological security as this study provides the theoretical basis and scientific information for sustainable development.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to identify potential supply chain risk factors that could emerge during the operation of the cold chain logistics system for small and medium-sized export businesses. Additionally, we attempted to comprehend how risk management affected the effectiveness of logistics and shipping.\r\nStructured questionnaires were distributed from October 11, 2022, to October 28, 2022, focused on lists of randomly chosen member organizations, including the Korea International Trade Association, the Korea Fisheries Trade Association, the Korea Pharmaceutical Bio Association, the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, and the Korea Small and Medium Business Association. As for the survey method, about 225 copies were collected by distributing Google questionnaires online, and a total of 202 copies were used for empirical analysis, excluding 23 insincere copies. For empirical analysis, the Smart PLS statistical package was used to evaluate external measurement models, internal structural model evaluation, and structural equation modeling, focusing on conceptual research models.\r\nThe results of this study are as follows. Among risk factors, low temperature maintenance risk had a negative (-) effect on cold chain risk management, and transportation environment risk and information technology risk had a significant positive (+) effect on cold chain risk management. And risk management was found to have an effect on responsiveness and flexibility in shipping and logistics. This study supplements the contents of previous studies on the risks that small and medium-sized export companies with limited human and financial resources may encounter in the process of operating a cold chain logistics system and examines the causal relationship that related risk management has on shipping logistics efficiency.</jats:p>",

A belt feeder that makes it possible to ensure the reproducibility of experiments with the initial clogging of the grain mixture in the range Zi = 1 - 3% and the productivity of the trier WT = 1.2 - 4.35 t / h is proposed for impurity components with high particle cohesion (oats, wild oats). The distribution of the impurity component along the length of the tape is carried out by means of a box without a bottom. The parameters of the box section were adopted based on the analysis of the contradiction, which consists in the fact that an increase in the horizontal section of the box (Sk) leads to an increase in the relative error in the distribution of the impurity component during its laying, and a decrease in Sk increases the dynamics of the formation of an impurity layer on the tape, reducing the efficiency of using its width. The box parameters turned out to be preferable for the experimental conditions at Zi = 1 - 3% and Wt = 1.2 - 4.35 t/h: width - 60 mm; height - 70 mm. A significant influence of the dynamics of the formation of an impurity layer on the tape was experimentally established: the angle of repose decreases by a factor of 2.5 (30° to 12°); the layer width increases by 1.6 times (from 170 mm to 270 mm). Reducing the dynamic impact on the impurity component by reducing the height of the box leads to a decrease in the efficiency of using the width of the tape - the cross section of the impurity layer becomes trapezoidal. Prevention of impurity losses in the feeder operation is ensured by flexible collars fixed on the edges of the belt. The qualitative distribution of impurities along the length of the box in experiments with partial loading of the trier is carried out by a special leveler - a vertical gate placed in a slider with the possibility of adjusting the position and fixing it with a clamp. To control the distribution of impurities in the box, it is advisable to make at least one of its side walls from a transparent material.</jats:p>",

The surface elemental properties and analytical performance of the Calix/MPA/Au sensor were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Under optimum conditions, the sensor exhibited detection limits of 1.5 and 0.34 mg/L at linear ranges of 2.85–6.65 and 0.13–1.68 mg/L for the Zn(II) and Ni(II) ions, respectively. The developed sensor exhibited a better electrochemical performance in the detection of Zn(II) and Ni(II) ions owing to the favourable host–guest interactions between the hydroxyl groups-functionalized lower rim of dicarboxyl-calix[4]arene and the metal ions. The RSD of the five independent Calix/MPA/Au electrode for Zn(II) and Ni(II) ions was calculated to be 16.3 and 16.1%, respectively. Despite the lower sensitivity of the modified electrode towards Ni(II) ions, this finding proves the high selectivity of the calixarene as a detection probe towards the fitted size of guest ion, hence promising to be assembled and explored as a solid-state based-supramolecular host molecule for tracing metal ions.</jats:p>",

Studying the responses of crop growth to different nitrogen (N) supply forms under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can guide nutrient management strategies for agricultural production under future climate change scenarios. Few studies addressed the effect of eCO2 on N uptake and morphological development for plants. This study was conducted in the CO2-controlled light incubators based on the sand-pot incubation using wheat and maize as experimental plants. Six treatments were set with two different environmental CO2 concentrations (aCO2, 390 µmol mol−1; eCO2, 690 µmol mol−1) and three different N supply forms, including ammonium−N, nitrate−N and ammonium-nitrate with 1:1 ratio. The following results were obtained: (i) Wheat and maize seedlings, as nitrate-preferring crops, grew better under mixed N forms than under single N forms. For the single N supply treatment, seedlings with nitrate−N supply showed better growth than with ammonium. (ii) For wheat plants, seedlings with a single ammonium−N supply showed slender height and fewer tillers; seedlings with a single nitrate−N supply were characterized by slightly shorter plant height, more tillers, and higher aboveground biomass. (iii) Compared to the aCO2 group, wheat seedlings with the ammonium−N supply showed an increased maximum root length and a decreased carbon concentration in root exudates; wheat seedlings with a single nitrate−N supply under eCO2 showed a significant increase in biomass and a decreased carbon concentration in root exudates; wheat seedlings with a mixed N supply under eCO2 explored a significant increase in carbon concentration in root exudate and a relatively lower N concentration. (iv) For maize plants, seedlings with either single ammonium−N or nitrate−N supply did not show significant differences in most growing indices. Maize seedlings with a mixed N supply exhibited an increase in aboveground biomass and N concentration in root exudates compared to those with a single N supply. (v) Compared with the aCO2 group, maize seedlings with mixed N supply under eCO2 conditions exhibited significant increases in plant height, aboveground biomass, and N concentration in root exudates. Single ammonium−N supply was toxic to wheat and maize plants under eCO2 conditions. We recommend raising the ratio of ammonium-to-nitrate under mixed N supply to improve the coordination of carbon and N metabolism for efficient crop growth under climatic change conditions of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration.</jats:p>"

We consider the integration of blockchain technology with a supply chain finance platform around the fraudulent default phenomenon in supply chain finance receivables financing and construct a three-party stochastic evolutionary game model among financial institutions, core enterprises, and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Firstly, we use Ito^’s stochastic differential equation theory to analyze the conditions for the stability of the behavior of game subjects. Secondly, we use numerical simulations to quantitatively analyze the impact of the regulatory strength of financial institutions, the information sharing of the blockchain platform, and the change of incentive parameters on the strategy choice of game subjects. Through the above analysis, we conclude that the information-sharing incentive coefficient promotes financial institutions to choose to connect to the blockchain platform, and the information-sharing risk coefficient and the regulatory intensity have the opposite effect on the blockchain platform construction. Meanwhile, the allocation of incentive shares has a significant influence on the core enterprises. Finally, we give priorities and directions for adjusting the relevant parameters to provide recommendations for financial institutions to regulate the financing process more effectively.</jats:p>"

Material technology embodied in production conditions and working conditions such as machinery, equipment and infrastructure is called hard technology, referring to the technology directly used in the development and production of means of production and means of subsistence, such as product design technology, equipment manufacturing technology, etc. Non-material technology, which embodies the experience, skills and management ability of process management, decision support and information technology, is called soft technology. Hard technologies make things easier and faster, while soft technologies promote flexibility and creativity. However, hard technologies take time to produce and have negative environmental impacts, while soft technologies are simple to produce but hard to use. Hence, finding the right balance between hard and soft technology investment is important for the sustainable increase of productivity. In recent years, China has continuously increased its investment in science and technology in aquaculture industry. However, the majority of the investment has gone to hard technology, which has hampered the long-term development of the industry. This paper aims to look at the status quo of the scientific and technological progress of the aquaculture industry in China and explore how the advancement of hard and soft technologies play a role in the economic growth of the aquaculture industry. Transcendental logarithmic production function is employed to calculate the contribution rate of technological progress on China’s aquaculture industry, and the contribution rates of hard technologies and soft technologies are examined separately. The results indicate that, from 2012 to 2020, the contribution rate of overall technical progress on aquaculture in China was 80.159%, of which 71.720% came from the progress of hard technologies, while only 8.439% came from the progress of soft technologies. Based on this conclusion, the paper calls for a balance of hard and soft technologies in the aquaculture industry in China to ensure a healthy and sustainable aquaculture industry.

The paper has analyzed equilibrium strategies in decentralized and centralized scenarios, respectively, and further developed an advertising–eco-quality investment cost-sharing contract to coordinate the supply chain. Finally, comparative and numerical analyses have been conducted. The analyses results reveal that consumers’ perceptions of eco-quality and their goodwill preference towards an agri-product encourage the supplier and retailer to improve the eco-quality of the agri-product and the level of advertising. Indeed, the greater the impact of goodwill on demand, the higher level of the supplier’s eco-quality investment and the retailer’s advertising effort, and the higher the profits of the supply chain. The paper also finds that the proposed cost-sharing contract can achieve a Pareto improvement in the continuous agri-product supply chain system.

However, intermittent water supply became a problem for years now in Butuan especially in dry seasons. Hence, this study intended to assess the impacts of LULC change in the TRWFR by generating and predict temporal land covers and determine the impact of these land covers to the current and future water supply of the watershed. This study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to generate LULC maps of TRWFR from year 2013–2021 which will be used as inputs for the LULC prediction. The QGIS MOLUSCE Plugin was used to predict a land cover for the year 2024. The generated and predicted LULC maps for the year 2021 and 2024, respectively, were then used to simulate streamflow using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The analysis of the SWAT model of the watershed, with the generated temporal land covers from 2013–2024, showcased increase streamflow from 3225.53 liter per second (lps) in 2013, 3267.10 lps in 2021 and 3239.73 lps in 2024. With the results of the hydrologic modeling, there is an increase in the water flow from 2013 to 2021 which might be due to the increase in vegetation but there is a probable decrease in the year 2024. The results show that the change in vegetation has an effect in the water flow in a watershed and this could be assessed through hydrologic modeling.\n                    </jats:p>"

In this open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial, patients were assigned to either a 7-day fast followed by an 11-week PBD including TRE (A) or a 12-week anti-inflammatory diet following official German guidelines (German Nutrition Society, DGE) (B). Dietary habits were assessed by 3-day food records at weeks -1, 4 and 9 and food frequency questionnaires. 41 out of 53 participants were included in a post-hoc per protocol analysis. Both groups had similar energy, carbohydrate, sugar, fiber and protein intake at week 4. Group A consumed significantly less total saturated fat than group B (15.9 ± 7.7 vs. 23.2 ± 10.3 g/day; p = 0.02). Regarding micronutrients, group B consumed more vitamin A, B12, D, riboflavin and calcium (each p ≤ 0.02). Zinc and calcium were below recommended intakes in both groups. Cluster analysis did not show clear group allocation after three months. Hence, dietary counselling for a PBD combined with TRE compared to a standard anti-inflammatory diet does not seem to lead to two different dietary clusters, i.e., actual different dietary behaviors as expected. Larger confirmatory studies are warranted to further define dietary recommendations for RA.</jats:p>"

Characterizing the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in BAC FBW is of great significance for the recycling and treatment of backwash water. DOM pollution was monitored over a year using three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix fluorescence spectra. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and fluorescence results showed that the DOC concentration reached the lowest value of 1.95 mg/L in the summer. The relative abundances of fluorescence components had a direct relationship with temperature variations. The soluble microbial products were enhanced greatly during cold seasons, while fulvic-acid-like and humic-acid-like compounds remained constant. Disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation potential and cytotoxicity were evaluated. The total haloacetonitriles (HANs), trihalomethanes (THMs), halonitromethanes (HNMs), and haloacetaldehyde (HALs) formation potentials ranged from 35.5 to 47.3 μg/L, 95.1 to 126 μg/L, 4.95 to 8.06 μg/L, and 43.4 to 53.0 μg/L in BAC FBW, respectively. Among all DBPs included in the calculation, the order of contribution to cytotoxicity was HANs &amp;gt; HALs &amp;gt; THMs &amp;gt; HNMs, respectively. Especially, HANs were much higher than the other DBPs, which should be controlled to avoid the biological risk of effluent quality.</jats:p>",

The pollutant removal, membrane fouling, long-term operational characteristics, and technical economy were systematically investigated using raw water from Tai Lake, which has a high algae content. The results elucidate that the dual membrane process has superb decontamination. This method has much better removal of turbidity, CODMn, UV254, and algae than O3-BAC. Its removal of ammonia nitrogen and fluorescent substances is slightly lower than that of O3-BAC, but the effluent still satisfies the drinking water standard. The dual membrane process is also much more capable of dealing with high algae-laden raw water. Compared to O3-BAC, the cost of the dual membrane process is 46.4% higher per ton without consuming chemicals, so it is more environmentally friendly. In summary, the dual membrane process offers a promising and effective technology to treat high algae-laden water with the advantages of high stability, reliable effluent, and zero emissions.</jats:p>"

We use the Stackelberg model to study the impact of the degree with the free-rider problem of consumers on the optimal pricing strategy and the optimal service level of the dual-channel supply chain under various decision-making modes and carry out a numerical simulation. The main conclusions are as follows: In the retailer’s dual-channel supply chain, the deepening of consumer free-riding behavior will reduce the enthusiasm of retailers, but the weak position of the channel will lead to improved service levels and reduced prices, as well as to increase the wholesale price to cover costs. In the manufacturer’s dual-channel supply chain, the deepening of consumer free-riding behavior will lead to a decline in the retailers’ service level and enthusiasm, as well as to a decrease in the wholesale prices and retailers’ pricing. In the two types of dual-channel supply chains, the demand of manufacturers’ network channels increases, the price increases first and then decreases, and the profits of all supply chain members decrease with the increase in the free-rider coefficient of consumers. Finally, we use numerical simulation to verify the validity of the above conclusions, which provides a scientific basis to make optimal pricing decisions in the manufacturer-led dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this paper studies a green closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) considering manufacturer sales efforts and fairness concerns. Then, the centralized model and decentralized model are built and analyzed. Afterward, a profit-sharing contract between members is designed to coordinate the supply chain. We made the following observations: (1) The manufacturers’ fairness concerns would reduce product green degree, sales effort and recycling rate of used products, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of the green closed-loop supply chain. (2) When the manufacturers’ fairness concerns are gradually strengthened, the optimal decisions would deviate even more from the optimal equilibrium results. (3) When the coefficient of fairness concerns and the ratio of profit-sharing satisfy a certain range, Pareto improvement can be effectively realized.</jats:p>"

In general, the species diversity and abundance of this system can be dynamically regulated by quorum sensing (QS). However, very little is known about extracellular secretions of algal–bacterial symbiotic system under the QS process. In this study, the effects of N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) on the algal–bacterial symbiotic system were investigated. When the supplemental concentration was between 250 and 500 μg/L, the biological dry weight, Chl-a, and phycocyanin of algae cells and the fluorescence intensity of extracellular humic acid and fulvic acid increased greatly. Whereas, when the supplemental concentration was greater than 750 μg/L, the concentration of Chl-a and phycocyanin showed opposite patterns. This result indicates that AHLs can mediate communication between algae cells and bacteria, and bacteria can regulate the growth of algae by secreting signal molecules. The results of this study also provide useful information for blue-green algae outbreaks prediction by changing trend of AHLs in water.</jats:p>",

First, in the green low-carbon supply chain which consists of a direct selling channel and reselling channel, the selection strategy of the manufacturer’s logistics service mode is analyzed. Second, in the green low-carbon supply chain which consists of a direct selling channel and an agency channel, the selection strategy of the manufacturer’s logistics service mode is analyzed. Last, the manufacturer’s sales mode is analyzed. We use the backward induction method to solve the theoretical model. This study contributes to the literature by considering the optimal decision of a green low-carbon supply chain. This study brings together the literature from streams on the selling channel selection strategy in green supply chains and the logistics service strategy in green supply chains. The impacts of the logistics service cost, the selling cost, and the green input cost coefficient on the optimal decision and the firms’ profit are discussed. The result shows that in the direct selling channel and reselling channel, when the basic market demand and the logistics service level of the third-party logistics service provider are low, manufacturers will choose the e-commerce platform logistics service; in the opposite case, manufacturers will choose the third-party logistics service. In the direct selling channel and agency channels, when the logistics service level of the third-party logistics service provider is greater than or equal to a certain critical value and less than or equal to the logistics service level of the e-commerce platform, manufacturers will choose the e-commerce platform logistics service; in the opposite case, manufacturers will choose the third-party logistics service. No matter whether the manufacturer chooses the logistics service provided by the third-party logistics service provider or the logistics service provided by the e-commerce platform, the manufacturer should choose the direct selling channel and the agency channel.</jats:p>"

The traditional calculation methods are generally used under several fixed operating situations. The scenarios are too few to cover the various situations encountered in actual operations and take insufficient account of boundary conditions, such as reservoir inflow, water requirements, etc. The water-supply schemes facilitated by these methods are finite and not adaptable to the ever-changing, producing environment. Therefore, based on a traditional water supply-demand balance analysis, this study established a dynamic calculation model that takes into account different variables, such as reservoir inflow, ecological flow, and water demand. This study also constructed a dynamic simulation system based on the comprehensive, integrated platform and dynamic calculation model, which shortens the calculation period from a month to a day. The results show that the water-supply assurance rates calculated under different conditions reach higher than 93.9% for domestic and production, and higher than 50.9% for agriculture, which all exceed the design assurance rates. Additionally, the dynamic calculation model can significantly improve the calculation efficiency, playing an important role in the formulation of the project-operation plan and project-benefit evaluation.</jats:p>"

A patent portfolio consisting of 82 documents was extracted from patent databases using PatSnap software. The analysis of latent topics using LDA indicates that inventions related to the application of BCs in FSCs are patented in four key areas: (A) BC-supported tracing and tracking in FSCs; (B) devices and methods supporting application of BCs in FSCs; (C) combining BCs and other ICT technologies in FSC; and (D) BC-supported trading in FSCs. Patenting of BC technology applications in FSCs started during the second decade of the 21st century. Consequently, patent forward citation has been relatively low, while the family size confirms that application of BCs in FSCs is not yet widely accepted. A significant increase in the number of patent applications was registered after 2019, indicating that the number of potential users in FSCs is expected to grow over time. The largest numbers of patents originate from China, India, and the US.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the frequency converters (FC) with active rectifiers (AR) have become widespread due to their advantages. The advantages are the possibility of energy recovery in braking modes of electric drive and support of the set value of power factor at the input of AR. At the same time these converters have a significant disadvantage, that is the deterioration of voltage quality in the in-plant 6–35 kV power distribution network due to the imposition of high-frequency harmonics of the input voltage and current of AR on the resonant area of the supply network frequency response. This disadvantage can be eliminated by using special passive filters in the in-plant power networks. They ensure the shift of the main resonance of currents to a zone free from high-frequency harmonics of the FC with AR. It makes possible to reduce the harmonic distortion coefficient in the voltage sections of the main stepdown substation (MSS) of the enterprise. Processing of experimental data is carried out in the Matlab mathematical package with the Simulink application. Using income data of functioning metallurgical complex CherMK of PJSC “Severstal”, the authors carried out the analysis of voltage quality of 10 kV network using specialized passive filters and without them. The article presents the results of the study of the effectiveness of the use of specialized passive filters in the in-plant power supply system of the rolling complex operating at the CherMK of PJSC “Severstal”. The reasons of the deterioration of the voltage quality in the 10 kV distribution network are studied, and as a result, operational breakdown of the modes of sensitive electrical receivers. A complex mathematical model of the 10 kV network has been developed to study the way to improve the harmonic composition of voltage due to installation of specialized passive filters. This filter allows you to adjust the frequency characteristics of the 10 kV network, shift it to an area free of high-frequency harmonics generated by modern frequency converters with active rectifiers. Thus, the resonance of currents and voltages in 10 kV sections is eliminated. As a result, a significant improvement in the shape of the line voltage and a decrease in the harmonic distortion coefficient of voltage THDU = 75,2–91,2 % to values THDU = 0,49–1,4 % is observed. The main result of the research is the recommendation to use a specialized passive filter to eliminate the negative impact of the harmonic component of the current resonance. The research results can be used to design power supply systems of metallurgical enterprises that have powerful electric drives with active rectifiers.</jats:p>",

Hence, a machine-learning-assisted mixed-integer multi-objective optimization technique was presented for efficiently programming remediation strategies. A swarm intelligence multi-kernel extreme learning machine (SI-MKELM) was proposed to build a reliable intelligent surrogate model of the multiphase flow numerical simulation model for reducing the computational cost of repetitive CPU-demanding remediation efficiency evaluations, and a hyper-heuristic homotopy algorithm was developed for progressively searching the global optimum of the remediation strategy. The results showed that: (1) The multi-kernel extreme learning machine improved by swarm intelligence algorithm significantly improved the approximation accuracy to the numerical model, and the mean residual and mean relative error were only 0.7596% and 1.0185%, respectively. (2) It only took 0.1 s to run the SI-MKELM. Replacing the numerical model with SI-MKELM considerably reduced the computational burden of the simulation–optimization process and maintained high computational accuracy for optimizing the DNAPL-contaminated aquifer remediation strategy. (3) The hyper-heuristic homotopy algorithm was capable of progressively searching the global optimum, and avoiding premature convergence in the optimization process. It effectively improved the searching ability of the traditional heuristic algorithms.</jats:p>",

This study filled this knowledge gap, demonstrating that boron modifies auxin distribution and transport in Al‐exposed Arabidopsis roots. In B‐deprived roots, treatment with Al induced an increase in auxin content in the root apical meristem zone (MZ) and transition zone (TZ), whereas in the elongation zone (EZ) the auxin content was decreased beyond the level required for adequate growth. These distribution patterns are explained by the fact that basipetal auxin transport from the TZ to the EZ was disrupted by Al‐inhibited PIN‐FORMED 2 (PIN2) endocytosis. Experiments involving the modulation of protein biosynthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) and transcriptional regulation by cordycepin (COR) demonstrated that the Al‐induced increase of PIN2 membrane proteins was dependent upon the inhibition of PIN2 endocytosis, rather than on the transcriptional regulation of the <jats:italic>PIN2</jats:italic> gene. Experiments reporting on the profiling of Al<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup> and PIN2 proteins revealed that the inhibition of endocytosis of PIN2 proteins was the result of Al‐induced limitation of the fluidity of the plasma membrane. The supply of B mediated the turnover of PIN2 endosomes conjugated with indole‐3‐acetic acid (IAA), and thus restored the Al‐induced inhibition of IAA transport through the TZ to the EZ. Overall, the reported results demonstrate that boron supply mediates PIN2 endosome‐based auxin transport to alleviate Al toxicity in plant roots.</jats:p>",

Compared with the traditional SCF mode, blockchain-driven SCF can shorten the transaction process and provide real trade data that cannot be tampered with, thereby improving the efficiency of capital operation. This article explores the financing and coordination problems of a blockchain-driven supply chain. Based on the three most common supply chain contracts (revenue-sharing contract, profit-sharing contract, and two-part tariff contract), we construct a comparative model of bank credit financing (BCF) and blockchain-driven SCF, discuss the optimal decision-making strategy of the supply chain, and quantitatively analyze the performance of supply chain under each mode. The results show the following: (i) there is a threshold for the usage rate of the blockchain-driven SCF platform; (ii) only when the platform usage rate is lower than the threshold, the blockchain-driven SCF mode which benefits both manufacturer and retailer is a better choice; (iii) the above results always hold if supply chain contracts can coordinate the supply chain in terms of quantity decisions; (iv) the blockchain-driven SCF mode is more efficient for supply chains which are less capital-constrained. This article provides a decision basis for the selection of supply chain financing channels and provides an idea for future research on blockchain-driven SCF.</jats:p>",

These changes are critical to the hydrodynamic characteristics of water intakes in tidal rivers. This paper establishes a 3D model and validates it through laboratory models, then analyzes the influences of dynamic change of flow velocity and water depth, and the amplitude changes of velocity and water depth on the secondary flow in the water withdrawal process. With the increase of the main flow velocity and the decrease of the water depth, diversion width at the water intake decreases, the peak velocity increases, and the intensity of the secondary flow also increases. With the increase of the velocity of the main channel and the changing rate in water depth, the lag time of the velocity change at the water intake is also longer, and the peak velocity will be greater than the velocity of the constant flow. The influence of the water depth change is greater than that of the main channel velocity change. Combining these four factors, more sand may be washed into the inlet channel under conditions of high flow and low water depth.</jats:p>",

However, few studies have focused on the natural oxygen supply capacity of urban green spaces. As a companion to photosynthesis in leaves, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) contains abundant photosynthetic information. Currently, satellite-based SIF observations are considered to be a rapid and nondestructive ‘indicator’ of plant photosynthesis, which provides an alternative way to quantitatively assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of oxygen supply capacity in urban green spaces. This study examined the spatial patterns, long-term trends, and environmental control factors of SIF in the nine central cities in China from 2001 to 2020 based on the time-series of the global reconstructed GOSIF-v2 SIF dataset. The results were as follows: (1) There was a contrasting spatial difference between southern and northern cities in China, and multi-year mean SIF values of the southern cities were generally higher than those of the northern cities; (2) The interannual dynamics of SIF in each city generally showed an upward trend, with fluctuations, and the intraannual seasonal differences were more significant in northern cities than those in the southern cities; (3) The spatial trend analysis showed that Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chongqing have had the most significant improvements, followed by Xi’an, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou, while Tianjin and Shanghai have had the least improvements; and (4) The expansion of construction land has exerted significant impacts on the dynamics of the SIF trend in several cities, but it is not the only factor. All analyses indicated that the improvement of vegetation structure and function in the area can offset its negative effect.</jats:p>"

A Pain Point or constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal like poor funding, high teaching loads, unattractive research prizes and incentives, low salaries that drive away talented academics and others and finally poor resourcing. The main reasons giving rise to this research were the facts that some colleges and universities in Africa faced challenges in graduate employability and suitability for industry and funding and needed accreditation by government agencies, and some had low innovation and research output. The main objective of this research was to contribute to theory building in the Theory of Higher Education and PPT and identify critical success factors for efficiency in service delivery excellence to students, industry and society in line with market orientation philosophy.

Maintaining the security of the coal industrial chain and supply chain is a prerequisite for energy security to be effectively ensured, considering the main position of coal in China’s energy. Therefore, in the face of multiple uncertain risk factors under today’s momentous changes, this paper constructs an industrial coal chain and supply chain resilience evaluation indicator system from the perspective of resilience, based on four representational capabilities of resilience, namely preparedness, absorptive capacity, recovery capacity, and adaptability, in order to profoundly understand and enhance the resilience of the coal industrial chain and supply chain. An integrated method combining Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Prospect Theory and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (Interval Type-2F-PT-TOPSIS) is proposed for evaluating the resilience level of the coal industrial chain and supply chain. In the case of Shaanxi Province in China, it was found that the worst level of resilience of the coal industrial chain and supply chain in Shaanxi Province was in 2018, and the best was in 2021. Finally, based on the evaluation results, recommendations are provided to the key nodes of the industrial chain and supply chain in Shaanxi Province with a view to improving their resilience levels to cope with uncertain risks.</jats:p>"

It has been established that due to the increased mass of the DM structure, it becomes necessary to equip the running systems with propellers with an increased profile width. The use of a disk leveling device is proposed to eliminate the negative impact of the track from the running systems of the DM. It is noted that the Kuban-LK sprinkling machine, whose running systems are equipped with pneumatic tires of size 18.4R24, forms a track of up to 0.30 m or more. Taking into account the constant static pressure on the soil DM, the indicator of movers is justified - the bearing capacity of the soil, determined by the dependence of Professor A.I. Ryazantsev. According to exploratory studies, it was revealed that with an increase in the number of full revolutions of the machine on an irrigated surface, the values of the bearing capacity increase, on average, by 3.5 times, both with and without a leveling device installed, so it becomes necessary to install propellers with an increased specific pressure in comparison with serial samples. It was found in the course of laboratory, as well as laboratory and field tests, that when the DM \"Kuban-LK1\" moves, one wheel of its running system has a pressure equal to 16 kN, therefore it must be equipped with tires enlarged in profile. It has been experimentally found that the installation of propellers of the specified size reduces the power consumption of gearmotors by 25-26%, and also reduces the area of damage to agricultural products by an average of 33%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the article, using MatLab dynamic simulation modeling, a study was made of the excitation systems of powerful synchronous generators of stationary diesel generator sets, which are the main sources of emergency power supply for nuclear power plants. The optimal structural complexity mathematical model of a synchronous machine in relative units and orthogonal synchronous coordinate system is used. A comprehensive simulation of diesel generator sets was carried out with the reproduction of both the dynamics of the automatic control system for excitation of a synchronous generator and the diesel engine control system. The simulation takes into account the features of starting a diesel generator to accelerate a synchronous machine, its initial excitation from a battery. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of self-excitation modes through a transformer connected to the stator circuit of the generator and a thyristor rectifier with an excitation winding as a load, as well as parallel operation with the power system. As a result, the processes of starting a diesel generator set in idle mode, effective self-excitation, autonomous operation of the generator at idle, and applying a load to the generator up to the values of permissible overload were simulated. The work of all channels of the control system is shown, including the signals of the regulators of the automatic control system and mechanical variables that are inaccessible in practice. The adequacy of the developed model is proved by comparison with a real physical experiment when testing a diesel generator at a nuclear power plant. The possibility of using the model developed in MatLab as a virtual test site for testing a diesel generator set and a computer simulator for specialized engineering personnel of a nuclear power plant is demonstrated.</jats:p>",

However, existing studies have not analyzed the innovation behavior of recyclers in CDW recycling public-private partnership (PPP) projects from the perspective of innovation diffusion theory. To reveal the mechanism of recyclers’ innovation behavior in CDW recycling PPP projects in which recyclers and remanufacturers jointly participate in the operation stage, this study uses a Stackelberg game to analyze the optimal innovation strategy choice and total profit of the CDW recycling supply chain among the two innovation paths of green independent innovation and green imitation innovation under the combined effects of technology spillover, consumer green sensitivity, and government price subsidies to consumers. The main conclusions are as follows. (1) Remanufacturers and recyclers can improve their own innovation level and profit through technology spillover. (2) The total profit of the CDW recycling supply chain changes dynamically with the level of spillover. (3) The government price subsidy to consumers does not always improve the total profit of the CDW recycling supply chain. (4) The effect of consumers’ green sensitivity on the total profit of the CDW recycling supply chain shows heterogeneity with the innovation path of recyclers and the level of technological spillover. This study not only enriches the theoretical study of the green supply chain but also provides a basis for decision-making for recyclers and governments in practice.</jats:p>"

To examine the impact of digital industrialization development on the energy supply chain, in relation to the sustainable development of China’s energy security, we discuss the nonlinear impact and transmission mechanism of digital industrialization on the supply chain of the energy industry using a panel threshold regression model based on sample data on the development of the provincial natural gas industry in China from 2006 to 2020. We found that there are multiple threshold effects of digital industrialization level development on energy supply chain length, and the results are statistically significant, i.e., digital industrialization development positively contributes to natural gas supply chain length after digital industrialization is raised to or crosses the critical threshold. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity analysis results show that there are differences in the impact of digital industrialization on the energy supply chain from sub-sectors, regional development differences, and different development periods. Therefore, we provide some factual support and experience for achieving the construction goal of “Digital China” and accelerating the digital reform of the energy supply chain as well as transforming and upgrading the economic structure.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to reveal the interaction mechanism between the digital integration degree, green knowledge collaboration ability, and the DGI performance of IBSC enterprises in DGI activities under the influence of environmental characteristics of the integrated supply chain. In this study, firstly, a hierarchical regression method and a structural equation model are used to empirically study the static mechanism of DGI among enterprises in the IBSC. Secondly, this study adopts a complex system theory to construct a logistic dynamic analysis model to explore a dynamic evolution mechanism. The results of the study are as follows. (i) The digital integration degree and green knowledge synergy ability of the IBSC are conducive to improvements in digital green innovation performance among the enterprises involved in this chain. The digital integration degree of this chain is the dominant factor affecting the performance of digital green innovation among these enterprises. (ii) The digital network capability of this chain has a significant impact on its digital integration degree but has no significant effect on green knowledge synergy ability. The quality of digital relationships in the IBSC affects both the digital integration degree and green knowledge synergy ability. It has a higher impact on the digital integration degree than on the synergy ability of green knowledge. The resilience of the IBSC can effectively promote the improvement of digital integration and green knowledge synergy ability, but has no significant effect on digital green innovation performance. (iii) In the early stage of an IBSC, the effect of the digital integration degree on DGI performance is more obvious. Over the long term, under the effect of different digital relationship qualities of the IBSC, green knowledge collaboration ability plays a pivotal role. Improving this ability is conducive to the continuous improvement of DGI performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Antibiotic resistance threatens provision of healthcare and livestock production worldwide with predicted negative socioeconomic impact. Antibiotic stewardship can be considered of importance to people living in rural communities, many of which depend on agriculture as a source of food and income and rely on antibiotics to control infectious diseases in livestock. Consequently, there is a need for clarity of the structure of antibiotic value chains to understand the complexity of antibiotic production and distribution in community settings as this will facilitate the development of effective policies and interventions. We used a value chain approach to investigate how relationships, behaviours, and influences are established during antibiotic distribution. Interviews were conducted with key informants (n = 17), value chain stakeholders (n = 22), and livestock keeping households (n = 36) in Kolkata, and two rural sites in West Bengal, India. Value chain mapping and an assessment of power dynamics, using manifest content analysis, were conducted to investigate antibiotic distribution and identify entry points for antibiotic stewardship. The flow of antibiotics from manufacturer to stockists is described and mapped and two local level maps showing distribution to final consumers presented. The maps illustrate that antibiotic distribution occurred through numerous formal and informal routes, many of which circumvent antibiotic use legislation. This was partly due to limited institutional power of the public sector to govern value chain activities. A ‘veterinary service lacuna’ existed resulting in livestock keepers having higher reliance on private and informal providers, who often lacked legal mandates to prescribe and dispense antibiotics. The illegitimacy of many antibiotic prescribers blocked access to formal training who instead relied on mimicking the behaviour of more experienced prescribers–who also lacked access to stewardship guidelines. We argue that limited institutional power to enforce existing antibiotic legislation and guide antibiotic usage and major gaps in livestock healthcare services make attempts to curb informal prescribing unsustainable. Alternative options could include addressing public sector deficits, with respect to both healthcare services and antibiotic provision, and by providing resources such as locally relevant antibiotic guidelines to all antibiotic prescribers. In addition, legitimacy of informal prescribers could be revised, which may allow formation of associations or groups to incentivise good antibiotic practices.</jats:p>"

Traditional allocation schemes are built on an annual basis and fixed. However, because of the drastic spatio-temporal fluctuations in the availability and demand of water resources, fixed annual allocation schemes are impracticable. This work proposed a dynamic allocation mechanism that can divide annual allocation schemes into monthly scales and dynamically correct allocation schemes to make them adapt to the above fluctuations. First, a total quantity allocation model, which focuses on fairness and efficiency, was developed to allocate annual water resources. Secondly, a combination weighting model for a monthly water allocation was built using game theory to make the allocation schemes stricter and more executable. Thirdly, a dynamic allocation mechanism was constructed to dynamically correct the allocation schemes. The results indicate that (1) coupling a total quantity allocation scheme with monthly allocation schemes is more in line with management requirements and (2) compared with static allocation schemes, rolling correction schemes can reduce the deviation between planned and actual water consumption by 10–20%. A dynamic allocation mechanism can make water resource allocation schemes more resilient to spatiotemporal changes in supply and demand of water resources.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the changing rules of composite roughness and the influence on the discharge capacity of drainage pipes under different flows and slopes were studied by experimental measurement and numerical simulation. When the Froude number is less than 1, the composite roughness decreases gradually with the increase of flow. When the Froude number is more than 1, the composite roughness increases at first and then decreases with the increase of flow. It also showed that the different bed roughness has a great influence on composite roughness, which affects the hydraulic characteristics of flow. The composite roughness of the drainage pipe increases as the bed roughness increases. The water surface rises and the average velocity decreases under a certain slope and flow. The formulas for calculating the composite roughness are obtained by analogy analysis, which can provide theoretical support for the design of the drainage pipeline.</jats:p>",
