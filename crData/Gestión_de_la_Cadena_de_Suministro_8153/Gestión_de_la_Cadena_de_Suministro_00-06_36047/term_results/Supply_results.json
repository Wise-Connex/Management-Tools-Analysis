The six projects are in different stages of development and have different levels of North American and international participation. All projects share common challenges and potential barriers. This paper reviews these challenges and barriers and suggests strategies to overcome them. The realization that North American research libraries are no longer able to collect comprehensively provides an opportunity for the global interlibrary loan and document supply community to provide access to and delivery of materials needed by scholars and researchers, regardless of location of the material or the scholar.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>There is recognition that competition is shifting from a “firm versus firm perspective” to a “supply chain versus supply chain perspective.” In response to this shift, firms seeking competitive advantage are participating in cooperative supply chain arrangements, such as strategic alliances, which combine their individual strengths and unique resources. Buyer‐supplier sourcing relationships are a primary focus of alliance improvement efforts. While interest in such arrangements remains strong, it is well accepted that creating, developing, and maintaining a successful alliance is a very daunting task. This research addresses several critical issues regarding that challenge. First, what factors contribute most to long‐term alliance success? Second, what conditions define the presence of those success factors? Third, do buyers and suppliers in an alliance agree on those success factors and defining conditions? The research results demonstrate a remarkably consistent perspective among alliance partners regarding key success factors, despite the acknowledgment that the resultant success is based on a relatively even, but not equal, exchange of benefits and resources. Additionally, within an alliance's intended “win‐win” foundation, suppliers must recognize their innate dependence on customers. Finally, significant opportunities for improvement exist with respect to alliance goal clarification, communication, and performance evaluation.</jats:p>",

The research focuses on four dimensions of collaborative relations including joint buyer‐supplier cost reduction, supplier involvement in new product development, delivery and logistics management, and core business strategy. A case study is presented which outlines how an organization adopted a strategy that led to extensive outsourcing and the adoption of more collaborative relations with its key suppliers. The pursuit of this strategy has acted as a stimulus for change within the organization. The article identifies a number of issues that must be addressed, including the adoption of an integrated approach to the management of strategic change, the pivotal role of senior managers as facilitators of this change, and the involvement of those most affected by the movement toward more collaborative buyer‐supplier relationships.</jats:p>",

The basic tenants of four previous frameworks for strategic sourcing from the literature are briefly reviewed. Following a critique of these frameworks, a new strategic sourcing framework is proposed. Elements of the frame‐work are discussed in terms of primary factors (competitive advantage and demand flexibility) and secondary factors (process capability, process maturity, and strategic risk). A decision flowchart incorporating these factors is given to illustrate the functioning of the proposed framework. Implementation issues are discussed using a case study wherein two products from an electronics equipment manufacturer are subjected to sourcing decisions using the framework.</jats:p>",

To test the hypotheses, a survey was administered to a sample of purchasing vice presidents, directors, and managers. A holdout sample was used for exploratory data analysis to test for type (manufacturing compared to non‐manufacturing firms) and size (large compared to small firms). A regression analysis of the remaining sample of 85 surveys indicated that purchasing skills were related to strategic purchasing, a firm's financial performance, and supplier responsiveness. Both research and managerial implications are discussed.</jats:p>",

Through the changes of supply chain management philosophy together with additional participation of suppliers, the original practice of trimming profit margins at the supplier side to increase the value of a purchase has now been replaced by the collaborative effect to add value in its downstream supply chain activities. Based on such a value improvement initiative, a three‐layer value challenge practice has been developed. Through the use of such a technique, the company has been able to attain over 20 per cent unit cost reduction per pin count. This is equivalent to a US$30 million saving in over two years.</jats:p>",

In place of the simplistic, linear and unidirectional model sometimes presented for supply chains, the supply network concept describes lateral links, reverse loops, two‐way exchanges and so on, encompassing the upstream and downstream activity, with a focal firm as the point of reference. A review of classifications of supply networks reveals that none of the existing approaches appears adequate for managers facing the practical problems of creating and operating them on a day‐to‐day basis. This research identifies differing emphases that may be required for managing within supply networks, according to the nature of the products for which they are created. Taking an established categorisation of supply chains as its starting point, the research first develops the conceptual basis, using strategy literature, and then tests the resultant initial model in 16 case studies. Finally, a new categorisation for supply networks is presented, using the type of product as a differentiator.</jats:p>",

Managers must take actions to reduce uncertainty in the timing and quantity of returns, balance return rates with demand rates, and make material recovery more predictable. Managers must also plan for the collection of products from end-users. The use of information systems with new production-planning and control techniques makes management of these activities more predictable.</jats:p>",

For such optimization, it is necessary first to quantify the reliability of WDN using a surrogate measure. Hydraulic-connectivity is selected as a surrogate measure in this study, which indicates a probability that every demand node in a network is connected to at least one supply source with required flow at adequate pressure. An optimization model using hydraulic-connectivity and the genetic algorithm (GA) is formulated. For illustration, the optimization model is applied to the New York City water supply tunnel. This tunnel cannot satisfy the minimum pressure with existing diameters. The new optimal design with required flow at adequate pressure is found to be lower than the existing tunnel cost by US$25.252 million when the hydraulic-connectivity is 0.9778. It is also noted that this approach allows the exploration of the trade-off between cost and reliability directly. This permits designers to design WDN based on more quantitative information regarding cost and reliability.</jats:p>",

The second part discusses the context of these points from a quality, general and construction project management perspective.

The structure indicator describes how the spatial distribution of users and water sources influences energy consumption. It is defined as the minimal energy that is necessary to lift a cubic metre of water to users and to give it a pressure of 6 bar (88 psi), a typical water pressure at the tap. In turn, minimal energy can be calculated as the difference between the potential energy of the delivered water (for some unit of time) and the potential energy of the same quantity of water at the source. The quality indicator is defined as the ratio of the effective energy used (during the same unit of time) and minimal energy. It shows the efficiency of the entire water supply system, which is determined by factors such as the efficiency of pumps, locations of reservoirs, and water loss in the network. The results of calculations are used to establish a relationship between the value of the quality indicator and the energy‐reduction possibilities; this relationship permits a water supplier to evaluate how economically a water supply system uses its energy.</jats:p>",

In actual bearing design, it is often necessary to reduce the thickness of porous material to make the bearing smaller. However, a reduction in thickness results in a reduction in the strength of the porous material. In particular, when the diameter of porous material is large, it is difficult to supply the air through the full pad area of porous material because it deforms. Therefore, in this paper, two types of air supply method (the annular groove supply and the hole supply) in a circular aerostatic porous thrust bearing are proposed to avoid the deflection of the bearing surface. The static and dynamic characteristics of aerostatic porous bearing with these air supply methods are investigated theoretically and experimentally. In addition, the effects of a surface restricted layer on the characteristics are clarified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In implementing rural development projects, African states expect that the otherwise poor peasantry would respond positively by maximising use of the productivity-enhancing technologies available to them, in order to improve their income status. The basic requirement is that the producer must supply significantly higher levels of productive labour-time, mainly from subsistence production and other traditional activities. The Malawi experience suggests that this process revolves around the critical role of both the physical and psychological dimensions of labour-time application. Therefore, the transformation of peasant commodity-surplus producers is unlikely to be effectively achieved, unless attainable commodity income is sufficient to at least support both customary production and subjectively defined socio-economic goals.</jats:p>"

La domanda di psicoterapia è stata del 16.1% (range tra 0.6-33%) includendo le richieste dei pazienti e dei committenti. I fattori predittivi dell'inizio di una psicoterapia sono stati: la presenza dello psicologo nel primo incontro, la richiesta del paziente di psicoterapia, l'età &lt; di 48 anni, una scolarità elevata, essere studenti, vivere con la famiglia d'origine, il Centro a cui ci si rivolti, una diagnosi del raggruppamento diagnostico delle «nevrosi». Ma l'analisi multivariata non ha permesso d'individuare un modello predittivo sufficientemente sensibile. <jats:bold>Conclusioni</jats:bold> - L'imprevedibilità dell'impiego della psicoterapia sembra dovuta alia mancanza di una chiara scelta sull'uso della psicoterapia nei CSM, come testimonia, in particolare, l'estrema variabilità dell'offerta, e alia mancanza di definite indicazioni.</jats:p>",

Up to now, the induction of zinc deficiency has not been accomplishable in the field or greenhouse. Thus any critical evaluations of effects of zinc nutrition on tree growth and development have been lacking. A hydroponic culture system was developed where zinc deficiency was induced. Seedstocks collected from `Stuart', `Curtis', and `Wichita' trees were grown with and without zinc supply. Biomass, leaf area, node number, and visual symptoms were assessed. Foliar deficiency symptoms were rated 4 and structural evaluations were conducted using light and electron microscopy. Significant differences in visual symptoms were observed between treatments and among cultivars. Leaf area significantly decreased in `Stuart' and `Curtis' under zinc deficient conditions. Zinc had no significant effect on biomass and internodal length. Foliar nutrient contents were compared between cultivars. Our data suggest that genotypic differences in sensitivity to zinc deficiency exists and improving pecan production through genetic selection for zinc efficiency appears promising.</jats:p>",

However, recent attacks both at home and abroad have forced government planners to consider the possibility that critical elements of the U.S. infrastructure might in fact be vulnerable to terrorism. The potential for chemical or biological contamination of water supply systems exists along with the possibility that such systems might be sabotaged. This article reviews the threat of biological and chemical compounds in relation to the characteristics of water supply systems. Vulnerability of such systems to terrorist attacks is examined, as well as possible physical and chemical countermeasures that could be applied. A case study is presented of an accidental contamination event that illustrates the difficulty of tracking such events in a drinking water system. It can be concluded that municipal water supplies are vulnerable. However, appropriate physical planning of such systems, including contingency back‐up with separate water lines for emergencies, coupled with proactive monitoring, will significantly increase security in the face of possible terrorist attacks.</jats:p>",

Oak was the most \nresponsive species to all three treatments; elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and irrigation increased biomass by an average of 79% and \n41%, respectively, whereas the ozone treatment resulted in a 30% reduction in growth. Significant treatment \ninteractions in this species demonstrated that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> ameliorated and irrigation exacerbated the effects of ozone. For \nScots pine and ash, irrigation and elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> increased growth by approx. 60% and 20%, respectively, whereas \nozone had no detectable effect on ash and resulted in a 15% reduction in growth of Scots pine. Carbon partitioning \nto the shoot was enhanced by both the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O treatments in oak, while branching was also increased in this \nspecies in response to elevated O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, resulting in changes to the allometric relationships. CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enhanced leaf \nproduction in oak and Scots pine, and together with the promotion of shoot allocation, this indicates an increased \nsusceptibility to windthrow. Biomass accumulation expressed as relative growth rate, suggested three different \ntime‐dependent growth responses to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>; the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fertilization effect was maintained through the third \nyear of growth in oak, had disappeared in Scots pine and a negative effect was evident in ash. Foliar nitrogen and \nchlorophyll concentrations indicated a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced nitrogen deficiency in oak and ash, but not in Scots pine. \nChlorophyll degradation in response to ozone was observed in oak, an effect that was enhanced by irrigation and \nreduced by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, presumably through stomatal mediated changes in effective ozone dose. These results therefore \nsuggest that elevated atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations will enhance growth of some UK forest tree species, \nalthough this might only be apparent during the juvenile phase. However, nitrogen deficiencies might limit this \nenhancement on some sites while changes in allocation and leaf area might promote susceptibility to windthrow. \nElevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> also provides some protection against ozone pollution, especially in combination with limited soil \nmoisture availability. These interactions between CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, ozone and water supply should be taken into account when predicting the effects of environmental change on tree growth and forest productivity.</jats:p>",

Isotope analyses have been used to establish the supply area of the deep aquifer system. The age of the groundwater has been estimated for two samples by using <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C analysis. A simplified numerical model for a north–south cross‐section has provided global values for the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of the aquifer system. The groundwater from permeable horizons deeper than 120–140 m is highly mineralised and is, therefore, inappropriate for use as a water supply. Because groundwater resources are limited, the water supply for industry and domestic use in urban regions cannot increase too much. Thus, the deep aquifer system could also be used as a water supply for rural regions.</jats:p>",

Males tended to have much larger home ranges than females and core‐areas of most breeding females seemed mutually exclusive. Adult female red squirrels were found to increase their home range and core‐area size in forest patches where food was less abundant. Home‐range size was significantly related to home‐range quality and the extent of overlap by other females. In contrast with high‐quality continuous conifer forests: (1) a considerable proportion of adult males and females at Spadeadam shifted home range, (2) both sexes had much larger home ranges than reported from other habitats in Britain or Belgium. Many ranges were multinuclear, particularly from January onwards, when supplies of seeds become depleted through consumption and seed shed. Squirrels tracked the availability of conifer seeds (lodgepole pine cones throughout the study, Norway spruce cones in spring 1992 and Sitka spruce cones in autumn 1993) and intensively used several non‐adjacent activity centres in temporally food‐rich patches. Consequently, habitat preference changed markedly with time. The squirrels seemed to maximize nitrogen intake and to avoid the smaller seeds when possible. This resulted in an overall preference for a mixed diet of lodgepole pine and spruce seeds and avoidance of Sitka spruce seeds when Norway spruce seeds were available. These results lend support to the hypothesis of Ostfeld (1985) that when food is sparse and patchily distributed, females should develop intrasexual territoriality, concentrating their activity in food‐rich patches, while males should be non‐territorial and adapt their space use to the distribution of females.</jats:p>",
