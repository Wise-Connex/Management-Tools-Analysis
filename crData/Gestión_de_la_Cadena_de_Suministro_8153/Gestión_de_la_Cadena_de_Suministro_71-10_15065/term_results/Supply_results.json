Since 1967, the AGA annual gas reserve report of reserves by discovery year has provided a key analytical tool. Total reserve provided a key analytical tool. Total reserve additions are dependent on the rate of discovery of new fields but with considerable and varying time lag. The first step in predicting reserve additions is to predict new field discovery rates, where the significant factors are the availability of attractive exploration opportunities and field prices for gas.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The future energy requirements of our country and the manner in which these requirements will be met is a matter of great concern to us all.

Gross additions to proved reserves in the lower 48 states are projected by means of the updated IGT model of natural gas discovery and production, and by a simpler technique. These projections give an average range of gross additions of 15 to 20 Tcf through 1980 and show a decrease to an average level of about 15 Tcf in 1990 and 10 Tcf in 2000. This compares to a current need of about 35 Tcf of lower 48 reserve additions. It is clearly shown that it is a lower 48 states resource base of, at best, 1,000 Tcf, compounded by insufficient economic incentives to fully develop even this limited resource base, which is responsible for this gas supply problem. Thus, after allowing for reasonably optimistic projections of imports of pipeline gas from projections of imports of pipeline gas from Canada and Mexico, and liquefied natural gas from Africa and South America, and for pipeline transport of Alaskan gas, natural gas supply defficiencies in the lower 48 states still increase by about 1 to 1.5 Tcf each year beginning in 1972 to 1973. This assumes a minimum average reserves to production ratio of 10 years. Since no competitive or technological factors are apparent which would reduce gas demand, these supply deficiencies, which would reach about 10 Tcf in 1980, 20 Tcf in 1990 and 35 Tcf in 2000, will either be filled by less attractive energy sources or, partially, by synthetic pipeline gas from coal. Assuming development of pipeline gas from coal. Assuming development of commercial processes from existing technology at the fastest practical rate, synthetic pipeline gas from coal production, beginning in 1980 and reaching 5 Tcf/year in 1990, appears feasible at costs competitive with any other known sources of supplemental pipe-line-quality gas.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>In 1970, on the basis of preliminary statistics, net production of natural gas in the lower 48 states was about 22 Tcf, an increase of roughly 6 percent over 1969, and total demand for natural gas from all sources also increased to nearly 22 Tcf, or more than 7 percent. Thus, in 1970, as an absolute minimum, gross additions to proved reserves in the lower 48 states should have been 34 Tcf: 22 Tcf to replace net 1970 production plus 12 Tcf to support the 1.2 Tcf increase over 1969 with a 10-year reserve life. Instead, drilling activity continued to decline and actual lower 48 additions in 1970 were only 11.1 Tcf, following equally disappointing lower 48 additions of 12.0 and 8.3 Tcf in 1968 and 1969, respectively. Thus the decline from the 1953 to 1967 average of 19 Tcf/year appears to be, by far, more persistent than earlier temporary setbacks and has resulted in a drop in the lower 48 proved reserves to production ratio of less than 12 years. production ratio of less than 12 years.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The design of a municipal water supply system may involve utilizing singly or in combination a conventional water supply, a desalted water supply, and a supply from a recharged aquifer reservoir. Optimization of the design requires a model formulated in a way that modern methods of systems analysis can be used. This study concerns the formulation, solution, and evaluation of a mathematical model of a municipal water supply system that includes a supply from a variable quality output desalting plant. The combined system is operated in conjunction with an artificially recharged aquifer reservoir. Also considered are short periods of water shortages. The model is set up in an approximate linear programming format, and the optimum solution (minimum cost) is found. The model is tested by applying it to the design of a supply system to meet the 1985 estimated water demand of the city of Lincoln, Nebraska. Results of this test indicate that the artificial reservoir and the existing conventional supply system are capable of supplying that demand during all but the peak period. An electrodialysis desalting system is used in this analysis. It is competitive only when the length of transmission pipeline for a conventional supply system approaches 90 miles. The model is formulated in a general way so that it can be applied to almost all situations encountered in municipal water supply design, as well as to the specific system designated for this study.</jats:p>",
