This not only affects the quality of life of those unable to obtain a transplant, but it also has important repercussions on the large and rapidly growing federal expenditures for the treatment of end-stage renal disease by transplantation and dialysis. A simulation model was constructed to assess the impact that changes in the number of cadaveric kidneys donated in Michigan would have on the waiting list of potential kidney transplant recipients in the state. The model represents the process of matching donated kidneys to people on the waiting list, taking into account the compatibility of the donor with the potential recipient's blood type and the tissue compatibility of the recipient to the donor as estimated by cytotoxicity. We describe the structure and data needs of the model, and we discuss the results obtained for Michigan. It was found that, under the current conditions, the waiting list would continue to grow rapidly. The number of donors needed to compensate for this growth would have to be disproportionately large: as the number of donations increases the effect of each donation in reducing the waiting list is less. The approach is applicable to other regions and it should also be adaptable to other types of organ transplants that require tissue compatibility, once such transplants become common enough to warrant regional coordination of the matching of recipients with donors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Human erythrocytes are essentially impermeable to glutamate and yet there is a continual requirement for the amino acid for glutathione synthesis. In addition, the intracellular glutamate concentration is approximately five times that of plasma. We present evidence that glutamate enters the red cell as small peptides which are rapidly hydrolysed by cytoplasmic peptidase(s) and that with the estimated physiological levels of plasma glutamyl-peptides the rate of inward flux would be adequate to maintain the glutamate pool at its observed level. Experimentally, we used 1H spin-echo n.m.r. spectroscopy to follow peptide hydrolysis, since peptide spectra are different from those of the free amino acids and the spin-echo sequence enables the monitoring of reactions in concentrated lysates and whole cell suspensions. Thus, the system was studied under near-physiological conditions. Weighted non-linear regression analysis of progress curves using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation was used to obtain estimates of Km and Vmax. for the hydrolysis of alpha-L-glutamyl-L-alanine and L-alanyl-alpha-L-glutamate in lysates and whole cell suspensions; the values for lysates were Km = 3.60 +/- 0.29 and 5.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/l and Vmax. = 120 +/- 4 and 46.7 +/- 1.7 mmol/h per 1 of packed cells respectively. In whole cell suspensions the rate of peptide hydrolysis was much slower and dominated by the transmembrane flux-rate. The estimates of the steady-state kinetic parameters for the transport were Kt = 2.35 +/- 0.41 and 11.2 +/- 1.0 mmol/l and Vmax. = 3.26 +/- 0.13 and 19.7 +/- 0.7 mmol/h per 1 of packed cells respectively for the previously mentioned peptides. Using the n.m.r. procedure we failed to detect any glutaminase activity in whole cells or lysates; thus, we exclude the possibility that glutamate gains entry to the cell as glutamine which is subsequently hydrolysed by glutaminase.</jats:p>",

The branches of the external carotid artery in the external auditory meatus were found to vascularize (1) the pars flaccida, (2) the manubrial part of the pars tensa, and (3) the junction between the fibrocartilaginous ring of the TM and the tympanic sulcus of the temporal bone. The TM vessels of areas 1 and 2 were found beneath the squamous epithelium, close to mast cells and nerve bundles. Vessels originating from the tympanic cavity (also probably emanating from the external carotid artery) supplied the periphery of the pars tensa with minute branches, localized immediately beneath the tympanal epithelium. The portion of the pars tensa between the manubrial part and the periphery lacked a vascular system. Upon mechanical stimulation (gentle pressure on the handle of the malleus), the normally visible vessels dilated and minute branches appeared. This dilation may be caused, at least partly, by a release of vasoactive substances from mast cells and/or nerves in its vicinity. Even under mechanical stimulation, a large portion of the pars tensa seemed to be devoid of vessels. The nutrition of this part may be served by diffusion, with nutrients originating from the vessels in the tympanal rim and along the handle of the malleus. The architecture of the attachment of the fibrocartilaginous ring to the bony sulcus of the temporal bone is quite unique. Thus, the flow in the dense vascular network between these structures may be affected by an altered tension in the pars tensa.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The hallux is subject to numerous surgical procedures and very little is known about its blood supply. Arteriographic studies were performed in six cadaver specimens to identify the major arterial supply to the hallux. Discrepancies with now known anatomical models were discovered. In this study, the major arterial supply to the hallux appeared to originate from the lateral digital artery. In addition, two transverse digital arteries were noted to emit the nutrient arteries of the phalanges. Examination of other arteriographic studies sustained our results. </jats:p>",

The model is then used to estimate the off‐farm labour supply of the operator and his wife, and develop policy recommendations concerning further increases in off‐farm labour participation by farmers and their wives. A Heckman procedure is employed to test for sample selectivity bias. The results suggest that the supply of off‐farm labour is inelastic for men but quite responsive to the estimated shadow wage for women.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several reasons have been proposed to explain the unexpectedly low supply elasticities often found for food crops. This study is unusual in using a farmers' panel approach. This enables a distinction to be made between four different measures of response: realised output, planted hectarage, planned hectarage and ‘hypothetical’ hectarage. The results indicate that the own‐price elasticities of supply are significantly positive. Planned, planted and realised responses are quite close, but are less than the hypothetical responses. The hypothetical elasticities are smaller for price falls than for price increases and they become lower as the harvesting period passes, suggesting contraction of supply of a crop when its price falls and asymmetric response among small‐scale farmers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the absence of explicit data that would facilitate a direct measure of the variable degree of control over exportable tobacco in Greece, a statistical measure was devised for it corresponding to the probability that control did adversely affect production in a particular year. This was measured by simulating the supply equations from the free market period over the control period and relating the discrepancies to the standard errors of the simulated values. The period 1948–1980 was re‐analysed using this control variable jointly with lagged prices as supplementary ‘independent’ variables. The best estimate of the long‐run price elasticity is considered to be near 3 but falls below 2 with a normal degree of control. The normal long‐run effect of control on production was near 30%. Other effects of considerable importance were the level of the rural population, weather and trend. The analysis required the use of several sophisticated econometric techniques including Schmidt's formula for the error of a cumulative projection.</jats:p>",

High solvent production was observed for a low ratio. When the pH was controlled at 4.5, only acids were produced for all ratio values. At a low ammonium‐to‐glucose ratio, solvents were produced when the pH was controlled at 3.7. Acids only were produced for a low ratio value at pH 4.0 or for a high ratio value at pH 3.7. In continuous cultures, mostly acids were produced under glucose limitation, but solvents were produced under nitrogen limitation. It was concluded that the nitrogen availability controls solvent production and that the pH affects the availability of organic nitrogen. Biomass autolysis at the stationary phase of batch cultures was reversibly inhibited at pH values less than 3.8. In batch fermentations, the overall molar growth yields on ATP (Y<jats:sub>ATP</jats:sub>) varied from 5.5 to 9.0 and the transient yields from 5.5 to 15.5. In continuous cultures, the Y<jats:sub>ATP</jats:sub> values varied from 5.5 to 14.7 under glucose limitation, and from 6.1 to 9.3 under nitrogen limitation. The Y<jats:sub>ATP</jats:sub> depended on the ammonium to glucose ratio and the culture pH, but did not show the usual dependence on the specific growth rate in batch cultures. The experiments seem to confirm the hypothesis that solvent production is controlled by the demand and availability of ATP.</jats:p>",
