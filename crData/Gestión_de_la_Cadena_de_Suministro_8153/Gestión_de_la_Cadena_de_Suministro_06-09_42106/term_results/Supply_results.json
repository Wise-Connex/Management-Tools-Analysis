A comprehensive algorithm is developed to calculate the time and cost impact of the disruption. Insights about the value of timely supply information sharing are further discussed, based on quantitative relationships of material flows. Finally, an application of the above model in a main manufacturer of China is introduced. It is then compared to its performance in the case of timely supply information sharing with cases where information is not shared or is shared late.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>By timely sharing of supply information, firms at downstream stages can alert a disruption at an upstream stage, derive the correct early warning time, and make proper decisions to offset the impact of the disruption.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dream of better relationships among different supply chain partners; trust and transparency during different construction activities; integrated supply chain; completion of projects on time, within the agreed cost, with promised quality products and services, and so on, have now been achieved within the UK construction industry due to innovation within the project procurement processes and activities. There has also been a growing realisation that the promotion of innovative thinking, in procurement processes for supply chain integration, offers all the involved parties some key benefits in terms of more flexibility and adaptability, commercial growth, and improved quality of products, and delivered service. This paper highlights the benefits of, and the motivation towards innovative procurement through two case studies done as part of a supply chain integration project at the SCRI research centre. The case studies demonstrate how organizations involved have promoted innovative thinking across the supply chain through innovative procurement. The case studies also highlight some of the critical factors that motivated people within those firms to move from traditional way of procurement, and search, innovate, and implement the new procurement thoughts and models. The paper concludes that these studies offer transferable learning opportunities and motivation for the staff of other construction firms seeking to promote integration within their supply chains through innovative procurement routes.</jats:p>",

Measurements were made to find out whether the treatments had produced any significant difference between the root strength of the two varieties (normal sweet Puma F I and super sweet Dessert R75 Fl) at the two dates of measurement (tasseling, milk stage) in the year 2003. The treatments with a high phosphorous ratio resulted in an apparent increase in root strength with both varieties. There was a detectable difference in root strength also between the two points of measurement, suggesting that root development had remained stable. The treatments produced significant increase not only in the root strength but also in the yields of both varieties.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The impact of the packaging system on logistics processes along the supply chain is often implicitly and fragmentally recognized. In order to increase understanding of the impact of packaging on logistics, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of the interactions between the packaging system and logistics processes in the retail supply chain. Four case studies involving Swedish and Dutch retail supply chains were conducted to identify, describe and understand in depth the logistics activities related to packaging within these retail supply chains. The comprehensive overview provided in this paper serves as an elementary step towards understanding the role of packaging systems in logistics, which is a prerequisite for taking packaging and logistics decisions based on a supply chain perspective. Moreover, the paper provides a process‐orientated description of what a packaging system must fulfil and perform along the retail supply chain. It also provides a means for evaluating packaging systems, with emphasis on logistics aspects. The interactions between the packaging system and the logistics processes identified in this research can be used to bridge the gap between logisticians and packaging engineers/designers/technicians/managers by enabling them to engage in a dialogue and understand where and how packaging and logistics decisions can impact the performance of packaging system and logistics processes in the retail supply chain.

Women fulfil most part‐time jobs, but a considerable fraction of men works part‐time as well. Evidence from descriptive statistics and a macroeconometric model at the sectoral level of industry suggests that the growth of part‐time employment in the 1990s relates strongly to the growth in female labour force participation. Factors of labour demand, such as the shift from manufacturing to services and the increase in the demand for flexible labour, turn out to play a significant role as well.</jats:p>",

We also estimate a very elastic supply for physical structure; hence, differences in construction activity across markets do not explain the variation in costs. Supply shifters that collectively do account for differences in building costs include the extent of unionization within the construction sector, local wages, local topography in terms of the presence of high hills and mountains, and the local regulatory environment.</jats:p>",

Conclusions drawn from experimental works differ when the data are grouped in a way such that the relative frequency of test conditions does not determine the emerging trends, for instance unrealistically strong CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>–‘fertilization’ effects, which are in conflict with some basic ecological principles. I suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (I); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (II); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady‐state leaf area index (LAI) and fine root renewal (III). Data for 10 type III experiments yield rather moderate effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on plant biomass production, if any. In steady‐state grassland, the effects are water‐related; in closed tree stands, initial effects decline rapidly with time. Plant–soil coupling (soil conditions) deserves far greater attention than plant–atmosphere coupling (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment technology).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:table-wrap position=\"anchor\">\n\n<jats:table frame=\"void\">\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:col />\n<jats:thead>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:th />\n<jats:th>Contents</jats:th>\n<jats:th />\n</jats:tr>\n</jats:thead>\n<jats:tbody>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td>Summary</jats:td>\n<jats:td>393</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>I.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss1\">A traditionally scarce resource becomes abundant</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>394</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>II.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss2\">Photosynthesis is not saturated at current CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>395</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>III.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss3\">The fate of extra carbon</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>396</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>IV.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss4\">Co drivers of plant growth responses to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub></jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>397</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>V.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss5\">Plant CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> responses as a function of time</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>399</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>VI.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss6\">Plant CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> responses per unit land area, a matter of definition</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>401</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>VII.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss7\">CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> effects on biomass carbon stores depend on tree demography</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>402</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>VIII.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss8\">Biomass responses to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in steady state  and expanding systems</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>403</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td>IX.</jats:td>\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss28\">Conclusions</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>405</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss29\">Acknowledgements</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>406</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n<jats:tr>\n<jats:td />\n<jats:td><jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#ss30\">References</jats:ext-link></jats:td>\n<jats:td>406</jats:td>\n</jats:tr>\n</jats:tbody>\n</jats:table>\n\n</jats:table-wrap>\n</jats:p>",

The study finds that restructuring has raised the barriers to employer investment in vocational training and is the principal cause of sustained skill shortages in the industry. Using the 1986 and 2001 Population Censuses and economic and labour force surveys, it examines the significant changes in the occupational, industry, firm size, educational attainment and demographic structure of employment in the industry that have occurred over the last two decades. The major drivers of change include: new technologies; evolving consumer tastes; an intensification of sub-contracting through the intra-industry division of labour; outsourcing of activities through the inter-industry division of labour; and reduced role of the public sector in the industry. The study also finds evidence that a large proportion of sub-trade vacancies are filled by qualified tradespersons. This finding has important implications for current strategies to address trade skills shortages. It is concluded that changes in industry and workforce structure which exacerbate the lack of employer investment in training are creating an industry which does not have the skilled people required to meet demands.</jats:p>",

For market work, we test our models for eight demographic groups of children, namely, younger and older, rural and urban, boys and girls. Our results show that for market work, fathers and children may be substitutes or complements in supplying labor, whereas mothers and children are complements for all groups of children. Our study of household work pertains to girls only, because boys do not engage in household work in sufficient numbers for analysis. We find almost no connections between parents' market work and daughters' household work status. </jats:p>",

The paper finds that the improved growth and diversification of South African manufactured exports during the 1990s lag those of East Asia and a few other resource‐based economies. This performance in part reflects relatively low world growth in resource‐based products, but factors that affect the profitability of export supply, such as the real effective exchange rate, infrastructure costs, tariff rates and skilled labour, are also shown to be important. Export demand and the ability to compete in the export market on the basis of price are not found to be a major constraint to export growth.</jats:p>",

A unimodal distribution of diversity with resource supply has been widely observed and explained previously in the context of selection acting in a spatially heterogeneous environment. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism to explain the relationship between resource supply and diversification that is based on selection for exploitation of different resources. To test this mechanism, we conducted a selection experiment using the bacterium<jats:italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</jats:italic>in spatially homogeneous environments over a wide range of resource supply rates. Our results show that niche diversification peaks at intermediate levels of resource availability. We suggest that this unimodal relationship is due to evolutionary diversification that is driven by competition for resources but constrained by the ecological opportunity represented by different resource types. These processes may underlie some general patterns of diversity, including latitudinal gradients in species richness and the effects of anthropogenic enrichment of the environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Eliminating the risk for ABO‐incompatible transfusion errors and simplifying blood logistics by creating an ABO‐universal blood inventory is a challenging idea but not a new one. In the early 1980s Goldstein and co‐workers at the New York Blood Centre pioneered the field of enzymatic conversion of blood group B red blood cells (RBC) to group O. They used native or recombinant α‐galactosidase from green coffee beans to remove the immunodominant galactose residues terminally located in the carbohydrate chains found on group B RBC. These enzyme‐converted O (ECO) RBC survived normally in the circulation of individuals independent of the blood group of the recipient. Small infusions were escalated to single, multiple and repeated RBC units. A successful phase II clinical trial in patients was reported in 2000 by Kruskall <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>. However, economically unfavourable doses of enzyme were required to convert a unit of blood due to the low pH optimum of the enzyme. Conversion of blood group A cells was never achieved due to lack of A‐converting enzymes working at RBC‐friendly conditions. Also, the chemical nature of group A antigens is more complex due to the A<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>/A<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> subgroups. Following screening of &gt;2500 microorganisms we recently identified a novel family of bacterial exoglycosidases with specificities for the blood group A or B antigens and remarkably improved kinetic properties. Enzymatically converted group A and B RBC type as group O and can now be achieved under cost‐efficient and optimised conditions including neutral pH and room temperature incubation. Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ECO RBC are currently ongoing. Of the different strategies envisioned to create a universal blood component supply, the ECO concept is the only one for which clinical trials in humans have been performed. The presentation will review the current status of this exciting technology and its potential for introduction in the clinical component preparation laboratory.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>The speaker is a Visiting Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA and also a scientific consultant to the R&amp;D biotech company ZymeQuest, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA.

In later works the method was improved towards design goals: nonetheless complexity of the network seismic behaviour, a procedure to maximize safety of selected nodes and minimize economic expenses was constructed, allowing identification of which components, within each station, had to be upgraded to obtain the maximum economic convenience. The procedure was programmed within the ASK4ELP computer code (National Information Service for Earthquake Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, U.S.A., 1999) using late 1990s state‐of‐the‐art knowledge for both the earthquake and the structural behaviour models.</jats:p><jats:p>Recently the method has gone through a thorough updating, partially still in progress.

With perennially water‐short status, the efficient capture and storage of precipitation in soil, and the yield responsiveness of crops to water, are emphasized. Our objective was to quantify grain sorghum [<jats:italic>Sorghum bicolor</jats:italic> (L.) Moench] and winter wheat (<jats:italic>Triticum aestivum</jats:italic> L.) yield responses to stored soil water and precipitation by using data gleaned from research conducted from 1973 to 2004 near Tribune, KS on Ulysses silt loam (fine‐silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustolls) and Richfield silt loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustolls) soils. Soil water content was measured gravimetrically to the 183‐cm depth at crop emergence. Grain yield was related to available soil water at emergence (ASW<jats:sub>e</jats:sub>) (increased 221 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in sorghum and 98 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in wheat). Grain yield was also related to in‐season precipitation (ISP) (increased 164 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in sorghum and 83 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in wheat). From response‐surface analyses, 63% (sorghum) and 70% (wheat) of variations in grain yield were explained by variations in ASW<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> and ISP. In data sorted by tillage, yield response to water supply (WS) was greater with no‐till than with conventional tillage in both crops (184 vs. 129 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in sorghum; 138 vs. 86 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in wheat).

Motivated by the automotive parts remanufacturing industry, we consider an end‐of‐life product from which a particular part can be recovered and remanufactured for reuse, and the remainder of the product can be recycled for material recovery. Both the supply of end‐of‐life products and demand for remanufactured parts are price‐sensitive. Yield of the recovery process is random and depends on the acquisition price offered for the end‐of‐life products. In this setting, we develop models to determine the optimal acquisition price for the end‐of‐life products and the selling price for remanufactured parts. We also analyze the effects of yield variation to the profitability of remanufacturing, benefits of delaying pricing decisions until after yield realization, and value of perfect yield rate information. </jats:p>",

To what extent, then should adults negotiate their provisioning behaviour with other family members? We used experimental manipulations of brood size, and targeted playback of begging calls to determine the extent to which adult great tits<jats:italic>Parus major</jats:italic>adjust their provisioning rates in response to the behaviour of their partner and their brood. We found that males and females behaved similarly, both responding more to each other's behaviour than to chick calling. We also found that the degree to which adults negotiated their provisioning rates with each other varied between years. A review of the literature suggests that the extent of negotiation over provisioning is likely to vary not only between species of diverse taxa, but also between and within (this study) populations of the same species. We suggest that provisioning behaviour lies on a ‘negotiation continuum’, which describes the extent to which parents respond to the actions of other family members. We argue that an individual's location on the ‘negotiation continuum’ is determined partly by the extent to which it can physically respond to the behaviour shown by other members of the family and partly by the quality of information on offer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Water resources management in the face of increasing scarcity requires that countries undertake audits of their current resources. The small island of Carriacou (area 34 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), which forms part of the state of Grenada, has no perennial streams and very little groundwater but receives an average annual rainfall of about 1200 mm. The island has traditionally depended on rainwater harvesting, and this offers a sustainable method of providing an adequate quantity and quality of water. Furthermore, rainwater harvesting systems have proven to be resilient in the aftermath of natural disasters. This paper assesses the potential of rainwater harvesting in the islands and shows that, although per capita water demand is dependent on household income levels, rainwater can adequately meet the demands of the island's residents. It shows that the cost of harvested rainwater is by up to nine times lower than that of the recently available desalinated water. The quality of rainwater has not been considered here, as quality is not a concern of the residents. The paper therefore highlights the need for policies that would promote the construction of adequate size storage and quality improvement facilities for achieving the full potential of rainwater as a sustainable water resource on a water-scarce small island. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Food Supply Veterinary Medical Coalition (FSVMC) was formed in 2004 with a mission to assure the public that food continues to be abundant, safe and wholesome by ensuring that veterinarians are appropriately involved throughout the food supply system. The premise of the Coalition is that food production is enhanced, both in safety and wholesomeness, when veterinarians are included in all steps of production and processing. Listed alphabetically, the following organizations are the founding members of the Food Supply Veterinary Medical Coalition (FSVMC): American Association of Avian Pathologists, American Association of Bovine Practitioners, American Association of Food Hygiene Veterinarians, American Association of Small Ruminants Practitioners, American Association of Swine Veterinarians, American Association of Veterinary Medical Colleges, American Veterinary Medical Association, Association of Veterinary Consultants, and the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. Although not officially a member, the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association was very supportive of this research program, and was instrumental in data collection in Canada.&#x0D;\nThis study was commissioned by the FSVMC in May 2004 to implement a far reaching research program to examine the demand and supply trends for food animal veterinarians and the issues shaping those trends. The study was funded by the FSVMC and a grant from Bayer Animal Health. Similar in spirit to earlier extensive research on the veterinary profession provided in the KPMG mega study and the Pew report, the final report, entitled \"Estimating FSVM Demand and Maintaining the Availability of Veterinarians for Careers in Food Supply Related Disciplines in the United States and Canada\" consists of over 1600 pages that describe many different studies on various facets of the supply and demand for food supply veterinarians. Representing 16 months of literature review, data collection and analysis, the entire report can be found at the following website: http ://www.avma.org/public_heal th/f svmc/fsvmc_toc.asp. Three summary articles have also been published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association (JAVMA) that highlight the major findings from the research program. The first article deals with veterinary student career path attraction to food production medicine in the USA and Canada. The second article, examines career switching and the retention of food supply veterinarians in the career. The third article15 addresses the patterns of growing demand for food supply veterinarians. Each article contains recommendations to improve the profession based directly upon the results from this research.&#x0D;\nThe research program that examined demand issues from 2004 thru 2016 in food supply medicine was comprised of thirteen panels of experts who participated in a multiple-round Delphi forecasting exercise. The research program addressing career attraction and career retention issues consisted of 1 7 studies, seven focus group studies and ten surveys, which provided insight into FSVM career path attraction and retention in the United States and Canada. Unlike some previous studies, this study found that there will likely be a 4% to 5% yearly shortfall in bovine-interested veterinarians graduating from US and Canadian veterinary colleges over the next 10 years. As demand for these veterinarians will rise only a modest 1% per year, most of this shortfall will be due to a lack of supply of new bovine-interested veterinary college graduates. To alleviate this shortfall, multiple tactics were suggested to: increase the likelihood of recruiting bovine-interested veterinary students into veterinary college, create cattle interest in students already in veterinary college, help these students as they begin their careers post-graduation, and provide further ongoing support to prevent them from switching from bovine medicine in their first five years of practice.</jats:p>"

To overcome such limitations, simulation tools that can deal with general networked queue topology must be developed. Despite certain limitations, simulation algorithms provide a mechanism to obtain insight and good numerical approximation to parameters of networked queues. This paper presents a closed stochastic simulation network model and several approximation and bounding schemes for G/G/c systems. The analysis was originally conducted to verify the integrity of simulation models used to develop alternative policy options conducted on behalf of the US Air Force. We showed that the theoretical bounds could be used to approximate mean capacities at various queues. In this paper, we present results for a G/G/8 system though similar results have been obtained for other networks of queues as well.</jats:p>",

The aim of the present study was to quantify the influence of grain quality and other factors on interannual variation in the premium calculated as a proportion of the feed price. A hypothetical model of the UK wheat economy was devised, appropriate annual national data from 1982 to 2000 were collected for each component and multiple regression was used to develop a statistical model for the premium.</jats:p><jats:p>The statistical model included livestock numbers (calculated as pig equivalents), Hagberg falling number and wheat stocks, which together explained 0·80 of the interannual variation in the premium. A high premium was associated with high livestock numbers, low Hagberg falling number and low wheat stocks. These variables were included in the hypothetical model because: livestock numbers represent demand for feed wheat; Hagberg falling number is a quality criterion for purchase of bread wheat with a low value indicating poor quality and thus a smaller supply of bread wheat; wheat stocks are one of the sources of supply of wheat. It was concluded that of the 16 supply, demand or price variables in the hypothetical model the main variables associated with the premium from 1982 to 2000 were demand for feed wheat, quality of the wheat harvest and carry-over of wheat from the previous harvest.</jats:p>",

Study 1 included 54 piglets (six litters of nine piglets). One piglet from every litter was killed 1 day before weaning. The remaining 48 piglets were allocated at weaning (28 days) to four dietary zinc treatments (100, 250, 1000 or 2500 ppm) and subsequently killed 1–2, 5–6 or 14–15 days after weaning. Study 2 included 48 piglets (six litters of eight piglets) allocated to four dietary treatments, consisting of low or high dietary zinc (100 or 2500 ppm) in combination with low or high dietary copper (20 or 175 ppm). All piglets in study 2 were killed 5–7 days after weaning. In both studies, the trace mineral status was assessed by zinc and copper concentrations and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity in plasma and mucosal tissue. In study 2, lymphocyte metallothionein (MT) mRNA and intestinal mucosa MT mRNA concentrations were included as zinc status markers. The results showed that the zinc status, measured as zinc in plasma and mucosa, was not affected by weaning of the piglets. Plasma copper concentrations decreased during the first 2 weeks after weaning. High dietary copper concentrations did not affect the concentration of copper in plasma, but increased the concentration of copper in mucosa and the concentration of zinc in plasma. The dietary zinc treatments increased the zinc concentration in plasma as well as the zinc and MT mRNA concentration in mucosa. Lymphocyte MT mRNA concentrations did not reflect the differences in dietary zinc supplementation.</jats:p>",

This study describes the investigation of pesticides at a site on the Triassic Sandstone aquifer of northern England. Drilling and pore water sampling demonstrated the presence of agricultural herbicides in the unsaturated zone of the aquifer close to a public supply well site at which elevated pesticide concentrations had been detected in the abstracted ground water. These were similar to the compounds detected in the supply wells, but there was no evidence for some of these having been used at the nearby farm. Modeling of water movement to wells showed that individual ground water flow subcatchments were retained during a monthly duty cycle and should be well‐defined. Detecting and quantifying the sources of pesticide pollution of ground water was unsuccessful, probably due to local land use and aquifer heterogeneity. This remains difficult even where the overall catchment is small (1‐km radius) and there are apparently few possible point sources. Even with sophisticated flow models, there is still a high degree of uncertainty in modeling pesticide movement, and treatment of ground water may be the only viable option for water utilities.</jats:p>",

Animals received one of three atherogenic (0·2% cholesterol) diets containing 12% butter with either a standard fatty acid composition (rich in saturated fatty acids), rich in <jats:italic>trans-</jats:italic>10-18:1 (T10 diet) or in <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>-11-18:1 plus RA (T11+ RA diet) for 6 or 12 weeks. The ingestion of butters rich in <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic> fatty acids an/r RA for 6 weeks had little or no effect on liver and AT lipogenesis. The ingestion for 12 weeks of butter rich in T11 + RA decreased perirenal AT weight, lipogenic enzyme and lipoprotein lipase activities, without affecting liver lipid concentration or lipogenic activities except for a decrease in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. Similar trends, but of a lower magnitude, were observed in rabbits fed the T10 diet for 12 weeks. Ingestion of the T10 or T11 + RA diets for 6 or 12 weeks had no significant effect on plasma metabolites and hormones except for glucose which increased at 6 weeks in the T10 group. Plasma leptin concentration was positively correlated with AT weight but did not differ between the three diets. In conclusion, the supply of butters rich in either T10 or T11 + RA in an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks decreased rabbit AT lipogenesis, with a more marked effect of the T11 + RA diet, but had no effect on liver lipogenesis.</jats:p>",
