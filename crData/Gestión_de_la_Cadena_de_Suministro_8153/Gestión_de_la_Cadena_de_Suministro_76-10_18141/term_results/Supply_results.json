Historical, U.S. graduate and petroleum engineering manpower. Historical, U.S. graduate and undergraduate total and petroleum engineering enrollment and degree productivity for the past forty years are documented. Trends are analyzed productivity for the past forty years are documented. Trends are analyzed and apparent reasons are given fro the supply-demand imbalance which occurred three times during the period. Future supply of petroleum engineering graduates for the next ten years is predicted upon the basis of past history and also several other assumptions. The number and annual past history and also several other assumptions. The number and annual demand for total engineering and petroleum engineering graduates in drilling and/or production activities during the past five years is summarized. For the next ten years, the petroleum industry estimate of the demand for petroleum engineers is compared with the supply of petroleum engineering graduates.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Petroleum technology program statistics, past and future predictions, are Petroleum technology program statistics, past and future predictions, are presented.

Such behavior can be attributed to the imbalance of supply productivity. Such behavior can be attributed to the imbalance of supply and demand. The author feels that it is not improper to observe at this time that those engaged in certain curricula, such as government, economics, business administration, liberal arts, etc., exhibit little concern for the magnitude of the degree productivity of their particular field of specialization. Consequently, the market is greatly oversupplied with these graduates, jobs are not available, and hence, students are motivated to pursue graduate studies. Usually only a small percentage of the advanced degree recipients are able to find employment in their field of specialization. The author abhors this situation and considers it detrimental to the individual concerned and society in general. The individual's time and resources are wasted, or at least inefficiently utilized, as well as the tax-payers dollars. Such an experience has a serious impact on the individual's dignity since he has spent so much and then finds that there is no use for his talents. America owes it to its young people to eliminate this situation. I am delighted to learn that Governor Briscoe of Texas is initiating action to remedy this deplorable situation.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Engineering has also experienced this oversupply but, fortunately, not to the extent of the aforementioned fields. However, petroleum and aeronautical engineering have experienced periods of great oversupply in the past forty years.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>SPE has recognized this as a serious situation for a number of years and has been scheduling forums, such as this one today, annually. The author feels that the future of petroleum engineering education is dependent upon the reconciliation of the supply-demand imbalance of petroleum engineering graduates. It is his fervent hope that as a result of all previous discussions, interested parties will act immediately to prevent a supply-demand imbalance of petroleum engineering graduates in the future.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Having worked as a petroleum engineer for a good part of my oil career and being directly associated as a manager for the remainder of it, I feel a strong sense of allegiance and concern for the future of petroleum engineering. As a discipline, it has had spectacular growth and contributed immensely to the technological capability of our industry. It will influence in large measure where we as an industry will be tomorrow.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Petroleum engineering began to emerge shortly after Drake drilled his first well at Titusville, Pa. Men without formal engineering training began to grapple with problem aspects of drilling, production, and oil reservoirs, which in our day have come to be known as petroleum engineering. A formally taught and petroleum engineering. A formally taught and practiced discipline was not on the oil scene practiced discipline was not on the oil scene really until about 1915. From that time on, it grew rapidly and fostered a breed of men from which much of the leadership for the industry has come. They were and still are a group with great breadth of understanding in relating human problems and skills, economics, risks, technical problems and skills, economics, risks, technical and practical know-how, all of which interplayed to help mold a great and bold industry. It is an industry capable of yielding results against difficult odds generated from complexity and from the physical environment. The understanding of risk and probabilities (generated from natural factors) is a game we must play to be in this business. Over the past 50 yews, we have overcome some risks through new technology, and other risks have cropped up. The net result is that the business is still risky.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A point that consistently emerges is that the best leadership for the production part of the business was and continues to be found in those who have a thorough understanding of all the factors involved in locating, drilling, producing, and employing economic and technical producing, and employing economic and technical analysis of reservoirs. This is the widely accepted broad definition of petroleum engineering.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Since the upstream side of the oil business will continue to drill wells and produce reservoirs for some time to come, there will be a need for experienced oil men to provide leadership, operational know-how and technical and economic assessment.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>When we view what is occurring in the oil industry in the United States, we get concerned as to what the future holds.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The mean concentration of ATP, determined by the luciferin‐luciferase assay, was 55.3 mg ATP/l rumen fluid in a heifer fed continuously, twice as much as found in a starved heifer. The mean ratio of biomass/ATP changed from 683 at the high level of energy intake to 1208 in the period of starvation.

Ammonium in this aerobic surface layer is nitrified and the resulting ammonium concentration gradient across the aerobic layer and the underlying anaerobic layer causes ammonium in the anaerobic layer to diffuse upward into the aerobic layer where it also undergoes nitrification. Nitrate produced in the aerobic layer then diffuses downward into the anaerobic layer where it is denitrified to N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O. Nitrate derived from ammonium nitrogen in the aerobic layer appears as an intermediate product in the nitrification‐denitrification reaction.</jats:p><jats:p>A laboratory experiment utilizing <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N as a tracer showed that approximately one‐half of the nitrogen involved in the nitrification‐denitrification process was ammonium originally present in the surface aerobic soil or water bottom layer with the remainder diffusing up from the underlying anaerobic layer. Where oxygen was absent or limiting, nitrification either did not occur or occurred at a lower rate, resulting in a reduced amount of nitrate available for the denitrification process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mutant derivatives of the unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph K1062 were employed to investigate whether the supposedly membrane-bound bacterial replication machinery requires for its replicatory functions a fluid membrane environment as is known for several membrane-associated protein functions. Temperatures Tt for fluid reversible nonfluid phase transitions of membrane phospholipids are raised from below 18 to 38 degrees C when mutant cells are supplemented with elaidate instead of with oleate. In this experimental system current or synchroneously initiated new rounds of DNA replication are shown in vivo to continue 8 degrees below Tt, provided appropriate corrections for the concurrent cellular metabolic breakdown are considered. Temperature rate profiles for in vitro deoxyribonucleic acid replication rates measured in lysates of either oleate- or elaidate-supplemented cells yield congruent Arrhenius plots without discontinuities at corresponding Tt positions. We conclude that neither the start nor the propagation of replication forks depends on a fluid membrane. The capacity for the assembly of new replication complexes was studied in replication-aligned cells either shifted from oleate to elaidate (at temperatures below Tt for newly synthesized phospholipids) or starved for oleate. Regardless of whether unsaturated fatty acids are exchanged or completely withheld, new replication complexes can be normally assembled and initiated. These results do not support the conclusions reached by Fralick and Lark (1973) that the availability of unsaturated fatty acids is a prerequisite for the assembly of a functional replication complex.</jats:p>",

With full Community prices applied in the UK at a realistic rate of exchange, dairying would be very profitable. In spite of the setback between 1973 and 1975 the milk output objective of the Government's White Paper ‘Food from Our Own Resources' should be reached in the first half of the 1980s. Liquid milk consumption will be fairly stable in the future, but with the higher prices under the Community régime the butter market will contract. A modest increase in cheese consumption will continue. Higher milk production in the UK and a reduced market will increase self‐sufficiency. In spite of the European surplus in the dairy sector the competitive strength of the UK industry at Community prices is substantial and it is economically right for it to expand.</jats:p>",

The results allow the conclusion that upon withdrawal of nitrous oxide in non‐adrenalectomized animals, there is an increase in metabolic rate at an essentially unchanged metabolic state. In adrenalectornized animals, discontinuation of nitrous oxide supply did not induce changes in any of the tissue metabolites measured.
