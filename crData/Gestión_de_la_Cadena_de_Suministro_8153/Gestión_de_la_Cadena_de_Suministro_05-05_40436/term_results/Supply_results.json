      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the impact that a water supply and sewerage (W&amp;S) expansion had on child mortality in Quito, Ecuador. Studies have typically estimated the effects of this type of interventions comparing outcome indicators - at the aggregate level - of areas with the facilities and areas that lack them, quite often neglecting systematic differences between treated and nontreated areas. Moreover, at aggregate levels, on the one hand, less comprehensive information may imply greater unobserved and uncontrolled heterogeneity; on the other, heterogeneity within areas may jeopardize identification of impacts. To account for these key observations, the authors used a propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at the individual level. Using indirect methods based on census data they constructed a mortality index at the motherhood level, and calculated five different impact estimators based on the propensity scores.</jats:p>"

The developed unit also does not need any expensive high voltage power supply for generating output voltages in the range of some 100V typically required for the function of trapping devices. The high efficiency of the generator allows long-term operation at output powers of around 50W without any performance losses. The frequency range of the device is determined by the output transformer. It can be varied from the megahertz range down to some kilohertz by replacing the output transformer and several capacitors in the control part of the generator. Thus, our device can be used for supplying traps operating with ions as well as with charged nano- or microparticles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper empirically documents the association between supply chain glitches and operating performance. The results are based on a sample of 885 glitches announced by publicly traded firms. Changes in various operating performance metrics for the sample firms are compared against a sample of control firms of similar size and from similar industries. In the year leading up to the announcement, the control-adjusted mean percent changes in operating income, return on sales, and return on assets for the sample firms are −107%, −114%, and −92%, respectively. During this same period, the control-adjusted changes in the level of return on sales and return on assets are −13.78% and −2.32%, respectively. Relative to controls, firms that experience glitches report on average 6.92% lower sales growth, 10.66% higher growth in cost, and 13.88% higher growth in inventories. More importantly, firms do not quickly recover from the negative economic consequences of glitches. During the two-year time period after the glitch announcement, operating income, sales, total costs, and inventories do not improve. We also find that it does not matter who caused the glitch, what the reason was for the glitch, or what industry a firm belongs to—glitches are associated with negative operating performance across the board. </jats:p>",

I studied the foraging behavior of coyotes (<jats:italic>Canis latrans</jats:italic>) in the Alaska Range during the peak and decline of a snowshoe hare (<jats:italic>Lepus americanus</jats:italic>) population cycle (1999–2002). Coyote diet was compared with prey availability to test for changes in prey selection and to examine the effect of coyote predation on the vertebrate prey community. Coyotes responded to the hare decline by increasing selection for hares and porcupines, whereas selection for voles, ground squirrels and Dall sheep did not change. Although the study area was characterized by considerable habitat heterogeneity, coyotes utilized the area as a fine‐grained environment. Coyote foraging behavior was driven primarily by changes in snowshoe hare abundance, and their sensitivity to change in alternative prey density was low. Predation by coyotes may therefore decrease the stability of alternative prey populations rather than dampening fluctuations. In order for predation to enhance the stability of prey populations, I hypothesize that prey profitability must be determined primarily by abundance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Timber supply analyses are used to estimate the possible harvest level of timber volume over the long term. Site index is one of the inputs of these analyses. When site index is underestimated, as is often the case for older stands, it will lead to underestimated yields. This creates a significant negative effect on harvest levels in the timber supply analyses. Better site index information is obtainable by using ecologically based site indices; however, an efficient way of applying the site index estimates is needed. The purpose of this project was to develop a technique for incorporating better site index estimates into timber supply analyses. We used simple random sampling to determine the proportion of each site series in a management unit. Site index estimates were available for these site series. To link the site index information to timber supply analysis units, we initially created analysis units using inventory information. The site series proportions were then used to form new ecologically based analysis units, and yield tables were generated from the associated site index information. After an area was harvested in the timber supply model from an inventory-based analysis unit, it was allocated to an ecologically based analysis unit in proportion to the area that the site series occupied in the timber harvesting land base. Once an area was placed into a new analysis unit, it remained there for the duration of the timber supply analysis. We tested this method in the Bulkley Timber Supply Area, where it resulted in a 26% increase in the long-term sustainable harvest level.</jats:p>"

The efficiency and the output voltage depend on parameters of coils. We studied the best parameter values that realize stable high efficiency contactless power supply. In the application with low output voltage, the voltage drop of the diodes becomes dominant power loss. A synchronous rectification was proposed as a solution of this problem. Our contactless power supply system for an artificial heart operates at 190kHz. We use planar coils with Mn–Zn ferrite cores. Highly stable output voltage and 88% maximum efficiency were realized.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Realistic optimization of the operation of urban water supply headworks systems requires that the issues of system complexity and stochasticity be addressed. A promising way of achieving this is to couple probabilistic search methods such as genetic algorithms (GAs) with Monte Carlo simulation models. However, the objective function surface, characteristic of this genre of problem, exhibits piecewise flat regions separated by steep slopes. The size of these flat regions is affected by the frequency of droughts sampled in the Monte Carlo simulation. Although an earlier study proposed a GA variant that appears to robustly negotiate such objective function surfaces, the assessment was limited to a simple one‐reservoir system. There remains therefore a legitimate concern that for more complex systems the GA may converge prematurely producing decisions of little practical value. This study assesses the ability of the GA to optimize key operating rules for a complex urban headworks system with nine reservoirs and interbasin transfers subject to a highly variable climate. Eight decisions affecting restriction rules, pump marks, and contingent desalination were optimized using an objective function that minimized expected annual costs. It is shown that the GA produced results that are judged consistent with the strategy that minimizes total expected costs. In addition, the sensitivity of the GA results to the length of the Monte Carlo simulation was investigated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this study was to quantify how photoprotective mechanisms in the leaves of `Concord' grapevines (<jats:italic>Vitis labruscana</jats:italic> Bailey) respond to a range of iron (Fe) supply. Own-rooted, 1-year-old container-grown vines were fertigated twice weekly for 11 weeks with a complete nutrient solution containing 1, 10, 20, 50, or 100 μ<jats:sc>m</jats:sc> Fe from ferric ethylenediamine di (<jats:italic>o</jats:italic>-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid (Fe-EDDHA). Leaf total Fe content did not increase in response to Fe supply; however, “active” Fe (extracted with 2,2′-dipyridyl) and chlorophyll (Chl) increased on a leaf area basis as applied Fe increased. At the lowest active Fe level, leaf absorptance and the efficiency of excitation transfer (<jats:italic>F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>′/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub>′)</jats:italic> was lower, and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) was significantly greater. Photosystem II (PSII) quantum efficiency decreased curvilinearly, and the proportion of PSII reaction centers in the open state (<jats:italic>q</jats:italic>P) decreased linearly as active Fe content decreased. On a Chl basis, the xanthophyll cycle pool size [violaxanthin (V) + antheraxanthin (A) + zeaxanthin (Z)], lutein, and β-carotene increased curvilinearly as active Fe decreased, and neoxanthin (Neo) increased at the lowest Fe level. On a leaf area basis, as active Fe decreased, V+A+Z and β-carotene decreased curvilinearly, and lutein and Neo decreased linearly. At noon, conversion of V to A and Z increased as active Fe decreased. On a Chl basis, activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR), and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) increased curvilinearly, and glutathione reductase (GR) activity increased linearly as active Fe levels declined. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT), on a Chl basis, were relatively constant. On a leaf area basis, a decrease in active Fe increased SOD and MDAR activity, whereas APX, CAT, DHAR and GR activity decreased. Antioxidant metabolites ascorbate (AsA), dehydroascorbate (DAsA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) also increased in response to Fe limitation when expressed on a Chl basis, whereas on a leaf area basis AsA and DAsA decreased and GSH increased curvilinearly. The GSH:GSSG ratio increased as active Fe declined, whereas the AsA:DAsA ratio did not change. In conclusion, both photoprotective mechanisms, xanthophyll cycle-dependent thermal dissipation and the ascorbate-glutathione antioxidant system, are enhanced in response to Fe deficiency to cope with excess absorbed light. In a low soil pH tolerant species such as <jats:italic>V. labruscana</jats:italic>, the foliar antioxidant system was upregulated in response to excess absorbed light from Fe deficiency-induced chlorosis, and there was no evidence of an increase in oxidative stress from high rates of applied Fe-EDDHA.</jats:p>",

A 15 wt% HCl acid treatment was performed in an attempt to remove drilling mud filter cake and improve wellbore to formation connectivity, however the solubility of the formation's cementation material (calcite) was overlooked and sand production resulted after the treatment.

The presence of biopolymers in the completion fluids enhanced the activities of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). These bacteria further compounded the problem, and the damaged environment was ideal to initiate the production of plugging FeS and biomass in the near wellbore region. Ultimately, the formation was not able to deliver the necessary flow rate to supply the ESP pump when the well was returned to production.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The damage mechanism is a combination of polymer residue, biomass and FeS plugging the screen liner. A three-stage treatment was designed to remove the damaging material. The first stage was based on tetrakishydroxy methyl phosphonium sulfate (THPS) and was designed to remove iron sulfide and hydrogen sulfide, and control the growth of bacteria. The second stage was based on formic acid and was intended to remove FeS and some of the polymer residue in the near wellbore area. The third stage was based on a two-part oxidative treatment and was designed to remove polymer damage deep in the formation. Analysis of well flowback samples before and after the treatments was used to confirm the damaging mechanisms and to evaluate the treatment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper reviews the procedure used to identify the problem, and the unique treatment which successfully restored well productivity.</jats:p>",

The operator of the thermal spray equipment is responsible for ensuring that sufficient gas quantities are available at all times, comparable to the logistics involved in spray material management. Linde is now offering a fully automatic gas supply concept, including everything from consultancy and installation, through to the types of gases which can be used. The customer can therefore choose to manage his stocks himself as before, or to have the gas delivered and the bundles replaced by the supplier.

To gain insight into the regulation of this process, we investigated capillary supply and gene expression of angiogenesis‐related factors in mouse gastrocnemius muscle following denervation for 4 months. Frozen transverse sections were stained for alkaline phosphatase to detect endogenous enzyme in the capillary endothelium. The mRNA for angiogenesis‐related factors, including hypoxia inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), kinase insert domain‐containing receptor/fetal liver kinase‐1 (KDR/Flk‐1), fms‐like tyrosine kinase (Flt‐1), angiopoietin‐1 and tyrosine kinase with Ig and epidermal growth factor(EGF) homology domain 2 (Tie‐2), was analysed using a semi‐quantitative reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR). The fibre cross‐sectional area after denervation was about 20% of the control value, and the capillary to fibre ratio was significantly lower in denervated than in control muscles. The number of capillaries around each fibre also decreased to about 40% of the control value. These observations suggest that muscle capillarity decreases in response to chronic denervation. RT‐PCR analysis showed that the expression of VEGF mRNA was lower in denervated than in control muscles, while the expression of HIF‐1α mRNA remained unchanged. The expression levels of the KDR/Flk‐1 and Flt‐1 genes were decreased in the denervated muscle. The expression levels of angiopoietin‐1 but not Tie‐2 genes were decreased in the denervated muscle. These findings indicate that reduction in the expression of mRNAs in the VEGF/KDR/Flk‐1 and Flt‐1 as well as angiopoietin‐1/Tie‐2 signal pathways might be one of the reasons for the capillary regression during chronic denervation.</jats:bold></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper findings are presented from survey work conducted with producers of specialist livestock products in the Scottish–English borders. Using supply-chain diagrams, the paper highlights how specialist livestock businesses operate individual or customised supply chains. The heterogeneity of surveyed producer initiatives throws into question both the simple conceptual distinction drawn between the labels ‘conventional’ and ‘alternative’ and also what is meant by a ‘short’ food supply chain. The starting point of the specialist food chain is clearly not the point of production but rather a series of upstream supply links—as is found in conventional food chains. Likewise, ‘alternative’ producers are regularly obliged, or choose, to ‘dip in and out’ of different conventional nodes downstream of the business, such as abattoirs, processors, and wholesalers. In practice, delimitations between ‘alternative’ and ‘conventional’ food supply chains are often blurred and are better characterised as ‘hybrid spaces’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Losses due to gate-leakage-currents become more dominant in new technologies as gate leakage currents increase exponentially with decreasing gate oxide thickness. The most promising Adiabatic Logic (AL) families use a clocked power supply with four states. Hence, the full VDD voltage drops over an AL gate only for a quarter of the clock cycle, causing a full gate leakage only for a quarter of the clock period. The rising and falling ramps of the clocked power supply lead to an additional energy consumption by gate leakage. This energy is smaller than the fraction caused by the constant VDD drop, because the gate leakage exponentially depends on the voltage across the oxide. To obtain smaller energy consumption, Improved Adiabatic Logic (IAL) has been introduced. IAL swaps all n- and p-channel transistors. The logic blocks are built of p-channel devices which show gate tunneling currents significantly smaller than in n-channel devices. Using IAL instead of conventional AL allows an additional reduction of the energy consumption caused by gate leakage. Simulations based on a 90nm CMOS process show a lowering in gate leakage energy consumption for AL by a factor of 1.5 compared to static CMOS. For IAL the factor is up to 4. The achievable reduction varies depending on the considered AL family and the complexity of the gate.\n                    </jats:p>"

The production of cyanobacterial hepatotoxins (microcystins) and their presence in drinking and recreational waters represent a growing danger to human and animal health. Risk management deals with the probability that a certain exposure to toxins will lead to specific health outcomes. Various model schemes for risk management have been portrayed, most of which have some common elements. These include the need for an information base on which to make decisions. Thus, seasonal variability in the concentrations of total microcystins and cyanobacterial cells was studied in two reservoirs: San Roque and Paso de las Piedras. Both reservoirs are eutrophic water bodies and mainly used to supply drinking water and for recreation. Because San Roque is an important recreational spot, the spatial distribution of microcystins was also investigated. Sampling of the San Roque Reservoir occurred from 1998 to 2000 and of the Paso de las Piedras Reservoir from June to December 2002 (late autumn, winter, and spring). Microcystins were identified by LC‐MS, and their concentrations were measured using the enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay. These hepatotoxic compounds were detected in all seasons, and even during winter relatively high concentrations were observed. Concentrations in the San Roque Reservoir varied from undetectable to 920 μg/L. On the contrary, in the Paso de las Piedras Reservoir the concentration remained below 1 μg/L, which is the provisional guideline value proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO; Chorus and Bartram, <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib4\">1999</jats:ext-link>) for microcystin‐LR in drinking water. Comparison of cell number and concentration of total microcystins indicated that the phytoplankton in San Roque Reservoir contained more toxic cyanobacterial strains than did the Paso de las Piedras Reservoir. This indicates that the threshold of 2000 cell/mL proposed by WHO as a alert level should be adjusted: it should be reduced for the San Roque Reservoir, whereas it seems appropriate for the Paso de la Piedras Reservoir. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Taking larvae density into account, no other environmental variable (inferred predation pressure, breeding phenology, and summer temperature) was significantly related to variation in reproductive output. There was no effect of brambling population density on per capita productivity, that is, when density was measured the conventional way, productivity seemed density‐independent. However, per capita productivity was significantly and negatively correlated to the food‐related population density (population density divided by larval density), supporting the hypothesis that not including a limiting resource into the density measure may indeed lead to erroneous conclusions about the density‐dependence of demographic variables.</jats:p>",

The response of four apple cultivars ('Elstar', 'Gala Prince', 'Granny Smith', 'Idared') to different nitrogen dosages was studied. The assessed and calculated indices were: yield, fruit diameter, fruit height, shape index, fruit mass, firmness, dry matter content and colouration. The results indicated that nitrogen fertilization has a significant effect on the yield and fruit quality of apple cultivars. The calculated specific yield values were reduced by the application of nitrogen via the increase in the volume of the canopy. An opposit trend was observed for fruit diameter, fruit height and fruit weight, which increased with increasing nitrogen supply. The reduced shape index caused flattening of fruits.&#x0D;\nHowever, the improvement of fruit quality via increasing nitrogen dosage is only virtual, since these dosages increase the fruit size, but firmness, dry matter content and colouration are diminished, which decreases the value of the fruits on the market.&#x0D;\nThe authors also studied the relationships between canopy density responsible for assimilation and light supply of the fruits and the different fruit quality parameters. The closest linear inversely proportional relationship was found in the case of colouration. There was a negative linear relationship between canopy density and firmness or dry matter content. The relationship between canopy density and fruit mass could be described by a quadratic polinomial function.</jats:p>"

Diameters were measured 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days after resection of one of the two blood supplies to the artery. Overall average diameter, normalized with respect to diameters in untreated vessels, increased slightly during the first 7 days, then increased more rapidly, reaching a peak around day 21, and then decreased. This transient increase in diameter was spatially nonuniform, being largest toward the point of resection. A previously developed theoretical model, in which diameter varies in response to stimuli derived from local metabolic and hemodynamic conditions, was extended to include effects of time-delayed remodeling stimuli in regions of reduced perfusion. Predictions of this model were consistent with observed diameter changes, including the transient increase in diameters near the point of resection, when a remodeling stimulus with a time delay of ∼7 days was included. The results suggest that delayed stimuli significantly influence the dynamic characteristics of vascular remodeling resulting from reduced blood supply.</jats:p>",

The liver is the main source of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The importance of IGF signal in hepatic metastasis has been clarified mainly by IGF-I receptor targeting strategies. This study aims to confirm these precedent reports by novel tool, neutralizing antibodies against IGFs and to show that IGFs are promising therapeutic targets for hepatic metastasis in vivo. Hepatic metastasis was induced by intrasplenic injection of human colorectal cancer cell line, HT29. The antimetastatic effects of three antibodies (anti-mouse IGF-I, anti-mouse IGF-II, and anti-human/mouse IGF-II designated KM1468) were tested singly or in combination in the early phase of metastasis. The dose escalation effect of KM1468 and its survival benefit were examined in the early and late phases of metastasis. The mechanism of IGF neutralization was investigated with immunohistochemistry. Dual neutralization of paracrine IGF-I and IGF-II showed modest additive antimetastatic effects than single neutralization of IGF-I or IGF-II. In any phase of metastasis, neutralization led to significant tumor growth inhibition and longer survival. Dose escalation of KM1468 influenced survival only in the late phase of metastasis. Apoptosis increased significantly in the antibody-treated group compared with the control group (P = 0.0025) In conclusion, IGFs are promising therapeutic targets for hepatic metastases of colorectal cancers. However, the IGF dependency is probably variable in the metastatic process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Dietary ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) influences the expression of a number of genes in the brain. Zinc transporter (ZnT) 3 has been identified as a putative transporter of zinc into synaptic vesicles of neurons and is found in brain areas such as hippocampus and cortex. Neuronal zinc is involved in the formation of amyloid plaques, a major characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. The present study evaluated the influence of dietary ω-3 PUFA on the expression of the\n            <jats:italic>ZnT3</jats:italic>\n            gene in the brains of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were raised and/or maintained on a control (CON) diet that contained ω-3 PUFA or a diet deficient (DEF) in ω-3 PUFA.\n            <jats:italic>ZnT3</jats:italic>\n            gene expression was analyzed by using real-time PCR, free zinc in brain tissue was determined by zinquin staining, and total zinc concentrations in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Compared with CON-raised animals, DEF-raised animals had increased expression of\n            <jats:italic>ZnT3</jats:italic>\n            in the brain that was associated with an increased level of free zinc in the hippocampus. In addition, compared with CON-raised animals, DEF-raised animals had decreased plasma zinc level. No difference in cerebrospinal fluid zinc level was observed. The results suggest that overexpression of\n            <jats:italic>ZnT3</jats:italic>\n            due to a perinatal ω-3 PUFA deficiency caused abnormal zinc metabolism in the brain. Conceivably, the influence of dietary ω-3 PUFA on brain zinc metabolism could explain the observation made in population studies that the consumption of fish is associated with a reduced risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\n          </jats:p>",

NR activity was assessed in leaf and root extracts by measuring the activity of the unphosphorylated active form (NR<jats:sub>act</jats:sub>), the maximal extractable activity (NR<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) and the activation state. To obtain an insight into potential signalling compounds, nitrate, free amino acids and soluble sugars were also quantified. In both species, foliar NR<jats:sub>act</jats:sub> and NR<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> were negatively affected by soil drying and a decreased supply of nutrients, the observed changes in NR activity being linearly correlated with the depletion of nitrate. Similar results were obtained in the roots of sunflower. Conversely, in white lupin roots, NR<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> was found to be independent of tissue nitrate concentration. Regardless of the species and organ, the activation state of the enzyme was unaffected by the nutrient supply regime. In well‐watered sunflower roots, only about 50% of the existing NR was unphosphorylated, but the activation state increased significantly in response to drought. In contrast, lupin roots always exhibited NR activation state values close to 80%, or even higher. At the leaf level, the NR activation state was hardly changed in response to soil drying. The observed changes in the concentrations of soluble sugars and free amino acids are discussed in terms of their possible contribution to the variations in NR activity.</jats:p>",
