It finds that even though exploration and discovery of new deposits account for part of the tremendous postwar expansion in the level and geographic distribution of iron ore and bauxite production, most of the areas that became major producers were known to contain significant mineralization long before detailed evaluation, development, and mining occurred. These areas needed increased consumer demand, lower ocean freight costs, or improved processing techniques to become economically attractive. Iron and aluminum are easier‐to‐find yet harder‐to‐process, and compared with other metals, discovering a better deposit will not reduce overall costs to the same degree as other cost‐reducing forms of investment.</jats:p>",

By supplying urea to the thallus, a urease is induced to produce carbon dioxide and ammonia from urea. However, the increase in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> availability does not lead to an increase in the concentration of photosynthates, since the ratio of mannitol to glucose decreases to a third of its initial value.

In their comments, T. W. Hill and G. L. Siscoe contend that explosive magnetic reconnection “is strongly supported by relevant theoretical arguments. . .,” while C. T. Russell states that “existing models do not require” explosive magnetic reconnection. It is worth mentioning that both refer to the same near‐earth X line models! Hill and Siscoe consider that the book edited by Hones [1984] presents evidence for their view. On the other hand, in the same book, Axford [1984] noted that “. . .it is fair to say that Akasofu might be right, in a certain sense, in claiming that the magnetosphere is basically a driven system.”</jats:p>",

Ten min after occlusion, nifedipine‐treated animals were given either a low or high dose of the drug: a 5 μg/kg bolus followed by 1 μg/kg per min infusion or a 10 μg/kg bolus and 10 μg/kg per min infusion, respectively. Regional blood flow was measured before and after occlusion using radioactive microspheres and O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation was measured microspectrophotometrically; the Fick Principle was then employed to determine regional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption.</jats:p><jats:p>3. After a 60 min occlusion, blood flow was reduced overall to 51% of pre‐ligation flows in the occluded region, and treatment with nifedipine or vehicle did not significantly alter this flow reduction.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Blood flow in nonoccluded regions increased 1.6‐fold only with the high dose of nifedipine and was unchanged in all other groups.</jats:p><jats:p>5.

In 14 open-chest anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded to 50% of base-line flow, and in half of the dogs the hearts were paced to 50% above base-line heart rate. Blood flows were determined by use of microspheres before and after occlusion, and O2 supply-consumption variables were determined by use of microspectrophotometry. After occlusion in control and paced groups, blood flow was depressed in the ischemic region compared with the nonischemic region. In paced animals, blood flows in all regions were significantly higher compared with their respective values in nonpaced animals. After pacing, mean O2 consumption was 34% higher (53% in the occluded region) compared with control animals. The O2 supply-to-consumption ratio was similar in the occluded region of paced animals compared with the same region in controls. This ratio was lower in ischemic regions of both groups compared with their respective nonischemic regions. This indicates that, despite a reduced O2 supply-to-consumption ratio in the ischemic area, an unutilized reserve of flow exists. </jats:p>",

Neither is the magnetospheric substorm “almost exclusively discussed in terms of hypothetical explosive reconnection,” nor is it “only recently that the input‐output relationship of the magnetosphere has been examined.” The question posed by Akasofu, “Is explosive magnetic reconnection. . .the primary energy supply process for substorms or. . .an unworkable hypothesis,” attacks a straw man of Akasofu's own design. In the process of attacking this straw man, Akasofu confuses the energization of the magnetosphere as a whole with the energization of magnetospheric substorms and ignores the fact that his present model is essentially in complete accord with the original near‐tail reconnection model for substorms [cf. McPherron et al, 1973; Russell and McPherron, 1973]. Since Akasofu claims that misdirection in substorm research has been occurring for 2 decades, we briefly review the history of the reconnection model for magnetospheric energization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is in magnetospheric physics today a controversy of sorts, involving the nature of the process by which the kinetic energy of the solar wind is tapped to power magnetospheric phenomena and related geomagnetic disturbances. The controversy is conveniently described in the language of signal processing [Akasofu, 1985]: an input signal composed of a suitable combination of solar wind variables is processed by the magnetosphere to produce an output signal consisting of a suitable combination of geomagnetic activity indices and/or magnetospheric variables. Akasofu advocates the view that the output signal, when properly measured, is a linear function of the input signal, and that the magnetosphere is therefore “directly driven” (i.e., it responds passively, after a fixed time lag, to a given solar wind energy input). In the alternative view the magnetosphere plays a more active role: the system response depends not only on incident solar wind variables (allowing a suitable time lag) but also on the recent dynamical history of the system. This second view is described by Akasofu as the “unloading” scenario because it corresponds to a physical model in which solar wind kinetic energy is collected and stored temporarily in the magnetic field of the magnetospheric tail and is subsequently— in a manner determined at least in part by internal magnetospheric processes—“ unloaded” to the ionosphere and inner magnetosphere to produce readily observable geomagnetic effects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This letter concerns the lead article by S.‐I. Akasofu in the January 8, 1985, Eos, concerning the lack of evidence that explosive magnetic reconnection plays a major role in auroral substorms. Akasofu's [1985] article also mentions the likely inapplicability of explosive reconnection to solar flares. I concur with this view. The primary instability responsible for solar flares seems to be located in the low‐temperature part of the chromosphere, as evidenced by the intimate association of chromospheric surges with solar flares. Based on a study by Schmahl [1981], Rust and Hildner [1980] state that surges may be associated with all flares. This conclusion is in agreement with visual Ha observations by E. T. Byram (Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, D.C.) in 1969 (unpublished), in which he found a surge associated with every disk flare he observed.</jats:p>",
