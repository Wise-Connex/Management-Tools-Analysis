In order to integrate different suppliers and send parts packages to production line directly, Supply-Hub is used in practice. Queuing theory and basic inventory strategy are applied to model inventory control of assembly manufacturing supply chain with Supply-Hub mode. And optimization solution for decentralized decision and centralized decision were derived separately. Then coordination inventory strategy is obtained by comparing decentralized decision and centralized decision. Backorder and holding cost subsidy contracts are used for coordination that incites suppliers to set basic inventories in favor of whole supply chain operation cost reduction. And numerical examples of three suppliers and one manufacturer are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the coordination strategy.</jats:p>"

However, the application of the research methodology, and in particular of the citation network analysis, requires the support of specific computer programs. Moreover, the underlying assumption of the citation network analysis is that, by analysing the network of citations made to and from articles, it is possible to explain the flows of knowledge used to generate new results. This is only partially true since the spread of measures based on impact assessment led many researchers to an excessive use of citations, even if their content is not always decisive for the outcome of their work.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The present paper outlines a research agenda that may facilitate the development of models for managing supply chain risk. Furthermore from the evidence of the performed literature review some managerial insights can be derived on how to manage supply chain risk: by considering uncertainty in the design of supply chains, by understanding the impact of risks arising from network collaboration and interactions between supply chain partners, by developing proactive mitigation capabilities to hedge the increasing level of risk.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The novelty of this research lies in the combination of two existing methodologies for reviewing the literature and in the adoption of a dynamic perspective in order to analyse theory development.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

While the literature is disparate, across different disciplines there is good support for these enablers. The relationships between supply chain alignment and shareholder and customer value are also argued with the support of the literature. Although each of the enablers is argued to positively affect shareholder and customer value, their interactions with one another are not well supported in the literature, either theoretically or empirically, and therefore this could be an area for further research.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>While the hypotheses remain theoretical, it is now possible to test them and understand the relative significance of the various enablers to alignment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The significance of shareholder and customer alignment on the delivery of shareholder and customer value can be examined, thus moving towards a theory of supply chain alignment.

Previous economic studies, focusing on demand side, find that the equilibrium demand is always less than the socially optimal demand because self-interested individuals do not internalize the social benefit of protecting others via reduced infectiousness (positive externality). In contrast, we show that the equilibrium demand can be greater than the socially optimal demand after accounting for the limited supply due to yield uncertainty and manufacturer's incentives. The main driver for this result is a second (negative) externality: Self-interested individuals ignore that vaccinating people with high infection costs is more beneficial for the society when supply is limited. We show that the extent of the negative externality can be reduced through more efficient and less uncertain allocation mechanisms. To investigate the relative effectiveness of government interventions on supply and demand sides under various demand and supply characteristics, we construct two partially centralized scenarios where the social planner (i.e., government) intervenes either on the demand side or the supply side, but not both. We conduct an extensive numerical analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite a professed commitment to free trade, Canada has retained a staunchly protectionist supply management regime in several agricultural sectors, notably in the dairy industry. Canada’s dairy farms are governed by a system that prices milk based on intended usage, locks out most foreign products with exorbitantly high tariffs and even determines how much farmers can produce — in other words, a cartel. Everyone suffers. Canadians are forced to pay twice the amount for four litres of whole milk as Americans, while the farmers are barred from taking advantage of the opportunities and efficiencies a truly free market affords. At the same time, Canada’s insistence on protecting supply management makes it difficult for Canada to open up access to international markets. This means that all other Canadian enterprises that rely on trade (including the farmers in the non-supply-managed sectors who make up by far the majority of Canadian farmers) — all those who would benefit from Canadian participation in trade arrangements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, are being denied lucrative access to some of the world’s largest and rapidly growing markets. The system needs to go. However, it is possible to dismantle it fairly. Australia managed it by offering dairy farmers transition payments over eight years, financed by a temporary retail levy on milk, which was still less than what consumers were paying under protection. Consumers now enjoy lower prices and Australia has one of the most dynamic and efficient dairy industries in the world. New Zealand did away with its own tariffs and subsidies even faster, and its dairy sector has become that country’s largest export earner. The potential gains for Canada are very real. At the same time, and, just as importantly, the threats to risk-averse politicians from the dairy lobby are, contrary to widely-held assumptions, negligible. Since 1971, the number of Canadian dairy farms has dropped by a staggering 91 percent. There are now few, if any, ridings where dairy votes could plausibly swing elections — particularly compared to the votes of all those in those same ridings who would benefit from dismantling supply management. This paper assesses Canada’s political, agricultural and economic landscape, highlights the problems with the present regime, challenges long-held political assumptions, and draws on lessons learned from the most successful reforms abroad to make the case for liberalizing the Canadian dairy industry. With lucrative free trade agreements being considered, and in particular the prospect of joining (or being refused access to) the Trans-Pacific Partnership, now is the time for the Harper government to reach out to the provinces and farmers, and move away from supply management for the good of all Canadians.</jats:p>"

A hierarchical-game based negotiation protocol is proposed. It is a three-layer game. Nash game is used to find the optimal trade partnership to maximize the whole profits of the SCN (Supplier Chain Network) in the first layer. The second layer games are aimed to find all possible coalitions if the order is out of the ability of MSA and determine the final coalitions of each MSA for each MA using cooperative games. The third layer games are used to determine the final strategies between MAs and MSAs or all possible coalitions found in the second layer games. Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced to resolve the conflict of interests of the two sides. The first layer game is based on the results of the second and third layer games. The second and third layer games are nested inside the first layer game. Simulations and analysis are provided to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed protocol.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Improving existing drinking water supply services in developing countries depends crucially on available financial resources. Cost recovery rates of these services are typically low, while demand for more reliable services is high and rapidly growing. Most stated preference based demand studies in the developing world apply the contingent valuation method and focus on rural areas. This study examines the willingness of households to pay for improved water supply services employing a choice model (CM) in an urban area in Ethiopia, a country with the lowest water supply coverage in Sub-Saharan Africa. The design of the choice model allows the estimation of the values of both drinking water reliability and safety. The estimated economic values can be used in policy appraisals of investment decisions. Despite significant income constraints, households are willing to pay up to 60% extra for improved levels of water supply over and above their current water bill, especially households living in the poorest part of the city with the lowest service levels. Women value the improvement of water quality most, while a significant effect is found for averting behavior and expenditures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Full coverage effusion cooling was studied for a square array of 90° effusion cooling holes with backside cooling using a 5 mm duct air supply to the coolant holes. Active cooling was used with metal walls and 300K effusion cooling into a 27 m/s mean velocity duct flow at 770K crossflow temperature. The 152 mm square test section had 15 rows of holes and the hole diameter, D, was varied for constant hole pitch, X. The X/D values studied were 11.0, 7.0 and 4.6. At a constant coolant mass flow rate the wall pressure loss was reduced as X/D was reduced and there was an associated reduction in the film blowing ratio, M. The duct air feed to the holes enhanced the backside cooling of the wall. These results were compared with previous work using a plenum chamber air feed. The increased duct air feed velocity relative to the plenum low velocity air feed resulted in an increase in the overall cooling effectiveness due to the additional heat transfer by the duct crossflow velocity. However, the trailing edge cooling effectiveness improvement was small as there was no residual cross flow here and the greatest effect was at the leading edge of the test wall. The decrease in X/D was the most effective way of increasing the overall cooling effectiveness as this reduced the blowing rate without decreasing the coolant mass flow rate. This was more effective than using 30° inclined holes with an X/D of 11, as the hole exit velocity was much lower for the same coolant mass flow rate with 90°holes at an X/D of 4.8 than with 30°holes at an X/D of 11.0.</jats:p>",

The constant issue at stake is the inability of projects to satisfactorily meet agreed delivery targets. In order to address this quagmire, performance improvement tools such as supply chain management (SCM) were introduced into the industry. The central theme of this discourse is thus concerned with the need to promote performance improvement in construction through the exploitation of the concepts inherent in SCM from the perspectives of lean construction researchers as documented in the annual International Group for Lean Construction (IGLC) conferences. The methodological approach adopted for the discourse is qualitative in nature as recent SCM literatures available on the IGLC web portal were subjected to a qualitative content analysis. The research outcomes, which have implications for South African construction, attempt to offer solutions to the mirage of performance-related project management and/or supply chain problems, especially in terms of improving ‘how organisations working together’ overcome complexities and deliver value to stakeholders.</jats:p>"

The blood system counts with 555 blood banks and 4,342 transfusion services. 25% of the blood banks belong to the Ministry of Health, 15% to the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) and 10% to the Institute of Security and Social Services for State Workers (ISSSTE), the blood banks of the Ministry of Defense, Navy and “Petroleos Mexicanos” constitute only 3% and more than 40% are private. Only 31 of them collect more than 10,000 units/year, 64 have an annually average collection between 10,000 and 5,000 and 101 collect over 2,000 and less than 5,000; 70% of the blood banks participated in the external quality control program. In 2011 the total country collection was 1,698,124 blood units, with an average increase of 50,000/year. PAHO’s rate of blood donors for every 10,000 inhabitants in Mexico is 148, indicating self‐sufficiency, but only 2·38% is obtained from voluntary blood donors. The IMSS collects more than 40% of the blood in country; but 99·7% is obtained by replacement donors. The frequency of transfusion transmission infectious diseases in blood donors was for HIV 0·31%, HBV 0·20%, HCV 0·60%, syphilis 0·47%, Chagas’s disease 0·46% and brucellosis 0·39%. The analyzed results highlight the need to promote voluntary blood donation, regionalization of blood services and to increase the participation in external quality programs in order to reduce the risks associated to blood transfusions in Mexico. The Ministry of Health promotes voluntary blood donations through external collects in universities, enterprises and embassies obtaining good responds. The “National Policy of Use of Blood and Blood Components” from 1993, was reviewed and updated including a mandatory establishment of a quality system based in GMP′s, participation in external quality programs, voluntary blood donation promotion, evaluation of the performance services information and hemovigilance reports.</jats:p>",

The project ADAPTACLIMA, promoted by EPAL, the largest Portuguese Water Supply Utility, aims to provide the company with an adaptation strategy in the medium and long term to reduce the vulnerabilities of its activities to climate change. We used the special report emissions scenarios (SRES) of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to produce local scenarios of water use. Available population SRES for Portugal were downscaled to the study area using a linear approach. Local land use scenarios were produced using the following steps: (1) characterization of the present land use for each municipality of the study area using Corine Land Cover and adapt the CLC classes to those used in the SRES; (2) identification of recent tendencies in land use change for the study area; (3) identification of SRES tendencies for land use change in Europe; and (4) production of local scenarios of land use. Water use scenarios were derived considering both population and land use scenarios as well as scenarios of change in other parameters (technological developments, increases in efficiency, climate changes, or political and behavioural changes).  The A2 scenario forecasts an increase in population (+16%) in the study area while the other scenarios show a reduction of resident population (−6 to 8%). All scenarios, but especially A1, show a significant reduction in agricultural area and an increase in urban area. Regardless of the scenario, water use will progressively be reduced until 2100. These reductions are mainly due to increased water use efficiency and reduction of irrigated land. The results concord with several projects modelling water use at regional and global level.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work presents the results of a study completed in the Hotel Industry, in the city of Natal, Brazil. Natal receives more than 2 million visitors per year and is also one of the cities with the largest numbers of tourist vacancies in the country, approximately 23,000. The objective of this work is to analyze the level of guest satisfaction from the gaps existing between the expectations and the perception of service received at hotels. Through questionnaires, 1440 guests from 6 hotels of the hotel network, falling into tourist categories, superior and luxury. The sample plan established two collection phases; the first in which guests were interviewed before checking into the hotel and secondly at check out. The study revealed that the majority of respondents traveled by airplane and came with tourism as their objective. The results suggest that there was a slight difference in the ranking of attributes, whether by category, or by hotel. The Spearman test confirmed that the expectations of the guests did not change significantly when the category of the hotel was changed. In the general evaluation by guests, from the gaps calculated, in thirteen of the attributes the performance of the hotels surpassed customer expectations.</jats:p>"

This study empirically examines the impact that the shortage of fuel, a commonly encountered problem in many disaster situations, can have on the effectiveness of disaster‐relief logistics operations. We focus on investigating the following two issues: (1) whether the shortage of fuel is more damaging in attaining logistical goals than the equivalent‐sized shortage in emergency supplies themselves, and (2) what types of vehicles should be used when the fuel supply is limited. Results suggest that the shortage of fuel may be more damaging than the shortage of emergency supplies, and that smaller trucks may be preferred to larger trucks when the shortage of fuel becomes severe.</jats:p>",

We also find evidence of a significant fall in supply elasticity between 1991–1996 and 2001–2006. When the median time taken by a local council to decide on a development application is included in the supply curve, it is found to have a negative effect on the supply of residential property. However, split‐sample estimates indicate this effect is largely confined to the 1991–1996 period.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Causes of these declines are still unclear but the loss of habitat quality across the wider countryside is thought to be a major factor. Nectar supply constitutes one of the main resources determining habitat quality. Yet, data on changes in nectar abundance are lacking. In this study, we provide the first analysis of changes in floral nectar abundance on a national scale and link these data to trends in butterfly species richness and abundance. We used transect data from the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme to compare two time periods: 1994-1995 and 2007-2008. The results show that butterfly decline can indeed be linked to a substantial decline in overall flower abundance and specific nectar plants, such as thistles. The decline is as severe in reported flower generalists as in flower specialists. We suggest that eutrophication is a main cause of the decline of nectar sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One major characteristic of studies in operations and supply chain management literature is a focus on how integration can lead to superior operations and manufacturing outcomes. Most of these studies, however, focus only on internal or external integration and few have been dedicated to understand how both internal and external integration influence performance outcomes. In addition, few studies, if any, have looked to the antecedents of organizational structure as a driver for such forms of integration. To help filling this gap, we draw on organizational structure and resource-based view theoretical perspectives to present a conceptual model that proposes a relationship between organizational structure and integration. The model also considers major antecedents of organizational structure and the manufacturing performance consequences of integration. As a result, we introduce a series of propositions to be subject to empirical scrutiny as well as serve as a reference for future conceptual and empirical models.</jats:p>"

Many wooden furnitureindustries in Indonesia, especially in Central Java Province face problems related to the sustainability. The relationbetween wood suppliers and furniture industry is studied in this paper. A sustainable supply chain management (s-SCM) model is proposed as an approach for solutions for the problems. The approach is chosen due to the characteristics of the problems that related to economic, social, and environmental problems. This aim of this paper is to determine how much supply teak wood must be provided by PP to satisfy furniture industry demand, how much production capacity that must be increased and how large forest area that must be planted in order to achieve environmental and social goals without sacrificing economical goals much. Goal programming (GP) is chosen for solving the problems, because the goals are to maximize the total benefit,minimize the total loss and anticipate the conflicts between goals. Numerical trial based on observation in teak wooden furniture industry in Central Java was used to illustrate our findings. Using pareto efficient principle, the model can satisfy all goals that need to be achieved. Numerical results can be used by decision makers in teak wood industry to analyze the trade-off among several set of alternative solutions.</jats:p>"

A method proposed by Roeger (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#agr21301-bib-0023\" />) is used to estimate monopoly and monopsony market power, relaxing the assumptions of perfect competition and constant returns to scale, and avoiding any endogeneity issues. The results obtained indicate that foreign investments and consolidation have a positive and significant impact on food processors’ and retailers’ mark‐ups. Food processors, agricultural producers, and wholesalers have lower price‐cost margins than retailers, whereas retailers exert monopsonistic power in the upstream food market as well. The results are robust for various estimation techniques and specifications.</jats:p>",

Conventional wisdom based on studies in the 1980s and 1990s has long held that the analysis of micro data leads one to conclude that aggregate labor supply elasticities are quite small. In this paper we argue that this conventional wisdom does not hold up to empirically reasonable and relevant extensions of simple life cycle models that served as the basis for these conclusions. In particular, we show that several pieces of conventional wisdom fail in the presence of human capital accumulation or labor supply decisions that allow for adjustment along both the extensive and intensive margin. We conclude that previous estimates of small labor supply elasticities based on micro data are fully consistent with large aggregate labor supply elasticities. (JEL D91, E24, J22) </jats:p>",

Eng. Gas Turbines Power, 127, pp. 843–855). The results from CFD simulations follow the experimental data. Leakage performance is underpredicted by up to 19.8%. Direct and cross-coupled stiffness coefficients are in reasonable agreement with the measurements. However, predicted cross-coupled stiffness increases slower with increasing preswirl ratio than the experimental cross-coupled stiffness. Direct damping is also in agreement with the measured values with the exception of the high preswirl ratio at 20200 rpm. Cross-coupled damping reveals the largest deviations between predictions and experiments. Additionally, the coefficient of determination is calculated for all experimental rotordynamic coefficients to estimate the goodness of fit for the raw test data.</jats:p>",

The statute is applicable to both goods and services but the provisions on services are very important because previously the laws regulating the supply of services seem to be left behind compared to those regulating goods. The aim of this paper is to examine the relevant provisions of the CPA and make a comparative study with the protection available under the Islamic law of muʿāmalāt. The central discussions are on section 53, section 54 and Part IX of the CPA since they deal specifically with the supply of services. The liabilities of the service providers are scrutinised as well as consumers’ rights of redress </jats:p>"

Based on the specific chip L6561, the novel single-ended flyback AC/DC converting circuit is adapted for mobile or office equipment, off-line battery chargers.

Napjaink pénzpiaci és reálgazdasági válságának hatásaként még fokozottabban jelentkezik az igény a változásra, változtatásra nemcsak a szervezetek, de az egyén szintjén is. Ahhoz azonban, hogy a változtatás lehetséges útjai, módjai közül megalapozottan lehessen választani, nemcsak a kívánatos cél kitűzésére, de a kiinduló állapot minél precízebb meghatározására is szükség van. Jelen cikkükben a szerzők egyrészt azokról az eredményekről számolnak be, amelyek az egyetemi hallgatók „vágyott” munkahelyének szervezeti kultúráját, és ennek kapcsolatát a tényleges piaci kínálattal mutatják be. Másrészt egy közszolgáltató cég példáján a munkavállalók szervezeti kultúrára vonatkozó vágyai és a valóság kapcsolatával foglalkoznak. _____ The aim of the authors is to review and examine the gap between the aspirations and reality regarding organizational culture of those already employed and those seeking employment. These days the financial and real economic crisis generated an increased demand for change on the part of organizations as well as individuals. However, in order to map the possibilities for change and formulate a well-founded decision on which alternative to adopt it is essential to define the starting point and to set clear aims. Present article outlines the research results of the aspirations of university students regarding the organizational culture of their possible future workplaces and how they can be related to the reality of labor market supply. Furthermore, by providing the case of a public utility company, the aspirations of employees regarding organizational culture and the way it relates to reality is also presented.</jats:p>",

On the other side, these firms are confronted with a strong retail sector that is able to prevent compensation to protect consumers’ and own economic interests. Regulatory impediments of European law, especially with respect to foodstuffs, can adversely be utilized as barriers to protect the interest downstream the supply chain. The problem is that legal-economic instruments which can serve to smooth price volatility in supply markets can also opportunistically be used at the expense of the middlesection in food supply chains (i.e., mainly small and medium sized producers). The aim of this article is to identify the legal-economic mechanisms that effect price transfers in food supply chains in the European Union and define policy adjustments to improve pricing mechanisms, while safeguarding the interests of the processing industry. Policy alternatives to improve the smooth functioning of notably intermediate markets in food supply chains are the restructuring of competition law, improved processor information management and creating transparency of value added in the supply chain by means of labelling devices.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Larval supply, settlement (24 h), and recruitment were measured simultaneously with flow and flocculated particulates (flocs) in a muddy, coastal embayment. Fortuitous observations indicated that flocs drifting above the bed touched down at slack tide. Unexpectedly, results showed that larval supply did not portend settlement for the two most abundant polychaetes, <jats:italic>Mediomastus ambiseta</jats:italic> (resident mud dweller) and <jats:italic>Sabellaria vulgaris</jats:italic> (nonresident sand dweller). Both variables fluctuated widely and were decoupled. Colonization of mud vs. sand trays was not significantly different, also due to high variances. A statistical power analysis indicated that resolving selectivity would require 45 (median) paired, replicate treatments. Time series of near‐bed planktonic larvae showed sizeable and sporadic spikes. Even 24‐h means failed to predict settlement. <jats:italic>Sabellaria</jats:italic> was numerous in zooplankton pump collections, rare in trays, and nonexistent in ambient sediments. In contrast, <jats:italic>Mediomastus</jats:italic> was absent from pump samples, but dominated mud trays and bottom cores. Floc contents, however, lend insight into these distributions. Densities (of order 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>) of <jats:italic>Sabellaria</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Mediomastus</jats:italic> in flocs greatly exceeded those in tray and pump samples (of order 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). Located between the water column and seafloor, organic‐rich flocs may offer transient larvae food, shelter, transport, and perusal of settlement sites. When aggregates touch down, entrained <jats:italic>Mediomastus</jats:italic> might exit upon contact with suitable ambient sediments, whereas nonresident <jats:italic>Sabellaria</jats:italic> remain suspended. Flocs may thus play a critical role in shaping connectivity and structuring species distributions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Sediment supply is widely held to be one of the primary controls on bar topography in alluvial channels, yet quantitative linkages between sediment supply and bar topography are not well developed. We explore the conditions under which alternate bars form and how they respond to the elimination of sediment supply in two linked laboratory experiments. The first set of experiments was conducted in a 28 m long, 0.86 m wide flume channel using a unimodal sand‐gravel mix. The second set of experiments was conducted at field scale in a 55 m long, 2.74 m wide channel using a unimodal gravel mixture. In both experiments, alternate bars and patchy surface grain‐size distributions developed under steady flow and sediment supply conditions. The cessation of the sediment supply induced a reduction in the surface grain‐size heterogeneity and the bars were eliminated. In both flumes, mean boundary shear stress had declined, but were capable of moving sediments after the bars disappeared, albeit at relatively small rates compared to when the bars were present. In the smaller flume, the previously stationary bars migrated out of the flume and were not replaced with new bars. A nearly featureless bed formed with limited surface grain‐size heterogeneity, a slightly coarsened surface and a slightly reduced slope. In the larger flume, the formation of alternate bars was induced by an imposed upstream flow constriction and as such, the bars did not migrate. Termination of sediment supply led to progressive erosion of bed topography and loss of the bars, coarsening of the bed surface, loss of bed texture patchiness and significant slope reduction. The original alternate bar topography redeveloped when the sediment supply was restored once sufficient deposition had occurred to reconstruct the original channel slope. This shows that the bar loss was reversible by establishing the previous conditions and highlights the importance of sediment supply for bar formation. The role of sediment supply in bar formation and stability is not often recognized in stream restoration. Our results suggest that the loss of sediment supply can significantly affect alternate bar topography and that considerable volumes of sediment may be needed restore channel bars.</jats:p>",

The concept used for analyzing the alignment of practices was based on Vachon et al. (2009). The main conclusion of this study is that suppliers and automakers seem to align their supply strategy, giving support to a desirable situation of single chain project. The subsidiary conclusion is the lack of relationship between intensity of the link and misalignment in these companies. The main contributions are the analysis of the relationship established in tiers that are the furthest removed from the focal companies; identification of practices that support the expansion of a new model of arrangements implemented by automakers in Brazil; and understanding of the processes that companies have adopted in order to manage their supply chains and the implications of these activities for the competitiveness of both the company and the supply chain as a whole.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless, several methodological points remain under debate, particularly regarding the feedstock production step, which is a key stage of bioenergy chains. The present work focuses on field emissions during feedstock production, improving assessment methods by the use of process‐based models. To do so, a real bioenergy chain, the local feedstock supply for a boiler located in northern <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">F</jats:styled-content>rance, was studied. The <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LCA</jats:styled-content> compares flax shives, (the reference) with four other biomass sources: Miscanthus, cereal straw, linseed straw, and triticale as a whole plant. Six feedstock supply scenarios were also compared. The study aimed to test a new <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LCA</jats:styled-content> methodology for agricultural chains by integrating local characteristics (such as climate, soil, and crop management data) and using models to estimate field dynamics of pesticide emissions and soil organic carbon (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOC</jats:styled-content>). Results showed that flax shives and linseed straw had the lowest impacts, except for global warming: as a consequence, supply scenarios with the largest share of flax shives had the lowest impacts. For all selected impact categories, transportation and fertilization were the main contributors. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOC</jats:styled-content> dynamics led to high C sequestration level (e.g. with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M</jats:styled-content>iscanthus) or to high <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CO</jats:styled-content>\n<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions level (e.g. with flax shives), thus significantly influencing the global warming impact. Sensitivity analysis showed a large influence of allocation method (economic or mass‐based). This study demonstrated the relevance of integrating simulation models using local data in agricultural <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LCA</jats:styled-content>s, especially for dynamics of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOC</jats:styled-content> and pesticide from fields. Moreover, this work brought scientific elements to support the choice of flax shives as the main biomass feedstock, and the ranking of the other sources as alternative biomass supplies for the boiler.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The emerging field of ocean iron biogeochemistry has prompted interest in the identification and quantification of Fe supply mechanisms. However, less attention has been given to estimating biological Fe utilization, and using the magnitude of Fe utilization to enhance our understanding of modes of supply. Here, we combine regionally validated data sets (1997–2007) on remotely sensed net primary production (NPP) with the iron:carbon (Fe:C) molar ratios for resident phytoplankton to produce Southern Ocean maps of Fe utilization. This approach exploits the resolution of remotely sensed data to investigate the spatial patterns, areal extent and interannual variability of Fe utilization, and relates it to published temporal and spatial trends for Fe supply mechanisms. We estimate that Southern Ocean Fe utilization averaged ∼3.3 ± 0.3 × 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> mol Fe a<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. This utilization varied little between years (7.8–9.6 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>mol Fe m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> a<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), was greatest for subpolar waters, particularly in the Atlantic (up to 53.0 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>mol Fe m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> a<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and was lowest for the polar waters of the Indian sector. Application of maps corresponding to the location and areal extent of Fe supply regions (e.g., dust deposition) revealed that Fe utilization was highest in waters supplied by Patagonian dust, and to a lesser extent, where sediment resuspension (i.e. &lt;500 m depth) probably supplies the majority of the Fe. The Atlantic sector has regions where multiple supply mechanisms are evident, resulting in perennially high productivity. This approach provides a better assessment of the relative importance, realm of influence, and areal extent of different Fe supply mechanisms to Southern Ocean waters.</jats:p>",

Therefore, we aimed to complete the knowledge about this interesting and clinically relevant topic. Five human patellae taken from voluntary body donators were studied at the Department of Applied Anatomy of the Medical University of Vienna. One was dissected under the operation microscope, a second was made translucent by Sihlers-solution, and three underwent angiography using a 3D X-ray unit. The results revealed that the patella to a considerable amount is supplied by arteries coursing through the surrounding parts of the infrapatellar fat pad. The latter were found to branch off from the medial and lateral superior and inferior genicular arteries. Within the infrapatellar fat pad, these arteries formed a dense network of anastomoses which are all contributing to the viability of the patellar bone. Due to the rich arterial supply reaching the patella via the infrapatellar fat pad, it seems advisable to preserve the fat pad during surgery of the knee in order to reduce the risk of vascular impairment of the patella.</jats:p>",

Classically, analytic system analysis of this type has been performed using optimization, simulation, or heuristics. However, in the past two decades, a newer class of techniques, metaheuristics, has emerged as a capable method for quickly providing near‐optimal solutions for problems that exact optimization cannot solve. This article outlines recent advances in metaheuristics development, and considers the ability of these advanced techniques to resolve various logistics and supply chain problem types. Specifically, the article discusses the ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and tabu search metaheuristics. The capabilities of these metaheuristic techniques to examine supply chain risk and disruptions, intermodal operations, customer service trade‐offs, backhaul strategies, and simultaneous facility location and vehicle route problems are proposed. The article concludes by describing how faculty can bring these techniques into the classroom to ensure their students enter the logistics and supply chain field with a current and relevant understanding of the state of the art in supply chain design techniques.</jats:p>",

The final sample was composed of 51 articles, drawn from 18 periodicals. For analysis, the definition of a construct was taken as the base, its relation with manifested variables and words or terms most used and coherent with the definition of the concepts and the contexts in which these terms were applied. A total of 639 variables that defined constructs, were transcribed. Similarity is noted in the employment of their variables and common use of words in the definition of the concepts. However, the constructs possess different nomenclatures. Therefore, confusion is present in the studies analyzed. The study sought to contribute to greater discernment of the concepts, making a critical reflective understanding of the practices in the area. It was raised in the subsections of the discussions that the authors used the same terms in different contexts. It was pointed out the future prospects for formation of the concepts, showing how such constructs are being modified and perfected by means of the introduction of theories, such as the theory of Transaction Cost Economics, the Resource-Based View, Agency Theory, and Knowledge-Based Theory</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper presents the optimization of an energy supply system for an industrial area. The system is mainly composed of a district heating network (DHN), of a solar thermal plant with long term heat storage, of a set of combined heat and power units (CHP) and of additional thermal/cooling energy supply machines. The thermal vector can be produced by solar thermal modules, by fossil-fuel cogenerator or by conventional boilers. The optimization algorithm is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and it has to determine the optimal structure of the energy system and the size of the components (solar field area, heat storage volume, machines sizes, etc.). The model allows to calculate the economical and environmental benefits of the solar thermal plant compared to the cogenerative production, as well as the share of the thermal demand covered by renewable energies. The aim of the paper is to identity the optimal energy production mix able to meet the user energy demands and furthermore how the solar thermal energy integration affects the optimal energy system configuration. The average costs of the heat produced for the users have been evaluated for different optimal configurations, and it emerges that the solution including some cogenerators located in strategic production units, the district heating network, the long term heat storage and a solar plant of proper size, allows achieving the lowest cost of the heat. Thus, the integrated solution turns out to be the best from both the economical and environmental point of view.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, environmental problems such as climate change, greenhouse gas, and etc, are spreading out worldwide. Dramatic increase of social concerns on the environmental problem has been leading companies to take into account environmental issues in strategic decision-making. Moreover, because environmental management is on the rise as a significant issue in securing firm's future competitiveness, company is establishing a strategy of green growth. Some doubts about corporate environmental strategy, however, still remain unsolved.\r\nSCEM is the concept of reducing environmental effect on the outside of purchasing and manufacturing process, delivery, and distribution process. An ultimate aim of SCEM are to obtain environmental stability and an operational efficiency which is related with energy and materials. Although the importance of greening supply chain has been highlighted, many former researches were often based on case studies of specific industry and didn't provide clear definition of environmental supply chain management which includes fundamental notions for business practitioners.\r\nThis study focuses on findings how the SCEM system practically runs and what the characteristics of SCEM is in Korean firms through case studies.\r\nI analyzed the cases under five categories: eco-friendly design &amp; products development, green purchasing, production &amp; logistics, take-back &amp; recycling and environmental supporting for suppliers. Those are selected through reviewing theoretical literatures which was published.\r\nFour companies including LG electronics, Samsung Electronics, Kia Motora, Hyundai Motors, POSCO, and Hyundai Steel was selected for the analysis of case studies. They are leading companies which has been implementing environmental management in Korea and has been annually publishing Sustainability Report.\r\nSustainability Report is a key sources of data and contents included in cases. Additionally interview with managers of companies which is in charge of environmental affairs was attempted.\r\nIt is suggested that SCEM is more effective for environmental management rather than by making limited eco-innovation. Korean firms have considered that an international environmental regulation is more important than customers' needs for environmental goods for implementing SCEM. The collaborative relations between manufacturing company and parts-suppling company make an important effect on SCEM. but it was implemented by one-sided lead of manufacturing company. Considering industrial characteristics, there is some differences between consumer goods and industrial goods. Auto mobile and electronic industry which is producing a consumer goods make actively a response to the environmental regulation. Also they are more elaboratively tied with the parts and material firm.\r\nFinally there is no difference in the implementation of SCEM comparing the category of Hyundai Group and other category including Samsung, LG and Posco. It means that the environmental management in Korean firms is needed and implemented by external environment rather than CEO' managerial philosophy.\r\nThe result of this study can be applied to developing strategies for SCEM concerning which direction a firm should focus on, and which process a firm should interest on. It also provides helpful insight on the implementation and development of environmental management. Also these findings give an important implications for future research because this study is implemented on an exploratory basis.\r\nHowever, it has some limitations which should be dealt with in further studies. Environmental strategy and its change need a longitudinal study. Also various elaborate research methods should be designed to trace the change of environmental strategy.</jats:p>",

In this paper we investigate how the interdependencies among information technology components, products, and infrastructure affect the release of new technologies. Going beyond the ad hoc heuristic approaches applied in previous studies, we empirically validate the existence of several patterns of supply-side technology relationships in the context of wireless networking. We use vector autoregression (VAR) to model the comovements of new component, product, and infrastructure introductions and provide evidence of strong Granger-causal interdependencies. We also demonstrate that substantial improvements in forecasting can be gained by incorporating these cross-level effects into models of technological change. This paper provides some of the first research that empirically demonstrates these cross-level effects and also provides an exposition of VAR methodology for both analysis and forecasting in IS research.</jats:p>",

Analysis of households' internal bargaining process suggests that women's bargaining power increases when their wages are higher and they are better educated. The results indicate that it is crucial to account for the mechanics of decision‐making within households when studying the effects of changing labor market conditions or designing development policies to improve individual well‐being or to empower women.</jats:p>",

Gramling and Rosman (2009; hereafter GR) extended AW by examining the number of candidates based on whether the 150-hour requirement applies to the exam or for licensure, concluding that the 150-hour requirement does not reduce the number of candidates taking and passing the exam. In this paper, we reopen the discussion of whether the 150-hour education requirement affects entrants into the accounting profession by comparing the AW and GR research designs and conclusions. We conclude that the GR research design yields results about whether differences in 150-hour implementation methods affect the number of candidates taking and passing the exam, but does not directly provide evidence about whether the 150-hour education requirement itself affects the number of candidates.</jats:p>",

As one of the largest biofuel markets worldwide, the German biodiesel market is of particular interest. It has grown rapidly since the beginning of the new millennium, with this growth being driven mainly by political interventions. Vertical price transmission channels along the biodiesel supply chain are analyzed in this study. We examine the relationship between diesel and biodiesel prices, and between rapeseed oil, soy oil, and biodiesel prices between 2002 and 2008. Due to pronounced changes in market conditions and the policy framework, a regime‐dependent Markov‐switching vector error‐correction model is used. The regimes are characterized by markedly different price adjustment behaviors. Before 2005 and from late 2007 onward, a regime characterized by the strong orientation of biodiesel prices toward diesel prices dominates. Between 2005 and 2007, biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices are mutually interdependent. Frequent switches between the regimes of the price dynamics during this period indicate a high extent of uncertainty and instability in the market.</jats:p>",

DSI involves coordinating the activities and processes reflective of a firm’s customer focus, with the operational, supply‐side activities that make demand fulfillment possible. This article contributes to this research stream by providing researchable propositions intended to foster support of a new dominant logic in supply chain management thought, describing how firms can best achieve “relevant” customer value by coordinating supply‐ and demand‐focused activities within and across their functional units.</jats:p>",

Using aggregate national data, we build a mixed‐frequency herd dynamics econometric model of the U.S. milk supply that updates and substantially amends the model first proposed by Chavas and Klemme. We implement a dynamic residual‐based bootstrap technique that can be used in testing for changes in nonmarginal simulated long‐run supply responsiveness, and trace the evolution of long‐run milk supply elasticity from 1975 through 2010. Several papers in the past have suggested that long‐run supply elasticity increases with dairy farm size, which implies that increased importance of large farms would increase aggregate long‐run supply responsiveness. Contrary to this conclusion, we find a declining trend in long‐run supply elasticity from 1975 through 2005. Persistence of such a decline would be a major cause for worry, as ever larger price swings would be needed to equilibrate the market in face of demand shocks. However, we find that milk supply is becoming more responsive since 2005 both to milk and feed price changes. Increasing responsiveness to feed prices further justifies focusing the next generation of the dairy policy instruments on managing dairy profit margins rather than just revenue streams.</jats:p>",

Its main conclusion is that increased high‐value exports and the modernisation of export supply chains can bring about important positive welfare effects, which can occur in various ways through product‐ or labour‐market effects and through direct and indirect effects.</jats:p>",

Data were analyzed for associations between users of these DS types, sociodemographic, sport-specific characteristics, and opinion on the need for DS. In addition, sources of supply and information were examined. In the framework of the GOAL Study, 1,138 German elite adolescent athletes (14–18 yr) answered questions about DS. The data were analyzed to identify groups at risk for using DS after a classification by supplemental function. Of the young athletes, 91.1% reported DS use during the previous month. (Daily) DS use was significantly associated with sex, kind of sport, and the weekly duration of sporting activity. Furthermore, some athletes were required to use DS by their sporting organization. DS use was more likely in these athletes than in those whose sporting organizations had no such requirement. Overall, DS with short- and long-term supplemental function were mostly associated with the use of magnesium. However, DS with medium-term muscle-building function played an important role among daily users. The main source of information about DS was coaches; main source of supply was parents. Professional education is urgently needed, as 9 out of 10 athletes used DS, and strong positive opinions toward the use of DS were present, particularly in the DS users.</jats:p>",

Creating resilient supply chain is an effective way to overcome the supply chain vulnerability. The supply chain characteristics of self-adaptation and self-coordination are consistent with the self-organization feature of ant colony's labor division. In this paper, a generalized ant colony's labor division model with constraints is provided, which is used to construct the ant colony's labor division model with constraints of resilient supply chain to solve task allocation of resilient supply chains. The simulation principle and algorithm of resilient supply chain are provided based on the proposed model and task allocation of the supply chain is analyzed from the five aspects, that is, task allocation status, supply chain coordination, emergency incidents' impact to task allocation, task allocation rate and the influence of different incidents for task allocation. The simulation results show that, with the proposed model, it is effective to allocate resilient supply chain tasks and has excellent performance, such as faster response and robustness.</jats:p>",

We found that reducing N supply increased amino‐N percentage of total N in maize (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) xylem sap. Proteomic analysis showed that 23 proteins in the xylem sap of maize plants, including 12 newly identified ones, differentially accumulated in response to various N supplies. Fifteen of these 23 proteins were primarily involved in general abiotic or biotic stress responses, whereas the other five proteins appeared to respond largely to N under‐ or over‐supply, suggesting distinct protein responses in maize xylem upon N under‐ and over‐supply. Furthermore, one putative xylanase inhibitor and two putative O‐glycosyl hydrolases had preferential gene expression in shoots.</jats:bold></jats:p>",

Accordingly, it is required to improve the technology to maintain the water distribution system so that the related technologies can be scientifically and systematically applied. The paradigm of Korean water supply service is changing from supply era to maintenance era, and it is required to apply equipment and method to effectively check, diagnose and test the internal condition of the pipe without stopping water supply. If photographing and diagnosis of the burial environment around the water service pipeline and inside the pipe can be carried out without stopping water supply effectively utilizing the surrounding facilities such as straight piping and air valve to the maximum, decrepit pipe (defective pipe) improvement projects can be effectively carried out by making adequate decisions. Also, a systematic and more efficient water supply service maintenance system can be established by building a database of surrounding pipeline directly investigated and selecting priority of direct/indirect evaluation. This study has raised accuracy of a diagnosis by applying a camera capable of securing high resolution without generation of distortion in case of photographing the inside of a pipe, and suggested an application method of the pipe endoscope camera using an inspection hole inside a pipe.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>As food markets have become more globalized, consumers have become more concerned about the origin of the foods they eat as confidence in the quality and safety of foods produced outside their local region or country has decreased. Traceability systems address these concerns by accommodating the importance of establishing a link between the product, the producer and the place of production, and these are gaining momentum in the food industry.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper describes the product attributes that could influence the decision‐making process of consumers towards purchasing a specific type of meat, namely Karoo lamb. Karoo lamb is the product of specifically reared lambs in the Karoo region of South Africa and has a distinctive taste. The information used in this paper was obtained in the first phase of a research endeavour involving three focus groups. They were conducted to identify the product attributes that were critical in influencing the consumers' preferences and choices regarding Karoo lamb. In phase two, conjoint analysis was used to measure the importance that individual consumers attach to the various product attributes and their denominations, and the utility they then attach to it based on their valuation of the product as a whole.</jats:p><jats:p>Price, as an extrinsic attribute, was identified as the most important factor in the decision‐making process of consumers when purchasing lamb. Safety and quality were also relatively important, although, of the two, food safety was clearly the more important consideration. This is not surprising given the legacy of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as mad‐cow disease, and <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic> outbreaks that, in the past, received considerable publicity, especially in the press. The attribute ‘origin’ was rated as of the lowest importance. Traceability can be meaningful to consumers although in an indirect manner. The importance of traceability to consumers is mostly in terms of its benefits such as providing information on safety and quality, in relation to aspects that they think are important regarding food in general. In terms of meat especially, there is a need for fast and reliable traceability systems along the full supply chain. From origin to the user, the end consumer, provision of safe and high‐quality food is imperative.</jats:p>",

Scarcity of critical natural resources such as oil, water, food, and precious metals has the potential to greatly impact commercial activity as the twenty‐first century progresses. The challenge of continuing to provide needed goods and services in the face of these constraints falls to supply chain managers, who are ultimately responsible for delivering utility to customers. Unfortunately, there has been almost no research focused on supply chain strategies aimed at mitigating natural resource scarcity’s (NRS) potential effects. The current research positions NRS as a supply chain risk and proposes an NRS typology based on key resource attributes. Supply chain mitigation strategies to counter each resource status are offered, with an overall objective of improving supply chain performance. The study recommends future research aimed at further developing theory and methods for countering NRS based on resource, systems and behavioral theories. In addition, this study has critical implications for practitioners faced with the growing threat of NRS in their supply chains.</jats:p>",

Assessing the temporal and spatial variability of water supply stress is urgently needed to mitigate water crisis caused by water resource reallocation. Water supply and use data were compiled for the time period of 1998‐2003 in this synthesis study. The Water Supply Stress Index (WSSI) as defined as Water Demand/Water Supply was used to quantitate whether water supply could meet the demand of human activities across the study region. We found a large spatial gradient of water supply stress in the study region, being much higher in the eastern subbasins (ranging from 2.56 to 4.31) than the west subbasins (ranging from 0.56 to 1.92). The eastern plain region not only suffered more serious water supply stress but also had a much higher interannual variability than the western hilly region. The uneven spatial distribution of water supply stress might result from the distribution of land use, population, and climate. Future climate change and rapid economic development are likely to aggravate the existing water crisis in the study region.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to standardize the types and amounts of goods provided by medical facilities on the basis of the survey results. We conducted a survey of medical facilities and patients regarding the status of goods supplied for ISC. Data were collected from January to May 2010 from 5 outpatient urology clinics and 26 patients practicing ISC. The first finding of this research is that the amount of supplied goods was insufficient and part of the supply method was incorrect. The second is that the status of goods supplied changed not only with ISC, but also with hospital characteristics. The third is that hospital costs averaged $63·10; the supplied catheter number affected hospital costs. Patient costs per month averaged $26·50, clearly showing that patients experience an economic burden. Patient costs were high in cases in which the percentage of types of goods supplied was low. A researcher analysed survey data to determine issues and procedures relevant to the supply of goods. The study showed a need to develop an optimal supply system for ISC patients and identified issues in the current system in Japan that require resolution.</jats:p>",

Here, we examine the natural range of variability in the Conejos River Valley, southern Colorado, through documentation of terrace morphostratigraphic and sedimentological characteristics as well as through investigation of sediment contributions from headwaters, hillslopes and tributary streams. Additionally, soil development and radiocarbon ages, together with local and regional paleoclimate reconstructions, were used to infer the range of processes acting in this system.</jats:p><jats:p>Since de‐glaciation, the Conejos River has fluctuated between episodes of bedrock strath formation, aggradation and vertical incision. Morphostratigraphic relationships, soil development and radiocarbon ages enable us to propose a chronology for periods of alluvial deposition (around 8·9–7·6 ka, 5·5 ka and from 3·5 to 1·1 ka), separated by intervals of fluvial incision. We infer potential forcing mechanisms by utilizing multiple working hypotheses. Specifically, we discuss the potential for increases in sediment supply during periods of (1) para‐glacial adjustment, (2) climatic cooling, (3) increased frequency of climate change and (4) increased fire frequency or severity. We also consider the effects of changes in stream discharge and extreme storm occurrence. We conclude that combinations of these processes, operating at different times, have contributed to sediment mobilization since de‐glaciation. Stream and landform morphology also varies longitudinally due to the influence of remnant glacial topography. In particular, valley bottom overdeepening at tributary junctions has resulted in incision and strath formation into unlithified glacial deposits (i.e. fill‐cut terraces) rather than bedrock in some reaches. Overall, the Conejos fluvial system has varied significantly both temporally and spatially since de‐glaciation and appears to be sensitive to changes in sediment supply related to Holocene scale climate fluctuations. This natural range of variability must therefore be a key consideration in any future stream management policies. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Power consumption is known to be a crucial issue in current IC designs. To tackle this problem, Multiple Dynamic Supply Voltage (MDSV) designs are proposed as an efficient solution for power savings. However, the increasing variability of clock skew during the switching of power modes leads to an increase in the complication of clock skew reduction in MDSV designs. In this article, we propose a load-balanced clock tree synthesizer with Adjustable Delay Buffer (ADB) insertion for clock skew reduction in MDSV designs. The clock tree synthesizer adopts the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) metric to estimate the interconnect capacitance and execute the graph-theoretic clustering. The power-mode-guided optimization is also embedded into the clock tree synthesizer for improving additional area overhead in the step of ADB insertion. After constructing the initial buffered clock tree, we insert the ADBs with delay value assignments to reduce clock skew in MDSV designs. The ADBs can be used to produce additional delays, hence the clock latencies and skew become tunable in a clock tree. An efficient algorithm of ADB insertion for the minimization of clock skew, area, and runtime in MDSV designs has been presented. Comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithm of ADB insertion, experimental results show maximum 42.40% area overhead improvement. With the power-mode-guided optimization, the maximum improvement of area overhead can increase to 47.87%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Malaria parasite clones with the highest transmission rates to mosquitoes also tend to induce the most severe fitness consequences (or virulence) in mammals. This is in accord with expectations from the virulence–transmission trade-off hypothesis. However, the mechanisms underlying how different clones cause virulence are not well understood. Here, using data from eight murine malaria clones, we apply recently developed statistical methods to infer differences in clone characteristics, including induction of differing host-mediated changes in red blood cell (RBC) supply. Our results indicate that the within-host mechanisms underlying similar levels of virulence are variable and that killing of uninfected RBCs by immune effectors and/or retention of RBCs in the spleen may ultimately reduce virulence. Furthermore, the correlation between clone virulence and the degree of host-induced mortality of uninfected RBCs indicates that hosts increasingly restrict their RBC supply with increasing intrinsic virulence of the clone with which they are infected. Our results demonstrate a role for self-harm in self-defence for hosts and highlight the diversity and modes of virulence of malaria.</jats:p>",

This situation created a “water crisis” that is mostly due to control and management problems, than to the lack of technical projects or the availability of the water resource. This contribution aims to demonstrate sustainability of exploitation of groundwater resources to supplement the water supply. The study area covers a sector of the Napostá Chico stream watershed in the southwestern slopes of the Sierras Australes range, Buenos Aires province. The unconfined aquifer is located in the “pampean sediments” widely distributed throughout the piedmont plain. Available hydrogeological information allowed to formulate a numerical flow model by means of the Modflow program. Pumping scenarios were simulated and their impact on the hydrodynamics of the aquifer was tested. The results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting groundwater through a well battery located in close proximity of Cabildo locality. A rational exploitation of the aquifer, sustainable in time, constitutes a viable alternative to alleviate the critical water situation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mineral malnutrition is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa but its extent is difficult to quantify. Using Malawi as a case study, the aim of this work was to investigate the adequacy of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) nutrition by combining national food supply and food composition data with a new spatial survey of maize grain. Non-maize dietary sources of Ca and Mg were estimated using existing food supply and composition data. Calcium and Mg concentrations in maize grain were determined at 88 field sites, representing &gt; 75 % of Malawis land area in terms of soil classification. Median maize grain concentrations from the survey were 34 and 845 mg kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, representing a per capita supply of 12 and 299 mg d<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> of Ca and Mg, respectively. Combining these data with food supply and composition data reveals that average Ca nutrition is likely to be inadequate for many individuals, whereas average Mg nutrition appears adequate. Optimal supply of Ca per capita depends critically on balanced food availability and choice. Since maize grain sourced from highly calcareous soils is still unlikely to deliver &gt; 5 % of estimated average requirements, agronomic solutions to rectify Ca malnutrition via maize are limited, in comparison with strategies for dietary diversification. </jats:p>",
