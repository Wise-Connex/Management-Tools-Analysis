The costs he considered are for storage and the extra cost of operating refineries at extreme distillate yield. The \"effect of price expectations\" on seasonal inventories is deliberately excluded from the analysis. The Tiplitz study has interesting and useful results. However, it raises (without answering) the question of how cost-minimizing stocks differ from stocks held for price reasons. Some readers may conclude that price-responsive stocks are somehow different from or additional to cost-minimizing stocks. This interpretation runs counter to economic intuition. n the classic theory of the firm, the profit-maximizing plan for variable inputs also minimizes the variable cost of the most profitable output level. When there is an opportunity to store, supply can be accomplished through storage as well as input processing. Stocks are a variable input in the supply process. If producers are expected-profit maximizers, they should therefore manage stocks like other inputs to minimize the expected variable cost of supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We examined the hypothesis that female spruce grouse (Dendragapus canadensis) rely entirely on their spring diet or endogenous reserves for the nutrients required for clutch formation. Spring food habits of 40 radio-tagged hens were documented by direct observation (21 262 min) during the period encompassing oviducal recrudescence, follicular development, and egg laying (late April – late May 1984 – 1986) and compared with clutch size and mean egg weight. Hens consumed conifer foliage, flowers, fruits, and foliage of ground plants, grit, and arthropods. Compared with their prebreeding diet, foods preferred in spring were rich in protein and P, but not necessarily Ca. Large clutch size was associated with a high rate of intake of the two most preferred foods, flowers of trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens) and spore capsules of Polytrichum mosses, and crude protein, P, and Ca, but was not related to the size of hens (body weight) or the size of endogenous reserves (scaled body weight). Egg size was not associated with spring diet or the size of endogenous reserves, but appeared to be related to the size of hens. Rate of intake of arbutus flowers and moss capsules was correlated with their availability on territories, suggesting that clutch size might have been proximately limited by food supply. However, rough estimates of nutrient intake suggested that the spring diet provided only about 60% of the protein and 45% of the Ca needed for clutch formation. Consequently, hens appeared to rely on both their spring diet and stored reserves for the nutrients required for clutch formation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. Changes in heart rate and blood pressure were observed, in nine healthy subjects, during and after voluntary and electrically evoked isometric contractions of the triceps surae under conditions of local circulatory arrest. 2. The progressive increases in heart rate and blood pressure seen during 2 min voluntary and evoked contractions at 30% of maximal voluntary contraction were not significantly different in the two conditions. On cessation of contraction but with circulatory arrest maintained, heart rate fell to control levels while blood pressure fell to a similar though still significantly elevated level in both conditions. Elevated blood pressure was maintained for 2 min until the circulatory occlusion was removed; however it was maintained at a significantly higher level for the last 60‐90 s of occlusion following electrically evoked contractions compared to voluntary contraction. 3. Comparison of the responses to voluntary and involuntary electrically evoked contractions suggest that ‘central command’ is not necessary for the initial increases in heart rate and blood pressure to occur. In addition the removal of central command on cessation of contraction need not account for the return of heart rate to control levels or the drop in blood pressure at that time. Maintained blood pressure elevation during circulatory occlusion would seem to be due to the trapping of chemical substances within the muscle interstitium.</jats:p>",
