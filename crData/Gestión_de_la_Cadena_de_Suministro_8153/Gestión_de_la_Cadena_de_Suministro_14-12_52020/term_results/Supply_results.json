This study seeks to understand the relationship between a firm's strategy, its supply chain integration efforts, and firm performance. Leveraging the theoretical lens of structure–conduct–performance from the industrial organization economics literature, and utilizing both archival and survey data, we describe how firms may align their internal and external supply chain integration strategies with customers and suppliers. In doing so, these internal and external integration strategies affect the firm's ability to respond to customer demand, which then impacts operational and financial performance. Our work provides theoretical and empirical evidence of these relationships and thus extends prior strategic supply chain integration literature.</jats:p>",

Lack of SCC can result in the bullwhip effect and poor performance for a firm and its partners.  By investigating the phenomenon in the Brazilian pharmaceutical supply chain using a qualitative research, this paper aims to understand the main issues that avoid a better integrated chain. Results of 21 interviews suggested that the lack of coordination in this environment was influenced by the network design and the history of the sector in Brazil, as well as scarce resources.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n2p75-90URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n2p75-90</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The evolution of science has intrigued countless scientists. Many philosophers hold that scientific evolution is linear and constantly adding to the overall body of knowledge. Thomas Kuhn changed this view. In his famous work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, he proposes a route to normal science. He explains that paradigm shifts are arduous and require long time periods to occur. Using qualitative research combined with a Kuhnian model, we explain the evolution of Supply Chain Management (SCM) from its origins. Some authors have traced SCM evolution with a focus on chronological and linear order. This paper brings a new approach using Kuhnian elements to explain how SCM has matured to its present form. This broad picture manifests the strenuous path of SCM’s evolution and helps to explain how it is close to becoming a normal science.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n2p59-74URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n2p59-74</jats:p>"

This study proposes a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) structure in fashion industry and develops its planning model as multi-objective mixed integer linear programming to find an optimal trade-off between CLSC profit and CO2 emission. The planning model is associated with the profit analysis of each member in CLSC to find the optimal price of products on CLSC network. The model determines optimal production, transportation, and inventory quantities on CLSC network. The proposed models are validated using numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses, and from the results some managerial insights are addressed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mounting pressure for sustainable business practices has led to a greatly increased focus on highlighting sustainability drivers throughout the supply chain. While the literature has concentrated on why downstream original equipment manufacturers (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OEM</jats:styled-content>s) and retailers become “sustainable,” much less is known regarding why and how upstream suppliers implement sustainability practices. Based on findings from a cross‐case analysis of eight first‐tier (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content>) suppliers and an integration of resource dependency theory (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">RDT</jats:styled-content>), this study explores the drivers and mechanisms of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> supplier engagement in sustainable supply chain management. Suppliers need to understand the sustainability priorities of customers and stakeholders to derive the effective focus and depth of further upstream integration with subsuppliers. Therefore, the integration between the two functions that manage the relevant external interfaces, namely marketing (downstream and stakeholder communication) and procurement (upstream), appears to be the essential cornerstone to move beyond <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> supplier compliance to actual commitment to sustainability practices. We present findings on how (1) stakeholder‐related, (2) process‐related, and (3) product‐related drivers influence the choice and effectiveness of the procurement–marketing integration (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PM</jats:styled-content> integration) mechanisms. Stakeholder pressures are considered to be the principal drivers of sustainability efforts. However, on their own, they rarely provide sufficient grounds for permanent and embedded <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PM</jats:styled-content> integration initiatives at <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">FT</jats:styled-content> suppliers. Evidence suggests that suppliers' commitment to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PM</jats:styled-content> integration is motivated by the opportunity to leverage sustainability initiatives in their product offerings and sustainability certificates recognizable by customers and secondary stakeholders.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper’s objective was to analyze the role of transaction costs in the longevity of Jaú footwear supply chain. Firms are configured in a cluster, and their level of coordination was investigated. The study data was collected via conducting interviews with the cluster’s agents, making direct observations during the field visits, and consulting secondary data emerging both from document analysis and from sources such as newspapers, sectoral studies, and previous academic studies. The data point to the intense frequency of transactions among firms and the low uncertainty of internal transactions within the cluster due to the extensive exchange of information among agents. The bonds of competition and coordination that are established among the firms both reduce transaction costs and make them more competitive. Both human asset specificity and site specificity are important factors in the longevity of Jaú’s footwear cluster.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n2p140-153URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n2p140-153</jats:p>"

Two strategies were employed to answer the question. The first involved a time series analysis of the relationship between seizures, supplier arrests, emergency department admissions and use/possess arrests. The second involved an analysis of three specific operations identified by the NSW Crime Commission as having had the potential to affect the market for cocaine. The associations between supply reduction variables and use and harm measures for cocaine and ATS were all either not significant or positive. These findings suggest that increases in cocaine or ATS seizures or ATS supplier arrests are signals of increased (rather than reduced) supply. The three significant operations dealing with cocaine listed by the NSW Crime Commission did bring an end to the upward trend in the frequency of arrests for use and possession of cocaine. Thus, very large-scale supply control operations do sometimes reduce the availability of illicit drugs.</jats:p>"

Several reasons are responsible; in particular, the dwindling availability of plants, the excessive complexity of supply chains, the growing distances between plant sources and manufacturing units, and the control over the medicinal plant market by powerful middlemen. Substitution, adulteration, and quality control have become sensitive issues and may eventually damage the reputation of the ayurvedic drug sector in a context of high competition between manufacturers. Cultivating medicinal plants is considered to be the main solution for solving the supply crisis, but manufacturers’ demands are often too constraining for cultivators and this may not be such a viable alternative in a context of continuous modernisation efforts for production efficiency.</jats:p>",

These motors have additional properties for speed control that distinguish them from the standard 3 phase motors: operation at various sequences of supplying voltages due to the inverter control and possible operation with few open-circuited phases. For each supply sequence different no load speeds at the same frequency can be obtained. This feature extends the motor application for miscellaneous drive demands including vector or scalar control. This depends mainly on the type of the stator winding for a given number of phases, since the principle of motor operation is based on co-operation of higher harmonics of magnetic field. Examples of operation are presented for a 9-phase motor, though general approach has been discussed. This motor was fed by a voltage source inverter at field oriented control with forced currents. The mathematical model of the motor was reduced to the form incorporating all most important physical features and appropriate for the control law formulation. The operation was illustrated for various supply sequences for “healthy” motor and for the motor operating at one phase broken. The obtained results have shown that parasitic influence of harmonic fields interaction has negligible influence on motor operation with respect to the useful coupling for properly designed stator winding.</jats:p>",

This paper, using the Fluent software and applying the volume of fluid model to simulate free surface flow and the k – ε turbulence model, analyzes conditions for roll wave formation in free surface flow with the aim of predicting their occurrence in chutes. This study describes how the type of cross-section of the chutes influences the formation of roll waves. Hydraulic characteristics of the flow in the physical model of the flood control structure for Azad Dam spillway, which consists of a side spillway, chute, and flip, are three-dimensionally simulated. Numerical predictions were compared against the experimental data and results show that there is a good agreement between numerical and experimental results. Results indicate that an increase in side slope tends towards flow stability and the slower formation of rolling waves. Also, the rolling waves are expected to be generated for sections of the chute when the difference between the maximum dynamic pressure and the minimum dynamic pressure in those sections is above 9,000 Pa.</jats:p>",

We find that information complementarities between firms in the same supply chain, between a supplier firm and its industry peer firms, and between the supplier's major customer and other firms in analysts' portfolio affect their supply chain specialization decision. The potential revenues supplier firms generate for analysts' brokerage houses also significantly affect this decision. While supply chain analysts achieve superior forecast performance compared to non-supply chain analysts for supplier firms, they provide lower-quality forecasts for other firms in their portfolios. These findings suggest that analysts allocate resources strategically. Our results are robust to techniques designed to address the potential endogeneity of analysts' supply chain portfolio choices.</jats:p>",

To achieve this goal, both freshwater availability for energy crops and best practices in bioethanol production chain management are very important issues. Therefore, this study integrates water footprint technique with the linear programing approach in order to optimize the operations decision, focusing on water footprint of the bioethanol production chains from both tactical and operational levels. A cradle-to-grave approach is adopted to evaluate the water consumption and pollution in bioethanol production from sugarcane and cassava. The results show that the water footprint of bioethanol consumed in Thailand was about 3.23 × 109, 1.72 × 1010, and 2.49 × 1010 m3 per year in 2010, 2016, and 2021, respectively. The share of agriculture water consumption to the total water footprints of bioethanol was 99% and industrial water consumption was 1%. After applying the linear programing, it was found that the water footprint could be reduced by at least 53%, or 1.33 × 1010 m3, annually. The modeling approach and formulation presented could be used as a tool to reduce water consumption and provide the operation plan of bioethanol production chain.</jats:p>",

The potential dam safety problem is not only a security issue but also a an issue of risk for areas downstream of dams. Therefore, risk management is the core of dam safety administration. Dam risk classification is an important part of risk management that should consider the probability of dam failure and the risk of loss (potential damage). This paper summarizes research on dam risk classification and finds that ‘three degrees’ and ‘four degrees’ of dam risk classification are used widely in developed countries or districts. It proposes that four degrees of risk could be adopted by the risk matrix approach for the current situation and relevant regulations of China. It might make the dam safety management more efficient and have a certain guiding significance in establishing the standard of dam risk classification in China.</jats:p>",

Aflaj are artificial canals constructed centuries ago to transfer horizontally the groundwater to a location at the surface. The water quality of these Aflaj is a very important factor to be considered for healthy and safe use of this water. This paper aimed to study the characteristics of the groundwater through its journey in Aflaj from source point up to its usage point. An experimental programme was adopted to investigate the water quality of Al Hammam Aflaj in Muscat, Sultanate of Oman. The results showed that some positions of the Falaj have high content of some elements, such as Ca, above the allowable values of drinking water standards. Results proved that the water of Al Hammam Falaj in general can be used with caution as a drinking water; however, some care and monitoring should be applied regularly. Results of sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and soluble sodium percentage (SSP) equations revealed that the water Falaj can be used for irrigation for all soil types but cannot be used on soils with restricted drainage due to its relatively high salinity.</jats:p>",

In a pilot study with 11 metabolic syndrome patients, who received as therapy 2 × 120 mg/d Gingko biloba special extract EGb 761 (Rökan novoÒ: Spitzner Arzneimittel, Ettlingen; TeboninÒ: Schwabe Pharmaceutical, Karlsruhe, Germany) over 2 months, it should be proven whether a change of the blood parameters MCH, MCHC, MCV and Hct could eventually supply a mechanistic explanation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: Photometric methods, commercial ELISAs and EIAs, and clinical routine chemistry were applied.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: MCH was increased from 27.7 ± 0.9 to 28.6 ± 1.0 pg (p &lt; 0.0003), a change of +3.2% (p &lt; 0.0044), MCHC from 317.7 ± 2.5 to 333.0 ± 3.1 g/L (p &lt; 0.0), a change of +4.8% (p &lt; 0.001), while Hct was decreased from 0.463 ± 0.011 to 0.407 ± 0.009 vol/vol (p &lt; 0.0), a change of -12.0% (p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, alterations in several biomarkers were measured: SOD +17.7% (p &lt; 0.009), oxLDL/LDL -21.0% (p &lt; 0.002), MPO -29.6% (p &lt; 0.013), hs-CRP -39.3% (p &lt; 0.004), HOMA-IR -14.0% (p &lt; 0.024), CREA -11.3% (p &lt; 0.001), ALT -16.0% (p &lt; 0.0208). The table demonstrates the results of a linear correlation analysis between these biomarker changes and the changes in Hct and MCHC showing calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients r and error probabilities p.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Discussion: Even though the additional load of the single erythrocyte with an increased hemoglobin concentration seems insignificant, it is, however, decisive for the O2-saturation of the blood. Decrease of the hematocrit from 46.3% to 40.7% signalizes a normalization of the initially elevated value in these metabolic syndrome patients. Possibly, this lowering by 12.0% would not have been so distinct in a normal person. Reduction of oxidative stress, inflammatory parameters as well as decrease in insulin resistance offer an explanation for the increase in MCH and MCHC.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusion: With the intake of ginkgo, a better O2-supply for organs and tissues is guaranteed not only through an increased blood perfusion but also through an improved load of the single erythrocyte with hemoglobin (MCHC) by 4.8% as well as through reduction of the hematocrit (Hct) by 12.0%.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Figure 1 Figure 1.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Disclosures</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Siegel: Schwabe Pharmaceutics, Karlsruhe, Germany: Research Funding.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In academia as in practice, seaports are increasingly viewed as elements in supply chains. It is argued that seaports should add value to shippers by aligning their own business activities with shippers’ Supply Chain Management (SCM) strategies and requirements. The implications of this ‘port-SCM’ philosophy are not fully explored, however. In this context, it is especially important to create mutual understanding between shippers, in terms of their SCM strategies, and port actors, in terms of services provided. In this paper a framework is developed, which aims to improve mutual understanding between shippers and port actors from a SCM point of view. It thereby aims to contribute to the dialogue on how the port logistics system can be better integrated into shippers’ SCM strategies. Three SCM reference models are analysed and twelve SCM subsystems identified that represent broad design areas of shippers’ SCM strategies. Further, the seaport system is discussed in terms of system boundaries and the actors involved. Port actors and SCM subsystems are then combined into one explanatory framework, the SCM-port actor matrix. Finally, applying the matrix, three cases retrieved from academic and trade literature in which port actors are actively involved in conducting shippers’ supply chain strategies are discussed. The paper concludes with a brief outlook on future research needs.</jats:p>",

Taking Spain as a case study and a sector with significant economic and environmental impacts, the agri-food industry, the objective of this work is two-fold. First, we estimate the associated water impact, both from the production and consumption perspectives, paying special attention to the water embodied in production exchanges among countries and sectors. To that aim, we use an environmentally-extended multiregional  input-output model (MRIO). Second, we assess the main driving factors behind changes in direct and embodied water consumption between the years 1995 and 2009 by means of a structural decomposition analysis. The MRIO model provides a comprehensive estimate of the economic linkages among regions and economic sectors and, therefore, allows calculating the environmental impacts over international value chains. The results indicate that the food industry exerts large impacts on global water resources, particularly given the remarkable interactions with the domestic and foreign agricultural sectors, These growing linkages show how consumption patterns, and, therefore, lifestyles, involve large environmental impacts through the whole and global supply chains.</jats:p>"

The Irish state played a central role in facilitating and shaping this labour supply, through its formulation of immigration policies and its role in influencing labour market structure, thereby influencing the nature of the workers who entered the Irish labour market. Placing the analysis of Irish immigration policy within the unfolding global systems of flows of people and capital prevents the classification of Ireland, or any country, as a unique experience. Economically driven moves by the Irish state, specifically in terms of labour supply, are evident in the recruitment drives supported through the Celtic Tiger and with the expansion of the European Union in 2004. This paper outlines how Ireland’s immigration policy during the Celtic Tiger shaped the labour market by determining which workers did what jobs. It also discusses the nature of the Irish state and how this contributes to immigration policy outcomes.</jats:p>"

Thermal power takes the largest part of China’s total installed power generation capacity, so these policies will undoubtedly impact thermal coal supply chain member enterprises. Based on the actual situation in China, this paper figures out how the member enterprises adjust their business decisions to satisfy the requirements of air pollution prevention and control policies by establishing system dynamic models of policy impact transfer. These dynamic analyses can help coal enterprises and thermal power enterprises do strategic environmental assessments and find directions of sustainable development. Furthermore, the policy simulated results of this paper provide the Chinese government with suggestions for policy-making to make sure that the energy conservation and emission reduction policies and sustainable energy policies can work more efficiently.</jats:p>"

Typically, such a network consists of several stages such as suppliers, manufacturers and retailers, which contribute to the completion of a product. Here, we restrict ourselves to one arc from supplier to costumer. Instead of known strategies such as postponement, we apply a model predictive control scheme to deal with the optimal steering problem of the considered arc in a distributed way. To this end, we assign one controller to each stage along the considered arc. Since the stages may represent different companies, local cost criteria are imposed, which are optimized subject to local and global constraints while communicating with neighbors. Additionally, we discuss the applicability of such an approach regarding information requirements and respective policies of companies. (© 2014 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

This is aimed at developing a theoretical and empirical template for such policy tools that are increasingly being demanded in African ministries of finance and central banks. We have concretized it by building a macro-econometric model for Rwanda. The Rwanda macro-econometric model has 107 equations, of which 72 are endogenous. In addition, a supplementary ARIMA based model with 33 equations for exogenous variable is built to make the model useful for forecasting. The fiscal, balance of payment and money supply block of the model is fairly disaggregated to offer an adequate picture of the macro economy. An econometric estimation of the core behavioral equations of the model using equilibrium [error]-correction approach, with the database that stretches from 1960 to 2009 is made. The model can easily be further extended to the support budgeting, forecasting and macro-economic policy analysis work at the relevant ministries and central banks in Africa. We have managed to successfully solve the model and reproduced historical values from 1999 to 2009, and forecasted major macro variables for the year 2010 to 2015. We have also used the model to conduct a policy and external shock related simulation exercise that is very important for policy makers. We hope this model offers a theoretical and empirical framework for building similar applied macro models across Africa.</jats:p>"

Consistent with conditional conservatism extending to the aggregate level, I demonstrate that annual estimates of aggregate corporate profits and gross domestic product compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis are more sensitive to negative aggregate news than to positive aggregate news. Next, I estimate the dollar value impact of conservatism on measurements of macroeconomic fundamentals. Finally, I show that incorporating the dollar value impact of conservatism increases the explanatory power of a monetary policy reaction function that describes U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision behavior. These results suggest that accounting can impact social welfare by altering the measurement attributes of key macroeconomic indicators and by shaping monetary policy decisions that regulate the money supply.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JEL Classifications: M41; E43; E52.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the research results on mixing at other junction configurations, such as double-Tee junctions, were insufficient. Double-Tee junctions can potentially be misrepresented as cross junctions because of network skeletonization. Hence, the diffusion and dilution of the contaminants at junctions were largely underestimated. To examine the mixing phenomenon and collect accurate mixing data at the double-Tee junction, a series of laboratory experiments was carried out with various Reynolds number ratios at the inlets and outlets combined with different dimensionless connecting pipe lengths (L/D). Results showed that the dimensionless connecting pipe length served an important function in mixing at double-Tee junctions. The cross junction was the special case of the double-Tee joint when L/D=0. The complete mixing state occurred when L/D→∞. The mixing degree of the double-Tee junction was between the cross junction and the complete mixing state. A conceptual model that described the mixing behavior at double-Tee junctions was developed. The model included the use of the dimensionless parameter φ, which defined the degree of departure from complete mixing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The global community had launched a global target related to access to sustainable safe drinking water sources and had pursued a global monitoring and reporting program on progress made on access to drinking water sources. The universal indicator considered by the global community for this purpose is the proportion of the population with (or without) access to improved drinking water sources. An improved drinking water source is defined as one that is likely to be protected from outside contamination. However, monitoring and reporting progress using this indicator does not reflect the quality of service delivery, in particular the quantity, quality and continuity of drinking water supply. This paper presents the evaluation of the quality of service of the water supply in Lebanon based on additional national-specific indicators that can properly inform the quality of water supply service delivery. A method of evaluation of quality of service index (QSI) is proposed based on a fuzzy inference system. The results of evaluation of the QSI for the four regional water supply authorities in Lebanon for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2014 are then presented and discussed. Finally, the conclusion and further developments are presented.</jats:p>",

According to the research, when the carbon emission reduction cost-sharing contract is introduced into the model, it leads to a good consequence that the optimal order quantity of the low-carbon product increases, the retail price decreases, and the manufacturer and the retailer will get Pareto improvement on certain condition.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problem of bursts and leakages in water distribution systems has received significantly increased attention over the past two decades. As they represent both an environmental and an economical issue, how to reduce water loss through bursts and leakages is a challenging task for water utilities. Consequently, various techniques have been developed to detect the location and size of leakages. The methods for bursts (or leaks) detection and location can be broadly divided into two main categories, one based on hardware and the other based on software. Hardware-based methods include (i) acoustic detection methods such as listening rods, leak correlators, leak noise loggers and (ii) non-acoustic detection methods such as gas injection, ground penetrating radar technology and infrared photography. Software-based methods make use of the data collected by real-time pressure and/or flow sensors and several artificial intelligence techniques and statistical data analysis tools, including (i) methods based on numerical modeling methods, such as inverse transient analysis, time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis, and (ii) some non-numerical modeling methods, such as artificial neural networks, Bayesian inference systems, the Golden section method, and Kalman filtering. In this article, the authors describe the methods for pipe network burst location and detection, summarize the features of each method, and propose a suggestion for future work.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On June 12, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. The Bioterrorism Act requires domestic firms and importers to register their agribusiness facilities with the U.S. government, to notify Homeland Security prior to shipment of agricultural products, and to keep records on the origination of agricultural inputs and the destination of agricultural outputs. Thus, the Act significantly altered the U.S. regulatory climate for both U.S. and foreign food industry firms who do business in the U.S. We present evidence that the passage of the Bioterrorism Act resulted in an average 3.2% decline in the market value of equity of domestic food industry firms. Cross-sectional analysis suggests that costs are increasing in the diversity of the firms’ supply chains. Contrary to the conclusions of prior research, we also find that the Bioterrorism Act does not constitute a non-tariff barrier to Canadian food firms. We base this conclusion on the fact that the negative wealth effects for U.S. firms are similar in magnitude to those previously reported for Canadian firms.</jats:p>"

The newsvendor might procure options when demand is unknown, and decide how many options to execute only after demand is revealed. If the newsvendor reserves too many options, he would incur high reservation costs. Yet reserving too few could result in lost sales. So the newsvendor faces a trade‐off between reservation costs and losing sales. When there are multiple options available, the newsvendor has to consider how many units of each to reserve by studying the trade‐off between flexibility and costs. We show how the newsvendor's loss aversion behavior affects his ordering decision, and propose an efficient algorithm to compute his optimal solution in the general case with <jats:italic>n</jats:italic> options. We also present examples showing how the newsvendor's ordering strategy changes as loss aversion rises. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. 62:46–59, 2015</jats:p>",

Each battery is a self-contained Li-ion micro-battery enclosed in an insulating shell, and can charge/ discharge wirelessly or through contacts. Thousands of such batteries are carried by an inert fluid to form a power fluid to drive an electric vehicle. This power fluid can be stored in the tank and replaced easily with a fully charged fluid by refilling once its energy is depleted. The system can provide better energy density, higher power density, and extremely fast “charging” within minutes. The architecture eliminates the large over-capacity design in the current battery packs, significantly reducing the weight and cost. It would also enable progressive improvements of vehicle performance by replacing the micro-batteries. The battery system has flexible geometry, and therefore can essentially go into a storage space of any geometry, allowing uniform design of battery configurations for diverse applications.</jats:p>",

The primary purpose of the paper is to use recently sourced teacher education data from a range of national databases to determine to what extent state-led interventions are assisting to meet the foundation phase teacher supply and demand challenge. The data, as well as the more qualitative aspects of their context, are analysed at the macro (national) level to present a more nuanced picture of foundation phase teacher supply and demand. The study attempts to move beyond simply basing an analysis of supply and demand on teacher attrition, and takes into account multiple variables that should be considered in supply and demand planning. It also goes beyond simply matching supply to demand in the most recent year for which data is available, to forecasting a future scenario which will need to be planned for. The paper concludes by suggesting steps that should be taken to ensure a better match between supply and demand.</jats:p>"

This law requires the collection and disposal of technological waste through the implementation of Reverse Logistics Systems (RLS). In this study we discuss the main challenges and prospects in implementing WEEE reverse logistics in Brazil. The research was conducted through document analysis and interviews with different players, who are participants in the process of establishing a sector agreement. The findings suggest that the shared responsibility model proposed by the NPSW is not comprehensive enough to deal with the complexity of the Brazilian WEEE reverse chain. Based on this research we were able to propose a broader model covering the interrelationships among all the agents that interfere directly, indirectly, locally and abroad with the implementation of reverse logistics chain practices for electrical and electronic consumer goods in Brazil. DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n2p91-109URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n2p91-109</jats:p>"

Using detailed labor force data for Malaysia for 1990–2010, we provide estimates of native responses to immigration on multiple extensive margins and rare evidence for a developing country. Instrumental variable estimates show that increased immigration to a state causes substantial internal inward migration, consistent with the fact that immigration increases the demand for native workers. Relocating Malaysian workers are accompanied by their spouses (three‐quarters of whom are housewives) and children who attend school. We find that these effects are concentrated among middle‐ and lower‐skilled Malaysians.</jats:p>",

An Internet survey was completed by 464 adult regular cannabis users residing in the United Kingdom. Results indicate that over a quarter of the sample had bought large amounts (9 ounces [252 g] or more) of cannabis at one time, a third had been involved in selling cannabis for profit and over two fifths had been involved in intentionally taking cannabis across internal European Union borders. These findings are discussed in relation to both Parker, Aldridge, and Measham’s (1998) thesis of normalization and South’s (1999) theory of the “everyday” nature of drug taking. We suggest that the boundaries between users and suppliers within the U.K. cannabis market are far from clear, and that attempts to conceptually separate these behaviors, whether for legal, policy or academic purposes, are therefore problematic. </jats:p>",

It can help water utilities to implement active leakage control, conduct pressure management, and prevent network contamination. It is generally achieved by closing some network pipes, thus reducing pipe redundancy and affecting system performance. No systematic set of performance indices has been defined to evaluate a sectorization design and thus allow for a comparison of different possible sectorizations on a formal basis. In this paper, several performance indices for water network partitioning are proposed and tested using two real water supply systems: Parete in Italy and Matamoros in Mexico. Both systems' sectorizations were previously designed by a novel effective automatic technique recently developed by the authors. For both the original and sectorized networks, the proposed performance indices considered energy dissipated in the network, network resilience, pressure variation, fire-fighting capacity, water age, and mechanical redundancy. Network resilience appears to be the most representative index for the entire network, whereas pressure variation indices are more appropriate for describing individual districts. Except for fire-fighting capacity in one network, system performance did not appear to be affected significantly after sectorization.</jats:p>",

One is the measurement module which is placed on the high potential part, the other one is the processing module which is placed on the low potential part. The power and transfer distance demand of the measurement module is analyzed. Then a wireless power transfer system is designed to fulfill the need. A prototype system is founded to confirm the validity of our design. The results show that the device can work normally while the measurement and the processing module is 10cm away from each other, which means the proposed system is practicable.

Demand–supply mismatches (DSMs) could indicate that some or all of these subsystems are not working as expected, creating uncertainties about the overall capabilities and effectiveness of the SCM system, which can increase firm risk. This article documents the effect of DSMs on firm risk as measured by equity volatility. Our sample consists of three different types of DSMs announced by publicly traded firms: production disruptions, excess inventory, and product introduction delays. We find that all three types of DSMs result in equity volatility increases. Over a 2‐year period around the announcement date, we observe mean abnormal equity volatility increases of 5.62% for production disruptions, 11.19% for excess inventory, and 6.28% for product introduction delays. Volatility increases associated with excess inventory are significantly higher than the increases associated with production disruptions and product introduction delays. Across all three types of DSMs, volatility changes are positively correlated with changes in information asymmetry. The results provide some support that volatility changes are also correlated with changes in financial and operating leverage. </jats:p>",

Sampling and herborization of biological material followed methods described in literature. The species were classified by life forms. We found 90 species in 57 genera and 36 families, were 52.7% are monospecific. The richest reservoir was Passaúna (40 spp.), followed by Iraí, Piraquara I and Piraquara II (36 spp. each). Cyperaceae was the most representative with 17 spp., followed by Asteraceae, Onagraceae and Polygonaceae (7 spp. each). Amphibious and emergent life forms were equally express throughout species (41% each). Since aquatic macrophytes structure and contribute to environment biodiversity, the present study can assist management and implementation of biodiversity conservation efforts.</jats:p>"

The valvular apparatus of the heart is the complex system, which includes: the fibrous ring, cusps, tendinous cords and papillary muscles. The last two components are characteristic for the atriaventricular valvular apparatuses and they are absent in the ventricular-vascular valvular apparatuses. The valvular apparatuses of aorta and pulmonary trunk have the fibrous rings, the wall of aorta/pulmonary trunk, semilunar cusps. The laying of the valvular apparatuses begins on early stages of embryonic development and finishes before the beginning of fetal period of the prenatal ontogenesis. The normal function of the heart and human body is dependent on the complex interaction of all components of the valvular apparatus of the heart. Many discussions of the development, structure with peculiari ties of the blood supply, the age changes remain in the fundamental investigations. The modern diagnostic and medical apparatuses, the possibilities of the modern methods of investigations require from scientists the renewal of the known facts about the valvular apparatuses of the heart. They might be useful as the theoretical and practical background which will deepen the understanding of the pathogenesis and the quality of heart diseases treatment. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to intricacies, considerable risks are involved in product recovery operations, therefore core competency and experience are prerequisite for successful implementation of Reverse Logistics (RL).To overcome this, organizations are outsourcing the recovery operations and are opting for Third Party Recovery Facilitators (3PRF) to obtain prominent results. This paper contributes by proposing a decision model to address risks associated with product recovery and suggesting criteria for suitable 3PRF selection. The study also introduces a novel approach, combining Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and ELECTRE III methodologies to tackle this problem of 3PRF selection to improve decisions. ELECTRE III is a more reliable and pragmatic method, as it considers imprecision present in expert opinions and ensures that an extremely low score on a criterion cannot be compensated by good scores on other criteria. Subsequently, ISM methodology is used for identifying relationships among various criteria to determine the most significant ones. ELECTRE III method is then applied to select the most appropriate 3PRF based on the most significant criteria. The application of this novel approach can reduce risk involved and time during the process of recovery facilitator selection. Additionally, case study has been conducted to show the practical implementation of ELECTRE III methodology in selection process.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n2p37-58URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n2p27-58</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>AIM: This study analyzed - the diel and vertical dynamics of phytoplankton functional groups in a natural tropical lake (Extremoz Lake, northeast Brazil), to investigate and understand the driver factors of the community during a severe drought period. METHODS: Sampling of the abiotic variables and phytoplankton was performed at intervals of 6 hours over 24 hours in vertical profiles, in dry and rainy seasons (according to the historical average). The phytoplankton species were grouped according to the functional groups' approach sensu Reynolds et al. (2002). RESULTS: October/12 was considered as a dry period (18.4 mm), while March/13, due to the historical average, as a rainy season, due to the low rainfall during the study period (15.7 mm), it was called severe drought. The lake showed thermal and chemical destratification in both periods. Phytoplankton biomass was higher in the dry season and their vertical distribution was stratified in both periods. In both samplings there were less algal biomass during the night. Phytoplankton functional groups of mixed and shallow systems (S1, L0 and K) were descriptors throughout the study period with higher biomass always registered in the group S1, represented by Planktolyngbya limnetica (Cyanobacteria). CONCLUSION: The lack of seasonality observed in this study, due to prolonged drought, may have influenced the pattern of homogeneous behavior in both samplings. This pattern strongly influenced the vertical distribution of phytoplankton in the two periods, with a constancy of dominance of functional descriptors groups.</jats:p>",

The aim of this is to develop a model of supply chain management focusing on the identification and minimization of waste, assisting in decision making and contributing to the quality of services and as a consequence the reduction of the costs involved in healthcare supply chain. The philosophies of continuous improvement and lean techniques have a role to play in helping healthcare to provide quality service and support to reduce costs in the current budget constraints. In the supply chain of hospitals the financial costs can be around 40% of its budget (MASOUMI et al. 2012; SOUZA et al., 2013). This article sheds light on the improvement in decision making and the effect of reducing costs in the healthcare supply chain. In this sense, the research intend to expand knowledge related to supply chain management in the area of provision of healthcare services through the use of the philosophy of continuous improvement and lean principles, helping healthcare to provide quality service within their current budget constraints.</jats:p>"

The complexity of the financial sector means that a wide range of financial variables is needed to fully characterize its functioning in real time. In this paper we construct a financial conditions index (FCI) for the euro area following the studies by Hatzius et al. and Brave and Butters. Our FCI successfully tracks both worldwide and euro‐area‐specific financial events. We then incorporate the FCI into a VAR model comprising output, inflation, the monetary policy rate, bank loans and bank lending spreads to identify credit supply shocks with sign restrictions. These shocks are estimated to have caused around one‐fifth of the decline in euro‐area manufacturing production at the trough of the financial crisis and a rise in bank lending spreads of around 30 basis points.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The City Blueprint® is a set of 24 dedicated indicators divided over eight categories, i.e., water security, water quality, drinking water, sanitation, infrastructure, climate robustness, biodiversity and attractiveness, and governance including public participation. In 2006 the various urban water-related services in Amsterdam were brought under one roof, culminating in the country's first water cycle company called Waternet. Waternet is responsible for surface water (rivers, canals, ditches and lakes), groundwater, stormwater, drinking water supply and waste water treatment. The city's unique water cycle approach has proved highly beneficial. Currently Amsterdam is the best performing city of the 30 cities assessed so far. This can be explained by: (1) a long-term vision and a multi-level water governance approach, (2) integration of water, energy and material flows (e.g., struvite production), (3) the entanglement between urban quality and water management, and (4) the transparent communication to and feed-back from customers, i.e., farmers and citizens. Surface water quality and biodiversity remain future challenges.</jats:p>",

And, this task was performed using the Stated Preference Technique, a tool not so widespread among operations management researchers. The research focused the small retail food stores in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, considering the complexity involved in the delivery of perishable and fragile foods. As result, the technique show us the relative importance of the attributes related to the service level, highlighting the high degree of relevance achieved by the attributes that define the service level. This means that gaps in services are not easily shadowed by compensatory practices of stock build-up, which are financially very burdensome or unviable in terms of storage area. This kind of approach may call attention to opportunities of improving buyer-supplier relationships and the management of these processes, as well as public issues.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv7n2p26-36URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv7n2p26-36</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a decentralized assembly supply chain in which an assembler (she) assembles a set of n components, each produced by a different supplier (he), into a final product to satisfy an uncertain market demand. Each supplier holds private cost information to himself, for which the assembler only has a subjective estimate. Furthermore, the assembler believes that the suppliers' costs follow a joint discrete probability distribution. The assembler aims to design an optimal menu of contracts to maximize her own expected profit. The assembler's problem is a complex multi‐dimensional constrained optimization problem. We prove that there exists a unique optimal menu of contracts for the assembler, and we further develop an efficient algorithm with a complexity of O( n) to compute the optimal contract. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to analyze how environmental parameters affect individual firm's performance and the value of information to the assembler, to each supplier, and to the supply chain. Our results suggest that each supplier's private cost information becomes more valuable to the assembler and each supplier when the average market demand increases or when the final product unit revenue increases. Surprisingly, when a supplier's cost volatility increases and its mean remains the same, the value of information to the assembler or to each supplier does not necessarily increase. Furthermore, we show that when the suppliers' cost distributions become more positively correlated, the suppliers are always worse off, but the assembler is better off. However, the value of information for the assembler might increase or decrease. </jats:p>",

In 2010, the occupation of the Brazilian soil consists of 20.8% pasture, 6.8% agriculture, 0.8% forested areas, 61.0% natural forests, and 9.7% other areas. In 2012, of the total area of the country 3.25% (27.65 million ha) is occupied by soy bean cultivation and 1% (8.5 million ha) by sugar cane cultivation. In 2012, the main cultivated species in the country were <jats:italic>Eucalyptus</jats:italic> spp. (71.0%), Pinus spp. (21.75%), <jats:italic>Acacia mearnsii</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Acacia mangium</jats:italic> (2.12%), <jats:italic>Hevea brasiliensis</jats:italic> (2.36%), and <jats:italic>Schizolobium amazonicum</jats:italic> (1.22%). From 2004 to 2012, the planted forest area growth was 50.4%. The main factor that boosted this growth was the demand of the pulp and paper, followed by wood-based panels sector. It is also notable the development of new planted forests in Brazil for energy purposes. In recent decades, scientific and technological advance shave resulted in significant improvements in productivity, resistance to diseases, uniform degree of the forest plantations, wood quality etc. Among the most researched species are the ones belonging to <jats:italic>Eucalyptus</jats:italic> gender for having excellent adaptability to the edaphoclimatic conditions in the country. The current average productivity of <jats:italic>Eucalyptus</jats:italic> is of 40.7 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/ha·year. In some regions of the country the average productivity of Eucalyptus has reached 100 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/ha·year. The Brazilian forestry industry uses mainly planted forests, and the pulp and paper industry consumes only this type of wood. The pulp and wood panel sectors are more technologically advanced in relation to the other wood products sectors.</jats:p>",

The computation of control strategies by MPC uses a simplified model of the network dynamics. The use of the combined approach of optimization and simulation contributes to making sure that the effect of more complex dynamics, better represented by the simulation model, may be taken into account. Coordination between simulator and optimizer works in a feedback scheme, from which both real-time interaction and extensive validation of the proposed solution have been realized using a case study based on the Catalunya regional water network. </jats:p>",

Firstly, we analyzed the LUCC and climate change in the upper reach during 1990–2005; then the water supply service, which was represented by the annual water yield, was estimated with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Thereafter three scenarios (precipitation change and LUCC change combined, LUCC change only, and precipitation change only) were established to analyze the impacts of LUCC and precipitation change on the water yield. The results show that the LUCC exerted great influence on water yield, while the impact of precipitation change is even more significant than that of LUCC. Although there are still some uncertainties, the results of this study can still provide valuable reference information for ecological conservation and water resource management in the upper reach of the Heihe River Basin.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Currently, distributed supply chain production planning (SCPP) is a practical problem affecting global supply chain production. Distributed SCPP is a complex constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) comprising a series of constraints intra- and inter-production members on orders, capacity, and materials. Previous studies have proposed various advanced planning and scheduling (APS) algorithms for companies to solve internal CSPs related to production planning. Distributed SCPP problems additionally require a coordination approach to resolve conflicts among the production plans of individual production members. Several distributed CSP (DCSP) algorithms have been proposed to guide the coordination for various DCSP conditions and objectives. Based on these techniques, we propose a coordination approach for achieving consistency among individual production plans to develop an integral supply chain production plan. First, we employed an APS system to resolve the internal production planning constraints and to develop a feasible production plan for each production member. Next, we developed a hybrid DCSP coordination algorithm based on agent-ordering asynchronous weak-commitment search (AWS) algorithm and asynchronous incremental relaxation (IR) algorithm concepts to facilitate production planning coordination and resolve constraint conflicts among individual production plans. Finally, a thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) supply chain was used to illustrate and verify the proposed coordination approach. </jats:p>",

Key elements of a successful SCT are the selection of a suitable surrogate and a reliable quantification method. A major challenge when using nanoparticles as surrogates is their quantification in the filtrate, since commonly used particle detection methods are often lacking in sensitivity. The applicability of laser-induced breakdown-detection (LIBD) as a monitoring tool for SCTs has therefore been evaluated. The SCTs were carried out using polystyrene (PS) and silicate particles spiked into ultrapure water and into bank filtrate. Nanoparticles were detectable down to 10 nm and, depending on the material, down to a few ng/L. The nominal pore-size of the ultrafiltration membrane could be confirmed during the tests, demonstrating the suitability of LIBD as a highly sensitive monitoring technique for SCTs.</jats:p>",

The estimated total RAP was 154.49 million m3 in 2013. About 53% of rainwater could be effectively harvested for use, among which the rooftops had the highest harvesting ratio of 70%, and contributed about half of the total RAP. Indirect use of rainwater can be achieved through infiltration facilities, of which concave green land construction and porous brick pavement can increase the amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil by 18.89% and 55.69%, respectively.

In this paper, a non-isolated ac–dc converter is proposed as the first stage converter to obtain a regulated dc output rather than using a simple uncontrolled diode bridge rectifier at the front end. A dc–dc converter is used at the second stage that has a high frequency transformer with multiple secondary windings to obtain different dc voltage levels at the output. The proposed bridgeless converter based power supply is designed using fundamental design equations, and different component values are calculated. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed bridgeless converter based multi-output computer power supply at varying source voltages and load conditions. Experimental validation of the power supply is carried on a developed hardware prototype, and the test results are compared with the simulated performance for design verification.</jats:p>",

We present a model of individual choice with home production and, using a harmonized dataset (the Cross‐National Equivalent File), we estimate its main comparative static results. The results suggest that the share of immigrants working in services is positively associated with an increase of native‐born women's labour supply at the intensive margin, if skilled, and at the extensive margin, if unskilled. Moreover, the results show that these effects are larger in countries with less‐supportive family policies.</jats:p>",

Weather shocks can directly reduce crop production, but their effect on food markets is partly buffered by storage and supply responses that can be complex and nuanced. We explore how inter-hemispheric trade and supply responses can moderate the effects of weather shocks on global food supply by enabling potential intra-annual arbitrage. Our estimates of this effect in the case of wheat and soybeans suggest that it may be considerable: 25–50% of crop production lost to a shock in the Southern Hemisphere is offset six months later by increased production in the North. These results have implications for the potential effects of climate change on global food markets, for how we model these interactions and, possibly, for the design of trade and production-related policies that aim to leverage this inter-hemispheric buffer more effectively. </jats:p>",

Switching combinations that threatened to exceed constraints were rejected heuristically. Flows were balanced by linear programming (LP). The genetic algorithm gave confidence in the near-optimality of its solutions, through the well-defined Pareto fronts between the competing objectives. The method was applied to a 16-reservoir water distribution system in Durban, South Africa.

We find that plants will exploit the intensive margin as well as the extensive margin to secure additional amounts of stover. Our results show, counterintuitively, that a market for stover may result in lower soil erosion due to reallocations of land to continuous corn with removal, which, combined with no‐till farming, results in lower soil erosion than the baseline without stover removal. Also contrary to expectations, using cover crops with stover removal may result in higher soil erosion due to land use changes within the fuel shed associated with optimal pricing.</jats:p>",

This paper highlights the combination of centralized and decentralized systems, which is referred to as hybrid water supply systems. The system is hypothesized to generate more sustainable and resilient urban water systems. The basic concept is to use decentralized water supply options such as rainwater tanks, storm water harvesting and localized wastewater treatment and reuse in combination with centralized systems. Currently the impact of hybrid water supply technologies on the operational performance of the downstream infrastructure and existing treatment processes is yet to be known. The paper identifies a number of significant research gaps related to interactions between centralized and decentralized urban water services. It indicates that an improved understanding of the interaction between these systems is expected to provide a better integration of hybrid systems by improved sewerage and drainage design, as well as facilitate operation and maintenance planning. The paper also highlights the need for a framework to better understand the interaction between different components of hybrid water supply systems.</jats:p>"

Deviation of the projected yield from actual comes to 31%, and the forecasting yield of the moving average drops to 4.6%. During the observation period the spring wheat productivity increased from 11.6 to 18.7 kilogram per hectare, an increase was 7.1 tons per hectare with an average yield of 17.4 tons per hectare. The productivity of spring wheat exhibits a very unstable value, which is evidenced by the high variation coefficient - 43.3%. There is a positive correlation between security soil by phosphorus, potassium and spring wheat yield. It is positive according to phosphorus for the actual and derivative wheat yield, the higher rates of coefficients was according U11. Potassium also has a positive association with yield. However, the correlation coefficients of potassium are higher (0.57-0.0.94), than of phosphorus (0.50-0.84). This fact suggests, that potassium in macroelement is more scarce, than phosphorus. Apparently, this feature of mobile potassium is manifested by solubility characteristics of the potassium compounds in aqueous medium, despite a sufficient amount of its gross shapes in soils. Studies prove once again, that the basis of of productivity formation is security by nutrient macroelements and peculiarities of economic activities. In addition to more accurately actual spring wheat yield it is necessary to attract agro-climatic indicators. The projections data are also a good tool for assessing the economic activity of individual districts, regions, and land users of different levels.</jats:p>",

Inherent features of construction projects, such as high repetition, complexity and uniqueness  on  the  one  hand,  and  advances  in  technology  and  methodologies  on  the  other, create more difficulties in planning construction delivery. This is true for bridge operations. This study presents an innovative incremental beam launching method with twin truss gantry. This construction method has significant advantages in terms of cost and speed of performance, but increases the level of planning and management required for the bridge operation. Further, because of the newness of the method, no specific Work Breakdown Structure nor conceptual framework has been developed as yet.

Assessment of pain (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS], pain DETECT, knee\nfunction [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index- WOMAC])\nwere documented pre and post PRF at 3 and 6 months. Knee radiographs (KellgrenLawrence [K-L] grading) were done before PRF and one week later. All the patients showed\na sustained improvement of NRS, pain DETECT, and WOMAC at 3 and 6 months. The\nsignificant improvement of patellar position and tibio-femoral joint space was concordant\nwith the patient’s reporting of improvement in stiffness and pain. The sustained pain relief\nand muscle relaxation enabled the patients to optimize physiotherapy thereby improving\nendurance training to include the daily activities of life.

Our analysis includes long‐term climate (weather) trends and water supply conditions as well as seasonal water supply forecasts. A farm‐level panel data set, which accounts for the priority effects of water rights and controls for diversified crop mixes and rotation practices, is used. Our results indicate that farmers respond to the long‐term surface and ground water conditions as well as to the seasonal water supply variations. Climate change‐induced variations in climate and water supply conditions could lead to substantial damages to irrigated agriculture. We project substantial losses (up to 32%) of the average crop revenue for major agricultural areas under future climate scenarios in Idaho. Finally, farmers demonstrate significantly varied responses given their water rights priorities, which imply that the distributional impact of climate change is sensitive to institutions such as the Prior Appropriation Doctrine.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Transportation of sweet cherry fruits to distant markets and further marketing processes often takes approximately 2-3 weeks. The present study investigates the quality changes during this time period at three stages for three sweet cherry cultivars: â€˜Early Burlatâ€™, â€˜Napoleonâ€™, and â€˜0900 Ziraatâ€™. Following pre-cooling, the sweet cherries were placed in modified atmosphere packages and exposed to the following stages for the indicated durations: transportation (T) [8 days at 2 Â°C and 85% relative humidity (RH)]; distribution center (DC) (4 days at 6.5 Â°C and 80% RH), and shelf-life (SL) (2 days at 19 Â°C and 70% RH). Weight losses at the end of the SL stage were 3.11, 3.18, and 2.74%, respectively in â€˜Early Burlatâ€™, â€˜Napoleonâ€™ and â€˜0900 Ziraatâ€™.Fruit firmness decreased after SL as compared to that at other stages and was more remarkable in â€˜0900 Ziraatâ€™. Decreased Chroma values which indicates, the intensity or color saturation were observed in all cultivars, whereas decreased hue angle values colours expressed in degrees were observed in the â€˜Early Burlatâ€™ and â€˜0900 Ziraatâ€™. In addition, a decrease was noted in the titratable acidity of all cultivars at the end of SL. The total soluble solids, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activities were similar for all cultivars at all stages. The visual appearance scores of â€˜Early Burlatâ€™ cherries decreased at the end of SL, because of development of pitting on the fruit surface. The fruit quality changes were limited at T and DC stages; however, these changes became more distinctive during the SL period. It was thus concluded that the SL duration and conditions were of the highest significance with regard to maintenance of the sweet cherry fruit quality.</jats:p>"

Extending Carter and Jennings’ department‐level study of purchasing social responsibility, our research assesses the role of supply managers’ ethical intentions and three key antecedents that drive socially responsible supplier selection. Comparing evidence from firms operating in China, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, we identify three key drivers of supply managers’ ethical intentions and examine both their direct and indirect impacts on socially responsible supplier selection. We find differential support for the predictor relationships on supply manager ethical intentions across national contexts and mediated versus nonmediated models. These observations bear important implications for firms conducting global supply management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The growing practice of environmental supply chain management by firms constitutes private sector regulation that is analogous in many ways to public sector regulation. Similarly to their public counterparts, private sector regulators set standards, apply standards, monitor for compliance, apply sanctions and require corrective action. Private sector regulation differs, however, in the source of authority, external oversight, analytical requirements, public participation and available sanctions. This article argues that supply chain management by firms goes beyond business objectives by creating positive environmental externalities for society, and that more systematic study of the similarities and contrasts between the two forms of regulation may provide valuable lessons for both. Further, it may be possible to increase the effectiveness of private sector regulation to achieve both public societal and private business goals. From a business perspective, supply chain management enables firms to strategically redefine their relationships with government, reduce uncertainty and promote goal‐oriented collaboration.

The methodology is a combination of theoretical analysis, Delphi quantitative method and Combined Fuzzy Multiple Attribute Evaluation (CFMAE) method. First of all, based on theories on textile supply chain, we developed a hierarchical system for performance measurement. After three Delphi rounds to seek opinions of experts on the system, the CFMAE which consists of two phases (fuzzy integral and fuzzy analysis hierarchy process – FAHP) was conducted to build a supply chain performance measurement system in textile industry with general attributes. The study has constructed a supply chain performance measurement system in textile industry in Ho Chi Minh City with suitable attributes. The weight of attributes is determined as a general viewpoint of the industry of the importance of the attributes to the supply chain performance. In terms of practicality, this paper provides an approach in the performance measurement for the textile supply chain that serves as a framework for a centralized and effective improvement. The scientific meaning of this paper is the application of the fuzzy logic in economics and management to eliminate the subjectivity in the decision making process.</jats:p>"

Based on the conceptualized model we infer that motivational expectations of developers and investors in green building construction and supply are rooted in the quest for profit maximization, financial viability of green construction, expected rate of return, monetary incentives, green certification and awards, public image, social and ethical responsibility. However, it is predicted that the nature and strength of relationships among some of these factors will be moderated by available green building skills.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we present an analytical framework in a single-channel supply chain and a dual-channel supply chain, respectively. We compare the optimal service levels under different scenarios to investigate the impacts of bidirectional free-riding and service competition on members' decisions. In order to realize system optimization, we propose contracts to coordinate the decentralized supply chain under different cases. We find that when a new channel is added, the retailer will always increase his service level to compete with the manufacturer, while the manufacturer needs to take the relationship with the retailer into consideration and decides whether to increase or decrease her service level. We also find that the contracts for different cases can make the optimal solutions the same as those under the centralized scenario by adjusting service levels based on the relative size of competition effect and spillover effect. Finally, we conduct numerical examples to verify the existence of Pareto improvement intervals and derive some managerial insights.</jats:p>",

This study proposes a new methodology to quantify the risk of supply insecurity with weather condition based operation of PHEVs in an active distribution network. The approach divides operating characteristics of PHEVs into charging, discharging and null. Operation of PHEVs with change in weather conditions, intermittent characteristics of distributed generation, sector customer demand characteristics and random outages of components are modelled on Markov‐chain Monte Carlo simulation. A set of case studies are performed considering distributed operation of PHEVs as oppose to central operation of conventional units. Results suggest that distributed operation of PHEVs can potentially mitigate risk of supply insecurity of moderately stressed networks. Highly stressed networks, which are operated with PHEVs, need supplementary supports from conventional units to mitigate risk of supply insecurity.</jats:p>",

Notre étude a porté sur une analyse dans laquelle nous avons examiné l'association de trois caractéristiques juridictionnelles sélectionnés avec la fourniture des lits LTC: la démographie de l'âge de la population, les ressources économiques des provinces, et les investissements provinciaux dans les soins à domicile. On n'a pas trouvé de l'écologie interjuridictionelle importante ni d'interrelation entre la variation de l'approvisionne-ment de lits des SLD avec aucune des variables étudiées. La variation entre les provinces pour le disponibilité de lits n'a également pas influencé statistiquement du jour à l'autre le niveau de soins spécifiques pour l'attente des SLD, ce qui suggère que ces jours ne sont pas influencés simplement par des différences dans l'approvisionnement de lits des SLD, et que d'autres facteurs au niveau provincial étaient en jeu.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider coordination issues in supply chains where supplier's production process is subject to random yield losses. For a simple supply chain with a single supplier and retailer facing deterministic demand, a pay back contract which has the retailer paying a discount price for the supplier's excess units can provide the right incentive for the supplier to increase his production size and achieve coordination. Building upon this result, we consider coordination issues for two other supply chains: one with competing retailers, the other with stochastic demand. When retailers compete for both demand and supply, they tend to over‐order. We show that a combination of a pay back and revenue sharing mechanism can coordinate the supply chain, with the pay back mechanism correcting the supplier's under‐producing problem and the revenue sharing mechanism correcting the retailers' over‐ordering problem. When demand is stochastic, we consider a modified pay‐back‐revenue‐sharing contract under which the retailer agrees to not only purchase the supplier's excess output (beyond the retailer's order), but also share with the supplier a portion of the revenue made from the sales of the excess output. We show that this contract, by giving the supplier additional incentives in the form of revenue share, can achieve coordination. </jats:p>",

Consequently characterizing the quality risk posed by value‐chain partners has become increasingly important. There have been several recent efforts to develop frameworks for rating the quality risk posed by suppliers. We develop an analytical model to examine the impact of such quality ratings on suppliers, manufacturers, and social welfare. While it might seem that quality ratings would benefit high‐quality suppliers and hurt low‐quality suppliers, we show that this is not always the case. We find that such quality ratings can hurt both types of suppliers or benefit both, depending on the market conditions. We also find that quality ratings do not always benefit the most demanding manufacturers who desire high‐quality suppliers. Finally, we find that social welfare is not always improved by risk ratings. These results suggest that public policy initiatives addressing risk ratings must be carefully considered. </jats:p>",

Groundwater is needed for the drinking water security of Chennai and overexploitation has resulted in depletion and seawater intrusion. Current policies at the municipal; state and national level all support recharge of groundwater and rainwater harvesting to counter groundwater depletion. However, despite such favorable policies, the legal framework and the administrative praxis do not support systematic approaches towards managed aquifer recharge in the periphery of Chennai. The present study confirms this, considering the mandates of governmental key-actors and a survey of the preferences and motives of stakeholder representatives. There are about 25 stakeholder groups with  interests in groundwater issues, but they lack a common vision. For example, conflicting interest of stakeholders may hinder implementation of certain types of managed aquifer recharge methods. To overcome this problem, most stakeholders support the idea to establish an authority in the state for licensing groundwater extraction and overseeing managed aquifer recharge.</jats:p>"

The supplier firms took on these projects to reduce worker dissatisfaction and employee turnover. The projects fill an institutional void in employer–employee relations within Chinese supplier firms as they provide alternative channels for workers to voice their concerns. The role of civil society organisations focusing on labour interests was a crucial feature of the projects, through capacity-building for workers and by providing independence. The supplier firms and their workers have benefitted as firms take measures to enhance worker satisfaction, while the reduced employee turnover positively impacted firm performance. We propose that these collaborative socially responsible practices are a potential way to strengthen the positions of workers and supplier firms in global supply chains. </jats:p>",

Recent evidence has shown that failure to manage supply chains responsibly can have significant impacts on firms' reputation and financial performance. In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework, which focuses on organizational learning, and outline specific channels through which firms can generate learning processes and build appropriate capabilities to successfully implement social and environmental supply chain policies. Drawing on 57 in‐depth interviews from a cross‐sectional sample of seven UK and nine German companies, we empirically assess our conceptual framework in accordance with a grounded, in‐depth case study analysis approach. We find compelling evidence to suggest that organizational learning is an important factor for a successful implementation of sustainable supply chain management. Organizational learning is often established as a result of training, knowledge acquisition, stakeholder engagement and collaboration between intra‐organizational and inter‐organizational partners, including suppliers and NGOs. Nonetheless, our results also emphasize that firms often have few systematic processes through which organizational learning is developed, and that such learning processes are often ad hoc at best, which in turn has significant implications for the responsible supply chain practices.

A mixed‐integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed with the objective to maximize profit per unit freshwater consumption, such that both economic performance and water‐use efficiency are optimized. The model simultaneously accounts for the design and operational decisions for freshwater source selection, multiple transportation modes, and water management options. Water management options include disposal, commercial centralized wastewater treatment, and onsite treatment (filtration, lime softening, thermal distillation). To globally optimize the resulting MILFP problem efficiently, three tailored solution algorithms are presented: a parametric approach, a reformulation‐linearization method, and a novel Branch‐and‐Bound and Charnes–Cooper transformation method. The proposed models and algorithms are illustrated through two case studies based on Marcellus shale play, in which onsite treatment shows its superiority in improving freshwater conservancy, maintaining a stable water flow, and reducing transportation burden. © 2014 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 61: 1184–1208, 2015</jats:p>",

Groundwater has average fluorine levels of 2.33 mg/L in PZ town ranging from 0.65 to 9.87 mg/L and of 0.91 mg/L ranging from 0.27 to 1.25 mg/L in TS town. The geochemical indexes indicate seawater intrusion in the both areas, the more serious seawater intrusion in PZ town causes the higher pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), HCO3− and Na+ than TS town, which can accelerate fluorine leach ability from rock/soil and result in higher fluorine than in TS town. So, the seawater intrusion is related to groundwater fluorine levels. Moreover, the groundwater shows the contrary process of cation exchange. That is, the exchange of Na+ to Ca2+ in TS town occurs and that of Ca2+ to Na+ occurs in PZ town during seawater intrusion. As a result, PZ town has relatively higher Na+ and lower Ca2+ than TS town, and the groundwater types transform from Ca-Cl type in TS town to Na-Cl type in PZ town with the ongoing seawater intrusion. Such a process decreases fluorine solubility in groundwater and contributes to lower fluorine levels in TS town. Therefore, the seawater intrusion and the special cation exchange explain well the different fluorine levels in the two areas, which should be considered when the fluorine enrichment is discussed in coastal regions.</jats:p>",

There is a need for robust evidence to help the NHS make informed decisions about how to make such savings and there is potential for lessons to be learned from activities and initiatives implemented elsewhere to enable the adoption of good practice. The work presented in this report seeks to contribute to this process by advancing our understanding of the evidence on procurement and supply chain management (SCM) in sectors within and outside health care that can inform practice in the NHS.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-2\"><jats:title>Objectives</jats:title><jats:p>Principally drawing on a rapid evidence assessment (REA), we sought to (1) describe approaches to procurement and SCM in selected areas (including, but not limited to, manufacturing and automotive sectors, defence, information and communication technology, and pharmaceutical industries) and (2) identify best practices that may inform procurement and SCM in the NHS.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-3\"><jats:title>Data sources</jats:title><jats:p>Searches were conducted across MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Academic Search Complete, Social Sciences Abstracts, Military and Government Collection, EconLit and Business Source Complete from January 2006 to November 2013, and Google Scholar, Web of Science and Business Source Complete for articles on specific sectors.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-4\"><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>We conducted a REA of the published and grey literature in a range of non-health-care and health-care sectors from 2006 onwards.

Findings highlighted that there is awareness in scholarly research and industry that SCM and procurement are areas for creating efficiencies and cost savings. We found that collective approaches to purchasing, improving relationships with suppliers, building capabilities and skills for purchasing decisions and the use of technology for data and materials management may lead to more efficient procurement and potentially save costs.

Although this still yielded a large number of studies (13,191), it is possible that this approach missed studies that would have been of relevance for this review. Studies that reported empirical findings only were included for final review, but this definition was broadened to include single case studies in order to capture the limited cases of interventions in practice and find examples of what can be learned from practice rather than theory.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-7\"><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Many of the studies identified are only described as before-and-after studies and do not include evaluations of their effects. We identified four recommendations for further research. First, there is a need for further research using rigorous methodology to assess the effectiveness of different types of interventions in different settings for improving purchasing and SCM. Second, empirical research on current practices in health-care purchasing and SCM, or evaluation of new practices in health-care settings, should be implemented. Third, an evaluation of the Department of Health’s 2013 Procurement Development Programme and its recommendations provides an opportunity to focus future evaluation efforts. Finally, there is a need for increased interdisciplinary work across health-care management and SCM.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"abs1-8\"><jats:title>Funding</jats:title><jats:p>The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

Currently  in  New  Zealand  (NZ),  there  is  little  or  no  information  on  the  various contractual risks and their mitigation measures.

This study aimed to establish priority contractual risks in the NZ construction industry, and their mitigation measures.  The research was based on a questionnaire survey of consultants and contractors. Descriptive statistics and multi-attribute techniques were used in the data analysis. Results showed 21 risk factors which were segregated into 6 broad categories in diminishing levels of significance as follows: Site conditions, main contractor, pricing, subcontractor, external and client-related risks. Putting tags and conditions to risky price items in the tender bids, and transferring the risks onto other parties were analysed as the 2 most effective out of the 5 key risk mitigation measures identified.

RO membrane modification by heat treatment reduced fouling and improved boron rejection. However, heat treatment also caused a decrease in the water permeability of RO membranes. Significant improvement on fouling resistance by heat treatment was observed when RO concentrate was used to simulate a feed solution with high fouling propensity. The improved fouling resistance is likely to be due to changes in the hydrophobic interaction between the membrane surface and foulants. Boron rejection by the ESPA2 membrane was enhanced by heat treatment from 26 to 68% (when evaluated at the permeate flux of 20 L/m2 h). Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy revealed that heat treatment did not significantly influence the free-volume hole-radius of the membrane active skin layer. The results reported in this study suggested that changes in the other membrane properties such as free-volume fraction and thickness may be the main cause improving boron rejection.</jats:p>",

The aboveground biomass of trees in the Woodland and Acacia seyal shrubland zones, were 16.87 tonsDM/ha and 10.99 tonsDM/ha respectively (mean 13.93 ± 4.16 tonsDM/ha). Aboveground biomass density in the herbaceous layer was 2.62, 4.21 and 6.9 tonsDM/ha, in the Woodland, Acacia seyal shrubland and Floodplain zones, respectively (mean 4.58 ± 2.16 tonsDM/ha), the difference between the vegetation zones being significant. The overall aboveground plant biomass density of the park averaged 13.86 ± 6.4 tonsDM/ha, however the harvestable food supply for elephants was a small portion of that estimate. The estimated plant biomass represented an average for the dry season, which is more useful for long-term planning purposes than for annual predictions of the level of forage production in the dry season. To minimize elephant encroachment into cultivated fields, it is necessary to estimate the park's carrying capacity and regulate the population size if necessary. This however will rely on the long-term prediction of forage production in the Waza National Park through continuous measurements of plant biomass density during the dry season. </jats:p>",

Wetland soil organic matter (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOM</jats:styled-content>) benefits air and water quality by sequestering large masses of C and N. Yet, the accumulation of wetland <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOM</jats:styled-content> depends on soil inundation, so we hypothesized that groundwater abstraction would diminish stocks of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOM</jats:styled-content>, C, and N in wetland soils. Predictions of this hypothesis were tested in two types of subtropical, depressional‐basin wetland: forested swamps and herbaceous‐vegetation marshes. In west‐central Florida, &gt;650 ML groundwater day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> are abstracted for use primarily in the Tampa Bay metropolis. At higher abstraction volumes, water tables were lower and wetlands had shorter hydroperiods (less time inundated). In turn, wetlands with shorter hydroperiods had 50–60% less <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOM</jats:styled-content>, C, and N per kg soil. In swamps, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SOM</jats:styled-content> loss caused soil bulk density to double, so areal soil C and N storage per m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> through 30.5 cm depth was diminished by 25–30% in short‐hydroperiod swamps. In herbaceous‐vegetation marshes, short hydroperiods caused a sharper decline in N than in C. Soil organic matter, C, and N pools were not correlated with soil texture or with wetland draining‐reflooding frequency. Many years of shortened hydroperiod were probably required to diminish soil organic matter, C, and N pools by the magnitudes we observed. This diminution might have occurred decades ago, but could be maintained contemporarily by the failure each year of chronically drained soils to retain new organic matter inputs. In sum, our study attributes the contraction of hydroperiod and loss of soil organic matter, C, and N from rural wetlands to groundwater abstraction performed largely for urban water supply, revealing teleconnections between rural ecosystem change and urban resource demand.</jats:p>",

At this point, a sufficient body of empirical SCM research has been put forward to allow for quantitative assessment of the field. Therefore, we examine three key elements of study design to assess what has happened, what is currently happening, and where we should be heading as a field. To do so, following a pattern of reviews in similar disciplines, we begin with an examination of effect sizes of the relationships under investigation. Results show that effect sizes in SCM research have marginally increased over time and that sub‐domains within SCM that receive the most scholarly attention also have higher effect sizes. We also conduct a post hoc analysis of statistical power and empirically examine a range of factors and study contexts that could influence power. Findings suggest that average statistical power in SCM research exceeds the statistical power of most related disciplines and is particularly high in several unique contexts. Lastly, we find that measurement reliability and the use of control variables have increased over time, possibly suggesting the field has matured, instilling a degree of confidence in its research. Overall, our results show that SCM research is becoming more empirically rigorous, but we also uncover key areas that warrant improvement. We describe implications of our review for the design of future SCM empirical studies.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Deviation of the projected yield from actual comes to 31%, and the forecasting yield of the moving average drops to 4.6%. During the observation period the spring wheat productivity increased from 11.6 to 18.7 kilogram per hectare, an increase was 7.1 tons per hectare with an average yield of 17.4 tons per hectare. The productivity of spring wheat exhibits a very unstable value, which is evidenced by the high variation coefficient - 43.3%. There is a positive correlation between security soil by phosphorus, potassium and spring wheat yield. It is positive according to phosphorus for the actual and derivative wheat yield, the higher rates of coefficients was according U11. Potassium also has a positive association with yield. However, the correlation coefficients of potassium are higher (0.57-0.0.94), than of phosphorus (0.50-0.84). This fact suggests, that potassium in macroelement is more scarce, than phosphorus. Apparently, this feature of mobile potassium is manifested by solubility characteristics of the potassium compounds in aqueous medium, despite a sufficient amount of its gross shapes in soils. Studies prove once again, that the basis of of productivity formation is security by nutrient macroelements and peculiarities of economic activities. In addition to more accurately actual spring wheat yield it is necessary to attract agro-climatic indicators. The projections data are also a good tool for assessing the economic activity of individual districts, regions, and land users of different levels.</jats:p>",

It is obvious that after the completion of the training institutions the graduates can hope to get employed if their specialty is in high demand in the labour market. Permanent labour market demand and supply indicators are monitored and analysis allows to foresee the changes of the tendencies and trends to find out which specialty is needed most and have the most job opportunities in the world of work. Therefore, the research problem is revealed by the following questions: What are the opportunities to get employed having accounting profession? Are the people, gained such education, in demand in the labour market?&#x0D;\nThe aim of the investigation – to evaluate the accounting specialty graduates’ employment opportunities in the labour market. &#x0D;\nYouth situation in the labour market is not favourable, and still significant positive changes still are not visible, because in recent years in recent years there at the labour centre applied approximately 70 thousand young people under 25 and about 20 thousand graduates. However, an analysis of the need for accounting professionals and graduates who have acquired the specialty of integration into the labour market statistics show that the demand for these professionals is not decreasing. As pointed out by some labour market analysts, this is one of the most stable professions and such individuals have significant employment opportunities in this field. This is also confirmed by the results of analysis: every year, employers offer about 2-3 thousand jobs for accountants and book-keepers; there are favourable employment opportunities in all regions of the country, as more and more businessmen are choosing financial services companies receive all levels of accounting services; every year graduates, who have acquired the specialty, number is decreasing, so the competition is to prepare professionals in the labour market is weakening; vacancy rate remains stable (on average by 0.6 per cent.), excess supply in the market for these professionals is not high, i.e. 2 persons apply for 1 vacancy. </jats:p>"

It is known that root development differs dependent on the availability of different mineral nutrients. It includes processes such as initiation of lateral root primordia, root elongation and increase of the root biomass. However, the signal transduction mechanisms, which enable roots to sense changes in different mineral environments and match their growth and development patterns to actual conditions in the soil, are still unknown. Most recent comments have focused on one of the essential macroelements, namely nitrogen, and its role in the modification of the root architecture of <jats:italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</jats:italic>. As yet, not all elements of the signal transduction pathway leading to the perception of the nitrate stimulus, and hence to anatomical changes of the root, which allow for adaptation to variable ion concentrations in the soil, are known. Our data demonstrate that primary and lateral root length were shorter and lower in <jats:italic>aha2</jats:italic> mutant lines compared with wild‐type plants in response to a variable nitrogen source. This suggests that the PM proton pump <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AHA2</jats:styled-content> (Arabidopsis plasma membrane H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>‐ATPase isoform 2) is important for root growth and development during different nitrogen regimes.

Detailed sedimentological logs and architectural parameters were used to define 13 facies associations. The distribution of facies associations and associated variations in fluvial architecture have enabled large‐scale changes in accommodation space/sediment supply ratios (A/S ratio) to be defined for the three component sections of the Mata Amarilla Formation. The lower and upper sections are characterized by a high A/S ratio, whereas the middle section corresponds to a low A/S ratio. In the western part of the study area, small‐scale variations in the A/S ratio were recognized in the middle section. The strong west to east trend in evolution of the fluvial systems coincides with the direction of propagation of the Patagonian fold and thrust belt, which is located to the west of the study area. Intervals of high A/S ratio (i.e. lower and upper sections) are interpreted to have developed during periods of increased loading by the fold and thrust belt caused by tectonic uplift. In contrast, intervals of low A/S ratio (i.e. middle section) were developed during periods of tectonic quiescence. This article suggests that the large‐scale variations in A/S ratios are related to different rates of migration and growth of the Patagonian fold and thrust belt, whereas the small‐scale variation occurred in response to specific periods of thrusting and folding in the Patagonian fold and thrust belt (i.e. local loads). This field example of the effects of different scales of variation in A/S ratios across the Austral Foreland Basin could be used to recognize similar tectonically forced variations in stratigraphic architecture in other foreland basins throughout the world, as well as to understand the response of fluvial systems to such changes.</jats:p>",

We assume that a decrease of <jats:italic>K<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> is practically irreversible at a time scale of decades. Representing climate with a Poisson rainfall process, the feedback hardly affects salt and sodium accumulation compared with the case that feedback is ignored. However, if salinity decreases, the much more buffered <jats:italic>ESP</jats:italic> stays at elevated values, while <jats:italic>K<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic> decreases. This situation may develop if rainfall has a seasonal pattern where drought periods with accumulation of salts in the root zone alternate with wet rainfall periods in which salts are leached. Feedback that affects both drainage/leaching and capillary upward flow from groundwater, or only drainage, leads to opposing effects. If both fluxes are affected by sodicity‐induced degradation, this leads to reduced salinity (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>) and sodicity (<jats:italic>ESP</jats:italic>), which suggests that the system dynamics and feedback oppose further degradation.

In New Zealand, these factors have not been researched; hence estimators rely only on judgement to ‘guess-estimate’ in their price forecasting. This study aimed to fill the knowledge gap by investigating the priority factors. 150 responses from professional members of the New Zealand Institute of Quantity Surveyors were analysed  using multi-attribute method.  Results  showed thirty-seven  factorswhich  could influence the final contract price; the three most influential being poor tender documentation, complexity of design  &amp;  construction, and completeness of project information. Other factors relating  to  project,  client  and  contractor  characteristics,  design  consultants  and tendering conditions,  estimating  practice  and  external  factors  were  reported. Concordance  analysis indicated  high  level  of  agreement  amongst  survey  participants  in  the  rank-ordering  of  the relative  importance  of  the identified factors.

Water-geological conditions of the valley sections of the Spitakajur Stream middle flow are favorable for constructing waterside and infrabed water drainages, for intake of underground waters through them and for supplying with potable water the mentioned part of the City. Moreover, the volume of drainage waters, determined by the corresponding water-geological calculations, makes 20 L/s, which will completely satisfy drinking-household needs of the eastern section of Dilijan City (over 5000 capita).</jats:p>"
