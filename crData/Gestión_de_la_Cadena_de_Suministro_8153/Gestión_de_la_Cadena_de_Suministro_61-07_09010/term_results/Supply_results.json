Similarly, in a modulated tone, the modulation frequency as such may be heard without being present in the Fourier analysis.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper shows that on the model of the cochlea the artificial basilar membrane vibrates at the place corresponding to the absent fundamental or the modulation frequency. The vibration seems to be a consequence of the complicated traveling-wave patterns and their interferences. This may be of interest for some hearing theories.</jats:p>",
