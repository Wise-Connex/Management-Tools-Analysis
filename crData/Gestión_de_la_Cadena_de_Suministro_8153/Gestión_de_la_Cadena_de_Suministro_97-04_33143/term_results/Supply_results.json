The field research was carried out in non‐vertically integrated supply chains in the UK and Spain. The main findings are: chains in different territories exhibited different operational requirements; and position in the supply chain gave rise to different operational requirements. From these findings concludes that, in order to manage supply chains, we must identify each chain player’s role in contributing to satisfying end customer requirements, recognizing that these roles may differ depending on the international environmental context and position in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

According to their interim report issued in December 1996, demand for natural gas energy for Japan shall be increased from 44 million tons of LNG basis (approx., 61 BCM, i.e. billion cubic meters) in 1994, which was 10.8% share of the total primary energy demand of 577 million kiloliters of crude oil equivalent, to 56 Mtons, i. e. million tons with 13% share in 2000 and 63 Mtons with 13 % share in 2010 then up to 68 Mtons with 12% share in 2030 under the current energy conservation measures and new energy introduction plans. Finally the author insists on the necessity of considering possibility of national gas pipelines on Japan island in accordance with future movement of presumable international gas pipeline concepts such as Trans-Asian pipeline and Northeast Asian pipeline in the 21st. century.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Natural gas is quickly moving away from its past image of poor relative of the hydrocarbon family towards much more powerful position in the primary energy resources. Natural gas now occupies about 23% share of world total primary energy supply while its share in Japan is only 11%, why not? To the contrary, crude oil share in Japan is as large as 57% of the total energy demand, compared with 40% level of oil share in the world total average.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In fact, natural gas business in the world started in 1950's much later than oil business that was initiated in the mid of the 19th. century. Therefore, the exploration and the development of natural gas have not been matured yet so that its reserves assessment may be still ambiguous. In another aspect, it is a serious problem that Japan must import more than 80% of the total primary energy demand nevertheless she is the world 4th ranked energy consumer, who exhausts about 6% of the world total energy consumption of 8,136 million tons of oil equivalent per annum.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In recent years, global environment problems such as global warming and acid rain have been discussed extensively in various forums including the United Nations Conference of the Environment and Development (UNCED). In order to prevent from warming the earth by the reduction of CO2 emissions it is essential to work on reforming Japan's energy supply/demand structure because energy is the key factor affecting both economic growth and environment protection. This reform consists of two major elements which are (a) reducing energy consumption needed for given amount of economic activity, in another words efficient use and save of energy, and (b) expanding the use of non-fossil fuel energy such as nuclear energy, hydro power and solar energy etc.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Energy Gases, Why Not?</jats:title>\n                     <jats:sec>\n                        <jats:title>1. Historical Trend of Primary Energy Consumption</jats:title>\n                        <jats:p>Many past predictions of future energy supply and demand seem to be unreliable during the last several decades. However, the history of energy use demonstrates clear trend and its tempting to extrapolate these into the near future. In 1956, Dr. M. King Hubbert of the U.S. Geological Survey suggested nearly symmetrical growth and decline curves for the discovery rate of reserves and the production rate for any energy resources. A symmetry in growth and decline in primary energy consumption is also suggested in 1988 by Grubler and Nakicenovic et al, members the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) based in Austria. For example, (Fig. 1) shows percentages of consumption shares of individual primary energy sources in the United States, which are plotted on a normal probability density scale on the axis of ordinates versus time on the abscissas. In the beginning of 19th century, wood was only our primary energy source, while secondary energy sources included water power, wind mill power, peat, agricultural waste and animal and human powers. With development of steam power and the expansion of railroads and the steel industry, use of coal increased exponentially until early decades of 20th century. Then crude oil was discovered in 1859 by Drake in Pennsylvania then introduced into the energy market in 1870's.</jats:p>\n                        <jats:p>P. 473^</jats:p>\n                     </jats:sec>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

As the number of the facilities increases, it becomes important to predict the reliability of the integrated system to ensure sufficient delivery of gas to meet the consumer needs while maintaining economical investments. Due to the complexity of the system, a joint study between PETRONAS, Esso Production Malaysia Inc. and PETRONAS Carigali Sdn.

Phase 1 of the study involved the assessment of the existing facilities and also the facilities that are in advanced stage of development to determine the system availability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There can be no doubt that distribution, in the widest sense of the word, is operating in a rapidly changing environment in the UK new car market. In particular, the supply and stocking systems for new vehicles have been subject to greater change since 1992 than at any time in the past and, it must be emphasized, this change is still ongoing. There has been very little academic research on distribution generally and some of the points drawn from this work in the automotive industry may have viability in other contexts with suitable localization. Summarizes the research carried out in the UK by the International Car Distribution Programme. Shows that some franchises have instituted revolutionary changes while others are more evolutionary. Some would seem to have carefully considered philosophies and strategies while others appear to have more of a “me‐too” approach. Many franchises have introduced central‐stocking systems as the first step in trying to make their supply systems leaner and they have achieved both an increase in customer matching (customers actually getting the exact specification of car that they wanted) and a decrease in stock and costs. Those already operating such systems are making them more sophisticated as time goes on. During the fieldwork for the research some systems had received major updates and others were due to occur in early 1995. There are many different approaches and in the research they have been classified into broadly similar types. The systems operated by some franchises are already pan‐European while others are confined to the UK with continental markets operating traditionally. In addition, wholly new approaches and systems are in the process of being introduced ‐ such as one specialist manufacturer who has introduced a “supply to order” policy. The improvements in distribution efficiency have the potential to provide savings typically of about £150 (but up to £360) per new car sold to the franchise as a whole. In addition there are unquantified benefits from the considerable improvements in customer satisfaction. Part of such savings can be realized by the dealer and part by the manufacturer. Some franchises had already realized large proportions of these savings and benefits before this research took place while others still have opportunities ahead of them and could yet achieve the sort of amounts suggested above.</jats:p>",

This paper claims that the information transferred in the form of “orders” tends to be distorted and can misguide upstream members in their inventory and production decisions. In particular, the variance of orders may be larger than that of sales, and the distortion tends to increase as one moves upstream—a phenomenon termed “bullwhip effect.” This paper analyzes four sources of the bullwhip effect: demand signal processing, rationing game, order batching, and price variations. Actions that can be taken to mitigate the detrimental impact of this distortion are also discussed. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to examine 1) the impact of supply and demand on variability in data collected for dietary studies and 2) the relationship between data and estimates of usual intake. The forces of supply and demand over time generate a consumption curve for each food. Two types of consumption curves are identified. One curve is horizontal and represents staples that are steadily consumed. The other curve exhibits peaks and dips and is unique for each food whose consumption varies with time. </jats:p><jats:p> The measurement of usual intake is discussed in. light of these two types of curves. Usual intake of foods whose consumption curve is horizontal could be read at any time since consumption does not vary with time. For all other foods, measuring usual consumption presents problems since the data vary with time. This examination indicates that foods whose consumption varies with time have unique properties that must be considered when attempting to calculate consumption. Suggestions are given to enhance measurement of consumption of these foods. Although excellent methodology currently exists for the calculation of intake, attention to the force of supply and demand with only serve to strengthen existing methods. </jats:p>",

Explores the current interest in supplier integration as a source of competitive advantage in consumer markets and proposes that the Japanese influenced network sourcing model provides a method whereby the advantages of vertical integration can be achieved without reducing the flexibility of product and material outsourcing. A central feature of the network sourcing approach is the use of supplier co‐ordination and development, facilitated by a supplier forum known as a supplier association. These associations represent a series of linking pins, extending from the focal purchasing organization, whereby the joint determination of supply chain improvements can be formulated and shared between a focal customer organization and entire groups of suppliers. Argues that the successful exploitation of these associations is a major pillar in developing and sustaining continuous improvement on a supply‐chain scale, where the efforts of each and every supplier are aligned to the changing requirements of the consumer market.</jats:p>",

The extent and localization of pial blush in relation to the total tumor volume were determined angiographically. The amount of edema and tumor size were calculated using computerized tomography. The edema-tumor volume ratio was defined as Edema Index (EI). There were 49 meningiomas with PTBE; of those tumors, 46 were supplied by pial vessels, and three were supplied exclusively by dural vessels. Tumors without PTBE showed no pial blush. The mean EI in meningiomas with pial blush was significantly larger (EI = 3.0) than in meningiomas without pial supply (EI = 1.1; p &lt; 0.0001). Meningiomas in which 10% of the whole tumor volume was supplied by pial vessels had only a small mean EI of 2.2, whereas tumors with pial blood supply greater than or equal to 20% had a mean EI of 3.3 (p &lt; 0.026). In 69.9% of cases with pial blood supply, major portions of the edema were located adjacent to the tumor region supplied by pial vessels. Edema index differences among tumors of different subgroups, as defined by size or histology, were significantly related to the pial supply in each subset. Thus, pial blood supply may be causative for the development of PTBE in meningiomas.</jats:p>",

Pusa Kalyani, were raised under field conditions with varying levels of N fertilization, i.e. 0, 40, 80 and 120 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Changes in dry matter accumulation in various plant parts as influenced by N supply were measured throughout the crop ontogeny. N supply up to 120 kg had an increasing effect on the growth of leaves, stem and pods during the entire period till maturity. Analysis on the assimilate distribution pattern revealed that 84–87% of the total was accumulated during the post‐flowering phase. Dry matter partitioning profile during the ontogeny indicated that about 72–83 % of the total DM was accumulated in the leaves, while 17–28 % in the stem, in the preflowering phase. This trend was found nearly opposite during the postflowering phase. At maturity, however, stem and pods accounted for nearly equal amounts of dry matter accumulation. Among the genotypes, Pusa Bold recorded significantly higher DM accumulation and seed yield over Pusa Kalyani which, on the other hand, exhibited a better assimilate‐partioning ability than the former. Nitrogen levels had a favourable effect on LAI, LAD and CGR in both genotypes. Highly significant correlations were obtained between seed yield vs. LAI, LAD and CGR. N fertilization up to 120 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> was found beneficial in enhancing growth and yield of rapeseed‐mustard.</jats:p>",

Resistance and aerobic training in older men: effects onV˙o <jats:sub>2 peak</jats:sub> and the capillary supply to skeletal muscle. J. Appl. Physiol. 82(4): 1305–1310, 1997.—Both aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) may increase aerobic power (V˙o <jats:sub>2 peak</jats:sub>) in the older population; however, the role of changes in the capillary supply in this response has not been evaluated. Twenty healthy men (age 65–74 yr) engaged in either 9 wk of lower body RT followed by 9 wk of AT on a cycle ergometer (RT→AT group) or 18 wk of AT on a cycle ergometer (AT→AT group). RT was performed three times per week and consisted of three sets of four exercises at 6–12 repetitions maximum. AT was performed three times per week for 30 min at 60–70% heart rate reserve.V˙o <jats:sub>2 peak</jats:sub> was increased after both RT and AT ( P &lt; 0.05). Biopsies (vastus lateralis) revealed that the number of capillaries per fiber perimeter length was increased after both AT and RT ( P &lt; 0.05), paralleling the changes in V˙o <jats:sub>2 peak</jats:sub>, whereas capillary density was increased only after AT ( P &lt; 0.01). These results, and the finding of a significant correlation between the change in capillary supply and V˙o <jats:sub>2 peak</jats:sub>( r = 0.52), suggest the possibility that similar mechanisms may be involved in the increase ofV˙o <jats:sub>2 peak</jats:sub> after high-intensity RT and AT in the older population. </jats:p>",

In the multivariate model, an increase of 1 catheterization laboratory per 100 000 population was associated with an increase in the angiography rate of 1.62 per 1000 population; those service areas with multi-provider markets were associated with an additional increase in the angiography rate of 1.27 per 1000 population ( R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 0.84, P = 0.0006). There was a moderately strong relationship between the catheterization laboratories per capita and the revascularization rates ( R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.43, P = 0.029). Angiography rates were highly associated with cardiac revascularization rates: An increase in the angiography rate of 1 per 1000 population was associated with a 0.46 per 1000 increase in the cardiac revascularization rate ( R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.85, P = 0.0001). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> Our work suggests that current efforts to address variation in cardiac procedures through activities such as appropriateness criteria, guidelines and utilization review are misdirected and should be redirected towards capacity, in this case the supply of catheterization facilities. </jats:p></jats:sec>",
