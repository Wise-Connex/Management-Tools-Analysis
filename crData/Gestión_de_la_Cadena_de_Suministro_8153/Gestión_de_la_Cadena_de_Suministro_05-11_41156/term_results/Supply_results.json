      "abstract": "<jats:p>With nearly 30 years' experience of managing stored surface water for water supply, the Municipal Water and Sewage Company of Seville (EMASESA), has introduced a Water Supply Natural Resources Vigilance Program. It consists of four levels that are mutually complementary: early warning system; vigilance of raw water resources; research; and integration of limnological knowledge. Selecting the reservoir that should be used, intake depth, transfer strategies, etc, are some examples of active management that this Vigilance Program allows us to achieve. Guaranteeing high quality raw water resources, at all times, which therefore favours their treatment, is one of the priority objectives for EMASESA. This is because it not only has repercussions from an economic point of view but it also contributes to the efficient and sustainable use of water resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In order to advance towards solving the problem of water supply in critical basins in Colombia, the Environmental Ministry and the Javeriana University formulated the technical basis for management of water supply in critical basins. The aim was at developing a methodology that handles in the most efficient way water resources in that kind of system. This guide proposes usage of new technologies for management. Basic geophysical characterization of basins was proposed to be carried out with free GIS software. For water balance, the Thomas model (abcd) was proposed. In addition, it is taken into account the minimum ecological flow rate and the minimum requirements for the control of water quality in the streams. The demand is calculated spatially in order to know how the water resource in basins should be distributed. With the results of water balance and water demand a Decision Support System (DSS) is proposed that joins both the technical results and the expert knowledge of the basin inhabitants. The methodology was applied in critical basins with different conditions and the results show a promising performance of the methodology.</jats:p>",

This approach to water management was emulated around the world. Today, however, budget deficits, climate change and competing interest all strain California's ability to meet new needs for a growing population, the economy and the environment. Water for California and the Planning &amp; Conservation League led an effort to assess viable options for California under these new realities. The resulting Investment Strategy for California Water identifies cost-effective, environmentally beneficial and socially acceptable water management strategies for meeting these needs. The Strategy demonstrates how California can more than meet water supply needs with locally planned and implemented programs such as water conservation, recycling and groundwater treatment. As with past California approaches to water management, this Strategy can be useful to other regions facing similar challenges.</jats:p>",

While approximately 80% of the over 80 MCM of wastewater/yr is currently reused, only a fraction is formalized with permitting and adherence to reuse guidelines. The Jordanian government seeks to embrace reclaimed resources in national water resources planning through recognized/regulated reuse implementation activities. A multi-sectoral project is being performed to help reach this goal in Jordan and worldwide, sharing lessons learned in increasing access to reused water, and involving performance of four demonstration projects with an aim toward developing replicable operational conditions that support sustainability/enhance expansion of treated wastewater reuse in Jordan.</jats:p>",

Ground and surface water supplies have been managed by twenty independent management agencies. In the 1980s and 1990s the region experienced dramatic population growth and increased water demand. Environmental organizations sought to preserve the environmental values of the Lower American River. Six years of negotiation resulted in the Water Forum Agreement, a memorandum of understanding signed by business and agricultural leaders, citizens groups, environmentalists, water managers, and local governments to fulfill two co-equal objectives: (i) to provide a reliable and safe water supply for the region's economic health and planned development to the year 2030; and (ii) to preserve the fishery, wildlife, recreational, and aesthetic values of the Lower American River. This paper describes three major parameters guiding the water future of the Sacramento Region, which may be a model for other regions of the world: (1) the seven policy elements of the Water Forum Agreement; (2) the Regional Water Authority (RWA) and the Sacramento Groundwater Authority help to implement the policies of the Water Forum Agreement; (3) RWA's regional water efficiency program provides “pick and choose” water efficiency measures to twenty water suppliers in three counties.</jats:p>",

In view of this, it is appropriate to consider the most suitable alternatives in relation to the uses for which the treated water is intended. Accordingly, the research group ‘Microbiology and Environmental Techniques’ is studying various types of tertiary treatment with the aim of establishing which treatment is most suitable for specific uses. Results indicate that neither maturation lagoons nor macrofiltration systems should be employed as the only tertiary treatment before reuse. More exacting uses require more advanced technology, such as microfiltration and ultrafiltration, although it should be stressed that neither of these technologies is capable of eliminating dissolved substances. In this respect, reverse osmosis technology may provide a solution.</jats:p>",

It was observed that the breaks of pipes increased after the temperatures of water and soil crossed in spring and fall. The pipe breaks were closely related to water and soil temperature, especially mains were affected more than service pipes. The fittings and valves were susceptible to the temperatures and needed to take measures for preventing breaks. The prediction of the pipe breaks by the ANN model built had a good performance except that the sensitivity was not good when the pipe breaks rapidly increased or decreased. The ANN model gave a good performance and was to be useful to predict the patterns of pipe breaks on a seasonal basis.</jats:p>",

There has been an increasing emphasis on buyer-supplier relationships in the academic community and in the international business to improve competitiveness and profitability of organizations by proposing different strategies, organizational structure, system, tools and techniques for how to select the right partner, establish the proper relationship and adapt adequately to the internal and external changes. Moreover, the system has witnessed a transformation in which suppliers and customers are inextricably linked throughout the entire sequence of supply chain. This paper aims to develop the buyer-supplier typology for strategic archetypes of contractual relationships. The typology reflects a buyer perspective ranging from arm's length relationship to strategic partnerships and represents a supplier segmentation tool which helps identify what types of competence and capability relate to each individual sourcing practice. The paper includes the comprehensive study of current state of the art of the survey based empirical research on sourcing practices and supplier selection, as they play a vital role in managing supply chain.</jats:p>",

A cross‐sectional data set was collected with respect to water firms in rural areas of former East and West Germany. The empirical data are analyzed by applying a symmetric generalized McFadden (SGM) functional form. This flexible functional form allows for testing the concavity required by microeconomic theory as well as the global imposition of such curvature restrictions without any loss of flexibility. The original specification of the SGM cost function is modified to incorporate fixed factors of water production and supply as, for example, groundwater intake or the number of connections supplied. The estimated flexible and global curvature correct cost function is then used to derive scale elasticities as well as the optimal firm size. The results show that no water supplier in the sample produces at constant returns to scale. The optimal firm size was found to be on average about three times larger than the existing one. These findings deliver evidence for the hypothesis that the legally set supplying areas, oriented at public administrative criteria as well as local characteristics of water resources, are economically inefficient. Hence structural inefficiency in the rural water sector is confirmed to be policy induced.</jats:p>",

These individual savings effectively provide SWC with a potential total saving of 3,344 ± 400 megalitres per annum (ML/a) for the single residential houses retrofitted alone, i.e. 80% of the 200,000 households retrofitted to date.

We develop a simple numerical model for their design and evaluation. Water flow through the soil is modelled over three layers: a root zone; a middle storage layer; and the site subsoil. To continuously simulate recharge, runoff and evapotranspiration, a Green-Ampt equation coupled with a surface water balance is used. For the humid climate of Madison, Wisconsin, USA, results show very high recharge rates in the rainy season, where a raingarden with an area of 10–20% of the contributing impervious area maximizes recharge.

The interurban panel dataset utilised in this study does represent a step forward, by permitting more robust econometric estimation and by incorporating a wider, more balanced range of determinant factors. A coherent set of relationships governing the key market outcomes-house prices, new building, migration and vacancies-can be established. The modelling framework is used to explore differences in behavioural responses between markets in 'high' and 'low' demand states. Simulations are used to track the impact on market outcomes of different policy strategies applied in different types of locality. Supply measures needed to achieve national targets for house price growth reduction are assessed. Measures acting on both demand-side and supply-side variables in areas of high and low demand are compared. These suggest that output is more sensitive than price to policies and that quite strong, concerted policies would be needed to impact significantly on the major market imbalances currently seen. </jats:p>",

With a multiple objective model, it is desirable to provide the DM (decision maker) with a wide range of choices of Pareto-optimal solutions.

But, decentralized decision‐making is known to result in inefficient Nash equilibrium outcomes, and optimal outcomes that maximize the sum of the utilities of all agents need not be Nash equilibria. In this paper we demonstrate through several examples of supply chain models how linear reward/penalty schemes can be implemented so that a given optimal solution becomes a Nash equilibrium. The examples represent both vertical and horizontal coordination issues. The techniques we employ build on a general framework for the use of linear reward/penalty schemes to induce stability in given optimal solutions and should be useful to other multi‐agent operations management settings. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Currently there are more than 60,000 patients on the U.S. waiting list for kidney transplantation. In 2004, 16,879 kidney transplants, including 880 simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplants, were performed in this country. Recent strategies for increasing the supply of kidneys hold promise, such as systematic programs designed to improve consent rates for deceased donor organ procurement. Efforts to increase donation after cardiac death (DCD) have been highly successful and now account for more than 5% of all deceased organ donors. Transplantation of kidneys from DCD donors yields 1‐year graft and patient survival rates equivalent to kidneys from brain‐dead donors. Expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys from donors ≥ 60 years of age (or donors age 50–59 years with certain comorbidities) confer a survival benefit for end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) patients compared to remaining on dialysis on the waiting list. The number of live donor kidney transplants, both from biologically related and unrelated donors, is increasing. Paired live donor kidney transplants provide yet another transplantation opportunity for ESRD patients with willing but incompatible (by ABO or direct antibody) living donors.</jats:p>",

Also the sternoclavicular artery is giving strong rami to the supracoracoid muscle by the lateral border of the coracoid. The subcutaneous thoracoabdominal vessels that supply the brood patches are branches of the pectoral trunk too. The brachial artery lies between the biceps and triceps brachii muscles on the medial side of the humerus and ramifies at the level proximal of the elbow joint to the stronger ulnar and weaker radial arteries. The radial lies cranially, covered by the pronator muscles and gives two branches, the deep and superficial radial arteries. The ulnar artery also gives off two: the superficial and deep ulnar arteries, which supply the flexor muscles and vascularize the distal part of the wing.</jats:p>",

Such models are becoming widely used in view of their substantial advantages, compared with a continuous hours approach, when estimating and their role in tax policy microsimulation. This paper provides an introduction to the basic analytics of discrete hours labour supply modelling. Special attention is given to model specification, maximum likelihood estimation and microsimulation of tax reforms. The analysis is at each stage illustrated by the use of numerical examples. At the end, an empirical example of a hypothetical policy change to the social security system is given to illustrate the role of discrete hours microsimulation in the analysis of tax and transfer policy changes.</jats:p>",

However, water allocation by priority might have the problem in which the area of lowest priority can suffer from water shortage all the time. So, this study has tried to develop water allocation rules by weighting factor techniques. The weighting factors are estimated by sectoral and regional factors. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to estimate the sectoral factors and the regional factors can be divided by the regional-characteristic and regional-scale ends. The water allocation rules for the reservoir are developed by applying those weighting factors and the rules are applied to Andong dam reservoir which supplies the water to Busan-Si, Daegu-Si, and Goryeong-Gun, Korea in water deficit situation. As a result, all sectors and regions could share the burdens of water shortage by the water allocation using the relative weighting factors.</jats:p>",

The National Multiple Family Submetering and Allocation Billing Program Study evaluated the merits of separate billing programs including the potential water savings, costs and benefits from various perspectives, and the accompanying administrative and regulatory issues. It was found that the practice of installing individual water meters (submetering) on multi-family apartment units and billing based on actual consumption results in water savings of 15%. Water billing practices based on allocation methods (commonly known as Ratio Utility Billing Systems or RUBS) did not effect any water savings. The study was motivated by the water industry's interest in capturing potential water savings by multi-family residents where there is currently no pricing signal to encourage efficient use.</jats:p>",

However, infrastructure condition of District Metered Areas (DMAs) could be misjudged, because characteristics of the system are not considered properly. Therefore the components of NFM were estimated in residential and business DMAs by using data of night uses collected by modified option A test and real losses from water balance analysis. A new background minimum night flow equation was developed by the components of NFM. Applicability of the equation was tested on various revenue water % residential and business DMAs. As a result, it is concluded that the new background night flow developed in this study is more reasonable in Korea and could be used to judge whether the DMAs have economically recoverable unreported bursts prior to leakage detection activity.</jats:p>",

The first trend is the improvements in domestic water use efficiency; the second is the new sustainability agenda, which places new demands on the water systems. Cities in the developing world have the opportunity to promote domestic efficiency at early stages by laying a strong emphasis on demand management, and to construct more sustainable systems by including sustainability criteria early in the development process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most water and sewerage utilities are faced with the challenges of improving efficiency and will pass on gains to their customers. The challenges are more in low-income countries especially those in Africa. There has been a lot of on-going debate and studies about approaches and options to water utility efficiency improvement in these countries to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs). About ten years ago the emphasis was on private sector participation (PSP). Consequently, most development partners propagated this approach and even went to the extent of conditioning PSP implementation to funding. The option delivered varied degrees of successes contingent on the operating contexts in those countries. Attempts to mitigate the wrong contexts and conditions to suit the PSP have proved to be more expensive than potential benefits from the option itself. As a result, many low-income countries have been compelled to be more innovative and widen the scope of solution search. The debate currently is, therefore, about performance improvement other than PSP options. This paper presents a phased approach to efficiency improvement taken by National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) of Uganda in the last seven years. We discuss mechanisms that NWSC has used to achieve significant efficiency gains. Managerial incentives and autonomy are at the centre of the successes registered. We also draw conclusions on how private management principles can be introduced into the public sector to improve efficiency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a model for a serial supply chain in which production, inventory, and transportation decisions are integrated in the presence of production capacities and concave cost functions. The model we study generalizes the uncapacitated serial single-item multilevel economic lot-sizing model by adding stationary production capacities at the manufacturer level. We present algorithms with a running time that is polynomial in the planning horizon when all cost functions are concave. In addition, we consider different transportation and inventory holding cost structures that yield improved running times: inventory holding cost functions that are linear and transportation cost functions that are either linear, or are concave with a fixed-charge structure. In the latter case, we make the additional common and reasonable assumption that the variable transportation and inventory costs are such that holding inventories at higher levels in the supply chain is more attractive from a variable cost perspective. While the running times of the algorithms are exponential in the number of levels in the supply chain in the general concave cost case, the running times are remarkably insensitive to the number of levels for the other two cost structures. </jats:p>",

A simplified analytical analysis was performed in a power system with an arc furnace and a 12-pulse STATCOM. The study has shown that the STATCOM can compensate the furnace reactive current, even when fast oscillations occur. The system studied was implemented in a detailed EMTP/ATP simulation program. The results show that the reactive power oscillations produced by the furnace can be strongly reduced. However, due to the fact that arc furnace is an unbalanced load, STATCOM dc side capacitor has to be designed to supply the corresponding oscillating energy.</jats:p>"

The 79 cities were grouped into six clusters by k-means clustering (KMC) of the factor scores of the cities. Then key local factors were identified and their impacts were quantified by multiple regression analysis (MRA) and they were justified by T-test and F-test. The approach through correlation-PCA-KMC-MRA was proved to be one of scientific ways for identification of key local factors.

The buying company, referred to as the focal company, manages the suppliers in the supply base through contracts and purchasing of parts, materials, and services. To facilitate better management of a supply base, we observe “complexity” as a key area of managerial consideration and apply the literature on complexity to the supply base. Supply base complexity is conceptualized in three dimensions: (1) the number of suppliers in the supply base, (2) the degree of differentiation among these suppliers, and (3) the level of inter‐relationships among the suppliers. Four propositions have been formulated in terms of four major areas of research within supply chain management—transaction costs, supply risk, supplier responsiveness, and supplier innovation. Corollary propositions are also stated. Although a reduction in complexity may lead to lower transaction costs and increased supplier responsiveness, in certain circumstances it may also increase supply risk and reduce supplier innovation. Therefore, reducing supply base complexity in general may be a cost‐efficient approach, but blindly reducing it may potentially decrease the buying company's overall competitiveness.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The triad, composed of three unique electroactive components, namely, 1) an electron‐donating TTF unit, 2) a chromophoric porphyrin unit, and 3) an electron‐accepting C<jats:sub>60</jats:sub>unit, has been synthesized in a modular fashion. A disulfide‐based anchoring group was tagged to the TTF end of the molecule in order to allow its self‐assembly on gold surfaces. The surface coverage by the triad in a self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) was estimated to be 1.4 nm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>per molecule, a density which is consistent with hexagonal close‐packing of the spherical C<jats:sub>60</jats:sub>component (diameter ∼1 nm). In a closed electronic circuit, a triad‐SAM functionalized working‐electrode generates a switchable photocurrent of ∼1.5 μA cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>when irradiated with a 413 nm Kr‐ion laser, a wavelength which is close to the porphyrin chromophore's absorption maximum peak at 420 nm. The electrical energy generated by the triad at the expense of the light energy is ultimately exploited to drive a supramolecular machine in the form of a [2]pseudorotaxane comprised of a π‐electron‐deficient tetracationic cyclobis(paraquat‐<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐phenylene) (CBPQT<jats:sup>4+</jats:sup>) cyclophane and a π‐electron‐rich 1,5‐bis[(2‐hydroxyethoxy) ethoxy]naphthalene (BHEEN) thread. The redox‐induced dethreading of the CBPQT<jats:sup>4+</jats:sup>cyclophane from the BHEEN thread can be monitored by measuring the increase in the fluorescence intensity of the BHEEN unit. A gradual increase in the fluorescence intensity of the BHEEN unit concomitant with the photocurrent generation, even at a potential (0 V) much lower than that required (−300 mV) for the direct reduction of the CBPQT<jats:sup>4+</jats:sup>unit, confirms that the dethreading process is driven by the photocurrent generated by the triad‐SAM.</jats:p>",

Alkylglycerols have immunostimulating and haematopoietic properties, while<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3 PUFA are essential for optimal neonatal development. We investigated the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with 32g SLO/d to twelve pregnant and then lactating sows (from day 80 of pregnancy to weaning) on the growth and immune status of their offspring, compared with a control group. Sows were vaccinated against Aujeszky's disease 21d before term. Blood samples were collected from sows before treatment, on delivery and 14d later, and from five piglets per litter on days 2, 21 and 36 after birth; colostrum and milk samples were collected 12h, 14 and 28d postpartum. Compared with controls, supplemented sows had higher levels of both erythrocytes and Hb in their blood, and higher concentrations of IgG, alkylglycerols and<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3 PUFA in their mammary secretions. In piglets from supplemented sows, leucocytes and IgG were higher. Supplementation with SLO resulted in an increase in Aujeszky antibodies in both blood and colostrum of sows after vaccination, together with an increase in Aujeszky antibodies in piglet blood. Our findings demonstrate that improvement of both passive and active immune status in piglets is related to the consumption of alkylglycerols associated with<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>-3 PUFA in the sow diet. The overall improvement in offspring health status by SLO supplementation to the mother could be of interest for optimisation of the lipid diet during and after pregnancy.</jats:p>",

In both +P (80 mg P kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and −P treatments (no added P), elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (800 μmol mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) increased shoot biomass production by 20 to 35% and accelerated the development of cluster roots, which exhibit important functions in chemical mobilization of sparingly soluble soil P sources. Accordingly, cluster root formation was stimulated in plants without P application by 140 and 60% for ambient and elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> treatments, respectively. Intense accumulation of citrate and increased activities of acid and alkaline phosphatases, but also of chitinase, in the rhizosphere were mainly confined to later stages of cluster root development in −P treatments. Regardless of atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations, there was no significant effect on accumulation of citrate or on selected enzyme activities of C, N, and P cycles in the rhizosphere of individual root clusters. Discriminant analysis of selected enzyme activities revealed that mainly phosphatase and chitinase contributed to the experimental variance (81.3%) of the data. Phosphatase and chitinase activities in the rhizosphere might be dominated by the secretion from cluster roots rather than by microbial activity. Alterations in rhizosphere bacterial communities analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were related with the intense changes in root secretory activity observed during cluster root development but not with elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years various novel DNA typing methods have been developed which are faster and easier to perform than the current internationally standardized IS<jats:italic>6110</jats:italic>restriction fragment length polymorphism typing method. However, there has been no overview of the utility of these novel typing methods, and it is largely unknown how they compare to previously published methods. In this study, the discriminative power and reproducibility of nine recently described PCR-based typing methods for<jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>were investigated using the strain collection of the interlaboratory study of Kremer et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 37:2607-2618, 1999). This strain collection contains 90<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>complex and 10 non-<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>complex mycobacterial strains, as well as 31 duplicated DNA samples to assess reproducibility. The highest reproducibility was found with variable numbers of tandem repeat typing using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU VNTR) and fast ligation-mediated PCR (FLiP), followed by second-generation spoligotyping, ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), VNTR typing using five repeat loci identified at the Queens University of Belfast (QUB VNTR), and the Amadio speciation PCR. Poor reproducibility was associated with fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism typing, which was performed in three different laboratories. The methods were ordered from highest discrimination to lowest by the Hunter-Gaston discriminative index as follows: QUB VNTR typing, MIRU VNTR typing, FLiP, LM-PCR, and spoligotyping. We conclude that both VNTR typing methods and FLiP typing are rapid, highly reliable, and discriminative epidemiological typing methods for<jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>and that VNTR typing is the epidemiological typing method of choice for the near future.</jats:p>",

To investigate ecosystem service supply during the 21st century, we used a range of ecosystem models and scenarios of climate and land-use change to conduct a Europe-wide assessment. Large changes in climate and land use typically resulted in large changes in ecosystem service supply. Some of these trends may be positive (for example, increases in forest area and productivity) or offer opportunities (for example, “surplus land” for agricultural extensification and bioenergy production). However, many changes increase vulnerability as a result of a decreasing supply of ecosystem services (for example, declining soil fertility, declining water availability, increasing risk of forest fires), especially in the Mediterranean and mountain regions.</jats:p>",
