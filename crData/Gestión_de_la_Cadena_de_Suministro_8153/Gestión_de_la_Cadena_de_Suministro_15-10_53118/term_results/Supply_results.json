      "abstract": "<jats:p>Information management is a core supply chain activity that is increasing in importance as firms strive to become more responsive to growing customer demand for innovative products. However, effective processing of information from customers and suppliers remains a struggle for most firms. Absorptive capacity provides a useful view of information processing activities, but the current understanding of how firms use it to improve performance and why some firms seem to develop it while others do not remains unclear. This study is grounded in information processing theory, and examines the role of absorptive capacity in linking a firm's responsive strategy and performance. We test a structural equation model on data from 711 manufacturing firms, and validate our results on a second sample of 677 firms. Our study makes three major contributions by providing evidence that: (1) absorptive capacity is motivated by a firm's responsive strategy; (2) it fully mediates the relationship between responsive strategy and firm performance, indicating that absorptive capacity is a necessary competence for firms that aim to deliver innovative products to customers; and (3) the relationship between responsive strategy and absorptive capacity is U‐shaped, indicating that when firms attempt to blend efficient and responsive strategies, their ability to develop absorptive capacity is diminished.</jats:p>",

Supply chains being network of firms entangled in exchange relationships; innovation in supply chains cannot be fully achieved without effective supply chain relationships. Hence the current study explores empirically the influence of dominant relational attributes viz. trust, commitment, communication, cooperation, coordination on supply chain (SC) innovation. As environmental uncertainty can moderate these relationships, hence the author includes the same as a moderating variable in the model. Based on a web based survey of 132 logistics professionals, the findings largely provide support for the proposed relationships.</p>",

This paper refines an instrument to empirically test the significance of the following drivers for participation in GSC initiatives: Government Regulation, Buyer/Supply Chain Influence, Internal Readiness, Competitive Advantage, and Corporate Social Responsibility. Corporate Social Responsibility emerged as the most significant variable that effected the decision making of the organizations around green supply chain management practices. Surprisingly, Competitive Advantage, which has been found to be a significant contributor in prior research when studied in isolation, did not emerge as a significant factor in this study. The emergent high correlation between the Corporate Social Responsibility and Competitive Advantage could imply that the Competitive Advantage could be embedded within the Corporate Social Responsibility when agencies focus on greening their supply chains.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>For supply chain optimization, as a key determinant of strategic resources mobility along the value-added chain, simulation is widely used to test the impact on supply chain performance for the strategic level decisions, such as the number of plants, the modes of transport, or the relocation of warehouses. Traditionally, a single centralized model that encompasses multiple participants in the supply chain is built when optimization of the supply chain through simulation is required. However, due to the heterogeneity of supply chain, a centralized simulation model has a limit to reflect the dynamics of each supply chain participant. This research focuses on the conceptual and the technical issues about the supply chain simulation with a parallel and distributed simulation (PADS) concept. In particular, to ensure the decomposition of supply chain simulation model by each supply chain participant, the simulation framework is proposed using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in e-collaboration environment. For a clear proof of concept, the virtual supply chain simulation model is implemented and experienced using business process modeling tools in SOA. Due to the reusable, interoperable, and scalable characteristics of the proposed supply chain simulation framework, various alternatives for supply chin optimization can be generated and evaluated.</p>",

Although supply chain quality control is a hot topic among researchers, supply chain quality prediction is actually an important but unsolved problem in manufacturing industry. In this paper, an approach of manufacturing supply chain quality prediction based on quality satisfaction degree is proposed to control supply chain better, in order to help ensure product quality. Supply chain quality prediction 3D model and model based on customer satisfaction and process control are established firstly. And then technologies used in quality prediction are studied, including quality prediction index system established on Expert scoring -AHP and prediction workflow built on ABPM. Finally an example is given to illustrate this approach. The customer satisfaction prediction result of supply chain quality can help supply chain management, and the quality prediction software system can make it easier, which provides a new direction for the product quality control technology research.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The water crisis in the state of Selangor has prompted the state water authority to use water from abandoned mining pools as an alternative resource of raw water supply. In this study, the potential use of the mining pool water has been assessed to evaluate its safe use for potable water consumption, which is the source of raw water to be supplied to water treatment plants. Assessments were made between sampling sites that include abandoned mining pools, active sand mining pools, and the receiving streams (two tributaries and the main river, Selangor River) within Bestari Jaya catchment, Selangor River Basin. As anticipated, some concentrations of metals were found in the active mining pool and in its discharge, such as iron, manganese, lead, copper and zinc. However, the trace elements were found at very low concentrations or below detection limits in the abandoned mining pools and in the rivers. It was found that generally the quality of the water in the rivers (upstream of water intake of the water treatment plants) was well below the recommended guideline limits set out by the Malaysia Ministry of Health for untreated raw water, and therefore is safe for potable water use.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cost pressures are driving the semiconductor industry to look for solutions that meet the challenge of expensive next generation silicon node fabrication. Simply integrating all functions in a single die may no longer be the most economical option. In addition, the need for close proximity of die and components has driven the development of packages that provide both the price and performance needs. System-in-Package (SiP) is gaining popularity as one of the most promising integration solutions. SiP is a functional system or subsystem assembled into a single package. It may contain two or more dissimilar die, typically combined with other components such as passives, filters, antennas, and/or mechanical parts. The components are mounted together on a substrate to create a customized, highly integrated product for a given application. SiPs may utilize a combination of wire bond, flip chip, wafer level packages, pre-packaged ICs such as CSPs, stacked packages, and/or stacked die. This presentation examines the role of system-in-package (SiP) discussing the formats most likely to emerge as volume packages and the supply chain requirements to produce these packages. The roles of OSATs and EMS companies are discussed with a discussion on the advantages and challenges of each.</jats:p>",

In particular, an emphasis is given especially on efficiency, optimization of operation, predictability, and synergistic effects. The operation effectiveness will be evaluated from several perspectives such as the thermal properties of the objects, characteristics and properties of resources, and internal air quality. The proposed system based on the analytical/static approaches (e.g. heat loss models of heated objects) and applying the techniques of computational intelligence (e.g. artificial neural networks) creates a dynamic environment that can predict the amount of heat delivered not only on the basis of the energy requirements for the thermal balance of the heated objects and the current weather forecast, but the use of the data base and universal approximators in the field of computational intelligence on the behavior of objects in different operating conditions.</jats:p>"

Hence, the participating organizations, people and transport processes are part of a Supply Chain. The Wood Supply Chain denotes a special Supply Chain that describes the flow of timber. This work focuses on the logistic operations from timber production to the first processing step in a saw or paper mill, and seeks to optimize the Wood Supply Chain with Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search. By introducing spatial amendments to Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search it is capable of solving the spatial-temporal problem of Wood Supply Chain optimization. A comparison of the obtained results and initial results give evidence that the optimization approach with spatial amendments results in an increase of the objective function of the given problem.</p>",

The SWH dataset was collected from a buoy station located in the North Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, the time series of SWH was decomposed into some subseries using WT and then decomposed time series were imported to the GMDH model to forecast the SWH. Performance of the wavelet group method of data handling (WGMDH) model was evaluated using an index of agreement (Ia), coefficient of efficiency and root mean square error. The analysis proved that the model accuracy is highly dependent on the decomposition levels. The results showed that the WGMDH model is able to forecast the SWH with a high reliability.</jats:p>",

The eco-innovations were developed by a supply network of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the framework of a project named “Hi-reach”. The component considered is a motorcycle rear wheel spindle. The conventional version is obtained by machining a single forged steel part. The Hi-reach version is indeed manufactured by joining a shaft to a flange; in addition, conventional surface treatments are replaced by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) treatment and other machining steps are improved. This process was conceived with the aim of maintaining (or enhancing) the technical performance of the spindle and reducing production costs. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the two scenarios described. Those eco-innovations resulted in significant improvements of the environmental performance of the analysed component, ranging, on average, between 50% and 70% for the impact indicators considered. Our results also highlight the role of SMEs in promoting process eco-innovations and the increasing relevance of LCA as a tool to support decision making in manufacturing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Power failures in a number of electric systems worldwide emphasize the importance of security of electric supply. Security of supply involves long term resource adequacy and medium to short term generation reserve management. Generation reserve requirements are usually determined using empirical rules considering the demand as a deterministic quantity. Ignoring randomness could lead to suboptimal decisions. The research presented here differs from that prevailing in the literature by considering the demand as a random variable following a doubly truncated normal distribution this has the advantage of allowing considering day to day and seasonal variations. In this paper two new mathematical models are presented to determine generation reserve requirements for a market in which the regulator imposes an extremely high load curtailment cost in any unmet demand and delegates the role of buying generation reserves on the generators in a secondary market. These models are helpful tools to study analytically or by numerical simulation the interactions between the two markets. A potential scope for application of the proposed models is presented for the Colombian electric market.</jats:p>"

In this article, we present formulations for the strategic supply chain network design problem with dual objectives, which usually conflict with each other: minimizing cost and maximizing reliability. Quantifying the total reliability of a network design is not as straightforward as total cost calculation. We use reliability indices and develop analytical formulations that model the impact of upstream supply chain on individual entities’ reliability to quantify the total reliability of a network. The resulting multiobjective nonlinear model is solved using a novel hybrid algorithm that utilizes a genetic algorithm for network design and linear programming for network flow optimization. We demonstrate the application of our approach through illustrative examples in establishing tradeoffs between cost and reliability in network design and present managerial implications.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the supply chain practices and challenges of craft producers in South Africa. A survey was conducted among 199 craft producers in Gauteng, South Africa. A convenience sampling method was adopted owing to the difficulty of accessing a reliable database of craft producers. Craft producers rely mainly on phones for customers to place orders. However, they use variety of methods for order placement. Customers are allowed to also visit the factory to buy products and they can buy at the exhibition. They use a variety of production methods. Due to transportation challenges, craft producers also make use of public transport to deliver goods and keep some products at the warehouse. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper develops a centralized supply chain model that integrates material flows with cash flows. The supply chain is owned by a single firm with two divisions. The downstream division (headquarters), facing random customer demand, replenishes materials from the upstream division. The firm installs a financial services platform that pools the divisions’ cash into a master account managed by the headquarters. In each period, cash is received from customers and paid to the outside vendor after materials are delivered. The headquarters determines how much cash to retain for inventory replenishment. The objective is to determine an optimal joint inventory replenishment and cash retention policy for the entire supply chain. We prove that the optimal policy has a surprisingly simple structure—both divisions implement a base-stock policy for inventory replenishment; the headquarters monitors the corporate working capital and implements a two-threshold policy for cash retention. This result is obtained by extending the well-known Clark-Scarf decomposition with newly derived cash-related penalty functions. The optimal policy enables us to investigate the interaction between cash and inventory decisions. We show that in the presence of transaction costs, a firm may stock more even if the inventory holding cost increases. To quantify the value of financial integration, we compare the cash pooling model with systems under different levels of financial integration. Our study suggests that the value of cash pooling can be significant when demand is increasing (respectively, stationary) and the internal transfer price is low (respectively, high). Nevertheless, a significant amount of cash pooling benefit may be recovered if the headquarters can optimize the internal transfer price.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water demand has increased in metropolitan cities due to fast population growth and industrial development. Jilin City, located in the middle of Jilin province, northeast China, has a population of approximately 4.30 million. The main water source for Jilin City is the Songhua River which has a lot of problems. This study aims to determine the appropriate groundwater resource field for Jilin City by groundwater quantity analysis, groundwater quality analysis and multivariate statistical analysis. Results showed that the groundwater quantity in the study area was separated into four main areas. Most of the study areas had good groundwater supplies. The dominant ions were Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, NO3−, HCO3− and SO42−. The groundwater types can be classified as Ca–HCO3, Ca + Mg–HCO3, Ca + Na–HCO3, Ca + HCO3–SO4, Ca + Mg–HCO3 + SO4 and Ca + Na–HCO3 + SO4. The regions of groundwater satisfying the groundwater quality standard can be separated into five main areas. Using principal component analysis (PCA), five principal factors were extracted from the dataset. Factor 1 had high positive loadings for most of the major ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3− and SO42−) as well as for total hardness (TH) and electrical conductivity (EC), which represents the natural hydro-geochemical evolution of groundwater by groundwater-geological interaction. Factor 2 was dominated by F−, pH and PO43−, which may be due to anthropogenic pollution sources. Factor 3 was dominated by NO2−, NH4+ and NO3−, which may also be due to anthropogenic pollution sources. Factor 4 had a higher loading of chemical oxygen demand (COD), which again may be due to anthropogenic pollution sources. Factor 5 was dominated by Fe and Mn, which are produced by weathering-leaching-dissolution processes. The score values of the principal factors were influenced by urban land use. Chuanying region is the area in which the quality of groundwater is relatively good. It was determined that No. 6 region in Chuanying region is the groundwater resource field which has sufficient good quality water.</jats:p>",

This sector forms a major part of Indian industrial base. Small and Medium scale industries contribute about 10% of total GDP. The Small and Medium Scale Industries (SMSI) are supported by the government and financial institutions like Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation (TIIC), State Bank of India (SBI) etc., in terms of technical and financial assistance. Even then Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE) are lagging in infrastructure, skilled labour. In order to analyse the various risk factors in SMSI, the survey was conducted in 20 small and medium scale industries who are supplying their product to many Tier 1 companies and leading automobile companies of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in India. This paper brings out most critical supply chain risk factors exist in every business processes inside and outside the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is used to prioritize supply chain risk factors and also the SMSI owners and managers are advised to focus from the highest ranking critical factors to improve their technical and financial performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines how a firm’s financial distress and the legal environment regarding the ease of bankruptcy reorganization can alter product market competition and supplier–buyer relationships. We identify three effects—predation, bail-out, and abetment—that can change firms’ behavior from their actions in the absence of financial distress. The predation effect increases competition before potential bankruptcy as the nondistressed competitor behaves as if it has some first-mover advantage that could benefit a supplier with price control. The bail-out effect reflects the supplier’s incentive to grant the distressed firm concessions to preserve competition, improving supply chain efficiency and providing support for the exclusivity rule in Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code when the supplier and the distressed firm are financially linked. The abetment effect is that the supplier may deliberately abet the competitor’s predation, leading to increased operational disadvantages for the distressed firm before bankruptcy. Together these effects stress that a firm’s bankruptcy potential can hurt its competitors and benefit its suppliers/customers. They also provide guidelines for firms’ operational decisions in such situations, a rationale for observed firm actions surrounding bankruptcies, and motivation for policies supporting reorganization and relaxing broad enforcement of nondiscriminatory pricing regulations. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

Focusing on underserved households in Kenya, this study compared user perceptions and preferences on water-service provision options, particularly investigating the viability of decentralized models, such as the Safe Water Enterprise (SWE), as sustainable safe drinking water sources. Results showed that among a number of water-service provision options available, the majority of households regularly sourced their domestic water from more than one source (86% Ngoliba/Maguguni, 98% Kangemi Gichagi). A majority of households perceived their water sources to be unsafe to drink  (84% Ngoliba/Maguguni, 73% Kangemi Gichagi). For this reason, drinking water was mainly chlorinated (48% Ngoliba/Maguguni, 33% Kangemi Gichagi) or boiled  (42% Ngoliba/Maguguni, 67% Kangemi Gichagi). However, this study also found that households in Kenya did not apply these household water treatment methods consistently, thus indicating inconsistency in safe water consumption. The SWE concept, a community-scale decentralized safe drinking water source, was a preferred option among households who perceived it to save time and to be less cumbersome as compared to boiling and chlorination. Willingness to pay for SWE water was also a positive indicator for its preference by the underserved households. However, the long-term applicability of such decentralized water provision models needs to be further investigated within the larger water-service provision context.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Interest in agricultural supply response increased dramatically after model predictions of land use change were used to estimate biofuel greenhouse gas emissions. The models divide crop response into higher yield—the intensive margin—or more land—the extensive margin. Input adjustments are assumed to drive yield response. But most yield changes result from adoption of technology. Regulators and modelers assume that increased harvested area implies conversion of land from forest or pasture to crops. With the notable exception of African countries, recent expansion of harvested area is due to more intensive use of existing agricultural land through multiple cropping and technology improvement. A lack of response at the extensive margin is consistent with inelastic estimates of land use change estimated by using time-series data. Option value is one reason for this inelastic response. Predictions of land use change based on cross-section data imply much higher land use elasticities than are consistent with recent data. </jats:p>",

These services offer, for example, consistent global networking platforms and shared real-time information. Furthermore, they enable quick decision making and ensure efficiency, which may strengthen competitive advantages as to digital processes within the supply chain (SC). However, research lacks a paper that systematically analyzes the interrelation between CC and SCM in detail and aims to become a reference point in the intersection of both research fields. Moreover, the purpose of this paper is to gain a deep understanding of the current state of research and to identify future research challenges. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper provides a cross-discipline systematic literature review from the research perspectives of ISs and SCM.

Results from a panel data of production areas between 2003 and 2013 show that once a basic supply-past production (or reserve) relationship is modeled, other often mentioned effects become non-significant. Chiefly among them are firm specific effects that were used as a central argument for the nationalization of YPF in 2012. Rather, the evidence shows that the observed downcycle conforms to the prediction of a simple model of depressed economic incentives acting upon mature conventional natural gas fields and hindering investment in reserve additions or new technologies. The results are robust to the nationalization of YPF, after which aggregate production continued a downward trend for two years, although are insufficient to capture an ongoing reconfiguration of incentives and risks in the forthcoming transition to shale gas production. </jats:p>",

I find increases in fertility and decreases in labor force participation rates among high-skilled US-born women in cities that have experienced larger immigrant inflows. Most interestingly, these changes have been accompanied by decreases in the strength of the negative correlation between childbearing and labor force participation, an often-used measure of the difficulty with which women combine motherhood and labor market work. Using a structured statistical model, I show that the immigrant-induced attenuation of this negative correlation can explain about 24% of the immigrant-induced increases in the joint likelihood of childbearing and labor force participation in the US between the years 1980 and 2000.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>JEL codes</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>D10, F22, J13, J22, R23</jats:p>",

It also causes the development of corrosion in steel and concrete. De-acidification of groundwater by means of air bubbles alters pH and the concentration of aggressive carbon dioxide. This was investigated for the variables of air flow (Q = 20–50 L h−1) and height of water layer (H = 25–75 cm) as well as aeration time (t = 0–20 min). The obtained three-parameter models showed good correlation with the experimental results, except in a few cases where r2 was bigger than 0.9. Furthermore, they allow for prediction of an increase of pH and a decrease in concentration of aggressive carbon dioxide in aerated water. The effectiveness of de-acidification of groundwater was evaluated using indices of water stability (Langelier Saturation Index, Precipitation Index, Ryznar Stability Index, Aggressiveness Index and Index of Aggressiveness). Although as a result of aeration an increase of pH over 7 was observed, the non-corrosive values of the indices were not reached. This was due to a very low alkalinity of water, which was 0.7 meq L−1.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In global competitive atmosphere, foundry industries are needed to perform efficiently with minimum percentage of rejections there by reducing cost of manufacturing. Foundries are using state of art processes with the involvement of experienced and knowledgeable people but the experience and knowledge needs to be transformed for the growth of the industries. Some foundries are working in a trial and error mode and get their work done. Many foundries have very less control on the rejections since they are in critical need of meeting production targets and they ignore the rejections and recover the castings. They need to have an efficient quality control aspiring for defects free castings with minimum production cost. Strategic decision makers need extensive models to guide them for efficient decision making that increases their profitability of the entire chain. The noval idea of this research is to investigate the various defects of cast iron foundry and suggest remedies for the defects in a day to day activity and propose a supply chain model to present the necessity of quality in a medium scale industry of cast iron foundry under different delay conditions, rejection rates and also various other factors. The results of the proposed model have been discussed and confirmed based on the original results of an industry. This research is also inspects the relationship between supply chain processes and quality as a key role in supply chain management.</jats:p>"

In the studied analysis the supply chains are embedded in a single model which highlights all the interconnections that have little evidence in traditional models. The complex network is studied analyzing the matrix that constitutes the network with algorithms and methods extensively tested and validated. This analytical approach has already been applied with positive results in many research areas such as social networks, transport networks, the stylistic of writers and musicians, proteomics, pharmacology, medicine, biology and many others. We apply this methodology to supply chains of products of animal origin and show a series of preliminary results. This method of study of food supply chains could be useful for an observatory, bringing to light slightly evident relations and becoming a strong support for policy-makers. It can also provide useful advices to individual actors on how to optimize their own supply chains. Finally, through an effective enumeration and evaluation of the relationships, a network model could be helpful in design of tracking and traceability systems.</jats:p>"

Since exact estimation is a bulky task, it adopts an approximation model based on poverty database, mixmarket database and some complementary reports on microfinance. The study shows that microfinance demand has shown a trend of increasing growth for India as well as Assam and stands its candidature as a potential matured market in future. The supply of microfinance for India as a whole is at low level, which shares only 0.70 per cent of gross domestic product of India. From the regional perspective, southern region dominates the supply of microfinance and Assam shares the least. The study indicates a huge mismatch between demand for and supply of microfinance and considering mixmarket average loan size all the regions of India are deficient in terms microfinance supply. The study further indicates some of the possible reasons for the mismatch.  Int. J. Soc. Sci. Manage. Vol-2, issue-4: 308-314</jats:p>"

Firstly, a history database which includes the forecasting models and correlative factors was first built and association rule mining was conducted; then combined with the correlative factors in the designated area, the criteria matching in the rules mined were carried out with CBR technique; finally automatic recommendation of the power supply modes was achieved under the given conditions. By application of an example, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can not only automatically analyze the applicability of power supply modes and the intrinsic relationship between correlative factors but also provide, to some extent, theoretical basis for selection of power supply modes and practical utility for urban distribution network planning.</jats:p>",

Africa in this trend has not been left behind with the IMF reporting that six out of ten fastest growing economies in the world are found in Africa. Specifically, East Africa is one of the regions that have experienced this positive trend relating to moreintegration of the economies, high average GDP growth, and tremendous increase in international freight destined for overseas and inlandthrough the ports of Mombasa and Dares Salaam. The rise in freightvolume however, has resulted into port terminal capacity and productivity challenges, congestion along transport corridors, damage of highways, traffic jam in port cities and environmental pollution hence making the nature of growth and development expensive and unsustainable.\nThis conceptual paper therefore tries topropose the adoption of the ‘extended gateway concept ‘to be integrated into East Africa’s transportation -logistics systemin order to manage and prevent supply chain related disruptions related to time,costs,reliability and safety .The paper presents a theoretical meaning of the concept, discusses the logistical challenges of East Africa from a shipping perspective, and proposes a ‘<jats:italic>Three tier’</jats:italic> Extended gateway model for the region based on the development of inland intermodal terminals or dry ports to achieve a modern, economically and environmentally sustainable fright transportation system.\n </jats:p>"

The problem features a dyadic channel where a dominant buyer operates a multiperiod inventory system with lost sales and fixed cost. He replenishes from a supplier, whose private state of production is vulnerable to random shocks and evolves dynamically over time. We characterize the optimal inventory policy with a simple semi‐stationary structure; it distorts order quantity for limiting information rent only in the initial period; the optimal payment compensates for production cost in every period but concedes real information rent only in the initial period. These properties allow us to derive an easy‐to‐implement revenue‐sharing contract that facilitates ex ante strategic planning and ex post dynamic execution. This work advances our understanding on when and how to use private information in dynamic risk management. </jats:p>",

Laboratory and pilot plant studies are often carried out prior to the design of full-scale water treatment plants. Emphases are laid on how accurately these laboratory and pilot plant studies represent actual industrial-scale systems and the limitations. A case study which encompasses laboratory experiments, pilot plant and industrial-scale UF systems has been carried out in Malaysia using the same type of modified polyethersulfone hollow fiber UF membrane and surface raw water source. This research elaborates on the practical utilization of laboratory experiments and pilot plant results on the design and scale-up for industrial-scale water treatment plants. The results obtained in filtrate quality, transmembrane pressure and specific electricity requirements elucidate that both laboratory- and pilot-scale studies are essential to determine the detailed design criteria of an industrial-scale UF membrane water treatment plant with limitations that require attention. Design engineers are able to reduce the safety factor allowance and minimize cost by utilizing laboratory- and pilot-scale results for the scale-up of UF membrane water treatment plants.</jats:p>",

Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) dosages were selected based on a point of diminishing returns for biopolymer removal (0.5 mg/L) and directly compared to that applied at full-scale (6 mg/L). Membrane fouling (reversible and irreversible) was measured as resistance increase over a 48 hour filtration period. DBP formation potential (total trihalomethanes (TTHMs), haloacetic acids (HAA9) and total adsorbable organic halides (AOX)) were measured in both raw and treated waters. Results of the study indicate that application of a PACl dose optimized for biopolymer reduction (0.5 mg/L) resulted in 65% less irreversible UF fouling when compared to 6 mg/L. The addition of PACl prior to the membrane resulted in up to a 14% reduction in DBP precursors relative to the UF membrane alone. A similar level of DBP precursor reduction was achieved for both 0.5 and 6 mg/L dosages. The results have implications for cost savings, which may be realized due to decreased chemical use, as well as increased membrane life associated with lower irreversible fouling rates.</jats:p>",

Precipitation is the main recharge factor for mineral water in Fusong County; therefore, it is necessary to determine whether precipitation can effectively guarantee the supply of mineral water resources. In this study, precipitation data from the Donggang hydrological station in Fusong County were collected and analyzed to determine annual changes in characteristics and extreme probability. The results show that precipitation is stable and that the probability of extreme precipitation is small. Precipitation and mineral spring discharge in the Mingshui, Baixi, No. 2 Jinjiang, and Laoling springs were then collected and analyzed for separate periods by using a continuous wavelet method. The results show that the main oscillation period of both precipitation and spring discharge is approximately 11 months. Finally, the cross-wavelet method is conducted to analyze the period relationships between spring discharge and precipitation. The results show that both precipitation and spring discharge share the same phase, which indicates spring discharge has an immediate reaction to precipitation changes.</jats:p>",

The bank loans’ demand and supply determinants are parameterized using the Johansen (1988) and the two-step Engle and Granger (1987) approaches to cointegration and error correction dynamic modelling. The main results reveal that the demand for loans in the long run depends mainly on the economic activity, capital inflows, deposits and loans to deposits ratio of the non-financial sector. In the short term these determinants are complemented by imports of goods and services. The supply of loans, however, in all time frames is influenced primarily by changes in banks’ liquidity, net interest income, capital adequacy and the producer prices dynamics, but in the long term consumer prices, market concentration and foreign ownership are supplementing the supply of loans’ drivers.</jats:p>",

The biomass, optimum backwashing conditions, treatment efficiency, and surface morphological properties of the B-IOMSNP were investigated via bio-filtration experiments. The raw quartz sands (RQS) and IOMSNP exhibited biomass levels of 24.32 nmol-P/(g-sand) and 83.71 nmol-P/(g-sand), respectively. The B-IOMSNP filter exhibited a lower swelling ratio, smaller initial head loss, and longer filtration period when water and air were used alternately for backwashing rather than water alone. In addition, the B-IOMSNP was most effective when air alone (at a strength of qair,I = 7 L/(s·m2) for tair,I = 6 min), a combination of air and water (at strengths of qair,II = 7 L/(s·m2) and qwater,II = 5 L/(s·m2) for tair-water,II = 6 min, respectively), and water alone (at a strength of qwater,III = 7 L/(s·m2) for twater,III = 4 min) were used alternately for flushing. The results indicated that the proposed B-IOMSNP could efficiently resist the shock induced by high NH4+-N concentrations (4 mg/L). The ripening period of the B-IOMSNP column was equal to 30 minutes. Furthermore, the B-IOMSNP reduced the turbidity of the water to values of less than 0.2 NTU for 72 hours and exhibited an NH4+-N removal rate of up to 96% and a head loss of 132 cm. In contrast, the biofilm-coated RQS exhibited an NH4+-N removal rate varying from 60% to 82%, a filtration period of 16 hours, and a terminal head loss of 58 cm. Due to its nano-pores and rough surface, the IOMSNP exhibited a specific surface area 39 times greater than that of the RQS, resulting in a higher filtration performance and absorption capacity.</jats:p>",

Each PBM selects a list of prices to be charged to the client organization for each of the branded and generic drugs within a therapeutic class (price decision) and a formulary list that assigns branded drugs to preferred or nonpreferred tiers (formulary decision). Drug manufacturers offer rebates to PBMs for drugs on preferred tier of formularies. The individuals participating in the client’s pharmacy benefit plan are the ones consuming the drugs and making purchasing decisions, whereas the client organization is paying the majority of drug cost. The choices of the individuals and the client organization are governed by different utility measures. For this complex drug distribution setting and for competing PBMs, we show the existence and uniqueness of a pure Nash equilibrium on aggregate formulary and price decisions, which represent the welfare-adjusted cost and welfare-adjusted price of each PBM’s plan, respectively. We characterize each PBM’s optimal formulary and equilibrium price decisions and discuss the impact of various model primitives. We apply our model to gain insights on the impact of mergers in the PBM industry. </jats:p>",

The comparisons have been made with respect to convective mass transfer coefficients, permeation and rejection rates, and energy consumption. Similar operating and hydrodynamic conditions were implemented for the comparison. According to our experimental data the circular crossflow module was proven to perform better as compared with the stirred dead end system due to the higher mass transfer coefficients, higher permeation rates and lower energy consumption. The mass transfer coefficients observed are comparable to those previously found in vortex flow filtration and dead end flow filtration. The presence of Dean vortices in the circular crossflow module promotes flow instabilities in the curved channel flow path which reduce the concentration polarization effect during the filtration process. The concentration polarization effect however deteriorated due to solute build up (high solute concentration at the membrane surface) and decrease of the shear stress, i.e., the particle lift forces on the membrane surface. This resulted in deposition of particles on the membrane surface. In terms of energy consumption, for the same energy cost the limiting flux reached in circular crossflow was found to be higher than in the stirred dead end unit.</jats:p>",

While it receives a lot of attention in the global context, the assessment of food waste is deficient at the sub-national level, owing primarily to an absence of quality data. This article serves to explore that gap and aims to quantify the edible weight, economic value, and calorie equivalent of food waste in Hawaii. The estimates are based on available food supply data for Hawaii and the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) loss-adjusted food availability data for defined food groups at three stages of the food supply chain. At its highest aggregated level, we estimate Hawaii’s food waste generation at 237,122 t or 26% of available food supply in 2010. This is equivalent to food waste of 161.5 kg per person, per annum. Additionally, this food waste is valued at US$1.025 billion annually or the equivalent of 502.6 billion calories. It is further evident that the occurrence of food waste by all three measures is highest at the consumer stage, followed by the distribution and retail stage, and is lowest at the post-harvest and packing stage. The findings suggest that any meaningful intervention to reduce food waste in Hawaii should target the consumer, and distribution and retail stages of the food supply chain. Interventions at the consumer stage should focus on the two protein groups, as well as fresh fruits and fresh vegetables. </jats:p>",

The evolutions of surface fronts of the simulated cyclone resemble the Shapiro–Keyser model. At the time of the maximum deepening rate, strong mesoscale diabatic heating areas appear over the bent-back front and the warm front east of the cyclone center. Diabatic heating over the bent-back front and the eastern warm front is mainly induced by the condensation of moisture imported by the cold conveyor belt (CCB) and the warm conveyor belt (WCB), respectively. The dry air parcels transported by the CCB can receive large amounts of moisture from the warm currents, whereas the very humid air parcels transported by the WCB can hardly be modified by those currents. The well-organized nature of the CCB plays a key role not only in enhancing surface evaporation from the warm currents but also in importing the evaporated vapor into the bent-back front. The imported vapor converges at the bent-back front, leading to latent heat release. The latent heating facilitates the cyclone’s development through the production of positive potential vorticity in the lower troposphere. Its deepening can, in turn, reinforce the CCB. In the presence of a favorable synoptic-scale environment, such a positive feedback process can lead to the rapid intensification of a cyclone over warm currents.</jats:p>",

First, the authors investigate the impact of knowledge integration in terms of joint decision-making and joint sense-making, on relational performance, including operational efficiency and innovation. Second, the authors examine the key antecedents that might facilitate knowledge integration: strategic supply management and trust. The paper aims to discuss these issues.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– This paper expands and tests theory drawing upon survey data from 133 buyer-supplier relationships (BSRs). The authors employed a two-step process of analysis to evaluate first the measurement model and then the structural model. The measurement model test built upon confirmatory factor analysis, while the structural model quality test built upon path analysis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The results suggest that both integrative mechanisms, joint decision making and joint sense making, affect performance although in different ways. This study also finds that while trust has multiple significant influences and consequently must be viewed as an organizing principle, strategic supply management is required to jointly understand the dynamic and complex context but not to jointly make ongoing decisions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Three limitations: first, this study was cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. Second, in line with accepted practice, the authors surveyed only one side of the relationship. The suppliers’ viewpoint is thus not fully taken into account. Third, another potential limitation of the study is that the sample stems from just one country and its size does not distinguish subgroups in the analysis of the path model.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Managers should be advised that: first, a trusting partnership built on knowledge integration is a hard order, especially with a new, unknown supplier in a low-cost country, where intellectual property protection is less obvious; second, strategic supply management may not improve cost or operational performance, but in its absence, it is unlikely that a supplier has insight into the exact needs of its buyer and thus, may not add considerable value to their customers; third, building a dynamic knowledge integration capability (valuable, rare, and difficult to imitate) takes time, as does creating reliable learning mechanisms. Joint teams, visit partners’ workplace, early involve suppliers in developing new products or selection of supplier with high-learning capabilities may help to create a knowledge integration capability.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The authors suggest that companies should move from an arm-length relationship and turn their supplier relationships into a tool for innovating faster while cutting cost. In order to do this, joint sense-making and joint decision should be seen as institutionalized inter-firm routines rather than ad hoc activities. Thus, the authors recommend managers to proactively build certain knowledge-based capabilities that hinges heavily upon a strategic stance toward supply management and trustful relationships with selected suppliers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The major intent of this research is to expand understanding of knowledge integration by building a more testable, complex model around its creation. While previous research relied on a configuration approach to explore the relationship between knowledge integration and performance, the authors evaluate causal relationships at the level of the formative dimensions rather than higher order knowledge integration, as this has proven to be a superior analytical method. Second, although supply chain scholars have expressed great interest in trust, an in-depth examination of prior studies in knowledge integration indicate that trust has been analyzed alone. In contrast, the study empirically examines the simultaneous effect of trust and strategic supply management in BSRs.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Hence, the number of cholera cases or deaths prevented in an endemic setting represents the minimum utility of these doses, and the optimal risk-averse response to any reactive vaccination request (i.e. the minimax strategy) is one that allocates the remaining doses between the requested epidemic response and endemic use in order to ensure that at least this minimum utility is achieved. Using mathematical models, we find that the best minimax strategy is to allocate the majority of doses to reactive campaigns, unless the request came late in the targeted epidemic. As vaccine supplies dwindle, the case for reactive use of the remaining doses grows stronger. Our analysis provides a lower bound for the amount of OCV to keep in reserve when responding to any request. These results provide a strategic context for the fulfilment of requests to the stockpile, and define allocation strategies that minimize the number of OCV doses that are allocated to suboptimal situations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Gel particles such as the polysaccharidic transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and the proteinaceous Coomassie stainable particles (CSP) play an important role in marine biogeochemical and ecological processes like particle aggregation and export, or microbial nutrition and growth. So far, effects of nutrient availability or of changes in nutrient ratios on gel particle production and fate are not well understood. The tropical ocean includes large oxygen minimum zones, where nitrogen losses due to anaerobic microbial activity result in a lower supply of nitrate relative to phosphate to the euphotic zone. Here, we report of two series of mesocosm experiments that were conducted with natural plankton communities collected from the eastern tropical North Atlantic (ETNA) close to Cape Verde in October 2012. The experiments were performed to investigate how different phosphate (experiment 1, Varied P: 0.15–1.58 μmol L−1) or nitrate (experiment 2, Varied N: 1.9–21.9 μmol L−1) concentrations affect the abundance and size distribution of TEP and CSP. In the days until the bloom peak was reached, a positive correlation between gel particle abundance and Chl a concentration was determined, linking the release of dissolved gel precursors and the subsequent formation of gel particles to autotrophic production. After the bloom peak, gel particle abundance remained stable or even increased, implying a continued partitioning of dissolved into particulate organic matter after biomass production itself ceased. During both experiments, differences between TEP and CSP dynamics were observed; TEP were generally more abundant than CSP. Changes in size distribution indicated aggregation of TEP after the bloom, while newly formed CSP decomposed. Abundance of gel particles clearly increased with nitrate concentration during the second experiment, suggesting that changes in [DIN] : [DIP] ratios can affect gel particle formation with potential consequences for carbon and nitrogen cycling as well as food web dynamics in tropical ecosystems.\n                    </jats:p>"

Our framework is based on the idea of overlaying product-related metadata onto the interactive graph representations of a supply chain and its associated product architecture. By coupling environmental data with graph-based visualizations of product architecture, our framework provides a novel decision platform for expert designers. Here, the user can balance the advantages of a redesign opportunity and manage the associated risk on the product and supply chain. For demonstration, we present ViSER, an interactive visualization tool that provides an interface consisting of different mutually coordinated views providing multiple perspectives on a particular supply chain presentation. To explore the utility of ViSER, we conduct a domain expert exploration using a case study of peripheral computer equipment. Results indicate that ViSER enables new affordances within the decision making process for supply chain redesign.</jats:p>",

A conceptual rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate catchment runoff, and the reliability of 29 notional and six actual reservoirs was calculated using a simple storage model. The relationship between water supply reliability and the variability of rainfall was then investigated using different measures of variability. A strong correlation was found between reservoir reliability and measures representing the distribution of rainfall between the winter and summer seasons, as well as the cumulative sum (CUSUM) of annual precipitation, quantifying the variability of rainfall between years. In contrast, mainly the intra-annual CUSUM range and the variance of monthly precipitation influenced the reliability of river-intake schemes. The presence of periodic patterns in rainfall anomalies was found to be more prevalent in West Scotland, where reservoir reliability is on average lower than in the East. In addition, a sensitivity analysis revealed the small influence of evapotranspiration on reservoir reliability in comparison to rainfall variability. This study reveals the measures of variability most affecting the reliability of surface water supplies in Scotland, and could therefore help with their management in the context of future climate change.</jats:p>",

The renewable technology can be coupled with conventional technologies to form a capacity portfolio that is used to meet stochastic demand for energy. The technologies have different initial investments and operating costs, and the operating costs follow different stochastic processes. We show how to reduce this problem to a single-period decision problem and how to estimate the joint distribution of the stochastic factors using historical data. Importantly, we show that data granularity for renewable yield and electricity demand at a fine level, such as hourly, matters: Without energy storage, coarse data that does not reflect the intermittency of renewable generation may lead to an overinvestment in renewable capacity. We obtain solutions that are simple to compute, intuitive, and provide managers with a framework for evaluating the trade-offs of investing in renewable and conventional technologies. We illustrate our model using two case studies: one for investing in a solar rooftop system for a bank branch and another for investing in a solar thermal system for water heating in a hotel, along with a conventional natural gas heating system.</jats:p>",

The paper extends the collaborative model that we have studied previously by characterizing it as a channel power structure under which the manufacturer plays the leader role in the collaboration. Furthermore, the paper compares this collaborative model with a competitive model in which the manufacturer competes with the remanufacturer in the market on pricing, sales volume and profit and finds that even if the manufacturer chooses to collaborate with the remanufacturer, it does not give up its market position; the manufacturer keeps the price of its product unchanged as the remanufactured product becomes increasingly acceptable to the consumer, and its product's sales volume remains unchanged in both models. Finally, this paper observes that the collaborative model benefits the manufacturer more than the competitive model, whereas the competitive model benefits the remanufacturer more than the collaborative model. Obviously, if collaboration benefits both of the manufacturer and remanufacturer, they will choose to collaborate, and the manufacturer will transfer part of its profit to the remanufacturer, but if competition brings them more profit, they will choose to compete in the market, and the remanufacturer will transfer part of its profit to the manufacturer. </jats:p>",

This paper investigates the condition under which component commonality is a profitable product design strategy for a firm by considering customer-choice behavior in the supply chain environment. The design configuration with commonality can lower manufacturing cost, but it also reduces product differentiation and revenue. While the customer-choice behavior with utility maximization will impact the retailer's product pricing, we analyze a stylized model of the manufacturer who designs a product family consisting of two products for two market segments with different valuations of quality. By explicitly considering the interrelationship between customer's utility and retail price, we find that commonality strategy is conditionally profitable. Theoretical research reveals that the optimal product design strategy depends on the marginal valuations of customer-choice behavior and the cost-coefficient of the common component determined by the supplier. An example is used to illustrate how some supply chain parameters impact the optimal product design strategy. </jats:p>",

These risks are difficult to predict and quantify; therefore, they are difficult to manage. As a result, managers may suboptimally deploy countermeasures, leaving their firms exposed to some risks, while wasting resources to mitigate other risks that would not cause significant damage. In a three-year research engagement with Ford Motor Company, we addressed this practical need by developing a novel risk-exposure model that assesses the impact of a disruption originating anywhere in a firm’s supply chain. Our approach defers the need for a company to estimate the probability associated with any specific disruption risk until after it has learned the effect such a disruption will have on its operations. As a result, the company can make more informed decisions about where to focus its limited risk-management resources. We demonstrate how Ford applied this model to identify previously unrecognized risk exposures, evaluate predisruption risk-mitigation actions, and develop optimal postdisruption contingency plans, including circumstances in which the duration of the disruption is unknown. </jats:p>",

Synchronizing soil N supply and crop demand will address this problem, however current soil analysis methods provide little insight into delivery and acquisition of N forms by roots. We used microdialysis, a novel technique for <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> quantification of soil nutrient fluxes, to measure N fluxes in sugarcane cropping soils receiving different fertilizer regimes and compare these with N uptake capacities of sugarcane roots. We show that in fertilized sugarcane soils, fluxes of inorganic N exceed the uptake capacities of sugarcane roots by several orders of magnitude. Contrary, fluxes of organic N closely matched roots’ uptake capacity. These results indicate root uptake capacity constrains plant acquisition of inorganic N. This mismatch between soil N supply and root N uptake capacity is a likely key driver for low N efficiency in the studied crop system. Our results also suggest that (i) the relative contribution of inorganic N for plant nutrition may be overestimated when relying on soil extracts as indicators for root-available N and (ii) organic N may contribute more to crop N supply than is currently assumed.</jats:p>"

The aim of this study was to develop an index to estimate population diet quality using food purchase data. Supermarket receipt data of 1 month were available for 836 adults from a corporate office of a large retail chain. Participants were aged 19–65 years (mean 37·6 (<jats:sc>sd</jats:sc>9·3) years), 56 % were female and 63 % were overweight or obese. A scoring system (Healthy Trolley Index (HETI)) was developed to compare food expenditure with the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Monthly expenditure per food group, as a proportion of total food expenditure, was compared with food group recommendations, and a HETI score was calculated to estimate overall compliance with guidelines. Participants spent the greatest proportion on discretionary foods, which are high in fat/sugar (34·8 %), followed by meat including beef and chicken (17·0 %), fresh and frozen vegetables (13·5 %) and dairy foods (11·3 %). The average HETI score ranged from 22·6 to 93·1 (out of 100, mean 58·8 (<jats:sc>sd</jats:sc>10·9)). There was a stepwise decrease in expenditure on discretionary foods by increasing HETI quintile, whereas expenditure on fruit and vegetables increased with HETI quintile (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·001). The HETI score was lower in obese compared with normal-weight participants (55·9<jats:italic>v</jats:italic>. 60·3;<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·01). Obese participants spent more on discretionary foods (38·3<jats:italic>v</jats:italic>. 32·7 %;<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·01) and less on fruits and vegetables (19·3<jats:italic>v</jats:italic>. 22·2 %;<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0·01). The HETI may be a useful tool to describe supermarket purchasing patterns and quality of the household food supply with application for consumer feedback to assist improved quality of foods purchased.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a simulation-based optimization supply chain model for supplying sawlogs to a sawmill from a forest management unit. The simulation model integrates the two-way flow of information and materials under the stochastic demand of the sawmill production unit. The dynamic optimization model finds the optimum inventory policy (s, S) that minimizes the total inventory cost for the three supply chain agents — sawmill storage, merchandizing yard, and forest management unit. The model is used to analyze a real sawmill case study in northwestern Ontario, Canada. It was found that the merchandizing yard absorbs shocks of uncertain demand from the sawmill production unit and reduces idle time, but it increases the total cost of the supply chain by $11 802 (about 42%). The optimized model predicts that only 3.5 days of inventory is required at the sawmill storage. The simulation-based optimization supplier model will help in decision-making at the tactical and operational level in the forest products industry supply chain through a two-way flow of information and materials. </jats:p>",

While most supply chain management research is directed toward supply chains in developed countries, the authors wish to explore the financial impact of disruptions on supply chains in a developing country. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of effective supply chain management practices that could help avoid or mitigate disruptions in Indian companies.

A significant stock decline was observed as early as three days prior to announcement, indicating possibility of insider trading and information differentials between investors. Irrespective of the location and responsibility of a disruption, companies experience significant negative returns. Company size, book-to-market ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio were found to be insignificant in affecting the stock market reactions to disruptions.

Some organics can leach from PE pipes into drinking water, which is undoubtedly harmful for consumers. In this study, potential organics leaching from two Chinese brands of PE pipe were investigated in order to determine the potential risk to both consumers and water quality. Their released amounts are characterized by UV254 instead of total organic carbon (TOC). Organics are identified by means of gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Influencing factors such as types of water, time, pH, residual chlorine are discussed. The cytotoxicity of leaching organics is first put forward in this study, and rat C6 glioma cell is used to assess the effect of leaching organics; the increasing dosage of soaking solution negatively affects morphology and relative viability of rat C6 glioma cell. The results show that residual chlorine, time and temperature have a positive effect on organics release, while pH plays an opposite role.</jats:p>",

Aircraft manufacturers, in the greener aviation context, need to care about the footprint of planes at the EOL. Considering the challenges in EOL aircraft recovery, the reverse logistics and green supply chain solutions in the other industrial sections cannot be applied in the aerospace industry.

The literature review is a research methodology that includes examining books, journals, conference proceedings and dissertations for available information on the area of research. The research area regarding EOL aircraft is new. A substantial amount of literature exists in the field of end-of-life vehicle, but the main content of literature about the aircraft recycling can be obtained via relatively few literature, technical reports, news and industrial experts’ opinions. The literature is complete in some respects while inadequate in others. A considerable amount of information has been gathered through graduate student projects. The other information has been collected via contacts with professionals involved in an EOL aircraft recycling project. The basis for this methodological framework comes from a research process proposed by Mayring (2010) that emphasizes on four steps: material collection, descriptive analysis, category section and material evaluation. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This paper addresses the opportunities and challenges of applying a green supply chain for aircraft manufacturers and analyzes the different aspects of aircraft at the EOL in the context of green supply chain. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – This study enriches the literature by identifying EOL aircraft value chain analysis in the sustainable development context.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Reform of the rural water supply sector occurred widely in the 1990s, when many low‐income countries replaced state‐led service provision with decentralized community management in the hope of generating improved technical and financial performance. This article asks whether these expected benefits have materialized in practice, and whether community management has strengthened institutional capacity at local, district and national level. Findings from a mixed‐methods study in four districts of Malawi show that both technical and financial performance under community management is weak. Maintenance is rarely done, repairs are slow and sub‐standard, and user committees are unable to collect and save funds: Average savings are just 2% of expected levels. Despite these failures, community management has ‘worked’ for the state (and donors) as a means of offloading responsibility for public service provision. The article suggests elements of an alternative framework for rural water supply that would tackle the technical and financial failures of community management, and notes that efforts to promote ‘local ownership’ in development must be undertaken with care. © 2015 The Authors. <jats:italic>Public Administration and Development</jats:italic> published by John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</jats:p>",

To reduce this problem and to provide new opportunities it is necessary to take into consideration different kinds of vegetable biomass that are more sustainable. Grass from the maintenance of non-cultivated areas such as riverbanks has not yet been fully studied as a potential biomass for biogas production. Although grass has lower methane potential, it could be interesting because it does not compete with food production. However, there is a lack of appropriate technologies and working system adapted to these areas. In this paper, different systems that could be available for the mowing and harvesting of grass along riverbanks have been preliminarily assessed through the evaluation of the field capacity, labour requirement, economic and energy aspects. The splitting of the cutting and harvesting phases into operations with different machinery seems to be the best system for handling this biomass. However, these solutions have to take into consideration the presence of obstacles or accessibility problems in the harvesting areas that could limit the operational feasibility and subsequent correct sizing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management of the products and goods flow from its origin point to point of consumption. During the process of SCM, information and dataset gathered for this application is massive and complex. This is due to its several processes such as procurement, product development and commercialization, physical distribution, outsourcing and partnerships. For a practical application, SCM datasets need to be managed and maintained to serve a better service to its three main categories; distributor, customer and supplier. To manage these datasets, a structure of data constellation is used to accommodate the data into the spatial database. However, the situation in geospatial database creates few problems, for example the performance of the database deteriorate especially during the query operation. We strongly believe that a more practical hierarchical tree structure is required for efficient process of SCM. Besides that, three-dimensional approach is required for the management of SCM datasets since it involve with the multi-level location such as shop lots and residential apartments. 3D R-Tree has been increasingly used for 3D geospatial database management due to its simplicity and extendibility. However, it suffers from serious overlaps between nodes. In this paper, we proposed a partition-based clustering for the construction of a hierarchical tree structure. Several datasets are tested using the proposed method and the percentage of the overlapping nodes and volume coverage are computed and compared with the original 3D R-Tree and other practical approaches. The experiments demonstrated in this paper substantiated that the hierarchical structure of the proposed partitionbased clustering is capable of preserving minimal overlap and coverage. The query performance was tested using 300,000 points of a SCM dataset and the results are presented in this paper. This paper also discusses the outlook of the structure for future reference.\n                    </jats:p>"

On average, the selected compounds reduced transcription by 33.9% (range: 24.1–65.8%) in the absence of HBx expression, and 30.6% (range: 20.4–48.9%) in the presence of HBx.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During Holocene sea-level rise, coastal areas became transitional environments as marine incursion covered the land. Changing conditions resulted in dynamic depositional environments that recorded the migration and stabilization of modern shorelines. These processes are viewed in the Zevulun Plain (Haifa Bay, Israel) record located in the northern edge of the Nile littoral cell. Sedimentological and palaeontological analyses combined with dating enabled the reconstruction of the Holocene chrono-stratigraphical frame. The results reveal an unconformity representing a long period of exposure and erosion during the last glacial. The interplay between relative sea-level rise and sediment supply was first set out by the deposition of alluvial sediments, evidence of the hydrological system reactivation and base level landward migration. Sea flooding of the Zevulun Plain started about 7.8 cal ka BP and the coastline was pushed eastward. Nile-driven sands transported by longshore currents formed dunes that blocked the rivers estuaries and led to wetlands formation. Peat accumulation is evident first in the north of the plain at 7.6–6.2 cal ka BP and later in the south at 6.5–5.5 cal ka BP. Both wetlands showed a change from fresh to brackish water environments at the end of their existence. Following the maximum sea-level rise and inland sea invasion at about 4 ka BP, alluvial sediments covered the plain and the coastline moved westward to its current position. This record serves as a model for the development of Mediterranean clastic coasts controlled by sea rise and infill processes. </jats:p>",

In order to achieve this purpose, adopting a convenient and criterion sampling strategy, 7 airlines, 3 global flight caterers and 3 global food suppliers were recruited. In addition, to improve the reliability of the data, this study has also conducted 18 in-depth interviews with the flight catering experts (for example, five airlines, three caterers, four food and three non-food suppliers and three logistics companies). As a result of these in-depth interviews, this study has demonstrated three points as follows. First, this study has found that environmental aspects include reducing emissions, conserving natural resources and waste reduction, recycling and packaging. Furthermore, as far as socially sustainable performances are concerned, whilst issues concerning people within the company are dealt with in two ways including basic human rights and welfare issues, those outside the company and their living environment relates to supporting local communities and health and safety/security issues. Second, there have been some differences in the level of adoption between the players when implementing corporate sustainable performances.</jats:p>",

The posterior cerebral artery was determined to have dominant supply from the posterior communicating artery if it was of similar size to the P2 segment and the P1 segment was smaller by approximately 50%. If the posterior communicating artery and P1 segment were the same size, it was considered to have a dual supply.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Magnetic levitation train power supply systems, or Maglev, are most commonly powered by 330‐V high‐voltage direct current power systems. The power supply for maglev control system is used to provide a stable voltage to the suspension control circuit, which is the key part of Maglev trains. The suspension control power supply is typically a DC–DC converter with a high voltage input and multiple low voltage outputs. The traditional solutions typically lead to the following issues, such as uncontrolled duty ratio, poor cross‐regulation capability, and low reliability. In order to solve these problems, a novel two‐stage solution employing a double resonant tank LLC DC transformer (LLC‐DCX) is proposed and developed in this paper. The proposed solution not only increases the overall conversion efficiency significantly because of the achieved soft‐switching over the entire operation range, but also realizes the low input current ripple and high reliability owing to a uniform thermal distribution. A 210‐W, 220–380‐V input laboratory prototype with four outputs is fabricated and tested, and the experimental results are presented in this paper. The declared features of the proposed solution are well demonstrated by the experimental results. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

We first discuss how to transform a level-2 fuzzy decision-making model with expected objectives and chance constrained into crisp equivalent models, then an interactive fuzzy satisfying method is introduced to obtain the decision makers satisfying solution. In addition, the technique of level-2 simulations is applied to deal with general level-2 fuzzy models which are usually hard to be converted into their crisp equivalents. Furthermore, based on the level-2 fuzzy programming, we focus on the supply chain network design problem where the total transport costs and the customer demands are assumed to be level-2 fuzzy numbers, a hybrid intelligent algorithm based on GA is used to solve the general supply chain design model. Finally, a numerical example and a case study are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and the algorithm. </jats:p>",

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is critical for maintenance of these cells; however, the perinatal source of Shh is enigmatic. In the present study, we examined the role of Shh expressed by hair follicles (HFs) that expand perinatally in temporal concordance with the proliferation of Shh-responding dentate stem cells. Specific inhibition of Shh from HFs or from epithelial sources in general hindered development of Shh-responding dentate stem cells. We also found that the blood–brain barrier (BBB) of the perinatal dentate gyrus (DG) is leaky with stem cells in the dentate exposed to blood-born factors. In attempting to identify how Shh might be transported in blood, we found that platelets contain epithelial Shh, provide Shh to the perinatal DG and that inhibition of platelet generation reduced hedgehog-responsive dentate stem cells.</jats:p>"

Here we rule out explanations that are not consistent with the data and construct a dynamic model of food prices using two factors determined to have the largest impact: corn-to-ethanol conversion and investor speculation. We overcome limitations of equilibrium theories that are unable to quantify the impact of speculation by using a dynamic model of trend following. The model accurately fits the data. Ethanol conversion results in a smooth price increase, whereas speculation results in bubbles and crashes. These findings significantly inform the discussion about food prices and market equilibrium and have immediate policy implications.</jats:p>",

This paper is a call to the ecosystem‐service scientists to engage in this decision context and tailor the information they are generating to the needs of the standards community, which we argue would offer greater efficiency of standards implementation for producers and enhanced effectiveness for standard scheme owners and corporations, and should thus lead to more sustainable outcomes for people and nature.</jats:p>",

Most of this production occurs within a polynya during the November–February period, when the availability of dissolved iron (dFe) is thought to exert the major control on phytoplankton growth. Here we combine new data on the distribution of dFe, high‐resolution model simulations of ice melt and regional circulation, and satellite‐based estimates of primary production to quantify iron supply and demand over the Ross Sea continental shelf. Our analysis suggests that the largest sources of dFe to the euphotic zone are wintertime mixing and melting sea ice, with a lesser input from intrusions of Circumpolar Deep Water and a small amount from melting glacial ice. Together these sources are in approximate balance with the annual biological dFe demand inferred from satellite‐based productivity algorithms, although both the supply and demand estimates have large uncertainties.</jats:p>",

Within this, a two‐echelon supply chain consisting of one emission‐dependent manufacturer and one retailer is discussed. Taking revenue‐sharing contract into account and combining practical situations with Stackelberg game method, decision‐makings of traditional supply chain (T‐SC) without carbon emission limits and carbon‐emission‐considering supply chain (C‐SC) are examined, respectively, along with the determination of the optimal range of revenue‐sharing ratio. Furthermore, government's policy making in distributing the optimal emission quota is studied as well as supply chain members' efforts on fulfilling the revenue‐sharing contract to accomplish Pareto improvements of social members' utilities. It is proved that profits of both manufacturer and retailer increase with the growth of the emission quota, proper governmental regulations not only help to achieve balance among social members but also improve overall utilities, and a reasonable revenue‐sharing contract is essential to raise supply chain members' profits even under low‐carbon conditions. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 35: 479–488, 2016</jats:p>",

The disease is strongly associated with HLA–B27. Additional genes, single‐nucleotide polymorphisms, and molecular components have been identified to be associated with AS, but the exact mechanism that drives disease development remains poorly understood. The killer cell immunoglobulin‐like receptors (KIRs) are regulators of cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and T cell subsets and may be relevant in binding to HLA–B27 and the development of AS.

In this study, numerical simulations using the TOUGH2‐ECO2N V2.0 package are performed to get quantitative insights into how cold CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> soil flux measurements are related to reservoir and fluid properties. Although the modeling is based on flux data measured at a specific geothermal site, the Acoculco caldera (Mexico), some general insights have been gained. Both the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes at the surface and the depth at which CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exsolves are highly sensitive to the dissolved CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> content of the deep fluid. If CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> mainly exsolves above the reservoir within a fracture zone, the surface CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes are not sensitive to the reservoir size but depend on the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> dissolved content and the rock permeability. For gas exsolution below the top of the reservoir, surface CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes also depend on the gas saturation of the deep fluid as well as the reservoir size. The absence of thermal anomalies at the surface is mainly a consequence of the low enthalpy of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. The heat carried by CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is efficiently cooled down by heat conduction and to a certain extent by isoenthalpic volume expansion depending on the temperature gradient. Thermal anomalies occur at higher CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> fluxes (&gt;37,000 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) when the heat flux of the rising CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> is not balanced anymore.
