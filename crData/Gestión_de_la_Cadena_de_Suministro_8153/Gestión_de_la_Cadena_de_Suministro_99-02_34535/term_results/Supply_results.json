      "abstract": "<p>It is well known that Erez Yisrael was not blessed with a plentiful supply of water. Other than the narrow winding Jordan, there are few rivers in the country and hardly any fresh water lakes, other than the Sea (!) of Galilee and Huleh Lake (which virtually no longer exists). Consequently, the cities, which required an abundant and regular flow of water, relied mostly on wells and on rainwater trapped in numerous small private and public cisterns. Fountains (springs) might have been situated at considerable distances from the city, and water would have been transported via an open canal (such as in present-day Wadi Kelt between Jerusalem and Jericho), through a closed piping system, which sometimes spanned hills and valleys for many miles, or by aqueducts (such as those near Caesarea). There were also large underground water systems with vent pipes surfacing at regular intervals to relieve water and air pressure and to enable workers to inspect and clear out the silt deposits and other obstructions (witness the magnificent complex bringing water to Jerusalem through the adjacent Armon ha-Naẓiv). There were also overhead pipes made of lead, earthenware, or at times even wood that were laid out carefully above ground, taking advantage of the lay of the land and using gravitational force to transport water over a great distance from a source high in the hills to a city situated low on the plains. Such piping systems required considerable sophistication in planning and construction, not only in choosing optimal routes but also in calculating water pressures and the strengths and diameters of piping units, in placing air vents to relieve excessive pressure, and in installing sludgecocks for removing silt deposits and for filtering the water. A detailed description of different water-supply systems can be found in the work of the great first century C.E. Roman architect Vitruvius in his De Architectura.</p>",

Aquifer brine is corrosive and leads to the corrosion of well tubing, manifolds and water injection system. Downhole squeeze treatments with corrosion inhibitors provide an effective means of controlling the corrosion problem in supply wells and injection system. Filming amine type corrosion inhibitors are \"squeezed\" into the aquifer and the chemical returned with the produced water provides the necessary protection.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents an analysis and design study of corrosion inhibitor squeeze treatments for aquifer water supply wells. Laboratory and field data are presented for optimizing chemical usage and squeeze strategies. Corefloods conducted at reservoir conditions show that adsorption/desorption is the dominant mechanism of corrosion inhibitor retention and release from the formation. Squeeze treatments were simulated in the laboratory to determine the effect of important variables on squeeze life. These variables included the amount and concentration of inhibitor, volume of formation to contact, amount of overflush and the shut-in time. Laboratory testing and field trials have insured corrosion control at reduced operational costs. This has been attributed to the teamwork between laboratory personnel and operation engineers. Recommendations are made for optimizing future squeeze treatments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. The first part of this review focuses on the oxygen status of natural groundwater systems (mainly porous aquifers) and hyporheic zones of streams. The second part examines the sensitivity of groundwater organisms, especially crustaceans, to low oxygen concentrations (&lt; 3.0 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>).</jats:p><jats:p>2. Dissolved oxygen (DO) in groundwater is spatially heterogeneous at macro‐ (km), meso‐ (m) and micro‐ (cm) scales. This heterogeneity, an essential feature of the groundwater environment, reflects changes in sediment composition and structure, groundwater flow velocity, organic matter content, and the abundance and activity of micro‐organisms. Dissolved oxygen also exhibits strong temporal changes in the hyporheic zone of streams as well as in the recharge area of aquifers, but these fluctuations should be strongly attenuated with increasing distance from the stream and the recharge zone.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Dissolved oxygen gradients along flow paths in groundwater systems and hyporheic zones vary over several orders of magnitude (e.g. declines of 9 × 10<jats:sup>−5</jats:sup> to 1.5 ×10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in confined aquifers and 2 × 10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> to 1 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in parafluvial water). Several factors explain this strong variation. Where the water table is close to the surface, oxygen is likely to be consumed rapidly in the first few metres below the water table because of incomplete degradation of soil‐generated labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the vadose zone. Where the water table is far from the surface, strong oxygen depletion in the vicinity of the water table does not occur, DO being then gradually consumed as groundwater flows down the hydraulic gradient. In unconfined groundwater systems, oxygen consumption along flow paths may be compensated by down‐gradient replenishment of DO, resulting either from the ingress of atmospheric oxygen or water recharge through the vadose zone. In confined groundwater systems, where replenishment of oxygen is impossible, the removal time of DO varies from a few years to more than 10 000 years, depending mainly on the organic carbon content of the sediment. Comparison of the hyporheic zones between systems also revealed strong differences in the removal time and length of underground pathways for DO. This strong variability among systems seems related to differences in contact time of water with sediment.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Although groundwater macro‐crustaceans are much more resistant to hypoxia than epigean species, they cannot survive severe hypoxia (DO &lt; 0.01 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) for very long (lethal time for 50% of the population ranged from 46.7 to 61.7 h). In severe hypoxia, none of the hypogean crustaceans examined utilized a high‐ATP yielding metabolic pathway. High survival times are mainly a result of the combination of three mechanisms: a high storage of fermentable fuels (glycogen and phosphagen), a low metabolic rate in normoxia, and a further reduction in metabolic rate by reducing locomotion and ventilation. It is suggested here that the low metabolic rate of many hypogean species may be an adaptation to low oxygen and not necessarily result from an impoverished food supply.</jats:p><jats:p>5. An interesting physiological feature of hypogean crustaceans is their ability to recover from anaerobic stress and, more specifically, rapidly to resynthesize glycogen stores during post‐hypoxic recovery. A high storage and rapid restoration of fermentable fuels (without feeding) allows groundwater crustaceans to exploit a moving mosaic of suboxic (&lt; 0.3 mg L−1 O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), dysoxic (0.3–3.0 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) and oxic (&gt; 3 mg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) patches.</jats:p><jats:p>6. It is concluded that although hypogean animals are probably unsuited for life in extensively or permanently suboxic groundwater, they can be found in small or temporarily suboxic patches. Indeed, their adaptations to hypoxia are clearly suited for life in groundwater characterized by spatially heterogeneous or highly dynamic DO concentrations. Their capacity to survive severe hypoxia for a few days and to recover rapidly would explain partly why ecological field studies often reveal the occurrence of interstitial taxa in groundwater with a wide range of DO.</jats:p>",

However, a survey of 20 U.S.-based chains found that only one actually keeps reservation statistics about smoking-room requests and refusals. Most chains mandate a minimum percentage of non-smoking rooms in their properties, but leave it up to the local managers to determine the actual percentage. Also left to the local property is mollifying the guest who has been promised a smoking or non-smoking room but finds none available at check-in. A survey of 364 individual hotels found an average of 55 percent of rooms set aside for non-smokers' use. However, about two-thirds of the hotels would put a smoker in a non-smoking room, if smoking rooms were all full. A survey of 917 travelers found that frequent business travelers are more likely to be non-smokers than smokers, and those frequent travelers are most likely to make a specific room request. Nearly three-quarters of non-smokers said they always state their room preference, while not even half of smokers always did so. Moreover, the availability of non-smoking rooms was important in the selection of a hotel for over 80 percent of the non-smoking respondents. Half of the respondents said they would be unlikely to do business again with a hotel that fails to fulfill their request for a non-smoking room. </jats:p>",

Results of structural equation analyses suggest that manufacturers and suppliers who feel interdependent rely upon cooperative approaches to conflict, not competitive or avoiding approaches. Cooperative conflict in turn strengthens trust and a long‐term orientation which result in quality enhancing relationships with suppliers. These results challenge the value of conflict avoidance in East Asia. The theory of cooperative and competitive conflict, although developed largely in North America, seems useful for understanding and building quality supply chain partnerships in East Asia.</jats:p>",

The treatment is based on a biocide-enhanced corrosion inhibitor squeeze, spear-headed by concentrated biocide, and is unique in attempting to affect control of SRB and MIC from within the aquifer supplying injection water to the system. Applications of the treatment were intensively monitored in the field to assess the rate of return of the chemical, and their effects on microbial populations in the wells. Non-surface active biocide components were produced back in short, concentrated slugs comparable to shock doses in pipeline treatment programs, providing effective short-term control of SRB activity in the water supply wells. Regrowth, however, resumes once the chemicals are flushed from the wells during normal production, limiting the effective life of the biocide treatment in these wells to 2–3 weeks. Amines are extensively adsorbed on clay minerals, and are produced back at low concentrations for extended periods of time. The data provide insight into the range of rock-chemical interactions that can occur when squeezing multi-component oilfield chemicals into a sandstone aquifer containing significant quantities of clay minerals. The investigation highlights the importance of effective microbiological control during initial drilling and completion operations, and the difficulty in treating established microbial populations in porous media with biocides developed primarily for pipeline systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The maxillary blood supply is essential for preserving the vitality of the affected maxillary region, integration of the grafting material, and wound healing such as following sinus floor elevation. Although it is well established that edentulous maxillae demonstrate a decreasing vascularity as bone resorption progresses, the vascular conditions relevant to sinus floor elevation procedures have not been investigated yet. This study deals with maxillary arteries relevant to sinus floor elevation surgery and examines the vascularization of the lateral maxilla after tooth loss. The vessels of the lateral maxilla of 18 maxillary specimens (10 male, 8 female, mean age 67 years) were prepared anatomically and the local main arteries, the number of macroscopically discernible branches and anastomoses, their calibers, and the distance between the caudal main branches and the alveolar ridge recorded. The lateral maxilla is supplied by branches of the posterior superior alveolar artery (PSAA) and the infraorbital artery (IOA) that form an anastomosis in the bony lateral antral wall, which also supplies the Schneiderian membrane. This intraosseous anastomosis was found in all of the specimens. Eight of 18 also showed an extraosseous anastomosis between PSAA and IOA, vestibular to the antral wall, giving off an average of 3 branches cranially and 5 branches caudally. The two anastomoses form a double arterial arcade to supply the lateral antral wall and, partly, the alveolar process. The PSAA had a mean caliber of 1.6 mm and exhibited an average of 2 endosseous and 1 extraosseous branches. The IOA had a mean diameter of 1.6 mm and showed an average of 1 endosseous and 3 extraosseous branches. The mean distance between the intraosseous anastomosis and the alveolar ridge was 19 mm in 2 defined measuring sites. Its mean length was 44.6 mm. The epiperiosteal vestibular anastomosis was situated further cranially, at a mean distance of 23 to 26 mm from the alveolar ridge and had a mean length of 46 mm. The rather large caliber of the vessels supplying the lateral antral wall seems to be crucial to the fact that the periosteal blood supply is maintained even in severe maxillary atrophy and after complete disappearance of the centro‐medullary vessels.</jats:p>",

Es wird gezeigt, daß eine Reduktion des Lohnnebenkostensatzes sowie eine aufkommensneutrale Senkung des Arbeitgeberanteils zur Sozialversicherung kurzfristig unbestimmte Effekte hat, die aus einem nicht eindeutigen Wechselkurssprung in der Ankündigungsphase resultieren, langfristig dagegen zu einer eindeutigen Zunahme des Output- und Beschäftigungsniveaus führt. Die Beschäftigungssteigerung ist dabei stärker als die Outputexpansion, da der Produzentenreallohnsatz sinkt und der reale Faktorpreis für importierte Vorleistungen steigt. Wie gezeigt wird, ergeben sich auch dann langfristig positive Output- und Beschäftigungseffekte, wenn der Arbeitgeber- und Arbeitnehmeranteil zur Sozialversicherung gleichzeitig gesenkt werden und die Gegenfinanzierung über eine (unterproportionale) Anhebung des Mehrwertsteuersatzes erfolgt.

Arterial embolization of myomas is a nonsurgical treatment option that can be performed as an outpatient procedure, is cheaper than myomectomy, permits preservation of reproductive potential, and may not only be associated with less morbidity than myomectomy but also may not cause adhesions which could compromise fertility. This paper details 2 cases treated by this technique.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The focus of this paper concerns change in the automotive supply chain,<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> industry responses, and policy and strategic implications. Automotive components suppliers are buffeted by global trends and forces, including rising quality standards, environmental issues, and product and process innovation. Although the higher ranks of the supply chain adapt to change continuously, new technologies on the horizon threaten to make many automotive components manufacturers obsolete within some three to ten years. The West Midlands region is particularly vulnerable given its high concentration of automotive suppliers. The potential for related diversification is limited and investment is needed in new manufacturing activities (rather than assembly or sales/distribution) related to environmental, alternative power and electronic technologies. This will position the UK's automotive supply base at the forefront of technological advance against strong and aggressive global players notably from the US, Germany and the Far East. Both the private and public sectors have a strategic and supporting role to play in ensuring that opportunities are maximised. The West Midlands case study has a broader currency for initiatives targeting diversification both in vehicles production and in other manufacturing sectors. Its significance is heightened by the increasing tendency for other sectors—such as food and drink production, and domestic appliances—to adopt automotive practices. </jats:p>",

The present study was designed to further determine whether such intracellular [Formula: see text] gradients can be a limiting factor of oxidative metabolism in uncoupled cardiomyocytes. The NAD(P)H fluorescence of a single cardiomyocyte was captured by a digital charge-coupled device camera and quantitated with a subcellular spatial resolution by a ratio-imaging technique. In the conditions that we demonstrated significant radial[Formula: see text] gradients (cells treated with 1 μM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and superfused with 2.09% or 3.14% O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>gas at 27°C), we demonstrated significant augmentation of NAD(P)H fluorescence near the core of an individual cell. The heterogeneous fluorescence pattern was not found in the control cell, whereas fluorescence intensity averaged over the cell was increased by hypoxia. These results suggest the possibility that oxidative phosphorylation near the core of actively respiring, uncoupled cardiomyocytes may be severely suppressed due to insufficient diffusional oxygen supply (hypoxic core) even if regions near the sarcolemma are adequately oxygenated.</jats:p>",
