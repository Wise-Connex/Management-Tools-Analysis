      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Ensuring the consistent availability of essential medicines is crucial for effective healthcare systems. However, Ethiopian public health facilities have faced frequent stockouts of crucial medications, highlighting systemic challenges such as inadequate forecasting, prolonged procurement processes, a disjointed distribution system, suboptimal data quality, and a shortage of trained professionals. This study focuses on the Ethiopian Pharmaceutical Supply Services (EPSS), known for its highly unstable and volatile supply chain, aiming to identify risks and mitigation strategies. Methods: Using a mixed-method approach involving surveys and interviews, the research investigates successful and less successful strategies, key success factors, and barriers related to pharmaceutical shortages. Results: Proactive measures such as communication, stock assessment, supervision, and streamlined procurement are emphasized as vital in mitigating disruptions, while reactive strategies like safety stock may lack long-term efficacy. The study highlights the importance of aligning supply chain strategies with product uncertainties, fostering collaboration, and employing flexible designs for resilience. Managerial implications stress the need for responsive structures that integrate data quality, technology, and visibility. Conclusions: This study contributes by exploring proactive and reactive strategies, elucidating key success factors for overcoming shortages in countries with unstable supply chains, and offering actionable steps for enhancing supply chain resilience. Embracing uncertainty and implementing proactive measures can help navigate volatile environments, thereby enhancing competitiveness and sustainability.</jats:p>"

The study shows that all three dimensions of SCI, namely supplier integration, internal integration and customer integration, can significantly enhance supply chain resilience. Relational capital and supply chain agility play an important role as mediating variables, while MT negatively moderates the supply chain integration and resilience relationship. This study not only deepens the theoretical understanding, but also provides new perspectives for practice, emphasizing that when formulating supply chain strategies, firms need to consider the multidimensional impact of integration to ensure the sustained stability and long-term competitiveness of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Despite their significant contributions, many of these enterprises currently lack strong research and development capabilities, face challenges in innovation investment, and struggle to produce high-quality innovative results. To address these issues and overcome funding obstacles, many SMEs are turning to supply chain finance (SCF) as a supplementary financing method. This study utilizes stata16 and fixed effects models to analyze the impact and mechanism of SCF on enterprise innovation performance (EIP), focusing on companies listed on the SME Board and GEM in Shenzhen, China from 2011 to 2020. The findings reveal that SCF can effectively enhance enterprise innovation output, facilitating the conversion of resources into high-quality innovation results. Additionally, the study demonstrates that supply chain concentration acts as a mediator between SCF and EIP. Moreover, SCF is found to significantly boost EIP with low supplier concentrations and high customer concentrations. This suggests that SMEs encounter obstacles to innovation from suppliers and customers, and SCF may not fully address the challenges posed by these relationships. Overall, this research offers new empirical insights into the economic implications of companies adopting SCF, providing valuable guidance for enterprises in optimizing innovation decisions and for the government in enhancing supplier and customer information disclosure systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article presents theoretical and applied aspects of digitalization of logistics and supply chain management. It is emphasized that the processes of digitalization of supply chains and logistics are a modern requirement for increasing business efficiency, as well as solving environmental, social and management problems of successful companies. Digitization of supply chains and logistics is defined as the integration of digital technologies and the implementation of digital tools to optimize, automate and increase the efficiency of all stages of the logistics process. Key modern technologies in logistics and supply chains are examined, including artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data. The role of AI in optimizing logistics processes, forecasting market behavior, inventory management and route planning is outlined. Emphasis is placed on the importance of IoT for tracking goods, monitoring storage conditions and vehicle maintenance. The role of Big Data in optimizing supply chains, improving decision-making and compliance with regulatory requirements is analyzed. The use of digital documentation and electronic document circulation are highlighted as important areas of digitization. The difference between digitization of documents and digitalization of document circulation is revealed: digitization, or digital preservation, refers to the transfer of information from paper documents to electronic format for convenient and safe storage of files and access to them in the future; digitalization involves the creation of documentation in computer applications, its intelligent processing and analysis, its accumulation in digital repositories, and the wide use of its data to solve various problems. It is noted that one of the main directions of digitization of documents is the automated reading of documents and data entry, which is implemented using specialized software for automatically extracting information from paper documents and entering it into digital systems. The list of the main logistics documents that are subject to digitization and the digitization of which leads to an increase in the efficiency of the supply chain (delivery confirmation, bill of lading, packing lists, invoices, cargo manifest, etc.) is provided. It was concluded that digitalization of logistics is a significant factor for modern companies seeking to increase their competitiveness in the market. It also enables the integration of all company divisions, improves product tracking, speeds up customs procedures, optimizes transport costs and increases the flexibility of return management. Despite the shortcomings that accompany this process, digitalization of logistics is necessary to achieve sustainable development and effective management of supply chains in today's world.</jats:p>"

Managing such complexities is challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) due to their heightened constraints, such as limited resources and inadequate awareness. Despite the challenges, there is fragmented research, understanding, and approaches to assist SMEs. SC designs need to be adapted so that SMEs can navigate the challenges and avert high wastage. The main objective of this research was to identify the practices influencing sustainable SC designs in a developing country and create a simulation model to illustrate the potential benefits and challenges of promoting sustainability in the banana SC in Malawi. Methods: Mixed-methods research was utilised, employing a literature review, participant interviews, observations, and survey data collected from 353 participants from three districts in Malawi to gain insight into the banana SC problem, establish objectives, and develop a simulation model complemented by design science research. Results: The research identified awareness, collaboration, efficiency, governance, knowledge sharing, and resilience as sustainability practices in the case study banana SC, thus forming a sustainability model. Simulation results showed improvements in key performance indicators like shelf-life, lead-time, quality, throughput, and waste through SC operation reorganisation. Conclusions: Sustainable models must be tailored to the specific challenges inherent in developing food supply chains in developing nations. The development of the models has significant managerial implications, notably enhancing strategic planning, operational efficiency, risk management, alignment of sustainability goals, performance monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and resource optimisation.</jats:p>"

Questionnaires were administered in a structural manner using a Likert scale (1-5) and data collected was processed with SPSS Version 29 to establish the relationship between the independent variables which were the three 3PLs activities (supply relationship, Enterprise Resource Planning optimization and customer relationship) and dependent variables (revenue, cost and operational efficiency).\r\nFindings: It was observed that 45.5% strongly agree that 3PLs activities drives supply chain performance while 37 % agree that 3PLs activities drives supply chain performance This sum up the total level of agreement to 82.4 % while the rest 17.6 were neutral and disagreed that there are no impacts. The 82% (approximately) justified the goal of the study that 3PLs activities have an impact on supply chain performance in FMN Plc. The hypotheses drawn up in the research questions were further validated through a two-tailed t-test by comparing the computed value in excel with theoretical critical t-values on table. The three respective at 5% significant level were 2.35305, 2.5468 and 2.68735. The three hypotheses were tested against the null hypotheses to further validates the hypothesis that there is significant impacts of 3PLs activities on supply chain performance in Flour Mills of Nigeria outsourced activities.\r\nImplications to Theory, Practice and Policy: Resource based theory and Core competency theory may be used to anchor the future studies on investigating the impact of third party logistics activities on supply chain performance in Nigeria. Manufacturing companies have the ability to achieve and sustain competitive advantage if they possessed resources that are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable. Therefore, firms should focus all resources that are strategically relevant within an organization and outsource its non-competencies in order to reduce cost of production and improve its supply chain performance. The study further advanced the core competency model by evaluating areas of shortage of resources, skills and capacity of the flour milling companies that enables outsourcing drives higher performance efficiency, revenue, and cost optimization of the organization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The newest stage of economic development, which experts call the \"economy of interactions\", is associated with the spread of network structures and organizations, the effective operation of which requires a new quality of interaction and management. Multi-channel network supply chains are functionally and organizationally more advanced, meet the requirements of the modern market as much as possible, and allow you to form an adequate product offer in the network of relevant supply and sales channels. However, the more complex the structure of the supply chain, the higher the degree of its internal connectivity and interdependence, and the more it is exposed to uncontrollable events and, accordingly, failures or rejections. The ramifications and complexity of agricultural products supply chain increase attention to their reliability and the need to develop new methods and models for maintaining and ensuring the necessary level of reliability of the supply chain of agricultural products, especially in today's difficult geopolitical conditions. The article discusses approaches to the formation of a multi-level model of structural reliability of the supply chain. It proposes a scheme for its assessment, which quantitatively describes the state of stability of the supply chain in the event of the spread of failures and rejections. An outsourcing planning model has been studied, in which the task of forming a supply chain food turns into the task of selecting channels with the lowest costs, provided that the requirements for reliability are met. The calculations show that multi-channel (network) supply chains for agricultural products with backup channels provide increased reliability, stability, and recoverability. A series-parallel model of structural reliability has been proposed, which ensures the flexibility of the supply chain with given reliability due to the possibility of regulating the volume of supplies by channels.</jats:p>"

The main purpose of the study is to rank and evaluate alternatives in choosing a sustainable fertilizer supplier in the agricultural supply chain by using AHP-F and ARAS-F techniques. In an environment of uncertainty and complex supply chain structure, multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are widely used to solve supplier selection problems. In this study, the importance levels and weights of the criteria in the selection of sustainable fertilizer suppliers were measured by the AHP-F method. The criteria that are important for fertilizer supplier selection were evaluated by taking expert opinions, the uncertain and uncertain opinions of the decision makers were modeled with the AHP-F approach and the weights of the criteria were determined. Among the criteria, resource consumption (FSC05) has the highest weight. Then, alternative rankings were obtained with the ARAS-F method. Fertilizer supplier alternatives in the agricultural supply chain were ranked with the ARAS-F method, using the criterion weights found with AHP-F. In the ranking of alternatives, alternative fertilizer supplier FS03 ranked first with the highest value.

This strategy is expected to benefit countries like India in sectors such as pharmaceuticals. Having faced the brunt of excessive reliance on a single country for supplies during the pandemic, India launched a product linked incentive (PLI) scheme in July 2020, covering 41 products, to incentivise domestic production of key starting materials (KSMs), drug intermediates (DIs) and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with the objective of reducing dependence on China. Launching at a time when countries and firms were actively considering the strategy of supply chain diversification, this scheme was perceived to be perfectly timed. However, the response of the industry was not on the expected lines. This article analyses the early trends coming from the implementation of the scheme and looks into the reasons for the lukewarm response of the industry. It identifies three areas—creating confidence among the investors, accommodating micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and involving public sector enterprises—where more attention is needed to make India self-reliant in APIs and their DIs and KSMs. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Codes: F02, F13, L24, L65, L78, O30 </jats:p>"

The main purpose of the study was to establish the moderating effect of supply chain Pillars on the relationship between supply chain integration and retail outlet performance. The study adopted a cross-sectional survey design with a target population of 2654 staff drawn from Naivas, Quickmart, Chandarana, and Carrefour supermarkets across the four cities in Kenya. The study used closed-ended structured questionnaires to collect primary data. The data was analyzed using logistic regression. The study was conducted between the years 2022 and 2024. The study reported a significant moderating effect of supply chain pillars on the relationship between supply chain integration and retail outlet performance (Est. = 0.986022; p≤0.01). Supply Chain Incentive Alignment (SCIA), with an estimate of 1.3888321 (p≤0.01), had the highest contribution to increasing retail outlet performance, followed by Supply Chain Decision Synchronization (SCDS) with an estimate of 1.290342 (p≤0.01) and lastly, Supply Chain Information Sharing (SCIS) with an estimate of 0.874501 (p≤0.05). The study concluded that the efforts invested in supply chain integration practices, including information sharing, decision synchronization, and incentive alignment, are crucial for improving service delivery, customer satisfaction, and profitability in retail outlets. </jats:p>"

First, an evolutionary game model between financial institutions (FIs) and SMLEs was built. In contrast to bank loans, a novel mechanism for achieving credit enhancement based on transaction data in the transportation supply chain was established through a strict environment and an increase in default penalties to compel SMLEs to uphold their obligations. Furthermore, the stability analysis shows that the stable state convergence of the evolutionary game between FIs and SMLEs evolves to the stage where FIs offer loans to SMLEs. Finally, according to the simulation analysis on the real data collected from CHZL logistics park survey data, this work demonstrates that the fluctuation ranges of the strategy evolution process for the FIs and SMLEs are positively correlated with the intensity of the stochastic perturbation.</p>",

Utilizing a survey methodology, data were collected from 380 respondents who are current employees of various oraganizations through a structured Likert-type questionnaire. The analysis employed descriptive statistics and regression techniques to explore the relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable, intention to leave. The results indicate that job satisfaction negatively correlates with the intention to leave, while job stress and training behavior positively influence turnover intentions. Additionally, employee turnover was found to mediate the relationship between training behavior and intention to leave. These findings underscore the importance of addressing job satisfaction and stress in organizational settings to enhance employee retention. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing empirical evidence from Uzbekistan, highlighting the need for tailored human resource strategies to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover rates.</jats:p>"

The traditional credit risk contagion assessment model based on the financial status of an enterprise and the pledging of fixed assets has been unable to meet the basic needs of modern supply chain companies and financial institutions for risk control. Therefore, this paper introduces the Cox-Copula model to comprehensively assess a company’s financial situation and the business health of upstream and downstream companies in the supply chain from the perspective of actual transactions between companies and fixed asset pledges. The study found that credit risk has a contagion effect in supply chain enterprises, and this contagion effect of credit risk has certain dynamic characteristics. At the same time, it was found that the impacts of macroeconomic factors and microfinance factors on credit risk contagion of supply chain finance have differences in the two dimensions of degree and direction of action.</jats:p>"

Lead firms are rarely held legally responsible for labour conditions in the suppliers they control, even conditions that are dangerous or human rights violations. Legal devices for extending liability up the supply chain are evaluated. These include: treating the supply chain as a legal entity; doctrines like vicarious liability, nondelegable duties, joint employment, and enterprise liability; human rights due diligence statutes; statutes imposing labour responsibility on various entities that contract with others; and voluntary assumption of responsibility in contracts such as the International Accord for Health and Safety in the Textile and Garment Industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Pharmaceutical companies use crisis management as a vital technique to lessen the effects of catastrophes. In this study, the author highlighted the significance of supply chain management for crisis management in the pharmaceutical industry. The study concludes by discussing the role that supply chain management plays in crisis management and offering pharmaceutical businesses advice on how to run their supply chains in an emergency. We conclude after conducting a thorough analysis of the literature review and regress research. These are actions that pharmaceutical organizations can take to strengthen their supply chain management skills and enhance their crisis readiness: Identifying possible supply chain risks through routine risk evaluations; Creating backup strategies in case the supply chain is disrupted; Establishing procedures to guarantee a smooth and efficient supply of medications in an emergency; and Collaborating with vendors and other stakeholders to increase the resilience of the supply chain. The pharmaceutical industry is critical to healthcare, providing safe and effective medicines to patients. Supply chain management is essential for maintaining the flow of medicines during crises. Proactive risk assessment, backup plans, teamwork, and efficient communication are all critical for crisis management in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly in supply chain management. In India, inadequate transportation infrastructure leads to a significant expense for pharmaceutical businesses. To mitigate negative effects, such as reduced healthcare access and insurance coverage, the study suggests implementing multi-echelon, closed-loop green supply chain models. These strategies aim to minimize total costs and ensure efficient resource management. To improve the resilience of pharmaceutical and consumable medical equipment during crises, policymakers should integrate modern technologies and consider business complexity, economic development, intense competition, and changing customer needs. The relationship between manufacturers, distributors, prescribers, and insurance organizations as purchasers should also be considered.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Previous research has proved that low-skill immigration impacts the labor supply of high-skilled native women; however, insufficient attention is paid to the sectors where these immigrants bring significant influence. This paper analyzes service sectors that heavily depend on less educated immigrants: maids and housekeeping cleaners, food preparation and serving, and childcare. These service sectors are focused on because they alleviate household responsibilities that women typically spend a large amount of time on. Using U.S. Decennial Census data from 1980 to 2000, the study found that the inflow of low-skill immigrants into these service sectors tends to lower wages for workers with similar education levels, thereby reducing service costs. These more affordable services enable highly skilled native women, especially those with young children under age 5, to provide more labor supply in the labor market. Therefore, low-skill immigrants play an indirect but important role in supporting the careers of high-skilled native women and thereby increasing the overall labor supply by influencing the labor structure in these targeted service sectors.\n<bold>JEL classifications</bold> J12, J16, J31, J61</p>"

For this purpose, we conducted a systematic literature review, following a series of steps to identify approaches, methodologies, and contexts into which the studies were developed. The search revealed that the studies focused on different management models and market structure issues. In addition, they also showed that the performance of service providers can be influenced by political and socioeconomic context and geographic aspects. A gap was identified concerning the qualitative studies since most used econometric methods mainly aimed at technical and financial efficiency. Also, social and service user perspectives received limited academic attention. To face the challenges in water provision in Brazil, tools, such as those related to performance evaluation, are essential for sufficient system management and can guide decision-makers and service providers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The term “Long COVID” is commonly used to describe persisting symptoms after acute COVID-19. Until now, proposed mechanisms for the explanation of Long COVID have not related quantitative measurements to basic laws. In this work, a common framework for the Long COVID pathophysiological mechanism is presented, based on the blood supply deprivation and the flow diffusion equation. Methods: Case–control studies with statistically significant differences between cases (post-COVID patients) and controls, from multiple tissues and geographical areas, were gathered and tabulated. Microvascular loss (ML) was quantified by vessel density reduction (VDR), foveal avascular zone enlargement (FAZE), capillary density reduction (CDR), and percentage of perfused vessel reduction (PPVR). Both ML and hemodynamic decrease (HD) were incorporated in the tissue blood supply reduction (SR) estimation. Results: ML data were found from 763 post-COVID patients with an average VDR, FAZE, CDR, and PPVR of 16%, 31%, 14%, and 21%, respectively. The average HD from 72 post-COVID patients was 37%. The estimated SR for multiple tissues with data from 634 post-COVID patients reached a sizeable 47%. This large SR creates conditions of lower mass diffusion rates, hypoxia, and undernutrition, which at a multi-tissue level, for a long time, can explain the wide variety of the Long COVID symptoms. Conclusions: Disruption of peripheral tissue blood supply by the contribution of both ML and HD is proposed here to be the principal cause of the mechanism leading to Long COVID symptoms.</jats:p>"

Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library.\r\nFindings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to blockchain technology in supply chain management. Preliminary empirical review revealed that blockchain technology significantly transformed supply chain management by enhancing transparency, traceability, and efficiency. The immutable ledger and decentralized nature of blockchain provided a robust framework for addressing traditional supply chain challenges, such as fraud, errors, and inefficiencies. The technology’s ability to automate processes through smart contracts streamlined operations and reduced costs. However, challenges such as high initial investments, scalability issues, and the need for industry-wide standards were identified as barriers to widespread adoption. The study emphasized the importance of continued research to address these challenges and refine blockchain applications in supply chain management.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The Theory of Transaction Cost Economics, Resource-Based View (RBV) of the Firm and Agency Theory may be used to anchor future studies on blockchain technology in supply chain management. The study recommended expanding theoretical frameworks to better incorporate blockchain technology's unique aspects into supply chain theories. Practically, organizations were advised to conduct pilot projects and phased rollouts to evaluate blockchain's impact before large-scale implementation, and to invest in training for effective technology management. Policy recommendations included the development of regulatory frameworks and industry standards to facilitate blockchain adoption. Collaboration among industry stakeholders was encouraged to address integration challenges and standardize solutions. Further research into specific applications and the integration of blockchain with other technologies was suggested, alongside investment in education and training programs for supply chain professionals.</jats:p>"

One way to estimate the contributions of these shocks is with a structural vector autoregression identified using sign restrictions on the slopes of demand and supply curves. The appeal of this approach is that it relies on uncontroversial assumptions. However, sign restrictions only identify decompositions up to a set. I characterise the conditions under which these sets are informative, examining both historical decompositions (contributions to outcomes) and forecast error variance decompositions (contributions to variances). I use this framework to estimate the contributions of supply and demand shocks to inflation in the United States. While the sign restrictions yield sharp conclusions about the drivers of inflation in some expenditure categories, they tend to yield uninformative decompositions of aggregate inflation. A 'bottom-up' decomposition of aggregate inflation is less informative than a decomposition that uses the aggregate data directly.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Radical-right behavior is increasing across Western democracies, often very fast. Previous research has shown, however, that political attitudes and preferences do not change this fast. I argue that, to understand these patterns, one needs to appreciate the crucial role of social norms as drivers of political behavior. Building on a norms-based theory of political supply and demand, I argue that growing radical-right behavior is driven by individuals who already had radical-right views, but who did not act on them because they thought that they were socially unacceptable. If these voters do not express their preferences, politicians can underestimate how much latent support there is for radical-right policy. This leaves the radical right with less skilled leaders, who are unable to mobilize even radical-right voters to support them. However, if politicians realize that there is more private support for radical-right policy than is typically observable, they have an incentive to run for politics with a radical-right platform and mobilize silent radical-right views. Their electoral success, in turn, makes radical-right individuals become more comfortable showing their views, and impels more politicians to join the radical right. The argument of the book makes us rethink how political preferences translate into behavior, shows how social norms affect the interaction of political supply and demand, and highlights how a political culture that promotes inclusion can erode.</p>"

This renewable energy idea was implemented at the Qoryah Thoyyibah mosque, Kandang Limun Kota Bengkulu. The purpose of this service is the implementation of Appropriate Technology, namely PLTS for alternative energy supply at the Qoryah Thoyibah Mosque facility. So that if there is a power outage by PLN, the facilities at the Qoryah Thoyyibah Mosque can still operate according to their functions.

The main objective of this study is to assess how reducing transactional costs through SSCQM, or within its framework, can improve the financial performance of Moroccan companies. The methodology is based on quantitative analysis, using an econometric model (GLM-Gamma) to test the association between SSCQM adoption and financial performance. The results of the study show that various SSCQM-related practices positively affect companies’ financial performance. Managing sourcing costs significantly improves profit margins. Contracts focusing on quality and sustainability, and minimizing the risk of non-compliance, also boost financial performance. However, the ability to adapt and respond to regulatory changes shows no significant impact. Optimizing production processes and investing in green technologies are proving to be profitable strategies, with significant improvements in financial performance. Customer engagement and transparency and traceability of operations also have a positive impact. These results suggest that SSCQM practices, such as the adoption of green technologies and transparency policies, are beneficial for companies’ financial performance. The originality of the study lies in its approach, which links transaction theory to sustainable supply chain management, an angle little explored in existing literature. The study confirms that SSCQM is an effective strategy for improving corporate financial health by minimizing transactional costs. It recommends integrating SSCQM into companies’ management strategies to boost their competitiveness, financial performance and sustainability.</jats:p>",

Some challenges are however still hindering the provision of fuel at stable prices. The study's independent variables were: inflation rate shocks, world oil price shocks, pipeline cost shocks, and currency exchange rate shocks. The population of the study was identified to be Kenya’s economy while the unit of analysis was the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA). The study adopted a time series data design for 8 years from 2015 to 2022 in monthly intervals to make 96 observations. Stata version 13 was used to assist in data analysis and presentation after the data went through a diagnostic test. VECM model was employed to analyse the relationship between the variables after which conclusions and recommendations were made. The study established that the rate of inflation rate shocks, world oil price shocks, and pipeline cost shocks have a significant effect on fuel price fluctuation while currency exchange rate shocks have a significant negative effect on fuel price fluctuation. The study recommends that the government should establish tax subsidies to control the impact of tax proportions on fuel prices and also that the government of Kenya needs to enter into a contractual agreement with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) nations on oil deals for a steady supply of crude oil at a favourable price.</jats:p>"

CNN can be used to analyze data in the supply chain. Training on real digital images ensures data privacy and improves the accuracy and efficiency of data processing. Blockchain technology can be introduced into supply chain information sharing to ensure the immutability and transparency of data. This article introduces a federated learning (FL) mechanism to improve consensus algorithms, which improves the efficiency of model training. Among them, each link in the FL process is rigorously verified and recorded through the consensus mechanism of blockchain, ensuring the security and reliability of the entire process. This article adopts an improved consensus algorithm, PoDaS (Proof of Data Sharing), whose core idea is to use the computational consumption generated during FL as proof of workload. The specific steps include: local model training and uploading, model update verification shield, and model update aggregation. The PoDaS algorithm combines the advantages of PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stack) to ensure the fairness of the consensus mechanism and reduce the waste of computing resources. By comparing and analyzing the block time and model accuracy of three algorithms, the superiority of PoDaS algorithm in block time and model accuracy was verified. The experimental results show that the PoDaS algorithm is significantly better than the PoW algorithm in terms of block generation time, and slightly better than the PoS algorithm. In terms of model accuracy, the PoDaS algorithm is significantly superior to traditional PoW and PoS algorithms. Its model accuracy reaches 96.00%, reflecting the effectiveness and practicality of the PoDaS consensus algorithm in the sharing of supply chain information security.</p>"

Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive’s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library.\r\nFindings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to the impact of Artificial Intelligence on supply chain optimization. Preliminary empirical review revealed that AI significantly improved various aspects of supply chain management, including forecasting, inventory management, logistics, and risk management. It was found that AI technologies enhanced operational efficiency by providing more accurate demand predictions, optimizing logistics operations, and improving risk management capabilities. Additionally, AI contributed to greater sustainability in supply chains by reducing resource waste and supporting environmental goals, thus demonstrating its critical role in modernizing and optimizing supply chain practices.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Practice and Policy: The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Resource-Based View (RBV) and Dynamic Capabilities Theory may be used to anchor future studies on Artificial Intelligence. The study recommended that future research should focus on developing theoretical models that integrate AI with traditional supply chain theories and that companies should adopt AI-driven tools for improved supply chain performance. It suggested that policymakers create guidelines for ethical AI use and data management to ensure responsible implementation. Additionally, it was recommended that collaboration between academia, industry, and technology providers be fostered to share best practices and address sector-specific needs. Lastly, it was advised that the long-term impacts and adaptability of AI technologies be evaluated to ensure their continued effectiveness and relevance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigated the effects of high dietary Ca supplementation during the final 21 days antepartum on Ca and bone homeostasis in dairy sheep and goats, and the growth response of their suckling offspring. Multiparous dairy sheep (n = 5/group, 10 animals total) and goats (n = 6/group, 12 animals total) were randomly assigned to 2 experimental groups. Feeding occurred restrictively (2.3 kg DM/d*animal-1 antepartum for both species; 2.9 and 3.1 kg DM/d*animal-1 for sheep and goats postpartum, respectively) according to recommendations, except for Ca during antepartum feeding: 1 group received the basal diet based on hay and concentrate with extra CaCO3 (1.3% Ca in DM; 2.49-fold the recommendations) for 3 weeks antepartum, while the other group received just the basal diet (0.6% Ca in DM; 1.15-fold the recommendations). Experimental feeding ended with parturition and animals were henceforth fed according to Swiss recommendations for lactating sheep and goats and kept together with their suckling offspring. The observation period spanned from 21 days antepartum to 56 days postpartum. Animals were under continuous veterinary surveillance and monitored for signs of milk fever. Data collection comprised quantitative and functional parameters of Ca and bone homeostasis as well as birth weights and daily weight gain of suckling lambs and kids. Data were analyzed using repeated measures and endpoint mixed models. The response of quantitative markers indicated that high dietary Ca antepartum significantly increased fecal Ca concentrations until parturition, suggesting efficient physiological mechanisms to manage Ca overload through increasing fecal excretion. No significant differences were observed in serum Ca levels, urinary Ca excretion, or bone mineral density between the antepartum Ca feeding groups at any point during the observation period, indicating stable Ca homeostasis despite the dietary challenge. Differences in quantitative markers were noted between sheep and goats, including variations in serum and colostral Ca levels and bone mineral density, which largely aligned with results from earlier comparative studies. Serum 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D (calcitriol) as well as markers of bone formation and resorption were monitored, revealing significant increases in serum osteocalcin postpartum in both goats and sheep fed high Ca antepartum. However, all other serum markers including calcitriol, remained unaffected by the feeding regime but differed between sheep and goats, consistent with previous findings. All repeated measures were significantly affected by time, except for urinary Ca and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity in serum. Suckling offspring of sheep and goats in the high Ca group exhibited significantly reduced average daily weight gain compared to those in the 0.6 % in DM Ca group, despite similar birth weights. We conclude that while dairy sheep and goats effectively managed high dietary Ca intake without overt signs of hypocalcemia or milk fever under these experimental conditions, the observed impacts on offspring growth and potential long-term physiological effects warrant further investigation. These findings contribute to the understanding of mineral nutrition in late-gestating dairy goats and sheep and highlight the need for further research on balanced dietary strategies to optimize health and productivity of dairy sheep and goats and their offspring.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many people and things involved in the supply chain can be represented by a network of linked agents in a multi-agent system. To achieve distribution and manufacturing targets efficiently, actions in a supply chain must be scheduled by tracking and organizing the allocation of resources. Healthcare, energy, aerospace, agriculture, and manufacturing are some of the industries that make use of it to better allocate and coordinate resources in complex networks. The goal of multi-agent supply chains is to lower costs and meet demand in dynamic contexts through efficient resource allocation and planning. Traditional approaches, such as linear programming and heuristic algorithmic approaches, have problems with adaptation and scalability. This study offers a novel scheduling method, Resource Distribution by Honey Bee Optimization (RDHBO), to circumvent these issues. It is based on a tactic that the honey bee uses when foraging. In this model, scout bees and foragers take on the role of actors, investigating and making the most of potential new ways to divide up resources by employing HBO strategies. The foraging agents look for places that have been profitable in the past, and the scouting agents carefully examine the supply chain to find places where resources might be available. The proposed RDHBO architecture allows for better supply chain scheduling by encouraging effective utilization and investigation, better communication, dynamic adaptability, autonomous decision-making, and efficiency of complicated systems. This method leads to an adaptable supply chain, lower operational costs, and more scalability and adaptability. This paper presents a formidable alternative to conventional optimization methods by demonstrating an efficient approach to dealing with complicated supply chain challenges.</jats:p>"

Grid electricity. South Africa’s energy is supplied by a huge governmental organization. Statistical analyses indicate that projected increase of the cost of grid electricity in South Africa is about 30% per annum for the next five years. Our research show that Photo-Voltaic (PV) technology can offer a viable alternative, provided a large initial capital outlay can be made. The technology is user-friendly and easy to operate. It is calculated that the cost of electricity, capitalized over 20 years, considering an 80 % supply of needs and assuming 20 sunny days per month, is about 2.80 ZAR. The study also shows that utilizing a hybrid combination of renewable energies, such as combining PV supply with solar thermal energy absorbers, and converting thermal energy to electricity, as energy supply systems, could reduce the current cost of electricity per household in South Africa to about half of national grid supply prize, R1,50 per kWhr. The study also shows that water provides as a most viable medium to store energy, instead of using expensive battery technology to perform such functions.</jats:p>"

Focusing on a unique policy experiment in Slovenia in 2011, where the government imposed a 0.1% tax on banks' total assets, I find that the introduction of the tax resulted in a lower credit supply of loans to corporates. In particular, for each percentage point increase in the share of tax in the capital, banks charge, on average, 8 basis points higher lending rates and decrease their lending amount by 0.5%. The findings of this research carry strong policy implications for countries contemplating or having already implemented windfall or other temporary taxes on banks. The introduction of the tax might lead to a reduction in lending beyond what would be warranted from the standpoint of monetary or other policies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Water supply security is the basis for high-quality urban development. Amid escalating extreme climate events, the upstream intrusion of saltwater in the Pearl River Estuary poses significant challenges to the water supply security of cities. This study establishes a city water supply system model based on the system dynamics method, then evaluates the urban water supply risks in Zhongshan City from 2016 to 2023 using the supply-demand gap and water stress index as risk assessment indicators. Additionally, it simulates the dynamic water supply risks under five development scenarios (conventional, economic, population, conservation, and comprehensive) and 17 saltwater intrusion scenarios from 2024 to 2035. Based on the simulation results, the study then proposes the emergency water reserve requirements for 2030 and 2035 under emergency response levels of 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 days. The results indicate that Zhongshan's water demand has increased from 2016 to 2023, with water supply capacity meeting demand but significantly impacted by saltwater intrusion. The highest water supply risk and water stress index (peaking at 0.45 in 2021) occur when the saltwater front reaches the Quanlu, Renyi, and Dafeng intake points simultaneously or individually. Among the five development scenarios, water demand peaks in 2035, with the highest demand under the economic development scenario and the lowest under the water-saving scenario. The comprehensive development scenario, which balances economic growth and resource conservation, achieves a 2035 water demand of 266.90×104 m³/d, a 5.19% reduction compared to the conventional scenario, thus making it more acceptable to policymakers. Under the 17 saltwater intrusion scenarios, the water-saving scenario exhibits the lowest water stress index (0-6.74) and thus the lowest water supply risk, followed by the comprehensive scenario (0-7.11) and the economic scenario with the highest water stress index (0-7.84) and risk. The current water reserves can usually meet demand under scenarios where the saltwater front only reaches below Quanlu or Dafeng, but additional emergency reserves will be necessary for higher intrusion levels to meet various emergency duration requirements. When the saltwater front reaches Yinggezui and a 60-day emergency level is considered, the water-saving scenario has the smallest water deficit, while the economic scenario has the largest, with deficits of 7,938×104 m³ and 8,928×104 m³ in 2030 and 10,164×104 m³ and 12,354×104 m³ in 2035, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights for coastal city policymakers in selecting urban development paths and enhancing emergency water reserve capabilities.</p>"

However, the stakeholders of the new energy battery supply chain, so far, have not been able to take responsibility for recycling. In this study, the influence of different subsidy strategies adopted by the government on the determination of each participant in the new energy battery supply chain is determined in the case of government participation and anarchy participation. We observed different strategies for government involvement, such as government recycling subsidies, profit reward and punishment policies, and total recovery costs and profits. At the same time, we designed a game strategy. This strategy shows that in the case of interaction between recyclers and manufacturers, the higher the additional income of recyclers and the degree of cooperation of manufacturers to participate in recycling processing, the higher the compensation for non-partners, and the recyclers and manufacturers are more inclined to increase the level of recycling. Compared with no subsidies and no government participation, government participation can improve the recycling rate of used batteries and the profits of enterprises. Our work provides decision support for government involvement in the energy vehicle supply chain.</p>"

In order to examine the overseas market development strategy of domestic manufacturers on the basis of traditional retail, this paper applies game theory to establish two dual-channel models including a domestic manufacturer and an e-retailing platform, and analyzes the channel selection of the manufacturer based on analytical deduction as well as numerical calculations. According to the analysis, though the introduction of dual-channel can alleviate the double marginalization in the multinational supply chain, the Nash equilibrium only exists in the scenario where the domestic manufacturer chooses the agency sales channel, due to the profit compensation of commission. Overall, these results shed light on the operation of multinational supply chain and bring some valuable insights on overseas market development in the era of e-commerce.</jats:p>"

Each broken component is replaced by a new component from the stock. When no component is available, an emergency supply is ordered. The stock is managed according to an ((s,S),(0,Qe)) policy, which is a combination of an (s,S) policy for the regular order and a (0,Qe) policy for the emergency order. The regular order is delivered after an exponentially distributed lead time, whereas the emergency order is delivered immediately. We study three sub-policies for emergency orders, which differ from each other in size and in relation to the regular order.

As a result, the slope of both the Phillips and the IS curve is altered, crucially influencing monetary and fiscal policy transmission. These changes are affected by factor ownership and propensities to consume. Theoretically, shortages can also raise the risk of self-fulfilling fluctuations if a rising price of the constrained factor boosts incomes for agents with high propensities to consume.

Methods: The data is collected from Turkish companies, a part of supply chains located in Turkey from different industries, through a structured interview developed as a result of the derived points from the literature.     Results: The results suggest that (1) while laws, customers, government and global influencers are externally effective, corporate culture internally drives green supply chain management (GSCM) practices; (2) quality is the most apperant outcome of GSCM practices; and (3) environmental sustainability is a clear consequence of GSCM practices in terms of sustainability.     Conclusion: For increasing forces in adopting green practices, the results suggest building suitable organizational culture. The results also imply that GSCM practices increase firm competitiveness and economic performance.</jats:p>"

The previous “dynamic zero-COVID” policy posed significant risks to companies, leading to frequent production halts and supply chain disruptions. This risk was particularly critical in the automotive industry, where each link in the supply chain is vital. If any manufacturer in the supply chain ceases production, the entire chain risks breaking during the shutdown period. Ensuring the normal operation of other parts of the supply chain during such shutdowns presents a significant challenge to the resilience of the automotive supply chain. In the current post-pandemic era, as the impact of COVID-19 diminishes and national policies adjust to reopen the country, positive implications for economic development are evident across various sectors. However, the issue of supply chain resilience remains critically important.</jats:p>",

For a period of 30 years, the monthly rainfall data (in mm) were gathered for eight localities in the Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh: Bharol, Chachiyot, Jogindernagar, Karsog, Kataula, Mandi, Sarkaghat, and Sundernagar. The augmented Dickey–Fuller test was performed to determine whether the rainfall data were steady before applying the ARIMA model. The minimal values of the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, autocorrelation function, and partial autocorrelation function were used to select the best models. The best fit was determined to be ARIMA (0,0,2) (2,1,0)12 for five stations and ARIMA (0,0,0) (1,1,0)12 for the remaining three stations. A box test is performed to validate the ARIMA model and verify the autocorrelation in the data. Using the ARIMA model, forecasts are made for the 10 years (2021–2030). The validity and performance of the ARIMA models were evaluated using error statistics (mean absolute error = 34.65, root-mean-square error = 33.58, and R2 = 0.93). The projected data's mean and standard deviation were close to the actual data. As a result, the ARIMA model's monthly rainfall prediction parameters were satisfactory.</jats:p>",

One of the primary justifications for implementing a blockchain in distribution network management is its ability to lower overall production costs while ensuring the security of the system. However, existing inventory control systems that utilize blockchain technology are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The objective of this study is to analyses actual risks and deficiencies in system design as a result. Ensuring trustworthiness and security in the supply management system is an essential necessity. This study focuses on the unique problems related to integrity and logistics in Supply Chain Management. The proposal presents a streamlined algorithm that utilizes blockchain technology to guarantee the integrity of data in Supply Chain Management systems enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT). The customized algorithms have been constructed using a private blockchain infrastructure. Topics covered include hash creation, smart contracts, mining, and other consensus algorithms. Proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) are efficient methods for executing tasks in a decentralized network of peers. The proposed system was thoroughly examined and confirmed through experimental inquiry. The results were compared with several state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the efficiency of our technique. This system demonstrates the utilization of blockchain technology to construct an e-transaction system. The concept is evaluated from a practical standpoint, considering both its development and usage contexts. This study serves as a prospective guide for the use of blockchain technology in facilitating intricate applications.

      "abstract": "<p>The food supply chain's heavy reliance on electricity poses significant vulnerabilities in the event of prolonged and widespread power disruptions. This study introduces a system-dynamics model that integrates five critical infrastructures—electric grid, liquid fossil fuels, Internet, transportation, and human workforce—to evaluate the resilience of food supply chains to major power outages. We validate the model using the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts as a case study, demonstrating its predictive validity. We then explore how more extreme electricity losses would disrupt the supply chain. More specifically, we model the impact of a large-scale cyberattack on the US electric grid and a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) event. A cyberattack severely damaging the US electric grid and allowing for recovery within a few weeks or months would lead to substantial drops in food consumption. However, it would likely still be possible to provide adequate calories to everyone, assuming that food is equitably distributed. In contrast, a year-long recovery from a HEMP event affecting most of the continental US could precipitate a state of famine. Our analysis represents a first attempt at quantifying how food availability progressively worsens as power outages extend over time. Our open-source model is made publicly available, and we encourage its application to other catastrophic scenarios beyond those specifically considered in this work (e.g., extreme solar storms, high-lethality pandemics).</p>"

Compared to the more established silicon devices, SiC provides better thermal conductivity, ~10x higher breakdown voltage, faster switching speeds and lower resistivity. Even with the performance advantages, the adoption rate of SiC is slowed by high cost and the inherent difficulty of processing this material. SiC is extremely hard (just below diamond on the hardness scale) and chemically inert which makes processing boules into wafers rather difficult.

SiC wafer manufacturers are trying to ramp output as quickly as possible but technical difficulties of processing SiC are often a limiting factor. In spite of aggressive capital spending by many of the major players, the actual growth in substrate production has been constrained to around 15% CAGR even though demand would support a much faster ramp. As end use markets continue to evolve, ripple effects are also evident in the underlying supply chains, such as CMP pads and slurries.    </jats:p>",

One way to add value is through Short Food Supply Chains (SFSC), innovating and valorizing product processes, with basis on local culture. The main aim of this article was to analyze innovations developed by specialty coffee producers from Garça, Brazil, as they were introduced into SFSC and their impacts on environmentally sustainable production. This is a qualitative-quantitative research, with multiple case studies. Data was collected through semi-structured interview observation and documents, and analysis was carried out using Fisher's Exact Test. The main innovations verified for insertion in SFSC are the marketing skills, technical processes used in the harvesting, and machinery acquisitions for processing and packaging products without compromising the quality of the beverage. Although producers made a strenuous effort to promote the environmental sustainability, the statistical test has confirmed that there was no association between innovations and environmental sustainability. As practical implications, this paper seeks to contribute to farmers who want to change their production by selling specialty coffees through SFSC, demonstrating the innovations and their impacts on environmental sustainability, as well as public policymakers who wish to contribute to these farmers by promoting events that generate knowledge about innovations and sustainable environmental development.</jats:p>"

Consider the impact of conflict level, cooperation possibility, and negotiation remaining time on negotiations in a dynamic negotiation environment, and use the entropy method to determine the weights of three influencing factors and perform linear weighting. Based on the differences in current negotiation topics, a concession amplitude prediction model based on dynamic selective ensemble learning is constructed, and an optimization strategy for supply chain production and sales negotiation is proposed. The experimental results indicate that, in the adaptive negotiation strategy of a regular SVM single learning machine, the joint utility of the most successfully negotiated agents falls within the interval [0.55, 0.70], while the author’s ensemble learning strategy mainly focuses on [0.6, 0.8], the author’s strategy is relatively superior to ordinary learning strategies in terms of both the number of successfully negotiated agents and the joint utility. Compared with the single learning machine negotiation strategy, this strategy improves the success rate and joint utility of Agent adaptive learning, and ensures the benefits of both production and sales in the supply chain, achieving a mutually beneficial situation for both parties in cooperation.</jats:p>"

This research addresses the pressing need to understand challenges faced by Indian supply chain executives by adopting AI-driven solutions for enhancing resilience. Analyzing data from 300 executives using ANOVA and t-tests reveals critical patterns in encountered barriers. Simultaneously, the study aims to fill gaps in existing literature by developing a strategic framework for executives. Using Structured Equation Modeling (SEM), it outlines best practices for integrating AI into supply chain operations, offering nuanced insights into strategic considerations and organizational barriers influencing AI adoption decisions. The research identifies a gap in comprehensive studies on challenges and decision-making factors specific to Indian executives adopting AI for supply chain resilience. By addressing this gap, the study enriches global discourse on AI in supply chain management and provides targeted guidance to Indian executives navigating AI-enabled operations. Ultimately, the research aims to empower executives with actionable insights to effectively leverage AI, enabling them to fortify supply chain resilience amidst India's evolving business dynamics.JEL Code: O32, M15, L23, L25, Q55. Doi: 10.28991/ESJ-2024-08-04-013 Full Text: PDF</jats:p>"

We compare the equilibrium and optimal allocations in a general equilibrium model with an arbitrary number of vertical production tiers. Our model features endogenous investments in protective capabilities, endogenous formation of supply links, and sequential bargaining over quantities and payments between firms in successive tiers. We derive policies that implement the first-best allocation, allowing for subsidies to input purchases, network formation, and investments in protective capabilities. The first-best policies depend only on production function parameters of the pertinent tier. When subsidies to transactions are infeasible, the second-best subsidies for resilience depend on production function parameters throughout the network, and subsidies are larger upstream than downstream whenever the bargaining weights of buyers are nonincreasing along the chain.</jats:p>",

These supply networks are currently designed using the cyber-physical construct to be lean. An unintended consequence of a lean supply network is that it is fragile and not fail-safe. We propose to design the defense supply network as a cyber-physical-social system that will result in a resilient fail-safe supply network that accommodates both variations and disruptions thus allowing us to dynamically manage lead times, address a systemic response for variations and disruptions to reduce or eliminate failure. We recognize the Government, Supplier and User to be the stakeholders. To frame the problem in the context of Dilemmas faced by the three stakeholders we use the Dilemma Triangle Method. The Dilemmas are then analyzed and resolved via the development of a Requirements List within the current defense sustainment “Machine” model outlined in the Art of the Possible (AoP). The application and examination of Dilemmas through the lens of the AoP based constraints management system is further specified to include satisficing resolutions to the identified Dilemmas rooted in a preliminary Requirements List. The Requirements List is foundational for designing a defense supply network that is failsafe. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying the requirements for designing fail-safe supply networks to satisfy multiple stakeholders. We illustrate the efficacy of the approach using the defense supply network as an example. Our focus is on the method rather than the results per se.</jats:p>",

This situation is expected to push 40% of the world’s population below the water scarcity level by 2050. As of 2023, 20,000 desalination plants converting more than 40 bm<sup>3</sup> of water annually in 150 countries. However, the energy-intensive operation, high desalination cost, and environmental footprint of conventional desalination systems require a technological breakthrough in the field to sustainably cope with the demand. This study presents a comprehensive and innovative approach to hybridizing two established desalination technologies for higher energy efficiency, higher water productivity, lower cost, and improved environmental operation. The proposed system is a hybrid multieffect desalination (MED) with an adsorption cycle (<sc>ad</sc>). The advantages of the proposed system include low-temperature operation (below ambient), double water production over the same top brine temperature, and high thermodynamic efficiency. A pilot-scale MEDAD with a water production capacity of 10 m<sup>3</sup>/day has been developed and tested. The study showed that the hybridization of the AD cycle with the conventional MED system decreased the bottom brine temperature to approximately 20 °C compared to 40 °C of the conventional MED system. Meanwhile, the productivity of hybrid systems surged to 2–3 times that of the conventional system. Moreover, the system operates at approximately 20% of the thermodynamic limit, which is the highest for any desalination system hitherto. Therefore, the system can be scaled up for any higher productivity as the most viable solution to desalinate seawater.</p>"

But it turns out that these are not as resilient as required. A resilient supply chain requires appropriate risk management measures that minimize internal and external influences. However, in some areas of value creation and supply chains, weaknesses are evident that are determined by a high dependence on international supplier markets. This approach to research in this area investigates whether Automotive OEM internal departments perceive certain risks differently. This was done by means of a survey of European OEMs to reveal different perceptions on important aspects of risk-based factors. Internal resilience would be necessary as a first step towards strengthening the supply chains in order to subsequently position themselves against stronger emerging competition from the Asian and US economies. This requires a strong European centering of supplier and partner networks, for example in the area of physical goods such as semiconductors and batteries. In order to support these necessary developments, networks are being established and promoted by the EU. GAIA-X and especially Catena-X are bases for the Automotive industry to adapt and optimize resilience and compliance regulations to governmental and intranational guidelines. As result of this research, it remains to be said that the realignment of supply chains must succeed in improving cooperation and delivery conditions across the entire OEM spectrum while at the same time reducing costs. In this way, the European Automotive market can be positioned as a resilient, strong market player for the future. The basic prerequisite for this is a uniform and coordinated view of risk-based factors in the individual companies and departments.</jats:p>",

Negative impacts such as environmental contamination can reduce production quality and quantity and increase supply chain operational costs. This study aims to identify effective risk mitigation strategies to reduce these negative impacts and improve the sustainability of supply chain management. Data were collected from laying duck farms and analyzed using the House of Risk (HOR) method with a Phase 1 and 2 approach. This approach allows the identification of the most critical risks and risk agents and mapping mitigation priorities. Key findings indicate that providing drugs or vaccines to prevent animal virus outbreaks is the highest priority mitigation strategy, while strategic policy decision-making has the lowest priority. Overall, 15 risks and 21 risk agents were identified. This study implies that the implementation of effective mitigation strategies can significantly reduce operational risks, strengthen the resilience of the livestock sector, and support the sustainability of supply chain management as a whole.</jats:p>"

This paper evaluates three forms of outsourcing: full outsourcing of inventory management, partial outsourcing of specific activities, and contingent partial outsourcing of specific logistics activities. It notes that, in Africa, contracting-out supply logistics has mostly taken the form of partial outsourcing of transportation only or storage and transportation of specific health commodities to all or selected geographical regions. Partial outsourcing offers limited benefits since it cannot provide adequate pressures on public-sector logistics to be efficient or maintain uninterrupted supplies in times of catastrophes. Improvements in logistics performance achieved through partial outsourcing should not mask the need for more expansive arrangements that support not only partial outsourcing but also full outsourcing in situations of inefficiency and in times of supply-disruption catastrophe.</jats:p>",

However, evidence of an increased supply of ecosystem services (ES) in more heterogeneous landscapes remains limited, with no consensus.\nObjectives\n To evaluate the effect of the spatial cropland system’s diversity and landscape configuration on the supply of key ES in agricultural landscapes of the Rio de la Plata Grasslands region.\nMethods\n We analyzed the relationship between the supply of ES and the heterogeneity of 1121 micro-watersheds. We assessed the Ecosystem Service Supply Index (ESSI), the Hydrological Yield (HY), and the Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (APAR) in agricultural areas. We calculated the average grassland patch area, the structural and functional cropland diversity, the cropland percentage, and the grassland’s juxtaposition to assess landscape heterogeneity.\nResults\n Cropland functional diversity increased the supply of ES at the micro-watershed level. It positively affected the ESSI and APAR, and reduced the HY. In contrast, the juxtaposition of grasslands had opposite effects to those of cropland functional diversity, so the spatial segregation of grasslands favored the ES supply.\nConclusions\n The functional cropland diversification and the segregation of natural grasslands improved the supply of ES and counteracted the negative effects of agricultural expansion. These findings contribute to designing multifunctional landscapes and suggest that cropland functional diversity and grassland configuration should be considered in food production systems aimed to preserve ES supply.</p>"

This study employs a qualitative research approach to explore various strategies for SCM optimization. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with SCM experts, focus groups with key stakeholders, and an extensive review of secondary sources. The analysis reveals that the integration of information technology (IT), including ERP systems, supply chain management software, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), significantly enhances supply chain visibility and coordination, leading to improved decision-making and reduced lead times. Additionally, lean manufacturing and Just-In-Time (JIT) practices are found to be effective in minimizing waste, optimizing inventory levels, and aligning production schedules with market demand, thereby reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency. Strategic supplier partnerships and collaborations play a vital role in achieving synchronization across the supply chain, improving quality, and managing risks. The adoption of sustainability and green supply chain management (GSCM) practices is also highlighted as a key driver for cost reduction and efficiency improvement. These practices not only enhance environmental performance but also drive innovation and provide a competitive advantage. However, the study acknowledges the challenges associated with implementing these strategies, including high initial costs, the need for skilled personnel, and the complexity of managing multiple supplier relationships. Despite these challenges, the findings suggest that a holistic approach to SCM optimization, integrating traditional methods with cutting-edge technologies, can significantly enhance supply chain performance. This research provides valuable insights for both academia and industry practitioners, offering practical guidelines for implementing effective SCM strategies. By adopting these strategies, manufacturers can build resilient and adaptive supply chains capable of meeting the evolving demands of the global market, ensuring sustainable growth and competitiveness.\n </jats:p>"

A survey of firms with established supply chains in South Korea was conducted, with 420 valid responses analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The SEM results indicate that trust, information sharing, and commitment levels positively influence supply chain agility, which significantly enhances logistics performance. These findings underscore the importance of cultivating mutual trust, smooth information sharing, commitment, and agile actions to improve logistics performance. Prioritizing supply chain agility is crucial for adapting to changes, mitigating risks, and securing a competitive edge in a dynamic market environment. This study empirically validates the roles of trust, information sharing, commitment, and agility in supply chain management and their collective impact on logistics performance. The findings are particularly relevant for supply chain managers and practitioners aiming to enhance overall performance and competitiveness.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the backdrop of globalization, sustainable supply chains are becoming one of the most important directions for commercial development in the future. The efficiency of supply chain management (SCM) will be significantly improved when business intelligence is used in the supply chain. Sustainable supply chain refers to the integration of sustainable development elements on the basis of traditional supply chain management, introducing the assessment and management of social, environmental, economic benefits and other risks. The aim of this paper is to look at how different BI techniques affect different business models. Most of this paper is a summary of previous scholars work. The most successful and widespread application of BI is the final outcome of the technology acceptance model. These three BI models have different effects on sustainable supply chains, but in general, BI is very helpful for sustainable supply chain development in all aspects. Future results would be much more accurate and effective if three techniques were actually able to monitor and compare the sustainability of supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title>\n        <p>Groundwater quality and quantity are critical issues in semi-arid regions, where it often serves as the sole water source. The study area is located in the Villarino district, Buenos Aires, Argentina, featuring a dune chain with high infiltration capacity, leading to variable hydrochemical conditions. The town of Médanos relies on a phreatic aquifer within this eolian dune chain for its supply, with water quality being influenced by well location and depth, with the occasional presence of undesirable ions. This study aims to determine the hydrogeological conditions and limitants of the aquifer in the area, using well surveys, in-situ measurements, physicochemical analyses, and electrical resistivity tomographies (ERT). Results indicate a hydrochemical stratification, with low salinity water lens overlying more saline water. Groundwater conductivity varies, with lowest values in central and southwestern preferential recharge areas and higher values near discharge zones. Chloride content follows a similar pattern. Saturated thicknesses of fresh water, determined by means of ERTs, vary significantly, revealing potential paleochannels that could act as preferential zones for future wells. Analysis of existing pumping fields shows that well location and depth critically affect water yield and quality. The Mascota pumping field, with the highest fresh water saturated thickness, provides the best water quality and yield, while Las Escobas field faces issues of low yield (due to low saturated thickness) and interference among wells. This emphasizes the importance of these kind of studies for the strategic well placement and depth to improve water supply quality and sustainability for the town of Médanos.</p>"

These decisions are made across multiple levels of a decision hierarchy. Given the frequent disruptions in MSNs, ‘resilience’ — the ability to maintain satisfactory network functionality despite disruptions, is a vital network goal. When designing MSNs for resilience, the resilience and group goals often conflict, requiring simultaneous consideration of network and group decisions.

The framework’s efficacy is demonstrated using a steel MSN test problem, considering network and group decisions across two levels. The use of information flow and generic constructs makes the framework generic and well-suited for co-design exploration of multilevel systems to ensure resilience.</jats:p>",

Effective SCM allows organizations to remain competitive and reduce costs. With the growth of the global marketplace, SCM is becoming increasingly important for businesses to compete. The most important aspect of SCM is to understand the components of the supply chain, which form a network of organizations involved in value-added processes and activities. The supply chain network consists of multiple components, indicating that the success of an organization's SCM depends on the combination of multiple influencing factors. This paper utilizes the supply chain data of several well-known companies, uses a dozen variables such as inventory turnover ratio, lead time, and supplier count as independent variables, and analyzes the effects of these different supply chain influencing factors on operational efficiency, supply chain resilience, and supplier relationship through multiple linear regression models. This study finds that many different supply chain factors, like transportation cost efficiency, delivery time, and others, have the greatest impact on the above-mentioned factors. This analysis may help companies to comprehensively assess their supply chain maturity and strategically enhance their supply chain attributes to achieve their business development goals.</jats:p>"

This paper describes the results of experimental activities carried out to verify the possibility of reusing treated institutional wastewater for irrigating three container-grown ornamental plants: Sweet William, Annual Phlox, and Rainbow Pink. The experiment was conducted in a subtropical highland climate by using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The plants were irrigated with borewell water (T1), hybrid sewage (T2), secondary treated wastewater (TW) (T3), tertiary-treated wastewater (T4), and ozone-treated wastewater (T5). Each irrigation treatment was subjected to physical, chemical, and biological analysis to determine water quality parameters. The growth of ornamental plants in each treatment was monitored in terms of height, leaves, and quality of flowers. The data were statistically analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The quality parameters of different irrigation water sources varied significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05) across the treatments, indicating effective treatment of institutional wastewater. ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences in plant height across irrigation treatments for Sweet William and Annual Phlox, but not for Rainbow Pink. Overall, treatments T4 and T5 resulted in the best growth of the considered ornamental plants.</jats:p>",

In particular, the supply chain for hazardous materials, involving chemicals and explosives, requires stringent regulation. Managing the flow of these high-risk goods necessitates a reliable access control system to ensure safety and compliance. Traditional supply chain management systems often rely on centralized databases and record-keeping systems, which are prone to tampering and single points of failure, making them inadequate for current high-security demands. This paper combines blockchain technology with a hazardous materials supply chain model. In the blockchain network, our innovation lies in the introduction of a transaction coordinator to create transaction sets for each supply chain entity along with smart contracts to implement access control for these transaction sets. We also propose a new hazardous materials supply chain model architecture and conduct experimental verification using simulated hazardous materials supply chain data. Our experimental results show that the proposed method performs excellently in throughput and latency tests, demonstrating the potential to enhance the efficiency and security of supply chain management.</jats:p>"

On the other hand, low formation pressure, low gas well production, and high water saturation are features of tight gas reservoirs that have been developed and produced over an extended period of time. In order to improve the assessment of the supply boundary and production capacity features of tight gas wells at low pressure, a new coupling model of gas-water two-phase was established in this paper and the threshold pressure gradient, stress sensitivity and slip effect are taken into account the built model. Subsequently, the steady-state substitution method and the material balance method were used to develop the supply boundary calculation model. Finally, an analysis is done on how the supply boundary is affected by the threshold pressure gradient production, stress sensitivity and production pressure difference. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to the slower propagation observed in the matrix zone, the supply boundary propagates relatively quickly within the fracture modification zone. The threshold pressure gradient and stress-sensitive increase the resistance of gas seepage and delay the propagation of the supply boundary, which reduces the production of gas well. The propagation of the supply boundary accelerates with increasing production pressure difference, but the pressure difference's effect decreases. The production of gas is significantly impacted by the threshold pressure gradient, stress sensitivity and production pressure difference. Efficient production of tight gas reservoirs necessitates minimizing water production and preserving formation pressure.</p>"

Precarious facilities and insufficient conservation technologies were observed, with only 12.9% of sellers having refrigeration facilities. Although 56.1% of the sellers denied experiencing losses, a weekly loss of 26.30 t of vegetables and 127.4 t of fruit was estimated, representing 2.26% of the acquired amount. In absolute values, this corresponds to over 150 t of wasted food.

The purpose of the work is to establish optimal parameters for an open-pit mine power supply at mining and processing complexes, and to conduct research that allows a technical and economic model of the system to be created. It has been established that mathematical statistics provides a number of methods for establishing the homogeneity (or heterogeneity) of the population of random variable values. When analyzing the data of failure statistics of electrical equipment, the method of comparative estimate of two sample averages (compared to the method of comparing the empirical distribution with the normal distribution or the moving average method) is the most acceptable. The paper presents accident rates of electrical equipment of open-pit substations and network devices of the quarry processed on the basis of data, also presents the relationship between the reliability of the circuit and its elements and shows the influence of protection reliability on the reliability of the circuit. Methods of optimizing open-pit power supply systems are presented, which consist in the use of first-order gradient methods, second-order methods or the so-called quadratic optimization methods, and random search methods. A group of gradient methods is the most widespread for solving nonlinear programming problems, among which the method of steepest descent should be considered primarily. The combination of random search with the penalty function method makes it possible to determine conditional extrema for the problem of optimizing the electrical grid and system operation mode. The method of random descent, which consists in determining the minimum of the target function according to an appropriate algorithm, is also considered, in which the direction of motion is generally given by a random vector uniformly distributed over a hyposphere.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the interplay between inventory replenishment policies and information sharing in the context of a two-tier supply chain with a single supplier and a single retailer serving an independent and identically distributed Gaussian market demand. We investigate how the retailer’s inventory policy impacts the supply chain’s cumulative expected long-term average inventory costs [Formula: see text] in two extreme information-sharing cases: (a) full information sharing and (b) no information sharing. To find the retailer’s inventory policy that minimizes [Formula: see text], we formulate an infinite-dimensional optimization problem whose decision variables are the MA([Formula: see text]) coefficients that characterize a stationary ordering policy. Under full information sharing, the optimization problem admits a simple solution and the optimal policy is given by an MA(1) process. On the other hand, to solve the optimization problem under no information sharing, we reformulate the optimization from its time domain formulation to an equivalent z-transform formulation in which the decision variables correspond to elements of the Hardy space H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. This alternative representation allows us to use a number of results from H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> theory to compute the optimal value of [Formula: see text] and characterize a sequence of ϵ-optimal inventory policies under some mild technical conditions. By comparing the optimal solution under full information sharing and no information sharing, we derive a number of important practical takeaways. For instance, we show that there is value in information sharing if and only if the retailer’s optimal policy under full information sharing is not invertible with respect to the sequence of demand shocks. Furthermore, we derive a fundamental mathematical identity that reveals the value of information sharing by exploiting the canonical Smirnov–Beurling inner–outer factorization of the retailer’s orders when viewed as an element of H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. We also show that the value of information sharing can grow unboundedly when the cumulative supply chain costs are dominated by the supplier’s inventory costs. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: R.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biomass supply chain (BSC) activities have caused social and environmental disruptions, such as climate change, energy security issues, high energy demand, and job opportunities, especially in rural areas. Moreover, different economic problems have arisen globally in recent years (e.g., the high costs of BSC logistics and the inefficiency of generating bioenergy from low-energy-density biomass). As a result, numerous researchers in this field have focused on modeling and optimizing sustainable BSC. To this end, this study aims to develop a multi-objective mathematical model by addressing three sustainability pillars (economic cost, environmental emission, and job creation) and three decision levels (i.e., strategic (location of facilities), tactical (type of transportation and routing), and operational (vehicle planning). A palm oil BSC case study was selected in the context of Malaysia in which two advanced evolutionary algorithms, i.e., non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), were implemented. The study results showed that the highest amounts of profit obtained from the proposed supply chain (SC) design were equal to $13,500 million and $7000 million for two selected examples with maximum emissions. A better target value was achieved in the extended example when 40% profit was reduced, and the minimum emissions from production and transportation in the BSC were attained. In addition, the results demonstrate that more Pareto solutions can be obtained using the NSGA-II algorithm. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) was adopted to balance the optimum design points obtained from the optimization algorithm solutions through two-objective problems. The results indicated that MOPSO worked more efficiently than NSGA-II, although the NSGA-II algorithm succeeded in generating more Pareto solutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When municipal solid waste (MSW) is placed in a landfill, it undergoes anaerobic decomposition, leading to the production of landfill gas, which primarily consists of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Reducing methane emissions is essential in the fight against climate change. It must be implemented at global and European levels, as set out in 2030 in the impact assessment of the climate goal plan. This assessment states that to achieve the goal by 2030 and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55%, the methane emissions must be reduced, considering the goals of the Paris Agreement. The Glasgow Climate Pact includes a global mitigation target of the year 2030: to reduce CO2 emissions by 45%, and the emissions of methane and other greenhouse gasses. For that purpose, looking for new, more advanced ways of managing such waste is necessary. The main objective of this experimental study was to evaluate the influence of aeration, probiotic introduction, and water supply on the production of landfill gasses (CO2, CH4, N2, H2, etc.) in five different landfill models during the management of MSW and to propose the best solutions for reducing environmental pollution. The results of the research showed that the first and second models of landfills, using only anaerobic conditions, can be used for the treatment of MSW for the production of biogas (CH4, CO2), as up to 40–60% of it was released during the 120-experiment period. The third landfill model can be applied in old, already closed landfills, where the rapid stabilization and aeration of MSW are required to minimize pollutant emissions (N2, etc.) and unwanted odors and shorten biodegradation processes. The results of the fourth and fifth landfill models, in which aerobic–anaerobic conditions were applied, showed that the developing nitrification–denitrification processes resulted in complete nitrogen removal (from 20% to 0%), and overall waste stabilization improved the biodegradation of the MSW. Later, relatively good (on average, 30%) results of biogas (CH4, CO2) emissions are achieved during anaerobic condition formation results. Summarizing all experiment results of all landfill models for the further evaluation of the processes, all models can be applied in real practice depending on where they will be used and what result they want to achieve.</jats:p>"

PISM addresses the lack of localised, adaptable frameworks by integrating three key components: a Viability Rating (VR), a Sustainability Rating (SR), and a conceptual formula within a predictive iterative process. This integrated approach optimises project evaluation and planning. Empirical data were derived by evaluating responses to a survey with 70 Likert-scale questions covering 265 sustainability challenges. This data was used to assess community viability for sustainable water infrastructure in five Nigerian communities facing significant water poverty. The results reveal VR scores ranging from 63.95 to 67.91%, establishing a benchmark for viability. SR scores, on the other hand, vary substantially from 179 to 424%, illustrating the model's capacity to evaluate sustainability under diverse conditions and identify critical, high-impact projects that can mitigate infrastructure failure risks. As a dynamic and adaptable framework, PISM holds significant potential to improve water infrastructure sustainability in Nigeria and similar regions globally.</jats:p>",

Although assessing aquatic food security relies on understanding global trends in per capita production and consumption, there has been no comprehensive index to evaluate these trends in a country or regional context. Here, we develop a novel framework based on a comprehensive scoring system to assess changes in contemporary per capita aquatic food production and consumption trends (tendency, magnitude, and stability) across 177 countries in two time periods (1961–1990 and 1991–2019). Globally, over 50% of countries scored positive in production and consumption trends from 1961 to 1990. However, between 1991 and 2019, over half of the countries achieved negative production trend scores, while 68.4% of countries maintained positive consumption trend scores, accompanied by higher stability in the trends. Meanwhile, while global overall aquatic food production trend scores decreased significantly across both periods, the consumption trend scores did not decline substantially. This caused a notable overall increase in the positive disparity between consumption and production trend scores. We highlight an increasing disjunction between per capita consumption and production comprehensive trends while underscoring the collaborative synergy between aquaculture and trade as crucial factors that sustain the increase and improve stability of aquatic food consumption for most countries worldwide. The scores of global production and consumption trends of aquatic foods can provide valuable indicators for managers and policymakers to promote sustainable development and more equitable distribution of aquatic products, thereby improving future food security.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally, rental housing has been supplied by a large pool of individual investors who own a few units and invest their savings, with some leverage, to take advantage of the tax regime in Australia. The last five years have seen the emergence of build-to-rent (BTR) units, which are supplied by investors who own a large number of units. The state of Victoria in Australia has the largest share of these projects. In the current market and regulatory environment, the financial viability of BTR projects is low for investors and hinges on the ability of units to be leased at higher than market rents. This paper examines four groups of levers, including those already being pursued by the building industry, that can be used to improve the financial viability of BTRs. These include: (i) revenue maximization, (ii) cost reduction (iii) fiscal and (iv) planning incentives. An archetypical BTR project which mimics current practice is considered, assumed to be in Docklands, Victoria, where several BTR projects are planned. For the robustness check, a feasibility analysis is conducted for a site in North Melbourne, a neighbourhood in Victoria with several BTR projects. The results indicate that for revenue maximization, the mix of unit types in a BTR project should be location-specific, as market preferences (and the characteristics of renters) determine the rent for different types of units that can be achieved. In a conventional BTR project development, where land is bought upfront and the project is developed, the mixed-use BTR (residential in combination with commercial) does not provide significant financial benefits though including small retail (3–4% of the net lettable area) may provide complementary benefits. Incurring large capital costs upfront and having the revenue stream spread over long periods reduces financial viability. While construction costs are more difficult to reduce, ways to reduce land costs could be through zoning land for BTR use, through mechanisms such as joint ventures with landowners, and land leasing. Exemptions on income, land tax, and rates (like CHPs) can result in a higher return for investors. A full GST refund, an incentive that industry is lobbying for, results in a similar IRR as an exemption on income, land tax and rates would offer. These results will assist in determining priorities for policies that are aimed at BTR.</jats:p>"

Sustainable supply chain planning incorporates environmental, social, and economic issues into the heart of supply chain management strategies. This is in response to the growing awareness among companies of the need to reduce their ecological imprint.\r\n \r\nWhen establishing a sustainable supply chain, it is necessary to conduct an exhaustive analysis of the whole supply chain lifetime, beginning with the procurement of raw materials and ending with the disposal of products at their end of life. It is necessary to put into practice procedures that cut down on waste, lessen the amount of carbon emissions, and increase the efficiency with which resources are used. The selection of suppliers who adhere to sustainable practices, the optimisation of transportation routes to minimise fuel usage, and the utilisation of technology that support the ideas of a circular economy are all important initiatives. Through the implementation of these components, organisations have the ability to reduce the risks connected with environmental requirements and interruptions in supply chain operations.\r\n </jats:p>"

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a unified training system for the training of nurses at the National Disinfection Supply Center . The aim of this study was to develop a scientific training framework for specialized nurses in disinfection supplies to serve as a benchmark for ongoing training at disinfection supply centers.\n<bold>Methods: </bold>The initialdevelopment of the CSSD nurse training system involved an extensive literature review and discussions among expert groups. From April to June 2024, two rounds of Delphi surveys were conducted, and 25 experts in related fields from 9 provinces in China were consulted to reach a consensus on the index system. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. The consensus threshold is set according to the mean (≥3.5), coefficient of variation (&lt;0.25) and full score ratio (≥70%).\n<bold>Results: </bold>The recovery rates of valid questionnaires in the two rounds of expert consultation were 92.59% and 100%, respectively, and the average authority coefficient of the two rounds was 0.912. In the first round, 13 itemswere modified, 4 items were deleted, 2 items were relocated, and 20 itemswere added. The indicators were not modified in the second round. Finally, the training process index system of specialized nurses in the disinfection supply center (5 first-level indicators, 12 second-level indicators and 50 third-level indicators) and the training content index system (4 first-level indicators, 24 second-level indicators and 107 third-level indicators) were developed. The Kendall's W coefficients for the training process and training content were 0.199 and 0.187 in the first round and 0.227 and 0.218, respectively, in the second round of consultations (p &lt;0.001).\n<bold>Conclusion: </bold>The training index system for specialized nurses in disinfection supply centers is scientific and reliable and can provide a reference for access, curriculum setting and quality management in the training process of specialized nurses in disinfection supply centers.</p>"

However, the integration of blockchain into supply chain systems poses challenges related to security, efficiency, and regulatory compliance. This paper presents an analysis of a blockchain architecture for file sharing and management in tertiary institutions. The proposed framework combines the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) deep reinforcement learning algorithm with prioritized experience replay for inventory optimization and a blockchain-based zero-trust mechanism for secure supply chain management. The SAC algorithm learns adaptive policies under demand uncertainty, while the blockchain architecture ensures secure, transparent, and traceable record-keeping and automated execution of supply chain transactions. An experiment using real-world supply chain data demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of reward maximization, inventory stability, and security metrics. The paper also discusses the evidentiary significance of blockchain records and the procedural implications of integrating this technology into the U.S. judicial system. The framework offers a promising solution for addressing the challenges of modern supply chains by leveraging blockchain, deep reinforcement learning, and zero-trust security principles.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a comparison of novel two-dimensional hybrid intelligent models for the idealization of the effects of waves on the performance of moored rectangular floating breakwaters (FBs). Fluid structure interactions (FSIs) were idealized by airy-type monochromatic regular waves generated in a numerical wave tank. The coupled Volume of Fluid-Fast Fictitious Domain (VOF-FFD) interpolation method was used to evaluate FB motions. Different forms of Least Squares Support Vector Machine Methods (LSSVMs) that utilized 183 data streams were used to model FB performance for different wave height-to-water depth ratios, dimensional aspect ratios, and specific length-to-water depth ratios. Of those, 80% were used to train the model and 20% to test it. Parametric studies have shown that during training a Least Squares Support Vector Machine Method-Bat Algorithm (LSSVM-BA) with R2 = 0.8725, MAE = 0.0276, and RMSE = 0.0488 presents the most appropriate model for the evaluation of FB performance. Notwithstanding this, during testing a Least Squares Support Vector Machine Method-Cuckoo Search (LSSVM-CS) Algorithm with corresponding values of 0.6841, 0.0519, and 0.0708 performs better.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the interplay between inventory replenishment policies and information sharing in the context of a two-tier supply chain with a single supplier and a single retailer serving an independent and identically distributed Gaussian market demand. We investigate how the retailer’s inventory policy impacts the supply chain’s cumulative expected long-term average inventory costs [Formula: see text] in two extreme information-sharing cases: (a) full information sharing and (b) no information sharing. To find the retailer’s inventory policy that minimizes [Formula: see text], we formulate an infinite-dimensional optimization problem whose decision variables are the MA([Formula: see text]) coefficients that characterize a stationary ordering policy. Under full information sharing, the optimization problem admits a simple solution and the optimal policy is given by an MA(1) process. On the other hand, to solve the optimization problem under no information sharing, we reformulate the optimization from its time domain formulation to an equivalent z-transform formulation in which the decision variables correspond to elements of the Hardy space H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. This alternative representation allows us to use a number of results from H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> theory to compute the optimal value of [Formula: see text] and characterize a sequence of ϵ-optimal inventory policies under some mild technical conditions. By comparing the optimal solution under full information sharing and no information sharing, we derive a number of important practical takeaways. For instance, we show that there is value in information sharing if and only if the retailer’s optimal policy under full information sharing is not invertible with respect to the sequence of demand shocks. Furthermore, we derive a fundamental mathematical identity that reveals the value of information sharing by exploiting the canonical Smirnov–Beurling inner–outer factorization of the retailer’s orders when viewed as an element of H<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. We also show that the value of information sharing can grow unboundedly when the cumulative supply chain costs are dominated by the supplier’s inventory costs. </jats:p><jats:p> Funding: R.

The complexity of the global supply chain network has led to the need for increased supply chain flexibility, agility, and resilience. This paper reviews different approaches to resolving the DES heterogeneity between business systems and their trade-offs in supporting flexible supply chain integration. A novel approach is then proposed to better manage and reuse mapping specifications and enable more efficient translation of messages from one DES to another and, consequently, more flexibility in supply chain networking. The approach represents an extension of the existing platform for DES management. It is based on previously documented federated DES development and management, which adopts the federated learning approach for building the DES library. Central to the proposed approach is the concept of a super data model as an “interoperable” layer that enables semantics match between different DESes. Another important concept is Business Context, which is envisioned as a basis for the identification and reuse of existing mapping specifications. Our initial evaluation shows the feasibility and benefit of the proposed solution. The paper identifies a list of research directions that will be addressed in the future.</jats:p>",

The lessons learnt from that experience is that flexibility in responding to demand and modularity must be planned at every stage. Along with planning, we argue that execution becomes challenging and is equally important to consider when making plans. We illustrate with a broad category of flexibility and modularity, dual sourcing, and how management mathematics can be used to manage these systems and understand the cost of execution. Dual sourcing has been used to manage the trade-off between cost and responsiveness by firms and has received considerable attention in academic literature. It is known that except in special cases, the optimal sourcing policy does not have an easy structure that is practically appealing and can be used by managers. Over the last decade and half, researchers have developed various management mathematics techniques and analyzed the performance of heuristic policies. This paper presents a discussion of the results in a few key papers related to the dual-sourcing inventory management problem and recent distribution free results in asymptotic regions. The asymptotic regimes considered include systems where the lead-time from the slower supplier is significantly higher than that from the closer, faster supplier and conditions where the unit cost of procurement is significantly higher compared to the unit cost of carrying inventory. These regimes represent different conditions about how valuable or costly using the faster supplier is and illustrate the value of simple heuristic policies and characterize the cost of these heuristics. The key learnings are that optimal ordering decisions may be robust to misspecification of demand distribution and managers only need summary statistics, such as the average and standard deviation of demand to determine the order quantities from the different suppliers. Managers could also consider ways to roll out new planning and control systems for managing multiple suppliers.</jats:p>",

This model is formulated after a thorough study of the power load conditions of Ghana as well as the factors that affect domestic electricity demand of supply in the Country was conducted. In Ghana, the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) forecast model is officially applied for electricity demand and projection of power supply which comes with forecasting errors. Thus, there exists a crucial need to develop a forecasting model for the best energy policies formulation and consequent minimization of overall forecasting error compared to the LEAP model. Results from the quantitative classical multiplicative decomposition forecast model is comparatively precise with a reduced forecast error margin between − 5–4.5% compared to an existing prediction error margin viz., 1% to -11%.\nBy virtue of the proposed study, accurate forecasting of power loads, improvement in utilization of electrical equipment, economies of scale and reduction in production cost can be attained. It is also essential to optimize power system resources for the attainment of energy conservation and overall reduction in emissions.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The potential risks arising from excessive supply chain concentration have received more and more attention. In practice, high supply chain concentration hinders firms’ sustainable development, especially for firms in emerging markets. However, how to reduce supply chain concentration remains an underexplored problem. Outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) has been an important strategy for firms to reallocate and optimize their supply chain relationships. Thus, we tried to explore whether OFDI can serve as an effective method to reduce supply chain concentration by analyzing their relationship. Using the data of Chinese A-share listed firms from 2008 to 2022, this paper empirically examines the impact of OFDI on supply chain concentration through a two-way fixed-effects model. We find that OFDI significantly reduces supply chain concentration, and this conclusion still holds after using alternative measures of the independent variable and dependent variable, endogeneity treatment, the Heckman two-stage model test, controlling for provincial factors, and excluding special samples. Channel analysis reveals that OFDI reduces supply chain concentration mainly through increasing market share, enhancing innovation capacity, and improving reputation. Cross-sectional analysis shows that the negative effect of OFDI on supply chain concentration is more pronounced in state-owned firms, firms under high industry competition, and high-tech firms. Our findings have important implications for firms to build sustainable supply chain relationships and strengthen supply chain resilience, and for policymakers to guide OFDI reasonably. Future research could further explore the effect of firms’ investment decisions on supply chain configuration.</jats:p>"

The objectives of this study were to assess the nutritional quality and the price of plant-based dairy and meat analogs compared to their respective animal-derived products and to examine the association between processing levels and the nutritional quality among these products. Using a branded food composition database, products in cheese, yogurt, milk, and meat categories were examined (n = 3231). Products were categorized as plant-based analogs versus animal-derived products using the ingredient list. Products were examined for their nutrient content, overall nutritional quality using the Food Standards Australia New Zealand nutrient profiling model, price, and processing levels using the NOVA classification. All plant-based analogs had lower protein and higher total carbohydrate, sugar, and fiber content compared to their respective animal-derived products. Compared to their respective animal-derived products, plant-based milk and meat analogs had lower energy, total fat, and saturated fat content; plant-based yogurt and meat analogs had lower sodium content; and all plant-based dairy analogs had lower calcium content. Plant-based cheese and yogurt analogs were more expensive than animal-based products; however, there was no significant difference among milk and meat products. There was no association between processing levels and overall nutritional quality among dairy and meat products. Plant-based analogs may be part of a healthy and affordable diet to reduce the intakes of nutrients of concern; however, additional compositional guidelines and/or labeling may be needed to highlight the differences in the levels of nutrients to encourage. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Primary data were collected from respondents to accomplish these objectives. Secondary data were obtained from private and government publications, and review papers. Utilizing a descriptive research design and employing a probability sampling method, the study surveyed 50 farmers, 5 village traders, 5 pre-harvest contractors, 10 wholesalers cum commission agents, and 10 retailers using a semi-structured schedule. Three marketing channels were identified. Among them channel-III (Farmer - Wholesaler cum commission agent - Retailer - Consumer) was the most efficient option, offering the highest producer's share in the consumer's rupee (40.05%) and the highest marketing efficiency (0.67), with a price spread of Rs. 1711.55 per quintal. In the study area, banana producers face challenges such as high input costs, delayed availability of planting materials, and losses due to diseases and pests. Marketing hurdles include lower prices, distant selling unit locations, delayed payments, and inadequate transportation and storage facilities. Village traders, preharvest contractors, wholesalers cum commission agents, and retailers also encounter various obstacles such as price fluctuation, handling and transportation losses, low-quality produce, and labour shortages. As the total market demand for banana in Navi Mumbai was estimated to be ₹62.26 crore, addressing these challenges is vital for enhancing the efficiency and profitability of banana marketing in the study area, necessitating coordinated efforts from policymakers, agricultural stakeholders, and market participants. Establishing FPOs and FPCs can ease access to affordable planting materials and address marketing challenges, benefiting all banana market stakeholders.</jats:p>"

This study evaluates the green hydrogen supply chain (GHSC) upstream process using the two-phase integrated multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework. In the first phase, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) technique is applied to measure the relative efficiency of provincial alternatives with multiple criteria. The input criteria include provincial area, population density, gross domestic product value, and land cost data. In contrast, the sustainability-based governmental criteria concerning people, prosperity, planet, peace, and partnership indices are used as output criteria. Then, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is further applied to evaluate regional districts for Ubonratchathani province, one of the twelve relatively efficient provinces, to obtain the ranking list of potential renewable energy sites in the GHSC. Criteria related to geographic and climate data relevant to the efficiency of solar and wind are, thus, collected and analyzed. Our results show that the top three district areas are Kut Khaopun District, Pho Sai District, and Na Tan District, respectively. Finally, the obtained results are verified to evaluate the robustness of the assessment.

The objectives of this study were to assess the nutritional quality and the price of plant-based dairy and meat analogs compared to their respective animal-derived products and to examine the association between processing levels and the nutritional quality among these products. Using a branded food composition database, products in cheese, yogurt, milk, and meat categories were examined (n = 3231). Products were categorized as plant-based analogs versus animal-derived products using the ingredient list. Products were examined for their nutrient content, overall nutritional quality using the Food Standards Australia New Zealand nutrient profiling model, price, and processing levels using the NOVA classification. All plant-based analogs had lower protein and higher total carbohydrate, sugar, and fiber content compared to their respective animal-derived products. Compared to their respective animal-derived products, plant-based milk and meat analogs had lower energy, total fat, and saturated fat content; plant-based yogurt and meat analogs had lower sodium content; and all plant-based dairy analogs had lower calcium content. Plant-based cheese and yogurt analogs were more expensive than animal-based products; however, there was no significant difference among milk and meat products. There was no association between processing levels and overall nutritional quality among dairy and meat products. Plant-based analogs may be part of a healthy and affordable diet to reduce the intakes of nutrients of concern; however, additional compositional guidelines and/or labeling may be needed to highlight the differences in the levels of nutrients to encourage. &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The idea relates to how easily relevant information regarding the production, processing, and distribution of agricultural goods is accessible to all parties involved in the agricultural supply chain, from farmers to consumers. For several reasons, including environmental sustainability, ethical sourcing, and food safety, it is imperative to maintain openness. The intricate and disjointed nature of the agricultural supply chain has made it difficult to attain complete transparency. A possible way to deal with these issues is through the use of blockchain technology. Blockchain can improve agricultural product traceability and accountability by offering a decentralized, irreversible ledger of transactions. With the use of this technology, supply chain players may access and validate information instantly, lowering the possibility of fraud and increasing overall efficiency.</jats:p>"

The IFRCCP model was applied to a WDS to analyze the effects of randomness and fuzziness on the booster costs. The booster cost intervals were obtained under various violation levels and confidence levels. The results indicated that the lower and upper booster costs increased with the confidence levels of the lower limits and decreased with the violation levels of the lower limits for both normal and log-normal distribution fuzzy random variables (FRVs). Moreover, the increased magnitude of lower and upper booster costs under normal distribution FRV is a little less than that under log-normal distribution FRV, while the decreased magnitude of lower and upper booster costs under normal distribution FRV is larger than that under log-normal distribution FRV. The same regulation can be found for the FVR with both triangular and trapezoidal distribution FRVs. With the increase of booster number, the increased magnitude of the lower and upper booster costs decreased for both normal and log-normal distribution FRVs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Realizing the multifunctional value of farmland is essential for regulating the pricing of farmland transfers and stabilizing the rural land market. However, in China, the mismatch between supply and demand leads to improper resource allocation, weakens the explicit value of farmland, and causes unreasonable transfer pricing mechanisms that threaten agricultural production and food security. This study develops an analytical framework to examine the relationship between farmland multifunction and transfer pricing from a supply–demand perspective. An evaluation index system is constructed, considering the physical, value, and material quantities. This study uses the matching index method and bivariate spatial autocorrelation to analyze the supply–demand match of farmland multifunction from 2014 to 2021 and its relationship with transfer prices. Additionally, management methods and strategies for dynamic zoning-based pricing under multifunctional matching trade-offs are proposed. The results show that: (1) There is significant heterogeneity in the supply and demand matching degree of different farmland functions in both space and time. The production and ecological functions of farmland are oversupplied, while the living functions are undersupplied. (2) Different spatial autocorrelation relationships exist between the degree of supply and demand matching of farmland functions and farmland transfer prices. Specifically, the supply and demand matching degrees of the production and living functions show a significant negative spatial correlation with farmland transfer prices. In contrast, the ecological function shows a significant positive spatial correlation with farmland transfer prices, which are continuously strengthening over time. (3) Based on the supply and demand matching situation of different farmland functions and the spatial autocorrelation of farmland transfer prices, nine types of regions are delineated for farmland functions. Among them, the surplus-coordinated development areas have the most cities, accounting for about 40%, with a wide distribution range. This study proposes zoning-based pricing instruments and management strategies. This research provides valuable insights for developing countries seeking to alleviate conflicts in multifunctional land use, enhance the sustainable protection of land resources, and improve land resource assessment frameworks.</jats:p>"

The liquor industry has been under the simultaneous strain of market consumption structure upgrade and overcapacity in recent years. Both of these pressures have been a challenge for the sector. As a consequence of this, the amount of competitiveness that exists within the industry has recently increased. Therefore, the industry needs to leave its old way of thinking, which focuses on the management of its internal working capital, and instead pay more attention to the performance that is brought about by coordinating with important firms in the supply chain. This is because performance is directly related to the efficiency of the supply chain.

The review provided theoretical and empirical kinds of literature on trust and collaboration in practices of supply chain management to provide detailed information and give insight and knowledge to the readers. This paper reviewed articles concerning trust and collaboration in practices of supply chain management published over the last 13 years. The review followed PRISM techniques as a methodological approach. The review examined 50 published research articles between 2010 and 2023. The majority of reviewed articles were published in the last two years. The most commonly used method of analysis in reviewed articles was quantitative. The results indicated trust and collaboration significantly affect organizations, and managers must invest in key result areas to remain relevant and dominant in the competitive environment. Trust is a crucial factor in supply chain management, as it ensures mutual understanding between suppliers and customers, leading to fair profits and high-quality products. This review suggested that future research focus on combining qualitative and quantitative methods and SCM practices and competitive advantage, sustainability performance, and organizational performance.\n</jats:p>"

The objective of this method is to enhance the operational efficiency of the power grid, reduce energy costs, and facilitate economical and efficient energy distribution in the power market. The method comprehensively considers the characteristics and uncertainties of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and incorporates advanced multi-objective optimization algorithms. Additionally, real-time market price feedback is integrated to achieve accurate allocation of power supply and demand. Through a case study of a multi-energy virtual power plant in Jiangxi Province, this paper examines the optimal combination model for various energy sources within VPP, and analyzes the impact of different market environments on supply-demand balance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling optimization method significantly improves economic benefits while ensuring grid stability. Compared with traditional power supply models, it reduces average electricity costs by 15% and increases renewable energy utilization efficiency by 20%.</jats:p>"

The primary objective of the research is to identify the most effective method for a business to supply several products while maintaining customer service and keeping inventory costs low. The main aim of this paper's Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)-enhanced Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach is to predict ideal order and lack quantities, considering into account historical demand, level of inventory, vendor performance, and cost data. The key goal is to reduce the total cost of inventory (which includes holding, placing orders, and supply-chain costs) while maintaining excellent customer service. In order to accomplish this, the proposed system combines SGD's efficiency to enhance predictions and SVM's predictability. A consumer products business chain's real-world dataset was employed to train and test the algorithm. The dataset provides three years' worth of revenue, stock levels, vendors, and costs. Parameters like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR), and Service Level Achievement (SLA) have been employed to test the methodology, and parameters were optimized using a 5-fold cross-validation. Based on the study findings, the simulation model obtains an average MAE of 1.81 following 100 training epochs, substantially boosting ITR and SLA. As it effectively and accurately balances inventory levels with customer needs, the findings demonstrate that the SVM model with SGD is an excellent match for IMO.</jats:p>"

Within the approach, the entropy weight method was used to assign different index weights, and the GRA-TOPSIS was used to rank the resilience of the construction supply chain in three urban cities. The development of resilience provides a robust decision-making basis and theoretical reference, further enriching research methods, and having strong practical value. The study serves to improve risk awareness and resilience, which in turn helps to reduce losses. It also provides enhanced awareness regarding the future enhancement of supply chain resilience for urban construction.</jats:p></jats:sec>"

The analysis combines theoretical insights with empirical research, specifically focusing on the economic aspect of sustainability, measured through efficiency. The study emphasizes the critical role of integrating participants across the food supply chain to achieve sustainability goals. It discusses methodologies for assessing integration levels within the chain, providing a theoretical and analytical basis for modeling integration and efficiency within the supply chain. To empirically validate these relationships, an extended stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) method was applied to selected sectors within the food processing industry. The results demonstrate that enhancing integration with suppliers and buyers can significantly improve efficiency within the food chain. In conclusion, through deductive reasoning, this study asserts that integration plays a pivotal role in advancing economic sustainability objectives within the food sector. This framework contributes to a deeper understanding of how integration influences sustainability outcomes, offering valuable insights for stakeholders aiming to enhance sustainability in food systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technology has become an integral part of modern business, facilitating transactions and operations in many areas, including procurement. Businesses, clinics, and hospitals in Kenya have been quick to embrace E-Procurement strategies. In Kenyan hospitals, where e-procurement accounts for as much as 30% of operational expenses, this study seeks to evaluate the effect of this trend on supply chain management success. Companies that want to survive in today's cutthroat healthcare market must embrace e-procurement strategies if they want to keep up with the ever-changing industry. By facilitating more efficient inventory management, faster purchasing cycles, increased transparency, and higher quality services, e-procurement practices are essential for improving performance and competitiveness in the market. The health industry is facing severe competition and financing constraints, making it imperative that it reorganizes its service delivery system to adapt to the complicated business climate. The purpose of this empirical study is to investigate how hospitals in Kenya are using electronic tendering and electronic invoicing to improve their supply chain management. The study found that Kenyan hospital administrators have a highly positive perception of electronic procurement practices, with e-tendering scoring an average mean of 4.75, significantly enhancing SCM performance through efficiency and cost savings. The findings concluded that e-invoicing also positively impacts procurement processes, promoting transparency and operational effectiveness. The study further recommended that legislators integrate these electronic procurement practices into healthcare policies, provide financial assistance and training, and encourage hospitals to invest in robust systems and strategic partnerships to improve patient care and system efficiency.</jats:p>"

It has been triggered by the annexation of the Ukrainian Crimea by Russia and Russia-Ukraine war today. All these problems have urged Ukraine to determine modern energy policy and a national energy security model in the light of the concepts of energy security in the 21st century. As it is known, the energy crises between Russia and Ukraine directly affect the security of European Union energy supply in the context of natural gas flows. The main argument of this study is as follows: The Russia-Ukraine war has severely affected the energy security of Ukraine and this situation has led the European Union countries to finally consider taking steps to diversify the supply and to prevent further deterioration of the EU energy supply security. In this context, the article will analyse how the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war on Ukrainian energy security will affect EU energy supply security.</jats:p>"

This shore supply base is the logistics hub for all drilling and oil and gas activity. It functions as a central warehouse and a forward base for supplying cargo and needed supplies to offshore installations, and it offers critical services to facilitate offshore operations. Because of its advantageous position in Southeast Asia, Malaysia has become a prominent participant in the worldwide oil and gas sector. The nation’s offshore supply bases, with oil and gas platforms operating in different locations along the eastern shores, have become crucial centres for the sector. This study aims to identify the key factors in supply base selection by oil and gas operators by performing a comparative analysis of two significant offshore supply bases in Malaysia, specifically Kemaman and Tok Bali. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been used for stakeholders to make multi-criteria decisions. The method will prioritise four main criteria for supply base selection: Geographical location of Offshore Supply Base, Infrastructure and facilities, services provided and charges, and Regulatory considerations were used with twelve sub-criteria to ascertain which supply base is most favourably situated to meet the increasing demands of the oil and gas industry in the region, all of which determine the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of offshore operations. The analysis revealed that the Geographical component is the most significant, followed by Facilities and infrastructure, Service and costs, and Regulatory, respectively. Based on the score, the attribute with the highest level of importance is the Distance to MTJDA &amp; MVCAA (Northern Section) Oil &amp; Gas Platform. This is followed by Service, Berth facilities, Distance to the oil and gas Platform at Terengganu Water (Southern Section), Outsourced / Inland Area, Warehousing, Storage Facilities, Crew Change, Customs, Charges, Port Authority, and ISPS compliances in that order. The findings of this study will aid oil and gas companies and players in making informed decisions regarding the selection of onshore supply bases. By examining the factors influencing the choice of supply base and their respective advantages, companies can make informed decisions that contribute to their overall success in a competitive global market.</jats:p>"

This study examines how capability factors (readiness, response, and recovery) and risk factors (technological, organizational, and environmental) interact to influence the resilience of the green building supply chain, using a third-order partial least squares structural equation model. The results indicate that response capability and technological risk significantly impact resilience, while readiness capability mitigates organizational and environmental risks. The study suggests three strategies to enhance supply chain resilience: strengthening readiness capabilities and increasing resistance to organizational or environmental risks. The findings provide green building project managers with practical insights and tools to make informed decisions that improve supply chain resilience.</jats:p>",

China is facing severe labor supply problems because of the aging population. Moreover, people who are middle-aged and seniors play a significant role in Chinese labor market. The paper will focus on studying labor participation and the labor hours of middle-aged and older adults. Meanwhile, public health insurance is one of the focuses of this research. Nowadays, there is a significant public health insurance named New Rural Cooperative Medical insurance (NRCMI), which has been implemented for many years. It aims to support the health status of people who are middle-aged and seniors. After a series of calculations and studies, it shows that NRCMI has great effects on labor decisions of people in middle-aged and seniors. NRCMI can improve the labor participation by 11.6 percentage points, and it can also increase the labor hours by 239.343 hours. Therefore, NRCMI has a tremendous impact on China's labour supply, and the government should increase the promotion of NRCMI and ensure the full implementation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains (SCs) serve many sectors that are, in turn, affected by e-commerce which rely on the make-to-order (MTO) system to avoid a risk in following the make-to-stoke (MTS) policy due to poor forecasting demand, which will be difficult if the products have short shelf life (e.g., refrigeration foodstuffs). The weak forecasting negatively impacts SC sectors such as production, inventory tracking, circular economy, market demands, transportation and distribution, and procurement. The forecasting obstacles are in e-commerce data types that are massive, imbalanced, and chaotic. Using machine learning (ML) algorithms to solve the problem works well because they quickly classify things, which makes accurate forecasting possible. However, it was found that the accuracy of ML algorithms varies depending on the SC data sectors. Therefore, the presented conceptual framework discusses the relations among ML algorithms, the most related sectors, and the effective scope of tackling their data, which enables the companies to guarantee continuity and competitiveness by reducing shortages and return costs. The data supplied show the e-commerce sales that were made at 47 different online stores in Egypt and the KSA during 413 days. The article proposes a novel mechanism that hybridizes the CatBoost algorithm with Dingo Optimization (Cat-DO), to obtain precise forecasting. The Cat-DO has been compared with other six ML algorithms to check its superiority over autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), long short-term memory (LSTM), deep neural network (DNN), categorical data boost (CatBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and LSTM-CatBoost by 0.52, 0.73, 1.43, 8.27, 15.94, and 13.12%, respectively.

Following market disruptions in March 2020, borrowers with jumbo loans saw significantly tighter credit supply conditions relative to borrowers with conforming loans. As a result, jumbo borrowers were 50 percent less likely to refinance and when they refinanced they borrowed 4-6 percent less than counterfactual borrowers facing looser credit conditions. The reduction in borrowing may have been caused by both an increase in the price and a change in a non-price mechanism, a decline in the availability of cash-out refinances. Decomposing the total effect into a price and cash-out channel, I find that that the cash-out channel accounts for two to three times as much of the decline as the price effect, and together both explain 70-80 percent of the total decline. This suggests that non-price mechanisms can be least as important as prices in clearing credit markets, a fact which is not adequately explained by current models of credit markets.</jats:p>"

This study seeks to examine the moderating role of technological capability on the relationship between E-procurement and organizational performance in oil and gas industry.\r\nMethodology: The study adopted a descriptive and exploratory study design. Quantitative approach was adopted to examine and determine the modern phenomenon between the variable: E-procurement, organizational performance and technological capability in the oil and gas industry. Simple random sampling and purposive sampling techniques were used. A sample size of 106 was used. Quantitative data from questionnaires was collected and processed and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 25) for accuracy. Factor analysis and structural equation modelling was run to examine the relationship among the study variables set out in the objectives.\r\nFindings: Findings show moderately significant relationship between e-procurement and organizational performance in the oil and gas industry, which means that as e-procurement increases, organizational performance is also likely to increase. Furthermore, findings show that there is statistically significant moderate relationship between technological capability and organizational performance in the oil and gas industry. The study concluded that, interaction between technological capability and e-procurement does not significantly influence the strength or direction of the relationship between e-procurement and organizational performance.\r\nUnique Contribution to Theory, Policy and Practice: The study recommends that, managers should prioritize developing their technological skills in order to increase organizational performance.</jats:p>"

However, this purchasing method, which lacks the capability to determine the order quantity, increases cost risks for reagent suppliers due to extended payment cycles between hospitals and suppliers. This paper aims to optimize the medical supply chain management under the pay-per-use model through process reengineering of the settlement mechanism and demand forecasting. It proposed the Supply, Processing, and Distribution (SPD) model for the healthcare supply chain and conducted an analysis of issues within the hospital settlement model. The paper then used the BP neural network to forecast hospital demand under the pay-per-use model, which was validated using data from Hospital A. The model fit was 0.97 for the training set and 0.87 for the test set, demonstrating the feasibility of reengineering the pay-per-use model and the effectiveness of the demand forecasting model. This study investigates how to optimize the pay-per-use model in the healthcare supply chain with the goal of reducing supplier inventory costs. It focusses on cash flow issues caused by suppliers' inability to accurately forecast the demand for hospital reagents. It provides practical as well as theoretical insight on how to improve the efficiency of healthcare supply chains.</jats:p>"

It fully covered the control of physical, chemical, and biological contamination within the recommended standard range from river water to irrigation water. Initially, to deal with the corresponding contamination levels, the performance of the combination of coagulation and flocculation, rapid sand filter, ultrafiltration, and ultimately reverse osmosis methods were examined. By optimizing the pre-treatment section of coagulation and flocculation with jar tests, more than 90% removal of colloidal materials was achieved. Following the optimization of pre-treatment section, an 18.7% reduction in water consumption was observed. Finally, through the examination of the irrigation system and monitoring of both physical and biological contaminations, alongside the optimization of the greenhouse's recycled water disinfection system, preventive measures inhibiting the irrigation system clogging were implemented. The findings of the current research exhibited the removal of over 99% of these contaminations yielding a 99% reduction in the occurrence of irrigation system clogging.</jats:p>",

Considering environmental concerns, electric vehicles (EVs) spearhead the move towards green mobility. Niti Aayog (Indian Government) has envisaged an “EV only” scenario by 2030. Two wheelers, with almost 80% of the market share of the Indian automobile industry, will provide the primary thrust for EVs. The holistic sustainability of the Indian EV two-wheeler industry will depend upon its vendor partnerships and processes, which are examined in this paper through a systematic review of the literature available from all known sources. This study, after reviewing over 165 papers apart from government and independent reports, also explores how sustainability and allied topics like green supply chain management in business decision making promotes efficiency, controls expenditure, enhances customer delight, increases sales and market share, optimizes risk management strategies and promotes profitability. Considering the restricted availability of the literature on the Indian automobile industry in general, and specifically on the Indian EV or EV two-wheeler industry, this work will help in bringing focus on this area of fast-burgeoning importance and will pave the way for the establishment of a conceptual framework for research.</jats:p>"

Challenges of local products are not only from qualities and quantities as per industrial demands, but also from sustainable principles that start applying by Upstream Oil &amp; Gas Industry. The implementation of sustainable principles is very important to ensure that Indonesia can fulfil the target of energy transition as mentioned on the Paris Agreement in 2015. In this moment, Indonesia oil and gas industry and supported by the Government of Indonesia already prepared the roadmap to support the energy transition by reducing emissions, applying new technology for CCU/CCUS, and emphasizing the crucial role of the supply chain sustainability. As part of supply chain management (SCM) sustainability principles, the government and industry need to prepare the local companies to support the energy transition target. The landscape of the Indonesian petroleum industry, focusing on specific regulations for local content improvement and their alignment with supply chain sustainability in the energy transition era. Indonesian oil and gas companies operate under Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) with the government. The PSC has agreed to target local content with the government during exploration and operation. To achieve this, local companies must enhance their capabilities through research and development (R&amp;D) to remain competitive and support decarbonization strategies without compromising local content and emissions reduction initiatives. This paper discusses, according to the research, local companies have limitations to get access of new technologies that will be implemented during energy transition era. Therefore, collaborative work among Government and Industries is required to ensure local companies can be ready by the time the energy transition begins. Overcoming the challenge and limitation, this paper belief that collaboration among Government, Oil &amp; Gas Company, Supporting Industries (Vendor), Financial and Education Institution in Indonesia during the energy transition has pivotal role. By fostering collaboration, embracing sustainability principles, and investing in research and development, stakeholders can create a thriving ecosystem that supports local economic growth and environmental stewardship. Successful development programs through collaboration are ultimately expected to enhance job creation for Indonesian citizens, addressing the needs of the country with large population like Indonesia.</jats:p>"

By examining current literature, the study highlights AI's potential to automate and revolutionize manufacturing operations, enhancing efficiency, resilience, and transparency. The study's conceptual framework is grounded in three primary pillars: AI-driven supply chain optimization, predictive analytics, and machine learning-based quality control, each contributing to the overall enhancement of manufacturing efficiency, resilience, and transparency. The methodology involves a comprehensive review of scholarly articles, reports, and academic publications, focusing on AI applications in predictive maintenance, quality control, and supply chain optimization. The analysis reveals significant improvements in operational efficiency and resilience due to AI, alongside concerns about biases, transparency, and implementation issues. The findings confirm AI's transformative potential in manufacturing but emphasize the necessity for ongoing supervision, regular audits, and the development of AI models capable of detecting and rectifying operational anomalies. The study proposes creating jobs such as AI Manufacturing Oversight Officer (AIMOO), AI Manufacturing Compliance Officer (AIMCO), and AI Manufacturing Quality Assurance Officer (AIMQAO) to ensure responsible AI utilization, maintaining the integrity and efficiency of manufacturing operations while addressing implementation challenges. The review concludes that AI is promising for transforming manufacturing; however, careful implementation is crucial to uphold operational integrity and resilience. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to evaluate AI's long-term impact, focus on addressing implementation concerns, and ensure fair and transparent integration of AI technologies. These findings have significant implications for practice and policy, underscoring the need for robust frameworks and regulatory measures to guide the effective use of AI in manufacturing.</jats:p>"

The main purpose of the study is to substantiate the essence of international economic and political conflicts, as well as scientific and theoretical approaches to resolving the political conflict that is the root cause of the russian-Ukrainian war. Various methods were used in the research, including the comparative-historical method, the method of source analysis, as well as induction, deduction, synthesis and analysis. This made it possible to gain a deeper understanding of the essence of political and political-economic conflict, as well as to divide political-economic conflicts into conflicts of values, interests, and identification, determining their essential causes. An armed conflict that turns into a war is the most dangerous form of political conflict, as it causes a transition to destructive actions on the territory of the country, involves the involvement of a large number of participants and significant losses among the military and the civilian population. The historical and modern reality in Ukraine since 2014 is characterized by the presence of political and armed conflicts that arose as a result of serious contradictions that were not resolved within the framework of the post-Soviet system. It is because of this that armed, political, economic and inter-ethnic conflicts became more frequent in the 21st century. For a long time, domestic science believed that state power and politics were aimed at finding a balance of the interests of seizing natural, energy and human resources, which was supposed to completely eliminate the conflict. However, the authorities of Ukraine did not cope with the invasion of certain territories, which has been going on for more than eight years. The article analyzes the prerequisites and nature of a full-scale invasion of the territory of Ukraine as a political conflict, and suggests key ways to resolve it. The conclusion states that Ukraine's accession to the EU and NATO is a significant prospect for ensuring future guarantees of peace and protection against further or new invasion of the Russian Federation on our territory.</jats:p>"

The automobile industry in Pakistan is one of the most significant industrial sectors, contributing approximately 3% of the country’s GDP and PKR 50 billion. Previously, scholars have discussed the use of TQM practices in different contexts, but this topic has been investigated less in the automobile industry. Furthermore, there are gaps in the literature regarding the relationships among top management commitment, customer focus, supplier quality management, human resource management and supply chain performance (SCP). The current study was designed to measure the impact of total quality management practices (TQMPs) on SCP of the automobile industry in Pakistan. Quantitative research was conducted, and a survey-based questionnaire was administered using a random sampling technique. Data from 155 senior managers representing the outlets of the automobile industry in Pakistan were analyzed using Smart PLS 4. Top management, customer focus, supplier quality, and human resource management are significant antecedents of SCP in Pakistan's automobile industry. This research addressed gaps in the supply chain literature and contributed significantly to the body of knowledge. We recommend that policymakers and practitioners implement practices to advance the SCP of the automobile industry in Pakistan. The study has novelty as unexplored area in literature was discussed by its findings. Policy and managerial implications of this research are significant to contribute to literature.

This study comprehensively analyzes the groundwater quality of the El Moghra aquifer in Egypt's arid Western Desert, for its suitability for irrigation uses. Detailed hydrochemical analysis and advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, including geographic information systems, were employed to enhance spatial analysis and predictive accuracy. Various ML models, such as random forest, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were optimized using Bayesian optimization to predict the irrigation water quality index (IWQI) accurately. The evaluation incorporated visual and quantitative methods, alongside ranking analysis, to validate model effectiveness. Shapley Additive exPlanations feature importance analysis and a graphical user interface (GUI) model were developed based on the best predictive model. The results indicated that the groundwater quality is generally suitable for irrigation, with XGBoost showing the best performance, achieving a root mean square error of 5.602 and a determination coefficient (R²) of 0.872. Sodium concentration was identified as the most significant factor affecting the IWQI. The GUI facilitates easy prediction of IWQI, aiding agricultural water management and resource allocation within the region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Improved organizational performances and increased competitiveness have been linked to sustainable supply chain management as a strategic tool. In Nigeria, most manufacturing companies seems to be unaware of the importance of this tool in their supply chain processes. Some of their manufacturing outputs are threats to life's existence. Proper adoption of all sustainable practices will not only reduce the cost of production but will also increase business profitability. Purpose: The main objective of this study is to investigate guidelines or practices manufacturing companies in Nigeria must adopt to achieve sustainability in their supply chain management. In addition, to explore the relationship between the outcomes of sustainable supply chain management practices and business profitability among manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Methodology: The research design is a descriptive type. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire that was designed to address each of the research questions. Findings: The findings are presented in tables. It was shown that the general awareness of sustainable practices is a bit above average and the adoption of the practices was seen in varying degrees. Reverse logistics (37%), sustainable warehousing (75%), environmental purchasing (26%) sustainable transportation (4%). Discussions: Adoption of these sustainable practices has been seen to increase sales, improve the corporate image of the firm, and improve information sharing among all stakeholders. However, this adoption is still poor, which means that the manufacturing sector has yet to harness the concept of sustainability as an option for doing business right in the country.</jats:p>"

In the era of large-scale digitalization, the aviation IT industry is facing a number of challenges related to the combination of new distribution channels, social networks, Big data, cloud technologies, etc. One of the main challenges of the time is the need to solve the security problem when software components are distributed and operated in hybrid clouds, the providers of which may be independent from each other. The difficulty lies not only in defining and expressing the desired level of security in software, but also in how cloud services affect security assurances in the aviation industry.

When a drilling fluid is poorly formulated with deficient additives, various problems such as loss circulation of drilling mud usually occur during drilling operations and this cause deferments in oil and gas supply chain. The objective of this paper is to highlight the use of locally sourced environmentally friendly bio- additives (dried sugarcane husks, dried palm kernel fiber and dried tiger-nut husks) as bio-additives for the enhancement of the loss circulation properties of a water-based drilling mud to conventional drilling mud with sodium hydroxide pH enhancer. Nine water-based mud samples were prepared with seven of these samples having varying concentration of the bio-additives as loss circulation materials. The eighth sample contained only limestone but no bio-additives while the ninth sample labelled as the control had zero concentration of the bio-additives and limestone. Tests carried out were mud density using the Baroid mud balance, viscosity using rotary viscometer, gel strength using rotational viscometer, pH using electronic pH meter and mud filtration tests using API filter press multi-unit. The various results obtained were compared with the standards as provided by API. The nine water-based mud samples prepared with varying concentration of the bio-additives showed promising results for critical mud properties such as mud density - within the API acceptable range of 8.45 – 12.00 ppg - and other properties like the plastic viscosity, apparent viscosity, yield point, mud filtrate and mud cake thickness were within values preferred by the drilling engineers as they result to lower circulating pressure that facilitate drilling processes. This paper highlights how cheap, locally sourced, and environmentally friendly agricultural wastes can become resources in mud formulation, hence need to reduce the dependence on the use of the toxic and costly chemical additives thus safeguarding the environment at large. The organic nature of these additives makes it environmentally friendly having little or no effect on the subsurface formation.</jats:p>",

Effective risk reduction necessitates the identification of suppliers who are prone to delays and the precise prediction of future interruption. Accurately predicting availability dates is therefore a key factor in successfully executing logistics operations. By leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques, organizations can proactively identify high-risk suppliers, anticipate delays, and implement proactive measures to minimize their impact on manufacturing processes and overall SC performance. This study explores and utilizes various regression and classification ML algorithms to predict future delayed delivery, determine the status of order deliveries, and classify suppliers according to their delivery performance. The employed models include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Random Forest (RF) Classifier and Regression, Gradient Boosting (GB) Regression and Classifier, Linear Regression (LR), Decision Trees(DT) Classifier and Regression, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Based on real data, our experiments and evaluation metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) demonstrate that the ensemble based regression algorithms (RF Regression and GB Regression) provide the best generalization error and outperforms all other regression models tested. Similarly, Logistic regression and GB Classifier outperforms other classification algorithms according to precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. The knowledge obtained from this study could aid in the proactive identification of high-risk suppliers and the application of proactive actions to increase resilience in the face of unanticipated disruptions, in addition to increasing SC efficiency and decreasing manufacturing disturbances.</jats:p>",

This has contributed a lot of challenge to an effective operation of modern power systems worldwide. This paper, therefore, presents an alternative approach of the graph theory-based method, which provides a simple but efficient solution to supply-to-demand matching as well as the network usage allocation problems for a secure and reliable operation of power systems most especially, during critical outages. The problems are formulated from the approach of the basic circuit theory and network topology perspectives. An Allocation Factor (AF) matrix, which captures the structural interconnections of various system components such as network nodes and transmission lines, is developed. The Generator Allocation Factor (GAF) matrix, which has the capability of matching the generation to load as well as solving transmission usage allocation problem within the power network, is then formulated using the developed AF matrix. The study uses a simple IEEE 5-bus system and the application is also extended to the practical system of the Nigerian 28-bus. The results show that the approach has the capability of matching the supply to demand plus losses in an efficient manner. The results obtained show the merit of the approach in solving the supply-to-demand matching and network usage allocation problems, most especially during critical outages, for efficient transmission pricing by the market regulators.</jats:p>"

Moreover, there exists a certain percentage of consumers (mostly elderly people) who are not able to purchase online because they lack digital skills. Therefore, understanding the impact of the purchase channel preference and service level on pricing decisions is vital for the dual-channel supply chain management. Focusing on the channel preference and service level, we first develop an optimal pricing model containing centralized and decentralized decision-making for an online and offline retailer by deploying the Stackelberg game. We first develop a Stackleberg game to capture such a dual-channel supply chain with the offline channel preference and service level. Secondly, under centralized decision-making, we derive the optimal retail prices and obtain the optimal total profit. Thirdly, under decentralized decision-making, we obtain the optimal retail prices and optimal total profit as well. Moreover, extensive monotonicity properties when system parameters change are obtained. Relying on the theoretical results, firstly, we show that the improvement of the offline service level would lead to higher pricing of the commodities for both online and offline channels. From our numerical results, when the service level is improved, the offline and online optimal pricing increases by 47.5% and 31.1%, respectively, which may contradict the conventional belief that the improvement of one channel would harm another one. Secondly, we demonstrate that the benefit of improving the offline service level has a diminishing marginal effect. The numerical results show that when the current service level is low, the effectives of improving the service level is roughly five times that when the service level is high. This indicates that the investment in improving the offline service level should not be unlimited. Thirdly, we show that the pricing decision under centralized decision-making should be adopted with the existence of both the offline channel preference and offline service.</jats:p>"

Additionally,Apple achieved a 25% decrease in carbon emissions,amounting to an annual reduction of 1.2 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. On the economic front,the incorporation of recycled materials into the supply chain has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately $350 million,largely due to a 28% reduction in the procurement costs of essential materials like aluminum and copper. Moreover,the strategic modifications to production lines have yielded an average return on investment (ROI) of 20% per annum,alongside a 22% decrease in energy consumption per unit produced. These findings demonstrate the dual benefits of sustainability and economic efficiency,positioning Apple as a leader in sustainable supply chain practices.

Despite creating economic opportunities, these supply chains are problematic as they contribute to the exploitation of the intersectional vulnerabilities of the workers, leading to the violation of their labour rights and other human rights. As the post-growth ideas take root in the Global North, this chapter explores how the existing post-growth theories have addressed the issues of economic globalization and supply chains in the Global South. Against this backdrop, the chapter critiques the current state of labour rights within supply chains from a Global South perspective. Building on this critique, it develops an alternative vision of the labour rights and supply chains that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of the Global South, based on the model of differentiated degrowth.</jats:p>",

Importantly, we find that our Divisia specifications do not require expanding the model's information set with commodity prices or the real exchange rate for a resolution of the price puzzle.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fashion industry in Bandung cannot be separated from various risks that will disrupt its supply chain. For the supply chain to endure risks, the fashion industry should develop a Supply Chain Design Strategy (SC Design Strategy) so that the supply chain is resilient to possible risks. SC Design Strategyis the ability to recover from disruptions by developing responsive capabilities, through redundancy and flexibility. So, this research aims to find out what form of SC Design Strategyis currently being implemented by fashion industry entrepreneurs in Bandung so that it can be used to create approaches towards resiliency. Data collection techniques were carried out through observation and interviews with company owners, managers, and employees of the enterprises. Data analysis uses a scoring rubric technique to measure the company's condition. Based on the results, the sourcing strategy dimension is the dimension that is most widely applied by ten fashion industry business actors in Bandung. Business actors said that they implemented strict supplier selection indicators to produce good quality products from suitable raw materials. Few business actors implemented global sourcing indicators, especially about supplying raw materials from abroad.  In the redundant strategy dimension, most business actors use multi-sourcing indicators, namely alternative strategies for more than one supplier. For the flexible strategy dimension, several business actors use flexible transportation indicators to minimize transportation risks. Most business actors do not apply factory redesign indicators because most of them do not have their factories, so it will be hard to change the production system.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The previous version of the low-temperature nuclear heating reactor, rated at 200 MW (NHR200-II), was primarily dedicated to winter heating, hence limiting its applicability. Furthermore, the previous version of the steam generator within the secondary circuit was vertical and capable only of producing saturated steam. To expand its functionality, a novel superheated steam supply system has been integrated into the secondary circuit to generate superheated steam for an industrial park. This novel system comprises three crucial components: a preheater, a horizontal steam generator, and a superheater. The horizontal steam generator features effective fouling discharge, allowing the coolant in the secondary circuit to be softened water rather than the deionized water used in the previous vertical steam generator. NHR200-II comprises the primary, intermediate, and secondary circuits. The primary circuit operates via natural circulation under all operating conditions, accompanied by two passive residual heat removal systems designed to extract decay heat after reactor shutdown. These passive residual heat removal systems also rely on natural circulation, with reactor decay heat serving as the heat source and air-cooling towers acting as the cooling mechanism. However, the intermediate and secondary circuits are driven by pumps, generating superheated steam for industrial park use. The pressure in the intermediate circuit is slightly higher than that in the primary circuit, ensuring that no radioactivity would be released into the secondary circuit. The entire system is simulated by using RELAP5 code, achieving rated power conditions by employing design values. The heat transfer between tube and shell sides for the three important heat exchanger is modeled using the ‘Heat structure’, while a ‘Separator’ model is utilized atop the horizontal steam generator to separate water and vapor. Reactor core power adjustments are performed via the point reactor model, modified by introducing positive or negative reactivity through a logical control system. Additionally, a control system of the feedwater is implemented to regulate the mass flow rate within the secondary circuit, aiding in achieving different steady states with changing operational conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the feedwater control system in efficiently adjusting the mass flow rate of the secondary circuit. Consequently, the entire system can attain a different steady state following alterations in operational conditions. Moreover, the temperature of the secondary circuit’s superheated steam exceeds 30°C, with a void fraction reaches to 1.00, meeting the specified requirements of the industrial park. The secondary circuit’s mass flow rate aptly corresponds to variations in reactor core power, ensuring the establishment of a new stable operational state.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>аdhesion disease has become a widespread disease, which for years has maintained a tendency to constant growth, and remains one of the most complex and unsolved topical problems of the functional state of the abdominal cavity. At the moment, most changes in the functioning of the gastrointestinal tract are associated with a violation of the tissue barrier during the penetration of pathogenic types of microorganisms and absorption of toxic substances, which is one of the effects of biological factors on the intestine. Understanding the structure of the body, its morphological and functional features, the ability to understand the patterns of vital and pathological processes in various organs, tissues and the whole body. At the moment, the functional connections between the immune, nervous and endocrine links in the functioning of the tissues of the peritoneum and its components during the progressive adhesion process remain incompletely investigated. At the same time, it is also important to pay attention to the behavioral characteristics of the organism. Purpose of our investigation was to investigate the correlational relationships between the morphological indicators of the mesentery of the small intestine during the experimental adhesion process. The analysis of the relationship between the body weight and BMI of the animals of the experimental group with the morphological parameters of the adhesion formations (quantity and thickness) showed a high level of correlation, and confirms the influence of intensive processes of fibrin formation on the morphometric indicators of the experimental animals. Correlation analysis between the number of detected milk spots, the thickness of detected adhesions and the total number of lymphocytes, as well as PNA+-immunologically immature and SBA+B-lymphocytes at each observation period in the animals of the experimental group during the adhesion process showed the dependence of the thickness of fibrin formations and the number of immunocompetent cells, which can be characterized as a local immune response that determines the intensity of collagen formation by the serous membranes and affects the degree of adhesion formation. The revealed correlations between antigen-presenting cells, the area of ​​collagen fibers of the 1st and 3rd types, and the total number of lymphocytes, as well as PNA+-immunologically immature and SBA+-B-lymphocytes at each observation period in the animals of the experimental group during the adhesion process, indicate the morphogenetic function of lymphocytes against the background of the growth of the protein-synthesizing function of fibroblasts, which leads to an increase in the synthesis of collagen and other components of the connective tissue matrix. On the 14th and 21st days of the study, correlations were established between the number of antigen-presenting cells and the area of ​​collagen fibers of the 1st and 3rd types at each observation period in the animals of the experimental group during the adhesion process. The presence of these correlations indicates that the morpho-functional state of the SALC lymphoid tissue associated with the serous membranes of the peritoneum is determined by the activation of one or another link of immunity. After an antigenic impact on the body, there are shifts in the direction of activation of the population of B1-lymphocytes of the mesentery of the small intestine and B2-lymphocytes, which changes the structure of the tissue barrier of the peritoneum and affects the general state of the body.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Resilience is a topic that has recently emerged concerning the basics of the construction project supply chain and we can consider it as a response to disruption in the supply chain of the project. Disruption also is an unavoidable reality in today’s complex and dynamic construction supply chain, the occurrence of which can cause irretrievable damages to the system, such as financial losses. Successful companies seek to minimize disruption and maintain adequate supply chain performance before disruption occurs, rather than looking for costly and challenging post-disruption solutions. This paper covers this gap by proposing a scenario-based mixed integer-programming model aiming to minimize logistics costs and delays, while scheduling projects to address selecting the appropriate supplier at risk of disruption. So far, this quantitative view was not presented in discussions about disruptions in the project supply chain, therefore different scenarios are applied in the process to validate the model. To improve its resilience level, this model benefits from back-up suppliers’ strategy. This study focuses on providing the required materials for the project site in an emergency without incurring additional costs using a back-up supplier. Results reveal the model’s suitability in confronting the unavailability of a supplier due to disruption.</jats:p>",

This strategy was developed using an embedded single case study on an end-to-end broiler chicken supply chain in Riau Province, Indonesia. The three distinct data collection methods were in-depth semi-structured interviews guided by the Delphi principle, field observations, and document analysis. Subsequently, the data were meticulously coded and analyzed using NVivo 14 software through template analysis. The development of themes and sub-themes from the final template facilitated the construction of the ANP model, comprising four clusters with a total of 28 criteria. The results indicated that in the business actor and activity cluster, the end consumer criterion was the priority with a weighting value of 0.222. In the stakeholder cluster, the priority was the Halal Inspection Agency (HIA) criterion with a weighting value of 0.178. Meanwhile, the business actors’ awareness of halal integrity assurance criterion had a weighting value of 0.217 in the barriers and challenges to adopting a halal traceability system. The criterion lean knowledge management process (LKM) for all supply chain actors is the priority for cluster strategy to strengthen halal integrity with weighting value of 0.338. This study showed the importance of upholding halal integrity within food supply chains, which are becoming increasingly complex.</jats:p>"

The IO model can quantify the virtual water content of agricultural and industrial products, as well as other services involved with the economy. Based on the findings of this study, the national water footprint (NWF) has increased in economic sectors over the studied years, with the highest footprint in the agricultural sector. Iran has been a net importer of virtual water due to importing more products than exports during 2001 and 2016. In addition, the commercial balance of virtual water has increased over these years. The results show that Iran's NWF is increasing rapidly, while the water footprint per capita and biological water capacity are decreasing. This indicates that the country is experiencing significant water stress due to the excessive and uncontrolled withdrawal of water resources, more than the limits of sustainable development. To address this issue, policymakers need to pay special attention to the virtual water trade in terms of integrated water resources management.</jats:p>",

To this end, the existing literature is categorized according to the nature of the disruptive event (risk or disaster), the event formulation, the structure of SC network (SC/CLSC), the source of the disruptive event, the decision‐making level (strategic, tactical or operational), the aim of risk/disaster management (viability–sustainability) and the relevant treatment methods. The target of this literature taxonomy process is threefold: (a) literature analysis with respect to risk and disaster management in SCs; (b) the formulation of a framework for selecting the most suitable treatment policies to manage risk/disaster events at strategic, tactical and operational levels, with the aim of achieving transition to viable SC networks; and (c) the codification of a methodological approach when developing models for achieving viability. The latter is introduced by proposing a dynamic model as an exemplary model to explain the state evolution of an SC network governed by dynamics subjected to viability constraints and, also, to reveal regulatory feedback mechanisms to achieve desired states.</jats:p>"

The 2001 WTO membership of China changed global trade, investment, production, and market behaviour. This mixed-method study examines China's WTO accession's many effects quantitatively and qualitatively. In a 2001–2022 dataset, a VAR model shows dynamic variable interdependencies. Stock market returns (SMR), volatility (VOL), interest rates (IR), and inflation rates spread economic shocks across interconnected markets in this model. VAR shows financial volatility and how past stock market returns affect future markets. For context, the study uses qualitative data from 100 policy documents, trade agreements, company reports, and 50 in-depth interviews with policymakers, industry experts, and business leaders. Complex feedback mechanisms in financial markets show that past stock market returns statistically affect future volatility and returns. Regional economic shocks affect stock markets worldwide, demonstrating global financial integration. China's changing role in the global economy is explained by quantitative financial analysis and qualitative policy and industry insights. This study examines China's policy shift's multi-layered effects on markets, supply chains, and financial systems, unlike previous trade flow or FDI studies. These findings can help policymakers and business leaders, especially in emerging markets, design strategic reforms to boost economic resilience, attract sustainable FDI, and manage supply chain realignments. The study recommends forward-looking infrastructure investments and adaptive economic policies to capitalize on China's economic transformations and trade dynamics for long-term growth, stability, and competitiveness.</jats:p>"

Although estimates suggest that the current production system can provide enough food and nutrients for everyone, equitable distribution remains challenging. Understanding global nutrient distribution is vital for addressing disparities and creating effective solutions for the present and future. This study analyzes global nutrient supply changes to address inadequacies in certain populations using the existing DELTA Model<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>, which uses aggregates of global food production to estimate nutrient adequacy. By examining the 2020 global food commodity and nutrient distribution, we project future food production in 2050 needs to ensure global adequate nutrition. Our findings reveal that while some nutrients appear to be adequately supplied on a global scale, many countries face national insufficiencies (% supply below the population reference intake) in essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins A, B12, B2, potassium, and iron. Closing these gaps will require significant increases in nutrient supply. For example, despite global protein supply surpassing basic needs for the 2050 population, significant shortages persist in many countries due to distribution variations. A 1% increase in global protein supply, specifically targeting countries with insufficiencies, could address the observed 2020 gaps. However, without consumption pattern changes, a 26% increase in global protein production is required by 2050 due to population growth. In this study, a methodology was developed, applying multi-decade linear convergence to sufficiency values at the country level. This approach facilitates a more realistic assessment of future needs within global food system models, such as the DELTA Model<jats:sup>®</jats:sup>, transitioning from idealized production scenarios to realistic projections. In summary, our study emphasizes understanding global nutrient distribution and adjusting minimum global nutrient supply targets to tackle country-level inequality. Incorporating these insights into global food balance models can improve projections and guide policy decisions for sustainable, healthy diets worldwide.</jats:p>"

The study aimed to assess how Sustainable Supply Chain in Ghana's Pharmaceutical Sector influences firm performance within the upstream industry.\n \nMethod: The study was conducted in the accessible southern part of Ghana, known for its concentration of pharmaceutical companies. Specifically, individuals involved in procurement and supply chain activities within these companies were selected for inclusion in the study. The study used quantitative methods to explore Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) in the upstream pharmaceutical industry. Out of 2000, 210 managers were randomly sampled, and SPSS Version 26 was employed for structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis.\n \nResults and Conclusion: The study found that there was a significant relationship between SSCM and supply chain performance (SSCMP). Besides, the study found moderation impact between Top Management Commitment (TMC) and SSCM and SSCMP respectively.  Pharmaceutical companies should not solely focus on economic performance; rather, strategic efforts and policies must prioritize sustainability. Top management commitment is crucial for enhancing supply chain performance. Their dedication ensures the integration of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) with strategic objectives, embedding sustainability across the entire supply chain, from procurement to distribution.\n \nResearch Implication: Top management should drive sustainability strategy, integrating it into operations and fostering a culture of sustainability for robust Sustainable Supply Chain Management in the pharmaceutical upstream sector.   \n \nOriginality/Value: the study leverages on the theoretical understanding of upper echelon theory to provide empirical evidence on the impact of top management commitments on performance of supply chain which hitherto has been scarcely deployed in recent years.</jats:p>"

Senior management's role in shaping procurement practices is critical, as their support and strategic direction significantly affect the efficiency and effectiveness of supplier selection. The study explores how managerial commitment moderates the relationship between supplier selection and procurement performance. The research employs a comprehensive analysis based on data collected from 185 respondents, including operations managers, procurement officers, risk managers, supply chain managers, and warehouse managers from manufacturing companies in Ghana. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and descriptive statistics, the study examines various dimensions of supplier selection, senior management support, and procurement performance. Findings reveal that senior management's involvement positively influences procurement performance by emphasizing key criteria in supplier selection, such as financial status, quality systems, and delivery capabilities. Specifically, factors like supplier reputation, pricing, and geographic location were identified as critical for effective supplier selection. Senior management's support for procurement practices, including regular performance evaluations and sustainability assessments, was also found to significantly impact procurement outcomes. However, while senior management support enhances procurement performance, it does not moderate the relationship between supplier selection and performance. The results suggest that while strategic management and support are crucial, they operate independently of the supplier selection process in affecting procurement performance. This study provides valuable insights for organizations seeking to improve procurement practices by highlighting the importance of both strategic supplier selection and robust senior management support. Recommendations include enhancing senior management's role in procurement strategies and focusing on critical supplier performance criteria to optimize procurement outcomes.</jats:p>"

Identifying areas at risk of flooding has become crucial to reducing this risk and protecting lives and property. Various softwares are used to identify areas at risk of flooding. In this work, a comparative study was made between two well-known software in flood modeling, HEC-RAS 2D and IBER 2D. The comparison included water depth, flow velocity, and the extent of the flood risk areas of El Bayadh City in Algeria for the return periods 50, 100, and 1,000 years. Despite the existence of some differences in the results of the water depths and the flow velocities compared, the results showed a good agreement between the two softwares. The HEC-RAS software gave higher values than the IBER software for three return periods in estimating water depth, and the IBER provided higher values than HEC-RAS in flood velocity estimation. The results of the flooded areas are almost identical, and the relative deviation of the compared areas varies between 1 and 3%. A flood risk map was produced to identify areas most vulnerable to flooding. This map can be used to help mitigate the risk of flooding.</jats:p>",

We propose two pricing models to examine the strategies of information disclosure and pricing within the live‐streaming supply chain. One model revolves around the agency framework, wherein the manufacturer determines the price while the streamer decides the level of information disclosure. The other model pertains to a self‐implementing framework, wherein the manufacturer determines both the level of information disclosure and the price. To evaluate the robustness of our findings, we extend our models to encompass three significant scenarios: (i) the platform involvement model, where a live‐streaming support platform becomes part of the supply chain; (ii) the fixed price model, which externalizes the manufacturer's pricing decision; and (iii) the dual‐channel operations model. Our analysis reveals that the cost associated with information disclosure impacts the streamer's profits in a nonlinear manner within the agency model. Interestingly, expanding the revenue‐sharing parameter does not invariably favor the manufacturer. Moreover, we observe that none of the live‐streaming sales models exhibits a clear advantage over the others. Additionally, we demonstrate that the platform's involvement limits the manufacturer's ability to utilize the agency model for live‐streaming sales. In situations with fixed pricing, the manufacturer is advised to disclose more production information during live‐streaming sales.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radical geopolitical and geoeconomic transformations in the global economy are disrupting established economic ties and traditional routes of global commodity movement. Rapid technological changes, accelerated development of e-commerce, omnichannel strategies, and the sharing economy have contributed to increased demand for automation, robotization, and digitalization of logistics activities and supply chain management. These factors prompt the renewal and adaptation of the competencies set for logistics managers and, consequently, academic educational programs. The aim of the conducted research was to identify the impact of Industry 5.0 on the formation of the logistics personnel competency system, and to develop a new competency model considering rapid changes in technology, market conditions, consumer sentiments, and the regulatory environment. The research methodology combines theoretical analysis (theoretical generalization, analysis and synthesis, comparison, and grouping) with empirical research. As a result, existing and future trends in the logistics industry development were summarized, a comparative analysis of the competencies of logistics managers and engineers was conducted, and a tendency for their convergence under the influence of the transition from Industry 4.0 to 5.0 was identified. The developed comprehensive competency model for logistics managers in the context of Industry 5.0 allowed for improving the content and structure of the \"Logistics\" educational program at the National Technical University of Ukraine, determining the ratio between general and professional skills, the set of necessary tools and technologies required for developing and implementing logistics solutions, stimulating students to improve their knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as orienting them towards effective professional activity in the future. Future research is reasonable to focus on evaluating new technological courses' effectiveness, developing interdisciplinary teaching methods, integrating practical experience, incorporating sustainability and social responsibility, and creating innovative assessment techniques to ensure curricula meet evolving labor market demands and prepare students for real-world challenges and new Industry 5.0 requirements.</jats:p>"

No additional discounts were offered by vendors with current standing orders. CCBC signed a supplier agreement with a national contracting service to purchase laboratory supplies at wholesale pricing. As such, the majority of CCBC’s frequently ordered supplies will be purchased at a significant cost reduction, with savings of approximately 13% from the annual supply budget. Additionally, CCBC will be able to consolidate ordering supplies through one main vendor, streamlining the ordering process and providing better preventative measures from backorders and shortages.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Discussion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Many cord blood banks can receive discounts on supplies through connections with a larger hospital or university system through bulk ordering. CCBC is unique in that it is a standalone public cord blood bank that is not connected to a larger hospital or university. By joining a national contracting agency, CCBC now has access to larger discounts on supplies through group purchasing discounts. After the annual membership fee, we are anticipating roughly 13% in savings compared to budget.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The utilization of digital technology has resulted in the Rise of a new supply chain management system known as the digital supply chain. Many parties believe that digital supply chain has several opportunities for companies, however, a number of researchers argues that the dependence on digital technology in the worldwide supply chain is accompanied by substantial obstacles. Therefore, this study intends to understand the opportunities and difficulties of digital supply chain and identify the future research agenda in this research area to develop better digital supply chain concepts and implementations. This research conducted systematic literature review through content analysis based on five dimensions in the SCOR model, which is plan, source, make, deliver, and return dimension. The analysis in this research finds that digital supply chain can enhances demand forecasting and product development in plan dimension, enables supplier selection and procurement automation in source dimension, facilitates smart and additive manufacturing in make dimension, optimizes inventory management, order management, transportation and logistics management in deliver dimension, as well as supports closed loop supply chain or circular economy in return dimension. However, the lack of infrastructure, policy, and coordination, along with financial, technical, and technological barrier, has become the common challenges of digital supply chain. Cybersecurity issue is also another main issue of the digital supply network. Through this analysis, the future research agenda can finally be taken in this research.</jats:p>"

Data were collected from 150 respondents, namely, farmers, traders, distributors, and retailers through a questionnaire survey. The results showed that the average order cycle time was seven days, with a logistics cost of IDR 1,500.00 per kilogram. The product loss rate reached 10%, indicating that there were problems in handling and storage during distribution. Product quality was considered quite good with an average score of 3.8, while customer satisfaction was at a score of 3.7. Statistical analysis showed that logistics costs and product loss rates were negatively related to customers’ satisfaction, while product quality had a positive relationship. SWOT analysis identified that infrastructure improvements, training, and implementation of information technology were needed to improve supply chain performance. Key recommendations are to improve road infrastructure, training for farmers, and product diversification. By implementing these recommendations, it is hoped that the efficiency and effectiveness of the potato supply chain in North Sumatra can be improved, which will ultimately improve farmers’ welfare and product competitiveness in the market.\n\nKeywords: Performance measurement, supply chain, potato, North Sumatra</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management as a discipline has attracted both international and national business attention. The current global and local business environment is challenging. The challenges are brought about by global and local economic and political environment, stiff competition and technological disturbances. Amidst such challenges, investigation of supply chain strategies and supply chain performance in organizations has become imperative. Reviewed studies link supply chain management strategies and supply chain performance though limited studies have been done about public universities in Western Kenya. The main purpose of this study was therefore to establish the effect of outsourcing on the supply chain performance of public universities in the Western Kenya region. The study was anchored on resource-based theory. The correlational research design was adopted to guide the study. The study adopted a census approach to data collection; all 82 staff in procurement and finance departmentsin the ten public universities in Western Kenya took part in the study. The data was collected by use of questionnaires and scheduled interviews. A multi- model approach was adopted. The validity of the study was assessed by the use of expert opinion and the reliability of the research instrument was assessed by undertaking a pilot test where a threshold of 80% Cronbach’s statistics was applicable. Data analysis utilized descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and structural equation modelling methods. Quantitative findings were presented using tables while qualitative results were  presented in verbatim reports and discussed. The study will offer insights to scholars, professionals in the procurement discipline and policy makers among others.</jats:p>",

Initially, 17 Industry 4.0 technological enablers were selected based on an extensive literature review of sustainable supply chains and evaluated through Systems and Information Processing theories. Using the fuzzy Delphi method, these enablers were then narrowed down to 14 relevant ones. The reliability of these enablers was assessed by measuring their internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha (<jats:italic>α</jats:italic>) and McDonald's omega (<jats:italic>ω</jats:italic>). The fuzzy Decision‐Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was then used to demonstrate that blockchain, cybersecurity, big data, and artificial intelligence (AI) are the most prominent and influential enablers for enhancing transparency in a sustainable supply chain. Additionally, the cause–effect relationship of other key enablers provides evidence for a feasibility study that links sustainability with transparency across the supply chain. These identified Industry 4.0 technological enablers can assist external stakeholders and policymakers in improving transparency and advancing sustainable supply chain practices.</jats:p>",

Namun, saat ini dalam melakukan pemesanan barang terdapat total biaya cukup besar untuk persediaan obat. Besarnya biaya persediaan tersebut diakibatkan karena frekuensi pemesanan yang cukup tinggi. Saat ini perusahaan menggunakan metode lot for lot dimana pemesanan dilakukan hanya untuk memenuhi satu periode saja. Penggunaan metode lot for lot tersebut masih menyebabkan tingginya total biaya persediaan karena tingginya frekuensi pemesanan yang dilakukan oleh perusahaan. Pada penelitian ini dilakukan perbandingan antara metode lot for lot dengan metode algoritma Wagner-Within. Tujuan perbandingan tersebut adalah untuk mengetahui manakah metode yang tepat untuk menciptakan total biaya persediaan yang lebih optimal, ekonomis dan efisien. Penggunaan algoritma Wagner-Within ini menggunakan perhitungan dengan memilih periode pemesanan terbaik sehingga biaya seperti pembelian dan penyimpanan dapat dioptimalkan menjadi lebih ekonomis. Berdasarkan hasil perhitungan algoritma Wagner-Within, frekuensi pemesanan mengalami penurunan dengan jumlah kuantitas pemesanan bertambah. Total biaya persediaan dengan menggunakan algoritma Wagner-Within sebesar Rp 2.410.200 lebih ekonomis dibandingkan dengan menggunakan metode lot for lot perusahaan sebesar Rp 4.800.000 sehingga adanya penghematan menggunakan algoritma Wagner-Within sebesar Rp 2.389.800 atau lebih hemat 50%.</jats:p>"

The utilisation of The Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and the digital transformation of supply chains is a pivotal step today towards enhancing their competitiveness and their supply chain performance and being able to follow the supply chains of the future. However, implementing them alone is not enough; new ways to get the most benefit from them must be inquired. The combined utilisation of certain industrial revolution technologies boosts their efficiency and their contributions to companies and supply chains. This study investigated the correlational relationships of the eight most used The Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies in the supply chain context and determined the technologies with the highest relationship with each other and called them intertwined technologies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Coordination and integration among farms within agri-food chains are crucial to tackle the issue of fragmentation within the primary sector, both at the European and national level. The Italian agri-food system still complains about the need to aggregate supply to support market dynamics, especially for niche and quality products that characterize the Made in Italy. It is well known that the Italian agri-food sector is closely linked to the relationship between agriculture on one hand and culture/tradition on the other, which is reflected in the high number of quality products that have obtained EU PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) recognition. The development of vertical forms of coordination has found significant support in recent years from the integrated supply chain design approach, which is increasingly becoming an essential tool for implementing rural development policies. In this context, the study provides a comparison between companies that have joined the Integrated Supply Chain Projects of the Rural Development Program and those that have not applied. The aim is to highlight any differences in order to understand policy impact. The analysis is based on the Emilia-Romagna region Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data, and the sample consists of more than 2 thousand farms. The statistical analysis conducted compares treated and non-treated using the Welch-t-test for independent unmatched samples. The main results show higher values for treated farms when structural variables are analyzed, like the utilized agricultural area or the agricultural work unit. In general, higher balance sheet performances emerged for treated farms. In conclusion, this study shows that the Integrated Supply Chain Projects represent a worthwhile tool both to increase cooperation, food quality, and to enhance a competitive agricultural sector.</jats:p>"

The optimal Inventory pledge, as well as redemption decisions of the borrowing enterprise, are analyzed under the consideration of constant and changing redemption prices, respectively, and the effects of the main parameters on the optimal decisions are discussed. It found that (1) when the redemption price is constant, the borrowing enterprise's optimal quantity of inventory pledge increases as the initial inventory quantity increases or the redemption price decreases; (2) when the redemption price varies, the borrowing enterprise's optimal inventory redemption quantity decreases as the initial inventory pledge and the redemption price increase; and (3) the borrowing enterprise's redemption decision is affected by the previous period's redemption quantity and the actual sales quantity. The conclusions of this paper not only provide suggestions for SMEs to make inventory pledge financing decisions but also provide references for financial institutions to formulate relevant financing rules.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Given the increasing focus on sustainability and environmental policy constraints, companies are required to redesign their supply chains. This paper explores the optimization of a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network under both economic and environmental considerations. To achieve this, a bi-objective mixed integer linear model was developed. The proposed model identifies the optimal selection of CLSC facilities and manages both forward and reverse flows between them. The economic objective is reached by minimizing the total CLSC costs, while the environmental objective is satisfied by reducing CO2 emissions throughout the network. Products can be returned throughout their entire life cycle, which is why our model incorporates a dynamic aspect by considering product life cycle phases as time periods for the decision horizon. The model was tested through numerical experiments using a meta-heuristic approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm NSGA-II. This algorithm produces a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that balance both objectives effectively. The results showed good performance in terms of computational time and optimization. Pareto solutions offered various options for managers and decision makers aiming for a sustainable closed loop supply chain design.</jats:p>"

Modeling such systems effectively entails adopting an agent-based methodology. To enhance comprehension of water resource management in the Zarrineh-Roud Basin, northwest of Iran, a comprehensive hydrological-behavioral model has been utilized. This model consists of two primary components: An agent-based model (ABM) for simulating farmers’ decision-making processes and a water evaluation and planning (WEAP) model for simulating catchment area, cultivated area, and agricultural water consumption. Validation outcomes of the simulation model demonstrate precise estimation, particularly in the runoff estimation of the Nezam Abad hydrometric station, with statistically favorable correlation coefficient (R2) and Nash–Sutcliffe index (NS) values of 0.78 and 0.75, respectively. Analysis of different management scenarios indicates that with ample government funds, simultaneous implementation of ‘Education and increasing environmental awareness’ and ‘Alternative employment’ policies can significantly improve water resources conditions and income. In scenarios with limited financial resources, a combined implementation of ‘Water pricing,’ ‘Alternative employment,’ and ‘Education and raising environmental awareness’ emerges as the most effective strategy for managing water resources, albeit with a slight reduction in farmers’ income.</jats:p>",

During this period, Ministry of Health had been urged to reassess its hospital surge capacity in relation to predicted COVID patient load. Based on that, the increasing COVID-19 surge has warranted the rapid hospital facilities expansion in every aspect especially in facilities for Oxygen therapy.  Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka had to develop strategies for Medical Oxygen management to fulfill its rising demand. All those interventions were focused to improve the accessibility and availability of medical oxygen while preventing irrational use and wastage of Oxygen. The ultimate goal of spending such cost was to prevent morbidity and mortality due to poor access of oxygen.

To elucidate, four field trials with oil radish, spring vetch, saia oat, and winter rye CCs were conducted on typical loessial soil in Germany. Mineral fertilizer N dose was varied as second factor: zero (N0) and optimum dose (Nopt). Biomass characteristics before winter, soil mineral nitrogen content in spring (SMN), and sugar yield and total plant N content of SB were measured. The CC N effect (Neff), calculated as the difference in SB N uptake after CC minus bare fallow, was computed for the periods sowing-summer (July/August) and summer-harvest.\nOn average, sugar yield was decreased after rye and increased after vetch CC compared to bare fallow which was more pronounced under N0 than Nopt. In the period sowing-summer, characterized by a high SB N demand, Neff was close to 0 kg N ha–1 after rye and up to +30 kg N ha–1 after vetch. In contrast, Neff in summer-harvest was negative, amounting up to –80 kg N ha–1 after radish and rye. Regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between Neff in the period sowing-summer and the sugar yield difference between the cover crop treatments and bare fallow (R2 = 0.29). A multiple regression analysis (R2 = 0.68) indicated that high CC biomass combined with a large negative spring SMN difference between CC treatment and fallow caused a large yield penalty, which can be compensated for by elevated N fertilization. Moreover, CC management ensuring either a limited CC biomass or low SMN difference of CCs compared to fallow by e.g., later sowing, less vital CC species or early CC termination, will likely secure higher SB yield after CCs than fallow.</jats:p>",

The latter face stochastic demands, such as most real-world supply chains do nowadays, yielding significant model complexity. The studied problem is of high relevance for inventory management, inventory location, and supply chain network design-related literature, as well as for logistics and supply chain managers. The proposed optimization model minimizes the total costs associated with cycle inventory, safety stock, and stock-out-related events, considering a global inventory service level and differentiated order sizes for a fixed and known set of warehouses. Subsequently, the model is solved by employing the Newton–Raphson algorithm, which is developed and implemented assuming stochastic demands with a normal approximation. The algorithm reached optimality conditions and the convergence criterion in a few iterations, within less than a second, for a variety of real-world sized instances involving up to 200 warehouses. The model solutions are contrasted with those obtained with a previous widely employed approximation, where safety stock costs were further approximated and order sizes were optimized without considering stock-out-related costs. This comparison denotes valuable benefits without significant additional computational efforts. Thus, the proposed approach is suitable for managers of real-world supply chains, since they would be able to attain system performance improvements by simultaneously optimizing the global inventory service level and order sizes, thereby providing a better system cost equilibrium.</jats:p>"

The study employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the direct and moderating effects of Strategic Procurement and Corporate Governance on Competitive Advantage. Data collected from firms highlights that Strategic Procurement significantly enhances Competitive Advantage (coefficient = 0.37, p-value = 0.00), and Corporate Governance has a strong positive effect on Competitive Advantage (coefficient = 0.62, p-value = 0.00). Additionally, the interaction between Strategic Procurement and Corporate Governance positively moderates this relationship (coefficient = 0.10, p-value = 0.04), indicating that effective Corporate Governance amplifies the impact of Strategic Procurement on Competitive Advantage. Descriptive statistics reveal that firms generally demonstrate high levels of engagement in Strategic Procurement and Corporate Governance, with variability in implementation across different firms. The findings underscore the importance of integrating robust governance practices with strategic procurement to enhance competitive positioning. The research recommends strengthening procurement practices, reinforcing Corporate Governance, and aligning both strategies to leverage their synergistic effects. This approach can address variability in practices and support sustained competitive advantage in a dynamic market environment.</jats:p>"

As governments worldwide push for renewable energy to achieve their clean energy targets, the role of lithium has become even more critical in making the energy transition process sustainable and affordable. Given its ambition to build the world’s largest EV market, China has prioritized lithium in its industrial policy agenda. Drawing lessons from China, this chapter examines the required regulatory and policy frameworks to bolster the lithium supply chain. Implementing these strategies has influenced the country’s domestic policy and regulation, focusing on driving the uptake of EVs, establishing dominance over the lithium supply chain, and securing supplies of raw materials.

The results show that the size and brand visibility of buying firms, and their affiliation to high-risk industries increase the frequency of media coverage of suppliers’ environmental misconduct, while their affiliation to high-risk countries decreases the frequency of media coverage. In addition, companies can reduce media coverage by implementing proactive supply chain sustainability risk avoidance practices.

Managing and monitoring groundwater effectively is crucial in mitigating these challenges. Understanding groundwater resources and their distribution is necessary for effective management. The present study covers Doramba rural municipality of Nepal. It employed the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool integrated with remote sensing (RS) data and geospatial techniques to identify groundwater potential zones (GPZs). The parameters for analysis include drainage density, slope, rainfall, lineament density, land use/land cover (LULC), soil, geology, curvature, roughness, topographic wetness index, and topographic position index. These 11 thematic layers of the study area were prioritized using Satty's AHP method for the delineation of GPZs. The results classified the study area into very high, high, moderate, low, and very low groundwater potential classes, covering 26.71, 27.98, 46.61, 34.71, and 4.89 km2, respectively. The delineated map accuracy was confirmed with a 70.7% prediction rate based on the spatial distribution of 56 springs in the study area. The study's results can be applied to the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the study region and other areas with similar hydrogeological conditions.</jats:p>",

Namun, saat ini dalam melakukan pemesanan barang terdapat total biaya cukup besar untuk persediaan obat. Besarnya biaya persediaan tersebut diakibatkan karena frekuensi pemesanan yang cukup tinggi. Saat ini perusahaan menggunakan metode lot for lot dimana pemesanan dilakukan hanya untuk memenuhi satu periode saja. Penggunaan metode lot for lot tersebut masih menyebabkan tingginya total biaya persediaan karena tingginya frekuensi pemesanan yang dilakukan oleh perusahaan. Pada penelitian ini dilakukan perbandingan antara metode lot for lot dengan metode algoritma Wagner-Within. Tujuan perbandingan tersebut adalah untuk mengetahui manakah metode yang tepat untuk menciptakan total biaya persediaan yang lebih optimal, ekonomis dan efisien. Penggunaan algoritma Wagner-Within ini menggunakan perhitungan dengan memilih periode pemesanan terbaik sehingga biaya seperti pembelian dan penyimpanan dapat dioptimalkan menjadi lebih ekonomis. Berdasarkan hasil perhitungan algoritma Wagner-Within, frekuensi pemesanan mengalami penurunan dengan jumlah kuantitas pemesanan bertambah. Total biaya persediaan dengan menggunakan algoritma Wagner-Within sebesar Rp 2.410.200 lebih ekonomis dibandingkan dengan menggunakan metode lot for lot perusahaan sebesar Rp 4.800.000 sehingga adanya penghematan menggunakan algoritma Wagner-Within sebesar Rp 2.389.800 atau lebih hemat 50%.</jats:p>"

Platform Supply Chain Finance (PSCF) has emerged as a promising solution for financing issues among SMEs, with an added focus on integrating sustainability aspects. This study focused on a two-tier supply chain as its primary research topic to find strategies to enhance supplier financial viability and improve the efficiency and profitability of the main manufacturing enterprise. In this study, we establish three distinct hypotheses corresponding to the three models involving supplier and manufacturer participation, encompassing parameters such as production batch size, pricing, and supply chain profit. First, it examined financing decisions through the lens of core enterprise-led platform finance. Second, it applied the Stackelberg game theory to investigate financing decisions in three distinct modes: traditional finance, platform internal finance, and external platform finance. Suppliers, manufacturers, and banks can be seen as participants in a Stackelberg game. In this game, suppliers act as leaders, making production and procurement decisions first, while manufacturers and banks act as followers, adjusting their behavior based on the suppliers’ decisions. Finally, it performed a comparative analysis of decisions and supply chain efficiency across these modes. When the risk regulation cost coefficient falls below a certain threshold, suppliers are willing to set up their own PSCF and there is an optimal level of risk regulation effort within the interval (0, 1). We compare platform finance with traditional finance and find that the traditional finance model maximizes profits for suppliers, while the external financing model maximizes profits for manufacturers and the overall supply chain profit. Findings provide insights for platforms, suppliers, manufacturers, and banks to implement optimal financing and channel structures to increase their profits and promote the sustainable development of the financial supply chain. In addition, future research on blockchain platform models would be highly meaningful.</jats:p>"

This importance has become heightened as governing bodies such as the European Union pass traceability legislation in an effort to reduce Scope 3 emissions. Despite this heightened importance, few studies have explored the role of supply chain management software in achieving sustainability goals within the agribusiness sector. This article provides a current perspective on ongoing supply chain and logistics software issues that might restrict the effectiveness of sustainability reporting. We argue that agribusinesses may struggle to achieve sustainability targets effectively without proficiency in supply chain software. This research contributes to the field by offering a nuanced understanding of the technological competencies required for sustainability success in agribusiness. This article highlights the importance of developing and implementing advanced supply chain management software to address the need for enhanced sustainability practices within the agribusiness sector. Using interviews with pre-farmgate and post-farmgate agribusiness employees, we demonstrate how these software skills will likely impact sustainability reporting and governance. Managerial implications also include the need for targeted skill development to facilitate more sustainable agribusiness management practices, as mastering such technological competencies is critical for adhering to evolving global environmental standards.</jats:p>",

In this study, water resources input-output model, structural decomposition analysis (SDA) and structural path analysis (SPA) were constructed to decompose the driving factors of total water use in typical water-deficient provinces (Ningxia, Shanxi, and Henan) in China’s Yellow River Basin, to calculate their water use at each production stage and identify their key water-saving pathways. The results were as follows: (i) Water intensity had the most obvious impact on total water saving, resulting in efficiency improvements of 81.39%, 9.21%, and 78.45% for each province, respectively. The next factor was the final demand structure, which suppressed total water-saving efforts by 24.23%, 11.52%, and 113.12% in the respective provinces. (ii) The key water-saving paths in the typical water-deficient provinces of the Yellow River Basin were primarily centered around Sector 1. (iii) Water intensity had a strong water-saving effect on the key paths in the three provinces, with contribution rates of 100.42%, 59.02%, and 42.34% for Ningxia, Henan, and Shanxi, respectively. Final demand also contributed to water-saving in the key paths of Shanxi and Henan, with contribution rates of 35.06% and 28.23%, respectively. However, it inhibited water-saving efforts in the key paths of Ningxia, reducing it by 8.64%. Policy measures should be tailored to local conditions.</jats:p>"

The target population for this research comprised of personnel drawn from the agricultural industry in Limpopo Province. A non-probability purposive sampling method was employed to select 16 research participants. Primary data was gathered using a semi-structured interview guide. Atlas-ti 23 was utilized to analyze qualitative data. The results revealed that enabling factors were farmers’ collaboration, information sharing, and proper packaging. Factors hindering effective supply chain management processes included competition and inadequate resources. To achieve a competitive advantage, it is recommended that mills and storage facilities be located closer to suppliers and customers. In addition, training in change management and supply chain management (SCM) should be prioritised. Disaster response strategies must be established to address potential catastrophes and disease outbreaks. Marketing should include the provision of incentives and discounts as well as the adoption of more aggressive global marketing strategies to create viable export avenues for locally produced agricultural products.\n\nKeywords: Barriers, Enablers, Information Sharing, Packaging, Supply Chain</jats:p>"

With the rising prices of fossil fuels, nuclear energy has become economically competitive in supplying industrial steam. Laboratory measurements show that, under the condition of no leakage in the heat transfer tube of the steam generator, the concentration of radionuclides in the condensed water of the secondary loop steam is not different from that in the environmental water sample except for tritium. The IAEA technical report provides a two-cycle scheme of PWR supply steam for SAGD, which has the advantages of simple system, less process equipment, and high steam quality compared to the external steam supply scheme from the tertiary loop. Based on the drinking water standard, this article proposes to control the target value of radionuclide management for industrial application of secondary loop steam at 3.0 Bq/kg; Add a high-sensitivity radiation monitor on the steam generator blowdown line, and carry out technical renovation on the main steam pipeline N-16 radiation monitoring channel to provide timely, effective, and reliable monitoring of steam generator heat transfer tube leakage.

This study proposes a monthly hedging rule-based aggregation–decomposition model for optimizing a parallel reservoir system. The proposed model, which is an aggregated hedging rule for ecological flow (AHRE), uses external optimization to determine the total release of the reservoir system based on improved hedging rules—the optimization model aims to minimize water demand and ecological flow deficits. Additionally, inner optimization distributes the release to individual reservoirs to maintain equal reservoir storage rates. To verify the effectiveness of the AHRE, a standard operation policy and transformed hedging rules were selected for comparison. Three parallel reservoirs in the Naesung Stream Basin in South Korea were selected as a study area. The results of this study demonstrate that the AHRE is better than the other two methods in terms of supplying water in line with demand and ecological flow. In addition, the AHRE showed relatively stable operation results with small water-level fluctuations, owing to the application of improved hedging rules and a decomposition method. The results indicate that the AHRE has the capacity to improve downstream river ecosystems while maintaining human water use and provide a superior response to uncertain droughts.</jats:p>"

However, in the era of Industry 4.0, innovative technologies such as additive manufacturing technology (AMT) promise to enhance supply chain sustainability and address environmental concerns. This study investigates the potential of AMT in mitigating supply chain risks (SCRs) through a comprehensive risk assessment framework employing the best‐worst method (BWM). Our analysis encompasses 14 SCRs grouped into four SCR categories. Analysis of the outcome reveals that AMT adoption has the most significant impact in addressing risks related to lead time fluctuations, waste generation, supplier dependency, inventory‐related risks, and logistics‐related risks. Notably, the adoption of AMT emerges as a robust strategy, significantly impacting these critical risk areas, thereby aligning with the principles of supply chain sustainability, strategic environmental management, and fostering innovation in green technologies. The implications of this study offer invaluable insights for researchers and practitioners, emphasizing the pivotal role of AMT in addressing environmental risks and promoting sustainable supply chain practices. By understanding and leveraging the potential of AMT, businesses can strategically navigate supply chain challenges while embracing environmentally conscious approaches, driving positive impacts across industries.</jats:p>",

Digital technologies have the potential to perform a crucial role in enhancing these processes and achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Therefore, exploring the factors that link digital technologies and CSCs is essential. This study identifies and analyzes the critical success factors (CSFs) associated with integrating digital technologies in CSCs. The study utilized a grey Decision‐Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to identify and analyze CSFs. The initial set of CSFs was derived from existing literature and further refined based on expert opinions. The findings from the study reflect that the top five CSFs for linking digital technologies and CSCs were identified as the organizational commitment toward digitization, adoption of modern technologies, support from top administration toward digitization, adoption of contemporary business models, and data‐driven modernization toward CSCs. The study also revealed that out of the 24 identified CSFs, 11 were associated with the “causal group” while the remaining 13 were associated with the “effect group.” The integration of digital technologies in CSCs has been found to significantly enhance organizational effectiveness. However, there is a paucity of studies analyzing CSFs for linking digital technologies and CSCs. This study fills this research gap and contributes to the frame of knowledge in the domain of CSCs.</jats:p>",

Green supply chain management (GSCM) and green innovation have become key strategies for enterprises aiming for sustainable development. This study explores the impact of green supply chain practices on green innovation performance, with a focus on how knowledge management and organizational integration serve as mediating variables in this relationship. Grounded in the resource-based view (RBV) and knowledge-based view (KBV) theories, this research employs surveys and in-depth interviews with companies across various industries, combined with the analysis of structural equation modeling, to reveal the complex relationship between GSCM practices, knowledge management capabilities, levels of organizational integration, and green innovation performance. The results show that GSCM practices significantly enhance corporate green innovation performance through effective knowledge management and organizational integration. These findings enrich the theories of GSCM and green innovation, providing practical guidance for enterprises on how to enhance green innovation performance through strengthening knowledge management and organizational integration. Finally, this study discusses its limitations and suggests possible directions for future research, such as exploring the differences in findings across different industry backgrounds and examining other potential mediating or moderating variables.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Digitalization has significantly shifted technology-driven processes, products, services, and business models. This revolution envisions an era in which smart machines can transfer information to automatic manufacturing and production lines, evaluate and grasp specific production difficulties, and solve them with the minimum human intervention. Previously, this revolution was thought to disrupt the manufacturing sector mainly. Therefore, their integration and advancement would influence retailers, distributors, operational organizations, and service providers. This paper assesses how digital supply chains (DSC) are evolving to cater to the needs of Industry 4.0. This literature-based research approaches the broad topic of DSC using bibliometric techniques and network analysis tools using software like Gephi and VosViewer — our study’s data from 2002–2024 from journal databases like Scopus and Google Scholar. Aside from the demands and trends driving supply chain digitalization, digital transformation trends and the changing business environment add challenges and risks. Implementing IT technologies significantly impacts the whole supply chain in order to compete in today’s dynamic and competitive business environment. Increased openness across the whole process, from order dispatch to product end-of-life, depends on collaboration between suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers. Industry 4.0 promotes big data, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore, the urgency and importance of theoretical methods and empirical studies are needed to help businesses establish successful and long-lasting Industry 4.0 supply chains while quickly adapting to continuously changing markets and technology, which can be easily possible through the broad study of the previous study that has been conducted in the past. This study allows for a thorough review of the discipline’s current state and future directions, highlighting significant contributions, emerging trends, and areas requiring additional research that will be helpful for future researchers and policymakers. </jats:p>",

This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comparative analysis of HSC research in Indonesia and globally. Utilizing Scopus as the data source, 355 studies on halal supply chains published between 2008 and 2024 were analyzed. A comparative study was then conducted to evaluate the development of HSC research in Indonesia based on various categories, including the number of publications, subject areas, authors, keywords, citations, paper quartiles, institutional affiliations, research objects, methods, and themes. The findings reveal that while Indonesia has made significant progress in HSC research, the research is still tiny compared to its Muslim population. These results highlight the need for further investment and focus on HSC research in Indonesia to match its global potential.</jats:p>"

Then, non-renewable energy often produces greenhouse gases that are harmful to the environment. Therefore, solar energy can be used as an alternative to supply the energy required by the absorption refrigeration cycle (ARC). Parabolic trough collectors (PTC) can supply the required heat energy to the reboiler, whereas photovoltaic (PV) panels can supply the electrical energy to the pump of an ARC. To prove the feasibility of using solar energy as a more sustainable alternative, a simulation of the PTC and PV models is conducted, and the average energy generated by each model is obtained. The result of this research proved that Malaysia is a suitable location for the implementation of solar technologies as the amount of solar radiation is sufficiently high throughout the year.</jats:p>"

Identifying the contribution of factors to price dynamics is a difficult issue, however, at present, scientists and analysts from the field of macroeconomics have proposed some ways to solve it. Existing econometric methods often show results that are inconsistent with the views of analysts of a particular market. In this article, the authors test these techniques to analyze the dynamics of prices for coal in the domestic Russian market.<jats:bold>Materials and methods</jats:bold>. In this paper, we used the method for determining the contribution of factors to price dynamics based on a theoretical model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and a statistical approach to identifying shocks through the residuals of vector autoregression models. We use Rosstat data as a source of statistical data on the price level and JSC “Russian Railways” data as a proxy data source on the level of consumption and the contribution of Russian regions. The calculation was performed by using the R programming language, using the RStudio development environment.<jats:bold>Results. </jats:bold>The calculations show that upward price changes were more often associated with positive demand shocks; however, there are periods where supply factors contributed more to price growth. Therefore, for a few months in early 2020, prices rose largely due to the contribution of supply factors, and in early 2022 due to the contribution of demand factors. During 2021, when prices in some markets increased by two or more times, both positive demand shocks and negative supply shocks affected the Russian market.<jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> The results obtained from the calculations are mixed; however, they do not contradict general economic logic and are combined with a prior view about the impact of supply and demand factors on the domestic coal market. In addition, considering the compactness of this approach in terms of calculations and necessary data, we can talk about the possibility of applying this approach to market analysis on a permanent basis.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the need to understand urban water consumption has increased. Studies about this topic usually focus on either temporal or spatial dimensions, highlighting the relevance of spatial panel data analysis to conduct spatiotemporal modeling. This technique is useful for performing long-term analysis for water management and decision-making. Mexico City is an urban area where total water consumption and its spatiotemporal evolution are still unknown. We aim to model spatiotemporally measured water consumption during 2004–2022 at the neighborhood level through a spatial panel modeling approach, to select the best model to estimate total water consumption and compare it with urban water supply to Mexico City. Based on the spatiotemporal model coefficients, our estimation of total water consumption is 15.44 m3/s which is close to 18.52 m3/s, calculated by the local water utility. These values, compared to 30.05 m3/s of total urban water supply for the period 2004–2022, suggest the need to focus on promoting water management efficiency actions. Our contribution also addresses intra-urban patterns of water consumption, water users, and meter coverage in Mexico City neighborhoods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper seeks to provide an overview of the characteristics of the Rice Supply Chain (RSC) as studied across various research areas related to food security concerns. In agriculture, Rice Self-Sufficiency (RSS) level is an indicator of food security. However, food security encompasses broader factors such as availability, accessibility, stability, and utilisation. Given that rice holds significant importance as one of the world's staple foods, addressing the increasing demand for rice is seen as a crucial strategy to enhance national resilience against food insecurity. Inefficiencies in the rice supply chain can negatively impact production, storage, and distribution, consequently diminishing the RSS. In line with the growing attention to food security, there is a need to better understand the importance of sustaining the production of rice to cater to food security issues within broader academic research. Thus, this study has two main objectives: 1) to examine the characteristics and development of literature related to the RSC and, 2) to identify the thematic areas related to the RSC research and their connections to specific disciplines. To achieve this, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and bibliometric analysis of 165 journal articles listed in the Web of Science (WoS) and SCOPUS databases was conducted. This analysis revealed significant findings in research activity, highlighting the extensive and multidisciplinary nature of the studies. Study results indicate a gap in relational bibliometric studies within the field of RSC. Nevertheless, there is still potential for increased collaboration across disciplines and further investigation into how diverse RSC studies touch on food security issues for future reference.</jats:p>"

Supply chain management activities, including supply chain management provenance, business process reengineering, and security enhancement, have enormous potential to be transformed by blockchain. This research uses the integrated interpretive structural modeling–cross‐impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (ISM‐MICMAC) technique to ascertain the hierarchical relationships and to comprehend the severity of interrelationships among various components in tackling our research questions. In MICMAC analysis, the enablers were classified into four categories based on their dependence and driving powers. The combined ISM‐MICMAC methodology employed for this study relies on experts’ individual evaluations and subjective assessments. Therefore, even with extreme caution, it is impossible to guarantee that the results are entirely devoid of personal biases. To further validate the linkages discovered in this study, we suggest employing more multiple‐criteria decision‐making (MCDM) methodologies and comparing the results with those of our research. Another method for confirming the results of the current study is to use an empirical research design based on survey methods.</jats:p>",

Thus, we examined how the supply of new SETs changed over time in relation to the characteristics of teacher preparation programs. We find decreasing supply of new SETs nationally, primarily driven by reduced supply of new SETs from small colleges. Results suggest the current SET shortage may be connected, in previously undocumented ways, to the broader decline of small- and mid-sized colleges. Finally, findings indicate the nation may be far more dependent on for-profit institutions for supplying new SETs, which has implications for the production of SETs by alternative certification and traditional teacher preparation programs. </jats:p>"

Placing magnetically coupled structures inside the substation pillar insulators for inductive power transfer is considered a feasible solution, and at this stage of research, systems that add multi‐stage repeating coil structures are mostly used to achieve stable power supply for individual online monitoring devices. However, the monitoring point generally requires multiple devices to monitor together, and the power requirements of different devices are different, so adding multiple repeating coils at the same time will increase the complexity of the system design, which is not conducive to engineering applications. Therefore, this paper designs and optimizes a multi‐stage multi‐load wireless power supply system magnetic coupling structure, using a three‐dimensional hollow solenoid combined with a ferrite core as the system repeating coil structure and an embedded magnetic coupling structure as the receiver end structure to reduce the number of system repeating coils while supplying power to devices with different power requirements. A prototype with a transmission distance of 1.02 m was built in the experiment, and the experimental results showed that the highest transmission efficiency of the system was 44.3% and 39.2% under single load and double load conditions, respectively. As the load resistance increases, the system can achieve constant voltage output under both single‐load and dual‐load operating conditions. Adjusting the number of turns of the receiving coil can change the output characteristics of the system and achieve constant voltage output of different voltage levels or constant current output of different current levels, which can meet the power supply needs of different loads.</jats:p>"

This water scarcity critically limits the socio-economic development of the region. Rational allocation of scarce water resources to achieve sustainable development of the ecological environment and economy has become a key issue in water resources research in the Northwest Arid Region. South-Central Ningxia, part of the Northwest Arid Region, exemplifies these challenges. This paper examines the urban and rural water supply projects in South-Central Ningxia. The current scheduling scheme focuses primarily on the distribution of water demand, with inadequate attention paid to water-quality requirements. Localized exceedances of water-quality standards indicate the existing scheduling scheme has failed to effectively control water-quality issues while ensuring water quantity. This study is the first to systematically evaluate the impact of the South-Central Ningxia Water Supply Project on water quality alongside field surveys and data analysis and propose an optimized scheduling scheme that addresses both water quantity and quality needs. The main findings are as follows: 1. Overall water quality is good, except for consistently high total nitrogen levels. 2. The optimized scheme significantly reduced total nitrogen levels, achieving a maximum reduction rate of 78.81%, and met all Class III standards.</jats:p>"

Using a sample of Chinese A‐share listed companies from 2007 to 2023, this paper empirically investigates the impact of digital transformation on supply chain efficiency. We find that firms with a higher degree of digital transformation are associated with higher supply chain efficiency. Mechanism tests show that digital transformation facilitates supply chain efficiency via lower customer demand uncertainty as well as raw material disruption risk. The positive effect of digital transformation is more pronounced for non‐state‐owned enterprises and for firms with less stable customers and more geographically dispersed suppliers. Moreover, there is much degree prompt in supply chain efficiency for firms located in a better digital environment. This paper sheds light on how digital transformation influences supply chain efficiency and provides significant insights for firms to improve supply chain efficiency.</jats:p>",

The increased dependency on groundwater due to monsoonal uncertainties amplifies the risk by several folds. Due to the high population density in the affected regions, policies on prevention, monitoring, and mitigation have become extremely challenging to implement. The pursuit of improved human health in the affected regions cannot be completed until and unless there is sufficient urbanization and industrialization to support the livelihood, which again aggravates the situation due to improper disposal of anthropogenic contaminants owing to the lack of knowledge about the natural cycle of contaminants. The present review article is an attempt to understand the problem of fluoride and arsenic in the scenario of Indian floodplains by first explaining the globally identified mobilization mechanisms of these contaminants and then developing a compendium of knowledge through which the risk on the Indian floodplains can be analysed. Then the study compares the similarity/dissimilarity in the enrichment mechanism followed by a detailed investigation of the available mitigation techniques. In totality, the present study adds a new dimension to our understanding of the risk due to contaminants.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the research delves into the optimal supply chain strategies under three distinct scenarios in the context of meteorological disasters. A comparative analysis is conducted to examine the decision-making variances and the shifts in the interests of each supply chain participant under these scenarios. The findings reveal two critical insights: First, meteorological disasters detrimentally affect the environmental friendliness of energy products, as well as the profits of both retailers and suppliers. Second, the selection of the optimal strategy varies depending on the evaluation criterion used. When product greenness is the metric, subsidies aimed at promoting sales costs emerge as the superior strategy. Conversely, for retailers and suppliers, subsidies that target the environmental friendliness of energy products prove to be the most effective.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates manufacturer encroachment on a sustainable supply chain, where the manufacturer holds exclusive information on product greenness and is responsible for both corporate social responsibility (CSR) and greening. The manufacturer and the retailer play a signaling game whereby CSR effort and wholesale price serve as joint green signals. Findings reveal that, firstly, encroachment induces higher CSR efforts from manufacturers. When customers exhibit a strong CSR preference, the resulting CSR increment leads to increased offline demand and drives up both wholesale and retail prices in a mutually beneficial manner. This phenomenon is referred to as the CSR effect, yielding a win-win encroachment. Secondly, when signaling product greenness to highly CSR-sensitive customers, the high-greenness manufacturer principally distorts her CSR effort downward to an extent unprofitable for the low-greenness manufacturer to mimic and subordinately distorts the wholesale price downward to counter CSR-induced demand decrement and mitigate CSR cost pass-through downstream. Finally, the win-win encroachment pattern is characterized by encroachment profit and signal expense sharing, with encroachment strengthening downward-distorted signaling while signaling weakens the CSR effect. These insights contribute valuable guidance for green manufacturers in CSR decision-making, which functions as a component of green signaling and facilitates transitioning to dual-channel sustainable supply chains.</jats:p>"

The adoption of renewable energies has spurred this LIB proliferation and resulted in a dramatic increase in LIB waste. In this review, we address waste LIB collection and segregation approaches, waste LIB treatment approaches, and related economics. We have coined a “green score” concept based on a review of several quantitative analyses from the literature to compare the three mainstream recycling processes: pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, and direct recycling. In addition, we analyze the current trends in policymaking and in government incentive development directed toward promoting LIB waste recycling.

Amongst available natural resources, water remains the most limiting factor. Present vegetable cultivation practices involve the utilization of excessive quantities of water, thereby leading to the wastage of precious water resources. Therefore, sustainable management of irrigation water is crucial for future vegetable cultivation, as most vegetable crops are vulnerable to water scarcity at different growth stages, which can result in yield and post-harvest quality losses. Adoption of deficit irrigation (DI) is one of the sustainable irrigation water management approaches. DI is a sustainable water-saving approach, as irrigation water is applied in limited or lower quantities than the actual evapotranspiration-based crop water requirement. Strategic application of water at the right time and quantity with the right technique can greatly improve water use efficiency and water productivity. It could also enhance the post-harvest quality with marginal yield loss. Yield losses whatsoever could be compensated by expanding agricultural areas in water-scarce zones by adopting the DI strategy. This review discusses the concept and types of DI and examines its implications for the morpho-physiology and productivity of commercially important vegetable crops.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The water pump scheduling problem is an optimisation model that determines which water pumps will be turned on or off at each time period over a given time horizon for a given water supply system. This problem has received considerable attention in mining and desalination due to the high power consumption of water pumps and desalination plants and the complicated dynamics of water flows and the power market. Motivated by this, in this paper we solve the optimal operation of a desalinated water supply system consisting of interconnected tanks and pumps that transport water to high-altitude reservoirs. The optimisation of this process encounters several difficulties arising from (i) the nonlinearities of the equations for the frictional losses along the pipes and pumps, which makes the problem a nonlinear mixed-integer model, and (ii) many possible combinations of pressure head and flow rates, which quickly leads to high computational costs. These limitations prevent the problem from being solved in a reasonable computational time in high-altitude water supply systems with more than six pumps and reservoirs, as in many networks worldwide. Therefore, in this work we develop new exact methods for the optimal pump scheduling problem that use a binary expansion approach to efficiently account for the existing nonlinearities by reducing the computational difficulties of the original problem while keeping an excellent representation of the physical phenomena involved. We also extensively tested the proposed approach in different network topologies and a case study for a real-world copper mine water network, and we conclude that the binary expansion approach significantly reduces the computational time for solving the problem with high precision, which can be very relevant for the practical daily operation of real-world water supply systems.</jats:p>"

Previous research mainly focused on how land use change affects ESS, ignoring its impact on the interaction between ESS and ESD, making it difficult to guide regional sustainability in social–ecological coupled systems. Taking the Yangtze River Delta as the study area, after evaluating five types of ESS and ESD during 2000–2020, this study analyzed the interaction between changes in ESS and ESD using Geodetector from a spatial zoning perspective and subsequently explored the impact of land use intensity on ESS, ESD, and their interaction using Spearman correlation analysis and regression analysis. The results showed that there was obvious spatial–temporal heterogeneity in ESS and ESD. Different ecosystem services varied in their interaction between ESS and ESD, and the demand changes in water conservation and soil retention significantly influenced their supply changes, while supply changes in carbon sequestration were not influenced by its demand changes. The effect of ESD changes on ESS changes also showed spatial heterogeneity. All interactions between ESS changes and ESD changes, except carbon sequestration, were significant in the Supply Increases–Demand Increases zone. Soil retention and water conservation showed a significant supply–demand interaction in the Supply Decreases–Demand Decreases zone and the Supply Decreases–Demand Increases zone, respectively, while no ecosystem service showed significant supply–demand interaction in the Supply Increases–Demand Decreases zone. Land use intensity had linear and nonlinear effects on different ESS and ESD, and it was also found that the effect of ESD changes on corresponding ESS changes was relatively obvious in regions with dramatic land use change. Finally, this paper incorporated the changes in ESS and ESD, as well as their interaction, into land use management, which can provide implications for regional sustainability.</jats:p>"

This study seeks to conduct a systematic analysis of the current literature about the obstacles and possibilities encountered by small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies in South Africa as they strive to become part of global supply chains. The objective is to offer a thorough summary of the existing research in this field. This study utilised the PRISMA systematic literature review approach to evaluate 26 peer-reviewed papers and academic publications from the Scopus database that are pertinent to pharmaceutical small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa. The data were extracted using Atlas-ti, which facilitated a thematic analysis to identify and categorise the primary difficulties and opportunities faced by these firms. The assessment has found four main obstacles: regulatory impediments, budgetary limitations, operational and logistical concerns, and market rivalry. On the other hand, there were also important prospects identified, such as the possibility for expanding the market, developments in technology, initiatives to promote sustainability, and the development of collaborative networks. These findings emphasise the complex and diverse ways in which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) become part of global supply chains. They illustrate the obstacles and opportunities that SMEs encounter in their efforts to succeed. Pharmaceutical small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South Africa encounter a range of intricate obstacles as they strive to integrate into the global supply chain. However, they also have multiple chances to utilise growth and gain a competitive edge. Effectively managing these difficulties and possibilities is crucial for their incorporation into worldwide markets. This study enhances the scholarly discussion on the integration of global supply chains by conducting a detailed investigation of small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies in the context of a developing country. This study provides valuable insights into the unique problems and possibilities faced by these businesses, which can be used to guide future research and develop practical strategies to enhance global integration. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Blockchain technology and smart contracts are emerging as transformative tools for enhancing transparency and efficiency in supply chain management and vendor relations. Traditional supply chains often face challenges such as inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to fraud (Kouhizadeh &amp; Sarkis, 2018). Blockchain, a decentralized ledger technology, coupled with smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code, offers promising solutions to these challenges (Wang, Han, &amp; Beynon-Davies, 2019). This paper explores the application of blockchain and smart contracts in these domains, examining their potential to provide immutable records, streamline processes, and mitigate risks (Casado-Vara et al., 2018). Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature and case studies, we identify key benefits including improved transparency, enhanced efficiency, and better risk management (Christidis &amp; Devetsikiotis, 2016; Tian, 2016). Our findings suggest that blockchain and smart contracts can significantly improve supply chain transparency and vendor management, though their implementation requires careful consideration of technical, regulatory, and organizational factors (Saberi et al., 2019). Notable case studies, such as Walmart’s blockchain pilot for food safety and De Beers' diamond tracking initiative, illustrate the practical benefits and challenges of adopting these technologies in real-world scenarios (Casino, Dasaklis, &amp; Patsakis, 2019; Kshetri, 2018). Despite the promising outlook, further research is needed to address scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance issues to fully realize the potential of blockchain and smart contracts in supply chain management (Hughes et al., 2019).</jats:p>"

In many countries, vital societal functions (VSFs) and CIs depend on inter-organizational and international supply chains (SCs) which combine public and private actors with often competing interests and unclear responsibilities that create discontents. While collaborative supply chain risk management (SCRM) can increase the robustness and resilience of VSF&amp;CIs, their inherent characteristics complicate SCRM. To understand this, supply chain risk governance (SCRG) has conceptually been introduced, suggesting collaborative mechanisms that facilitate inter-organizational SCRM.

This study quantifies the consequences of groundwater nitrate pollution for the drinking water supply sector by estimating the effect of groundwater nitrate pollution on the costs of water utilities. In doing so, we contribute to the estimation of the external costs of agricultural nonpoint pollution associated with drinking water supply. Empirical evidence is based on fixed effects regressions using large panel data sets on water supply companies and groundwater sampling sites in Germany. Local nitrate pollution at the abstraction plant is approximated using spatial interpolation. Our findings reveal that water suppliers incur substantial costs through groundwater nitrate pollution in terms of increased treatment and total costs. The estimated cost elasticities range from 0.048 to 0.052 for treatment costs and up to 0.019 for total costs. For an average firm, these estimates imply annual increases in treatment and total costs of €39,000 and €116,000, respectively, for a 10 milligrams per liter increase in groundwater nitrate concentrations.</jats:p>",

An increase in the HT/P ration in all angles leads to a decrease in Cd and Ra. However, the decrease rate of these parameters is less for 15-degree angle compared to other threshold angles of the input and output keys. In the PKWs with different input and output key angles and at low HT/P ratios (total head to weir height), the dropping flow nappe needs aeration due to its bonding. However, by increasing this ratio to the submergence condition and transforming into a linear weir, the dropping flow nappe is aerated. At low ratios of HT/P, the dropping flow nappes do not interfere and the highest discharge coefficient and the highest weir efficiency are obtained. While by increasing the HT/P ratio, the dropping flow nappes start to collide and interfere with each other in the output keys, causing the flow rise and the weir submergence, and consequently, the discharge coefficient and the weir efficiency is decreased.</jats:p>",

For the supply chain to endure risks, the fashion industry should develop a Supply Chain Design Strategy (SC Design Strategy) so that the supply chain is resilient to possible risks. SC Design Strategyis the ability to recover from disruptions by developing responsive capabilities, through redundancy and flexibility. So, this research aims to find out what form of SC Design Strategyis currently being implemented by fashion industry entrepreneurs in Bandung so that it can be used to create approaches towards resiliency. Data collection techniques were carried out through observation and interviews with company owners, managers, and employees of the enterprises. Data analysis uses a scoring rubric technique to measure the company's condition. Based on the results, the sourcing strategy dimension is the dimension that is most widely applied by ten fashion industry business actors in Bandung. Business actors said that they implemented strict supplier selection indicators to produce good quality products from suitable raw materials. Few business actors implemented global sourcing indicators, especially about supplying raw materials from abroad.  In the redundant strategy dimension, most business actors use multi-sourcing indicators, namely alternative strategies for more than one supplier. For the flexible strategy dimension, several business actors use flexible transportation indicators to minimize transportation risks. Most business actors do not apply factory redesign indicators because most of them do not have their factories, so it will be hard to change the production system.</jats:p>"

A través de una metodología de análisis bibliográfico, se revisaron fuentes académicas de bases de datos reconocidas, utilizando palabras clave relevantes y criterios estrictos de inclusión y exclusión. Los resultados muestran que plataformas privadas, como Hyperledger Fabric, ofrecen mayor escalabilidad y control de acceso, mientras que plataformas públicas, como Ethereum, priorizan la transparencia, aunque presentan limitaciones en términos de velocidad y costos. Además, la integración de blockchain mejora la trazabilidad y transparencia en las cadenas, permitiendo un seguimiento en tiempo real y fomentando la confianza entre los actores. Sin embargo, factores como la falta de interoperabilidad, los altos costos iniciales y la resistencia al cambio organizacional limitan su adopción.

However, the industry's continued reliance on single-vendor systems (SVS) for processing poses significant risks. Stringent FDA validation requirements, coupled with increasing vulnerability to supply chain disruptions and the potential for discontinued vendor support, can result in costly and irreplaceable losses of cord blood units (CBU). These losses not only have financial implications but can also delay or prevent life-saving treatments for patients in need. To optimize this valuable resource, a strategic balance between clinical and therapeutic needs is essential. This study investigates the hidden costs associated with SVS reliance and explores the potential benefits of maintaining secondary processing capabilities as a risk mitigation strategy, ensuring the availability of CBU for both current and future therapeutic applications.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Objectives</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>This study analyzes the experiences of a FACT accredited public cord blood bank in the USA to:</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>-Highlight the challenges associated with onboarding and validating a new SVS for CBU processing.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>-Quantify the CBU losses resulting from validation, supply chain disruptions, and instrument downtime.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>-Demonstrate the long-term cost-effectiveness of maintaining secondary processing capabilities to mitigate such losses.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A retrospective review of cord blood processing techniques and product disposition from February 2020 to February 2024 was conducted.

It explores how GF influences firms' economic, environmental, and social sustainability, with a focus on the moderating effects of modern technologies like big data analytics (BDA) and blockchain. The research is based on data collected from 562 managers in Egypt's industrial and manufacturing sectors through a survey conducted between November 18th, 2023, and January 12th, 2024. The survey, which used a five‐point Likert scale, was distributed via both traditional and electronic methods, and its reliability was ensured through a pilot phase involving seven academics and five SC practitioners. The data was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling, chosen for its effectiveness with non‐normal data distributions. The Bootstrapping method with 5000 iterations was employed to validate the model. The findings reveal that GF significantly enhances green supply chain management (GSCM), particularly when moderated by BDA, though blockchain technology does not have a significant moderating effect. Additionally, GSCM is found to positively influence the environmental and social dimensions of sustainable development, mediating the relationship between GF and these sustainability outcomes. This study provides valuable insights for practitioners and policymakers, emphasizing the critical role of GF and BDA in fostering sustainable development, especially within the Egyptian industrial and manufacturing sectors.</jats:p>",

The process of fistula formation is accompanied by the formation of tubercles and craters on the surface of a corroding metal. The study focused on examining the qualitative and quantitative composition of the solution, which is generated inside the tubercles during their growth. It was found that, during the operation of water pipelines, the concentration of aggressive chloride ions inside the tubercles increases significantly compared to the chloride content of the source water. The increase in chloride concentration leads to an accelerated corrosion rate, potentially causing the formation of fistulas over time. As a result of the study, a mechanism for changing the mineral composition of the solution inside the tubercles has been proposed. This is due to the manifestation of selective properties by a dense layer of tubercles. The study also examined the appearance of crystalline forms of corrosion products that form after removing pipes from the water supply system. The study also reveals the conditions of corrosion products emerging. Further studies on the structure and properties of a dense layer of corrosive sediment could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of various corrosion inhibitors.</jats:p>"

Our research introduces an innovative approach, integrating game theory, BiLSTM-Attention deep learning, and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to refine supply and pricing strategies within this domain. Focusing on Moroccan automobile companies, we utilized Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system data to forecast customer behavior using a BiLSTM model enhanced with an Attention mechanism. This predictive model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0525 and an R² value of 0.896, indicating high accuracy and an ability to explain substantial variance in customer behavior. To further our analysis, we incorporated reinforcement learning, evaluating three algorithms: Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and SARSA. Our findings demonstrate SARSA's superior performance in our context, attributed to its adeptness at navigating the dynamic environment of the automotive supply chain. By synergizing the predictive power of the BiLSTM-Attention model with the strategic optimization capabilities of reinforcement learning, particularly SARSA, our study offers a comprehensive framework for automotive companies to enhance their supply chain strategies, balancing profitability and customer satisfaction effectively in a rapidly evolving industry sector</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study explores the hypothetical elimination of Japan’s retirement earnings test (ET) for public pensions, focusing on its implications for older workers’ labor supply and pension-claiming behaviors. The ET currently reduces public pension benefits for individuals aged 65 and older if their earnings exceed specified thresholds, potentially discouraging employment in this demographic. Notably, the Japanese ET influences both immediate and future pension benefits, thus diminishing current payouts for working pensioners and foregoing beneficial actuarial adjustments—adjustments based on actuarial calculations that would otherwise increase future benefits to account for delayed pension claims. This dual impact may discourage the labor supply and influence pension-claiming behavior among older workers. Through a survey-based experiment with male workers aged 40–59 years expected to face the ET upon retirement, we assess three reform scenarios as the first study in the literature: (1) eliminating future benefit reductions through actuarial adjustments, thereby enhancing the value of deferred pension claims; (2) removing immediate benefit suspensions to increase current pension payments directly; and (3) a comprehensive reform combining both approaches. Our findings reveal that eliminating reductions through actuarial adjustments increases the intensive margin (labor hours and income) and encourages delayed pension claims. Conversely, removing immediate benefit suspensions influences both the extensive margin (decision to work) and the intensive margin but leads to earlier pension claims. By highlighting the importance of differentiating between immediate and future benefit components in designing ET reforms, this study demonstrates their significant impact on labor supply and pension-claiming decisions.</jats:p>"

This research uses the time series analysis method by focusing on comparing the accuracy of three forecasting methods: Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), Double Exponential Smoothing (DES), and Triple Exponential Smoothing (TES/Holt-Winter). This research provides a solution by comparing the performance of the three methods based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) results and prediction graphs. The goal is to determine the most accurate forecasting method using the time series analysis method with several stages, namely data preprocessing, train/test split, modeling, and performance metrics measurement. based on the test results show MAE SES 1077, DES 96, and TES (Holt-Winter) 101. Although DES has a lower MAE, TES (Holt-Winter) provides better accuracy, especially through prediction graph analysis. Holt-Winter is recognized as the most effective method in forecasting future sales, reliable for proper stock management in the dynamic e-commerce industry. This approach is expected to improve efficiency and accuracy in enterprise stock management, support the growth of online businesses, and contribute to the literature and practice of stock management. The use of time series analysis methods, especially Holt-Winter, is considered an important strategic step to optimize sales prediction, positively impact stock management, and create a competitive advantage in a growing market</jats:p>"

The parasitic parameters of the harness connecting the AT and the arc thruster power control unit (ATPU) induce a high-voltage electromotive force under the fast transient current condition. If the high-voltage electromotive force exceeds the rated voltage of the ATPU device, it will affect the reliability of the ATPU.

The results indicate that in the short term, inflation tends to decrease towards stability, with a strong exchange rate capable of reducing inflation, while an increase in the money supply slightly raises inflation. However, in the long term, inflation demonstrates a strong self-correction mechanism, with the influence of exchange rates and the money supply becoming limited.

However, there are still challenges in scaling production and reducing costs. These challenges involve various stakeholders such as the manufacturing facility, third-party logistics (3PL) company, and medical center. Proposed solutions tend to focus on individual companies rather than addressing the interconnectedness of the supply chain’s challenges. The challenges can be categorized as barriers from product characteristics, regulatory requirements, or lagging infrastructure. Each barrier affects multiple stakeholders, especially during a boundary event like product handover. Therefore, solutions that only consider the objectives of one stakeholder fail to address underlying problems. This review examines the interconnecting cell therapy supply chain challenges and how they affect the multiple stakeholders involved. The authors consider whether proposed solutions impact individual stakeholders or the entire supply chain and discuss the benefits of stakeholder coordination-focused solutions such as integrated technologies and information tracking.

With the series connection of IGBTs in a single-phase NPC three-level inverter, the voltage withstand requirement of IGBT is reduced by half. The middle four IGBTs are controlled using unipolar frequency-doubling SPWM, while the outer four IGBTs are turned on later and turned off earlier to address the neutral point voltage imbalance issue in the inverter. Simulation results show that, compared with the traditional bipolar SPWM-controlled single-phase full-bridge inverter, the DC-side input voltage of the inverter can be double, and the current flowing through the entire circuit can be halved under the same output power using the proposed method.</jats:p>"

We first formulate the single-epoch joint optimal output model by allowing the production of extra quantity for stock underage, considering the fixed costs incurred by having inventory over demand and shortfalls. Then, the multi-temporal dynamic joint production model is further investigated to deal with stochastic demand fluctuations among CSN nodes by constructing a dynamic input–output model. The K-convexity defined in Rn space is proved to obtain the optimal control strategy. According to physical flow links, all demands associated to the nodes of CSN are categorized into the inter-node demand inside CSN (intermediate demand) and external demand outside CSN (final demand). We exploit the meliorated input–output matrix to describe demand relations, building dynamic input–output models where demand fluctuates randomly in single-cycle CSN and finite multi-cycle CSN. The novel monocyclic and multicyclic dynamic models have been developed to minimize system-wide operational costs. Unlike existent literature, we consider fixed costs incurred by overdemand and underdemand inventory into system operational cost functions and then demonstrate the convexity of objective functions. The cost function with two fixed penalty costs due to excess and shortage of inventory is developed in a multicycle model, and the K-convexity defined in Rn is proved to find out the optimal strategy for joint dynamic production of CSNs in the case of multi-products and multicycles.</jats:p>"

Unisba's Campus 1, which consists of nine buildings including FMIPA, Postgraduate, Foundation, LPPM, Medicine, Rectorate, Tamansari 1, Dean, and Unisba Pension, is still unable to meet the parking needs for two-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles. The increase in the number of students carrying vehicles, especially two-wheelers, has led to a shortage of parking facilities. Parking congestion also often occurs during graduation events and milad celebrations. This research aims to identify the gap between the needs and parking capacity at Campus 1 of the Islamic University of Bandung.  The method used is a quantitative approach with supply-demand analysis based on existing formulas and standards. The results of the study show that the total parking capacity is currently 2,030 Parking Space Units (SRP) with a land area of 6,295 m², while the total need reaches 2,234 SRP with a land area of 6,931 m².

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimization of supply chains in emerging markets presents significant opportunities for enhancing operational efficiency and economic growth. However, these markets also pose unique challenges, particularly in the financial sector, that can impede the development and efficiency of supply chains. This Review explores the key financial challenges faced by supply chains in emerging markets and proposes strategies for addressing these issues to optimize supply chain performance. One of the primary challenges in emerging markets is the limited access to financing. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often form the backbone of supply chains in these regions, frequently encounter difficulties in securing necessary capital due to stringent lending criteria and a lack of collateral. This financial constraint hampers their ability to invest in advanced technologies and infrastructure, thereby affecting the overall efficiency and reliability of the supply chain. Additionally, emerging markets are often characterized by volatile economic conditions, including fluctuating exchange rates, inflation, and political instability. These factors increase the financial risks associated with supply chain operations, making it challenging for businesses to plan and execute long-term strategies. The lack of robust financial instruments and risk management solutions further exacerbates this issue, leaving supply chains vulnerable to disruptions. To address these challenges, the implementation of innovative financial solutions and supportive policies is crucial. Microfinancing and mobile banking can provide SMEs with greater access to capital, enabling them to invest in necessary resources and technologies. Furthermore, developing tailored financial products that cater to the specific needs of businesses in emerging markets can mitigate risks and enhance supply chain resilience. Collaborative initiatives between governments, financial institutions, and international organizations can also play a vital role in optimizing supply chains. Such collaborations can lead to the creation of more favorable regulatory environments, the provision of financial literacy programs, and the establishment of public-private partnerships that support infrastructure development and technological advancement. In conclusion, addressing the financial challenges in emerging markets is essential for optimizing supply chains and fostering sustainable economic development. By improving access to financing, enhancing risk management practices, and promoting collaborative efforts, stakeholders can significantly enhance the efficiency and resilience of supply chains in these regions, paving the way for greater economic growth and development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally, scale deposition in water supply pipelines is one of the major problems faced by water utilities. This research aimed to determine the causes and effects of scale deposition in the water supply pipelines in Surakarta City, Indonesia. The total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, manganese, and alkalinity in groundwater were higher than those in the surface water and spring water; thus, the supply areas from groundwater were identified using TDS at the taps. The three scaling indicators, i.e., the Langelier saturation index (LSI), the Ryznar stability index (RSI), and the Puckorius scaling index (PSI), indicated moderate calcium carbonate scaling. However, elemental analysis of eight scale samples using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) revealed that the major components of scale were either manganese (50.1–80.8%) or iron (45.6–63.8%), whereas calcium (3.0–7.8%) was a minor component. Because only five of twenty groundwater sources were chlorinated before distribution, it is estimated that dissolved manganese is oxidized by manganese-oxidizing bacteria. The manganese deposition rate in the networks was estimated to be 1660 kg/year using the manganese concentration at groundwater sources and in customers’ taps. These results suggest the importance of the elemental analysis of scale and avoidance of overreliance on scale indicators.</jats:p>"

The authors have conducted a systematic review of articles and scientific publications in PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases. The information of the hippocampal structure, blood supply, functions and importance for the generation of human cognitive performance in health and in conditions of persistent arterial hypertension has been processed.\nConclusions. The current research results allow asserting that the hippocampus plays an important role in combining environmental signals and creating an integral and unified perception in the spatial and temporal domains. The performance efficiency depends on cellular signaling and stability, adequate blood supply, neurotransmitter balance, and the character of a receptor landscape. Experimental studies and clinical observations show cerebral arteriole reconstruction and constriction as well as decreased NO bioavailability in the hippocampus induced by chronic arterial hypertension to compensate for excessive pressure and increased blood flow pulsatility and to protect microvessels from damage. Increased vasoconstriction results in hypoperfusion and neuronal damage, which is most obvious in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas and visualized as a reduced number of chaotically scattered cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles, nuclear pyknosis and nucleolysis.</jats:p>"

Hence, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to reduce data dimensions and determine the pollution criteria based on four physical and six chemical parameters premeasured at 19 stations between 2020 and 2022. The CCA results showed that pH and dissolved oxygen (as physical variables) and also mercury, nitrate, and sulfate (as chemical variables) had a significant role in predicting the canonical variables of chemical and physical parameters, respectively. These pollutants predominantly originated from anthropogenic pollution sources, including runoff infiltration from surrounding vast agricultural lands (based on the first principle component results accounted for 39.3% of the variations), and also the soil erosion in the watershed (based on the second principle component results accounted for 25.7% of the variations). To conclude, the Aras River water quality management programs should focus more on controlling anthropogenic pollution sources to monitor the status of effective physicochemical parameters using multivariate statistical methods, especially CCA and PCA methods.</jats:p>",

Recent developments in the mixing phenomenon within cross junctions of water distribution networks (WDNs) have heightened the need for evaluating the existing incomplete mixing models under real-world conditions. Therefore, in this study, two cross junctions with pipe diameters of 100 × 100 × 100 × 100 mm and 150 × 150 × 150 × 150 mm were employed in laboratory experiments to evaluate six existing incomplete mixing models for 25 flow rate scenarios ranging between 1.5 and 3.0 L/s. It was observed that within the same flow rate scenario, the degree of mixing in a cross junction with a pipe relative roughness of 6.00 × 10−5 (pipe diameter of 25 mm) was higher than that in a cross junction with a pipe relative roughness of 3.00 × 10−5 (pipe diameter of 50 mm) and smaller. Considering the real-world size of pipes in evaluating the incomplete mixing models showed that two incomplete mixing models, AZRED and the one by Shao et al., had the best accordance with the results of the laboratory experiments.</jats:p>",

Despite its significance, substantial food loss and waste (FLW) in CSCL pose multifaceted challenges across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. This comprehensive literature review aims to identify state-of-the-art CSCL for reducing food waste, key research themes, and their potential roles in red meat waste reduction, as well as identify future research directions. It explores four pivotal themes—management, sustainability, network design (ND), and new information technologies (IT)—each contributing uniquely to mitigating FLW. A review of papers published in the last two decades reveals management as the predominant theme, followed by sustainability, ND, and IT. The study underscores the interconnectedness of these themes and highlights gaps in current research, particularly the need for multi-objective optimisation models. These models should integrate uncertainties, sustainability dimensions, and technological advancements, while aligning strategic, tactical, and operational decisions to enhance CSCL sustainability and reduce FLW in the beef meat industry. This review informs stakeholders—researchers, policymakers, practitioners, the government, and the public—about emerging trends and opportunities in addressing food waste, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable CSCL practices.</jats:p>"

This causes opportunities for errors due to inaccuracies in interpretation and calculation in elaborating the complexity of the building to be built. Calculations that still use excel in development projects where it can result in a much larger calculation difference resulting in cost overruns. For this reason, it is necessary to require more effective cost estimation planning. One of the latest project management information systems today is Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM has great potential to share visualize information, visualize construction progress, provide information quickly. Therefore, this research uses BIM 5D (Autodesk Revit software) which functions to estimate the cost budget of a project. The Plan Budget Cost (RAB) figure will not be 100% accurate. The purpose of this study is to determine the comparison and difference in volume calculations and RAB using BIM 5D dimensions with calculations of Planning Consultants on Reinforced Concrete Works in the Office and Post Security Depot Supply Point Pertamina Lubricants Tarakan Construction Project. The results of the calculation with BIM 5D method and the Planner Consultant obtained the results of the calculation of the difference where the comparison of the volume of reinforcement is a difference of 3.83% while in concrete work the difference is 4.37%. Meanwhile, the results of the RAB calculation on reinforced concrete work cost difference of 4.10%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Engineered geopolymer composites (EGCs) exhibit excellent tensile ductility and crack control ability, making them promising for concrete structure repair. However, their widespread use is limited by high costs of reinforcement fiber and a lack of an EGC–concrete interface bonding mechanism. This study investigated a hybrid PE/PVA fiber-reinforced EGC using domestically produced unoiled PVA fibers to replace commonly used PE fibers. The bond performance of the EGC–concrete interface was evaluated through direct tensile and slant shear tests, focusing on the effects of PE fiber content (1%, 2%, and 3%), fiber hybrid ratios (2.0:0.0, 1.5:0.5, 1.0:1.0, 0.5:1.5, and 0.0:2.0), concrete substrate strength (C30, C50, and C70), and the ratio of fly ash (FA) to ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) (6:4, 7:3, and 8:2) on interface bond strength. Results showed that the EGCs’ compressive strength ranged from 77.1 to 108.9 MPa, with increased GGBS content significantly enhancing the compressive strength and elastic modulus. Most of the specimens exhibited strain-hardening behavior after initial cracking. Interface bonding tests revealed that a PE/PVA ratio of 1.0 increased tensile bond strength by 8.5% compared with using 2.0% PE fiber alone. Increasing the PE fiber content, PVA/PE ratio, GGBS content, and concrete substrate strength all improved the shear bond strength. This improvement was attributed to the flexible fibers’ ability to restrict thermo–hydro damage and deflect and blunt microcracks, enhancing the interface’s failure resistance. Cost analysis showed that replacing 50% of the PE fiber in EGC with unoiled PVA fiber reduced costs by 44.2% compared with PE fiber alone, offering the best cost–performance ratio. In summary, hybrid PE/PVA fiber EGC has promising prospects for improving economic efficiency while maintaining tensile ductility and crack-control ability. Future optimization of fiber ratios and interface design could further enhance its potential for concrete repair applications.</jats:p>"

Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis on this matter. This work presents a novel phase-noise drive sensitivity (PNDS) model for the XO to reveal its mechanism. This model based on five noise modulation processes demonstrates the distribution of the PNDS in the frequency domain clearly, and there exists a PNDS bandwidth fS that limits the supply voltage fluctuation, which is similar to the effect of the noise bandwidth of the classical Leeson model. Using the PNDS, we successfully predict the phase noise of a 10 MHz oscillator under different supply voltage noises. In addition, experimental results show that the PNDS floor is determined by the phase modulation of the sustaining amplifier, while the amplitude-frequency effect of the resonator and the tuning of the diode often play crucial roles in the near-carrier PNDS.</jats:p>",

Although data analytics and machine learning methods have been proposed to support the characterization of probabilities to inform decisions and risk mitigation strategies, their application in the PSC has not been previously described. Further, it is unclear how well these models perform in the presence of emergent events representing deep uncertainty such as the COVID‐19 pandemic. This article examines the use of data‐driven models to predict PSC disruptions before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using data on generic drugs from the pharmacy supply chain division of a Fortune 500 pharmacy benefit management firm, we have developed predictive models based on the naïve Bayes algorithm, where the models predict whether a specific supplier or whether a specific product will experience a supply disruption in the next time period. We find statistically significant changes in the relationships of nearly all variables associated with product supply disruptions during the pandemic, despite pre‐pandemic stability. We present results showing how the sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rate of predictive models changed with the onset of the COVID‐19 pandemic and show the beneficial effects of regular model updating. The results show that maintaining model sensitivity is more challenging than maintaining specificity and false positive rates. The results provide unique insight into the pandemic's effect on risk prediction within the PSC and provide insight for risk analysts to better understand how surprise events and deep uncertainty affect predictive models.</jats:p>",

The research aims to evaluate how adherence to ethical standards influences various dimensions of procurement performance, including fairness, transparency, customer service, efficiency, effectiveness, teamwork, and organizational values. Utilizing a quantitative approach, data was collected through a structured survey distributed to procurement professionals across various public sector organizations in Ghana. The analysis of the data, which includes constructs related to procurement ethical codes and performance metrics, reveals several key findings:\r\nFairness and Transparency: Respondents generally perceive high levels of fairness and transparency in the procurement process. Strong mean scores indicate that ethical codes are applied uniformly and that key procurement information is accessible and equitably managed. However, variability in responses suggests that some areas could benefit from further enhancement.\r\nCustomer Service and Effectiveness: There is a positive perception of improvements in customer service, which is seen to enhance organizational performance. High mean scores for effectiveness indicate timely delivery, high-quality goods, and minimal complaints, although there are some variations in perceptions regarding damage reduction and staff effectiveness.\r\nEfficiency: The data shows a favorable view of cost-effective procurement practices, with improved staff knowledge contributing to better performance. Moderate variability in responses points to differing experiences in procurement efficiency.\r\nTeamwork and Organizational Values: Teamwork is recognized as a critical factor in enhancing procurement efficiency and effectiveness. Organizational values are seen to positively impact purchasing activities and governance, with consistent perceptions of trustworthiness and responsibility.\r\nHierarchical Levels: Opinions on the impact of hierarchical levels on procurement performance are mixed. While some respondents agree that reducing hierarchical levels could improve performance, there is significant variability in views on its effectiveness.\r\nThe study concludes that while there is a generally positive perception of procurement practices and ethical enforcement, there are areas with varying experiences that may benefit from targeted improvements. Addressing these variabilities can enhance overall procurement performance and align with ethical standards more effectively.</jats:p>"

The use of ED technology for groundwater treatment has been increasing globally, and Sri Lanka is also considering its introduction to treat groundwater in rural areas because of its higher efficiency and easier operation compared to other membrane technologies. A pilot plant was installed in Kahatagasdigiliya, NCP, Sri Lanka focusing on the selective removal of problematic ions identified in the area. Operational parameters were adjusted to remove identified problematic ions during the TED process, and suitable operational parameters were selected considering treated water quality and the water demand of villagers. TED was operated at a selected condition of 12 m3/h flow rate and 45 V voltage. The final effluent water quality meets the Sri Lanka Standard (SLS) 614:2013 limits, with a higher removal efficiency of 65.63% (hardness) and 55.37% (F-). This TED system with a capacity of 260 m3 day has been operational since 2017 in Sri Lanka, providing better quality water to villagers and ensuring water safety in the area. This pilot TED provides guidance on operating ED for selective removal of problematic ions in drinking water in real-world applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Administrative penalties towards digital technology companies (APDTs) have emerged prominently in recent years as the Chinese government has started to impose these penalties on digital technology firms for their increasing frequency of legal violations. These penalties are expected to significantly influence the behavior of businesses in various governmental jurisdictions. To investigate the impact of APDTs on the level of business credit supply (BCS), this paper conducts an empirical analysis grounded in theoretical derivation. Using data from APDTs in Chinese cities and A‐share listed companies in China, the study examines the effect of APDTs on BCS and its underlying mechanisms. The findings indicate that APDTs incentivize enterprises to enhance their BCS. Additionally, as municipal governments intensify APDTs, local enterprises demonstrate an increased level of BCS. This is attributed to heightened industry competition resulting from APDTs, which amplifies the pressure on enterprises to extend credit and increases revenue incentives. Consequently, enterprises are driven to augment their BCS to facilitate credit sales and drive revenue growth. This study provides empirical evidence detailing the microeconomic consequences of APDTs, offering theoretical insights to advance the development of digital technology and optimize financial resource allocation, thereby alleviating enterprise financing constraints.</jats:p>",

In particular, peak load conditions often cause serious problems of voltage drops occurring along the contact line, affecting the reliability, flexibility, system safety, and efficiency performance of the MRT system. The potential at the pantograph of a train on the segment of power supply depends significantly on the structure of the traction power supply network, contact network type, and voltage level. Recently, there have been studies on the dynamics of ROCSs under the impact of train motion, thereby applying the design to several railway systems in the world in specific conditions such as tunnels, stations, or viaducts. To consolidate the advantages of this trend, this paper studies the operating voltage of an ROCS in a full-line MRT system with a voltage level of 750 V DC belonging to the third rail. Matlab R2017b/Railway Systems is a reliable software for simulating and analyzing the necessary data. The results exhibit the feasibility of the designed ROCS. The system has a passenger carrying capacity of up to 90,000 passengers per hour per direction (p/h/d) under both normal and fault conditions. In this case, this capacity is achieved with a single-end feed at a distance of 2 km from a Traction Power Station (TPS), with the minimum feeder voltage at the pantograph point being 532.7200 V. The lowest operational feeder voltage of the system is 523.6667 V, supplied from a double-end feed at a distance of up to 5 km from the TPS.</jats:p>"

Extensive simulations and numerical results confirm the model’s effectiveness in providing robust solutions to dynamically changing supply chain problems when compared to conventional models. However, the integrated model introduces substantial computational complexity, which may pose challenges in large-scale real-world applications.

In order to provide scientific and systematic implementation suggestions for regional water resource protection management and ecological compensation, a SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model was constructed to quantify the water resource supply of the upper Hanjiang River basin at three spatial scales: pixel, sub-basin, and administrative unit. The water demand at the three spatial scales was calculated using the LUCC (Land Use and Land Coverage) and water consumption index. The supply and benefit zones under different spatial and temporal scales were obtained. Simultaneously, this study uncovered the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in water resource supply and demand, alongside elucidating the spatial extent and flow attributes of water supply. The ecological compensation scheme of water resource supply–demand was preliminarily determined. The findings indicate an initial increase followed by a decrease in both the water supply and demand in the upper reaches of the Han River, accompanied by spatial disparities in the water supply distribution. The direction of the water supply generally flows from branch to main stream. The final ecological compensation scheme should be combined with natural conditions and economic development to determine a reasonable financial compensation system.</jats:p>"

Since the outbreak of the First World War, unable to secure an adequate supply of rifles from the major advanced industrialized nations in time, Russia turned to Japan for rifles. Japan saw this as an opportunity to seize the initiative in relations with Russia and tried to conclude an agreement which had been pursued since before the war, to make Russia to the partner of her continental policy. Grand Duke Georgy's visit to Japan was a symbolic event that showed that relations between the two countries had turned in Japan's favor as discussions of the Russo-Japanese agreement intensified. Initially, Russia insisted that the purpose of the visit was solely to express gratitude for the arms assistance and to congratulate Emperor Taishō on his enthronement, denying any political intentions. However, Japan insisted on discussing the rifle supply issue on the premise of concluding the Russo-Japanese agreement. Finally, Russia agreed to discuss the basic terms of the agreement and promised to purchase rifles. During the negotiations for agreement, Japan proactively led the discussions and weaponized the rifle supply to strengthen its dominance over Russia. Conversely, Russia, which was dependent on Japan for rifles, accepted almost all of Japan's unfavorable demands. Thus, the unstable compromise that had been maintained in bilateral relations since the Russo-Japanese War finally ended with the conclusion of the 4th Russo-Japanese agreement led by Japan during World War I, as Japan took the initiative by weaponizing the rifle supply, a change triggered by the shortage of rifles in Russia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The major purpose of this study was to look empirically at the missing mediating role of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) practices in the relationship between intellectual capital(IC) and organizational performance(OC). Using concept from the resource-based view (RBV) theory, in the complex context of Pakistan's construction sector, the integration of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) processes is not just a choice, but a must for attaining sustainable growth. The main objective of GSCM is to mitigate negative environmental impacts and improve operational effectiveness. For this, a sample of 327 employees was gathered from the managerial staff of the construction industries by using a nonprobability purposive sampling technique, as only respondents engaged in SCM and GSCM activities were contacted. The hypotheses were put to the test using Smart PLS-SEM version 4 via reliability, validity statistics, and mediation analysis using the Hayes and Preacher model. Overall, the results imply that intellectual capital is significantly contributing to improving OC. Also, results revealed the partially mediating role of GSCMP in the association between intellectual capital and organizational performance. This study also highlights the GSCMP approach for creating sustainable competitive advantage, which highlights various implications for prospective academicians and practitioners.</jats:p>"

The practice of green supply chain management is one of the strategies that are well applied in the face of the challenges to the cement industry. Through the GSCM practical dimension consisting of green manufacturing, green purchasing, green transportation, and green facilities, this research will test the impact of the application of GSCM on the performance of cement companies in Indonesia. The thesis used primary data and obtained 224 respondents from 13 groups of cement companies that are part of the Indonesian Cement Association (ASI). The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and partial least squares (PLS) techniques using smartPLS software version 3.2.9. Research results show that internal environmental management influences GSCM practices and influences the performance of cement companies in Indonesia. Green purchasing only has a positive impact on operational performance and has no impact on the environmental, economic, or social performance of the company. Green transportation is positive for the economic, operational, and social performances of the enterprise but does not have an impact on environmental performance. The study also found that green supply chain management practices strengthen the relationship between internal environmental management and the performance of cement companies in Indonesia.\r\n </jats:p>"

To improve the accuracy of short-term electricity load forecasts and deeply explore the temporal characteristics of load sequences, a method is proposed to extract predictable components of load sequences based on the secretary bird optimization algorithm (SBOA)-optimized successive variational mode decomposition (SVMD). This method decomposes the electricity load sequence into multiple subsequences under different time series. The combined forecasting architecture of the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the bidirectional long short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is introduced to mine the temporal characteristics of each load component, resulting in short-term load forecasting outcomes. A case study is conducted using the annual electricity load data for the year 2018 from a specific region in Belgium. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the TCN–BiLSTM model is reduced by 47.8%, 32.8%, and 11.5%, respectively, compared to other models. The root mean square error (RMSE) is reduced by 42.9%, 39.2%, and 11.3%, respectively, and the average goodness of fit R2 is reduced by 9.81%.</jats:p>"

This study introduces a system-dynamics model that integrates five critical infrastructures—electric grid, liquid fossil fuels, Internet, transportation, and human workforce—to evaluate the resilience of food supply chains to major power outages. We validated the model using the 2019 Venezuelan blackouts as a case study, demonstrating its predictive validity. We then explored how more extreme electricity losses would disrupt the supply chain. More specifically, we modeled the impact of a large-scale cyberattack on the US electric grid and a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) event. A cyberattack severely damaging the US electric grid and allowing for recovery within a few weeks or months would lead to substantial drops in food consumption. However, it would likely still be possible to provide adequate calories to everyone, assuming that food is equitably distributed. In contrast, a year-long recovery from a HEMP event affecting most of the continental United States could precipitate a state of famine. Our analysis represents a first attempt at quantifying how food availability progressively worsens as power outages extend over time. Our open-source model is made publicly available, and we encourage its application to other catastrophic scenarios beyond those specifically considered in this work (for example, extreme solar storms, high-lethality pandemics).</jats:p>",

The results show that the local temperature on both sides of the original computer room is too high, which is because the center of the server on both sides is not effectively ventilated and dissipated. The heat dissipation effect is optimized by adding the upper and lower air vents on both sides of the room, respectively. The calculation shows that the optimization effect is obvious. The top-to-bottom air supply mode and bottom-to-top air supply mode can have a good effect on the heat dissipation of the computer room, but the top-to-bottom air supply mode has a better effect on the heat dissipation of the computer room.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Semantic segmentation of target objects in power transmission line corridor point cloud scenes is a crucial step in powerline tree barrier detection. The massive quantity, disordered distribution, and non-uniformity of point clouds in power transmission line corridor scenes pose significant challenges for feature extraction. Previous studies have often overlooked the core utilization of spatial information, limiting the network’s ability to understand complex geometric shapes. To overcome this limitation, this paper focuses on enhancing the deep expression of spatial geometric information in segmentation networks and proposes a method called BDF-Net to improve RandLA-Net. For each input 3D point cloud data, BDF-Net first encodes the relative coordinates and relative distance information into spatial geometric feature representations through the Spatial Information Encoding block to capture the local spatial structure of the point cloud data. Subsequently, the Bilinear Pooling block effectively combines the feature information of the point cloud with the spatial geometric representation by leveraging its bilinear interaction capability thus learning more discriminative local feature descriptors. The Global Feature Extraction block captures the global structure information in the point cloud data by using the ratio between the point position and the relative position, so as to enhance the semantic understanding ability of the network. In order to verify the performance of BDF-Net, this paper constructs a dataset, PPCD, for the point cloud scenario of transmission line corridors and conducts detailed experiments on it. The experimental results show that BDF-Net achieves significant performance improvements in various evaluation metrics, specifically achieving an OA of 97.16%, a mIoU of 77.48%, and a mAcc of 87.6%, which are 3.03%, 16.23%, and 18.44% higher than RandLA-Net, respectively. Moreover, comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods also verify the superiority of BDF-Net in point cloud semantic segmentation tasks.</jats:p>"

The dock is designed for operation in a river canal. In order to dock a ship, it is moved away from the quay over a dock trench. Initial requirements and design criteria for the system were determined. The most important of them include docking in the maximum weather conditions, corresponding to a wind speed of 5° Beaufort (5°B), and a zero-emission target for the power supply system (use of a renewable energy source). A wire and winch system was designed to move the dock and stabilise it in position during docking operations. The system comprises mooring wires which are tied to bollards on both quays, and wire winches mounted on both sides of the dock. The wire winches are hydraulically driven, and the hydraulic pumps, run by electric motors, are powered with batteries charged using photovoltaic panels. Statistical environmental parameters (wind, river current) were analysed and the probability of certain mooring wire loads and the corresponding wire winch power output were quantified. Based on these calculations, the power of photovoltaic panels and capacity of the batteries required to power the dock moving system were determined.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the context of logistics integration, it is important to conduct analytical activities to study the effectiveness of marketing innovations in a timely manner. To form an idea of the effectiveness of marketing activities, it is necessary to study the influence of various factors on the performance indicator, in the case of logistics, this may be the volume of transported goods. The motive for writing the article was to study the capabilities of standard software for analyzing the effectiveness of economic processes in general, and in particular the results of innovative activities. The purpose of the article is to analyze the innovation, namely the integration of the logistics space in a certain region, for four companies in the Northern Black Sea region in order to assess the potential of these companies in the provision of transport services, taking into account the implemented innovation. The study used information provided by transport companies from 2013 to 2022. The choice of the focus of the study in the field of transport support is due to the importance of the quality of transport support for the functioning of the economy, especially in the context of cross-border movement of components and goods, raw materials and finished products. For the optimal study of the innovation efficiency, studies were conducted for two periods, namely from 2013 to 2019, and from 2013 to 2022. The analysis used the tools of mathematical analysis (function derivatives) for polynomial trend equations. It was found that for all four companies that participated in the implementation of the innovation, namely in the formation of an integrated logistics space with the creation of a common rolling stock base and the search for algorithms for the most optimal use of vehicles for cargo transportation, there is a positive dynamics of the total volume of cargo transportation, which indicates the effectiveness of the innovation. The introduction of innovations in logistics is the main condition for increasing the level of transport provision of the economy, which provides opportunities for a more systematic and comprehensive development of the economy. The integration of the logistics space on the example of four companies in the Black Sea region allowed not only to improve the quality of transport services, but also to increase the total profit of the group of companies, which indicates the effectiveness of marketing innovations. The results of the study can be used to replicate the innovation to other transport enterprises both within the region and for other regions. The proposed methodology for analyzing the effectiveness of innovations can be extended to other innovations in various sectors of the economy.</jats:p>"

The selected case study focuses on the hardwoods from Cuba (as well as Mexico, Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo) shipped to Cadiz during the reigns of Philip V and Ferdinand VI, between the late 1720s and 1750s. This supply was facilitated by the naval infrastructures established in Havana and Veracruz, as well as the trade networks of the Carrera de Indias and naval squadrons that took charge of its transport. From the state shipbuilding programmes to the repair and maintenance activities motivated by the participation of vessels in the warfare dynamics of the post-Utrecht and Aix-la-Chapelle geopolitical orders, the rhythm of this transatlantic timber supply was the result of multiple factors that had a direct influence on the metropolitan demand for timber. </jats:p>",

The bullwhip effect is a significant problem observed in forecast-driven supply chains and is the major cause of disturbance in a supply chain. The bullwhip effect, or the whiplash effect, amplifies demand forecast variance as the echelons of the supply chain increase. Optimization of ordering policy is one important way of suppressing BWE. In this work, an ordering policy optimization model based on Sterman's model has been proposed. In the proposed model, new factors based on demand-forecast pattern, in conjugation with stock adjustment and supply lag adjustment, and mathematical formulation for enumeration of these factors, have been introduced to optimise the ordering policy. A comparative study of the proposed model with various existing models has also been presented to highlight its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The peculiarities of planning environmentally oriented customer service for a logistics company based on implementing \"green\" technologies are discussed in the article. It has been researched that planning is an integral part of the successful management of any company, especially in the logistics sector, where customer satisfaction and operational efficiency are key factors. Under modern conditions, to respond to customer requests, logistics companies must take into account the impact of their activities on the environment and implement appropriate methods to minimize the negative impact on the environment, and accordingly, the process of planning customer service in a logistics company should include an environmental component. Given this, the importance of integrating environmental factors and business processes at each stage of planning to ensure sustainable development of a logistics company based on forming a cyclic approach to planning environmentally oriented customer service is substantiated. The method of iterative planning that allows a logistics company not only to improve the quality of customer service but also to integrate environmental practices into its activities, which meets the modern requirements of sustainable development and social responsibility of business has been established. The developed model of environmentally-oriented planning of customer service combines business processes of logistics service and \"green\" technologies, transforms the operational efficiency of a logistics company in the context of sustainable development, substantiates the integration of environmentally sustainable solutions at all stages of the logistics chain - from initial planning to the final delivery of goods to consumers. To support the proposed model, the implementation of Power-to-X technology is recommended, which allows the conversion of excess renewable energy into energy specifically for logistics and transportation purposes. The implementation of this measure enables the logistics company to reduce emissions and increase energy efficiency, to form a comprehensive approach to the development and integration of environmentally friendly technologies in the company's logistics operations to increase efficiency and competitiveness. It is emphasized that the proposed model demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a highly efficient and at the same time environmentally sustainable logistics system of the company by integrating innovative \"green\" technologies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Over 75% of a firm's carbon footprint is attributed to logistics activities and transportation related to the acquisition, production, and distribution of materials and goods. Green supply chain management is considered a way to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change concerns. Accordingly, this study aims to investigate whether sustainable supply chain practices reduce carbon emissions and whether supplier environmental, social, and governance (ESG) training further enhances this effect, thereby reinforcing the negative association. We collected data for an international sample of manufacturing firms from Thomson Reuters Eikon for the period between 2002 and 2021 and ran a country–year fixed‐effects regression. To address endogeneity, we also utilized two‐stage least squares regression, propensity score matching, and entropy balancing. Our findings indicate that sustainable supply chain practices alleviate carbon emissions. Furthermore, we found that supplier ESG training strengthens this relationship, leading to even higher reductions in carbon emissions. Specifically, this training reinforces the negative association between sustainable supply chain practices and carbon emissions, resulting in a more pronounced decrease in carbon emissions. These results are robust to alternative proxies, samples, and endogeneity concerns. Our study highlights the importance of policy development and collaborative interorganizational actions among supply chain partners in developing solutions to climate change issues. As supply chain activities generate high levels of emissions and regulatory press is mounting, our findings may help firms take proactive actions for greener supply chain management and avoid regulatory sanctions. Additionally, we found that institutional strength stimulates firms' clean supply chain practices. Therefore, we advise policymakers to develop and implement necessary policies in less developed countries with weak public environmental regulations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impacts of climate change (CC) are intensifying and becoming more widespread. Greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) significantly contribute to CC and are primarily generated by transportation—a dominant segment of supply chains. City logistics is responsible for a significant portion of GHGs, as conventional vehicles are the primary mode of transportation in logistical operations. Nonetheless, city logistics is vital for urban areas’ economy and quality of life. Therefore, decarbonizing city logistics (DCL) is crucial to promote green cities and sustainable urban living and mitigate the impacts of CC. However, sustainability encompasses the environment, economy, society, and culture, collectively called the quadruple bottom line (QBL) pillars of sustainability. This research uses the QBL approach to review the extant literature on DCL. We searched for articles on SCOPUS, focusing on analytical scholarly studies published in the past two decades. By analyzing publication years, journals, countries, and keyword occurrences, we present an overview of the current state of DCL research. Additionally, we examine the methods and proposals outlined in the reviewed articles, along with the QBL aspects they address. Finally, we discuss the evolution of DCL research and provide directions for future research. The results indicate that optimization is the predominant solution approach among the analytical papers in the DCL literature. Our analysis reveals a lack of consideration for the cultural aspect of QBL, which is essential for the applicability of any proposed solution. We also note the integration of innovative solutions, such as crowdsourcing, electric and hydrogen vehicles, and drones in city logistics, indicating a promising research area that can contribute to developing sustainable cities and mitigating CC.</jats:p>"

However, evidence is lacking on how much campus green space is complementary to the supply and demand of PGS. For this purpose, we chose Yangling, a university town in western China, as the study area. We compared perceived accessibility and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the supply and demand of PGSs for residents with different purposes before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, when the campuses were closed or reopened. After the campus reopened, the number of blocks that were able to reach their most frequently visited green spaces within 5 min had increased from zero to one (walking) and two to four (by bicycle). The proportion of blocks with a high level of CCD had increased from 28.6% to 42.9%. The reopening of campuses can significantly increase the perceived accessibility of PGSs within 5 min and 15 min by walking and bicycle, respectively, in central urban communities, but it was not significant in suburban communities. It also effectively improved the PGS supply of the block where it is located. For residents who aim to exercise, walk, go sightseeing, and communicate, its role was similar overall. For residents who aim to play with children, the campus green spaces could not bring significant improvements. In order to enhance the complementary role of green space on campus, it is important to improve its accessibility for adjacent blocks, increase inside footpath density, and add child-friendly facilities.</jats:p>"

We estimate a collective model using data from the EU-SILC over 2004–2019 for 17 countries. Results provide evidence of the relevance of the following distribution factors: sex ratio, non-labor income, age difference, education difference, and fertility rates. The sex ratio seems to be a distribution factor in Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Switzerland. In addition, the wife’s share of non-labor income is a distribution factor in Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the UK. In Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the UK the spouses’ age gap displays opposite signs on spouses’ labor supply, whereas in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, and the UK the spouses’ education level differences display intrahousehold bargaining signs. Finally, the fertility rate is a distribution factor in Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Ireland, Latvia, Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. These results indicate that spousal- and country-specific characteristics are assessed differently across Europe and may help planners to implement household policies on cash transfers, schooling, and fertility.</jats:p>"

We rely on a rich panel dataset including 1319 Senegalese rural households collected in 2016 and 2020, during the deployment of the first phase of the Emergency Program for Community Development (PUDC). By combining propensity score matching (PSM), inverse probability weighting, difference-in-differences, and quantile regression, we find that access to piped water improves employment in the agricultural sector but has no significant impact on household expenditures. After controlling for attrition, through PSM, we find that the employment effect operates through access to a greater quantity of water and a reduction in the time women devote to water fetching chores. Moreover, when bundled with complementary infrastructure interventions such as the construction of rural roads, we find that access to water services generates an even higher impact. The quantile analysis shows that non-poor households seem to benefit more from the provided water supply infrastructure compared to poor households. Finally, when comparing the welfare effect of government-led PUDC water supply with that of community-led initiatives, our findings advocate for the widespread implementation of the former for reasons of cost-effectiveness.</jats:p>",

We will perform numerical simulations to analyze the strategic choices of each party and the relevant influencing factors. The results suggest the following: (1) The tax hike on traditional car production is less than the innovation expenses for new energy vehicles, leading manufacturers to lean towards manufacturing traditional vehicles. (2) The rise in taxes resulting from the manufacture of conventional vehicles will influence manufacturers’ strategic decisions, whereas the expenses related to technological advancements will have a more significant effect on manufacturers’ strategic choices. (3) Compared to dealers, manufacturers’ strategic choices are more significantly influenced by consumers’ awareness of low-carbon preferences. (4) In the early stages of technological innovation, the government typically offers incentive subsidies to manufacturers to boost technological innovation activities.

This study explores crucial ESG activities for sustainable digital supply chain focusing on their promotion of sustainable businesses. Initially, a literature review and experts input identified 12 potential activities. Using the Best‐Worst Method, these activities were ranked, and their interactions were evaluated through Total Interpretive Structural Modeling and the Matrix of Cross‐Impact Multiplication Applied to Classification technique. The key activities identified include “circular economy practices and waste reduction,” “energy efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions,” and “data privacy and cybersecurity.” Understanding these activities enables organizations to mitigate environmental impact, enhance social performance, and improve governance practices in supply chains. The implications extend to fostering environmentally conscious supply chains in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, aligning with “sustainable development goals,” including justice, responsible consumption, clean energy, and climate action.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management is the process of obtaining the raw materials or components needed to create a product or service for an enterprise and deliver that product or service to customers. In construction, it is vital due to the involvement of a large number of resources and stakeholders. Hence, documentation plays a very important role in such a process. Yet, there are certain issues with supply chain management documents that contribute to the various issues of construction projects, including project delays. Hence, this research aimed to identify the potential factors affecting construction projects due to poor documents in supply chain management. This study was limited to building construction projects in Sri Lanka. Agreement errors of labour suppliers and material suppliers were the main areas of concern. In order to achieve the objectives of the research, semi-structured interviews were conducted among construction professionals such as site engineers, project managers, technical officers, and Quantity Surveyors. The results of the research revealed that the documents were not prepared correctly, which indirectly caused the project to be delayed. This could happen due to various causes, such as documentation errors that take a long time to be corrected, people are not aware of the documentation required in various stages of the supply chain, and the stakeholders are not aware of the procedures correctly for each of the scenarios. Findings further revealed that errors such as delays, arithmetic mistakes, and specification inaccuracies frequently disrupt operations. To address these issues, corrective actions tailored to each document type were detailed, emphasising early negotiation, skilled personnel involvement, and rigorous verification processes. The study contributes significantly to the field by offering practical solutions that enhance document accuracy, improve supply chain efficiency, and reduce project delays. These measures not only address immediate documentation issues but also provide a framework for maintaining high standards of documentation accuracy in the construction industry, ensuring smoother operations and successful project completions.</jats:p>",

It is shown that by reducing conservatism, until the criteria for maintaining the integrity of the fuel cladding are achieved, it is possible to extend the lifetime of almost all RCCAs currently operating at Ukrainian NPPs from 25500 to 38000 hours in the control group and from 75600 to 113500 hours in the shutdown groups. However, the substantiation should be carried out for each RCCA separately, since each one has its own individual history of operation in the reactor core.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The main part of the article is devoted to the ways of increasing the efficiency and extension of RCCA lifetime, and to the development of control rods with improved characteristics. Among the proposed absorbers, the most acceptable neutron absorption efficiency is provided by metallic hafnium with an absorbing part diameter of 8.2 mm (without a cladding) and Dy2O3·HfO2 in the pellet version of filling the lower part of the control rod (up to 300 mm). In the upper part of the rod (from 300mm to 3500mm), Eu2O3·HfO2 composition can be used instead of B4C. Europium hafnate with a density of 8.0 g/cm3 and a tablet filling (6.85 mm) will exhibit an initial neutron absorption efficiency of 95.6% of B4C. The high neutron absorption efficiency will make it possible to use less efficient (n,y) absorbers with extended lifetime (Dy2O3·HfO2, Hf) with a length of more than 300 mm in the lower part without violating the neutron-physical criteria for the performance of the control rod.</jats:p>",

On this basis, the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, ordinary panel model, and spatial econometric model are used to analyze evolution pattern and driving factors of CCD between GWUE and NU. The results show that: (1) GWUE exhibits a modest downward trend, with the lower reaches being much higher than the middle and upper reaches. (2) NU has increased overall by 43.65%, showing a northeastern high and a southwesterly low spatial distribution. (3) CCD is rising, with the high-value areas mainly distribute in the Yangzhou–Taizhou region and the Southern Shandong region, while the low-value areas concentrate in the middle and upper reaches. (4) The spatial econometric model analysis shows that industrial structure, technological level, and water resource management contribute significantly directly to the CCD, but the spillover effects are markedly different.</jats:p>",

This paper argues that providing more transparency regarding green supply chains (GSCs) through eco‐labels (such as Cradle to Cradle Certified®) is critical for creating trust and convincing consumers to buy eco‐products over conventional ones. Building on previous literature related to sustainable consumption behavior, green purchasing behavior, Cradle to Cradle certification and GSC management, we develop and test a conceptual model to empirically investigate the links between consumers' trust in eco‐product labels and GSC perceptions in influencing green purchase behavior (GPB) in the case of eco‐friendly fast‐moving consumer goods (FMCGs). By studying a sample of 276 German consumers and applying structural equation modeling, we find that the trust in eco‐product labels and positive perceptions of GSCs are important drivers of GPB. Our research contributes by expanding the knowledge on the factors influencing the acceptance of eco‐products, highlighting the importance of supply chain transparency and trust in GSCs among consumers. We discuss theoretical implications for green product innovation and marketing including eco‐product labeling based on transparent GSCs.</jats:p>",

Recommendations are given regarding the operation of heat and mass exchange equipment in the fractional processing of perennial legumes, equipment for pressing in the technology of preparing concentrated fodder and adaptive vibration mill in the technology of preparing concentrated fodder.\nTherefore, the specified recommendations determine the important role of repair services of enterprises in ensuring the production of their products, but the level of technical equipment of these units, their organization and management is currently lower than in the main production. As a result, the labor intensity of repairs increases, especially unplanned and complex ones, during which various parts of technological equipment (mechanical, electrical and electronic) are restored, repair costs increase and there is a significant overspending of various types of resources. This is a consequence of the established traditions, when the repair service of machine-building enterprises, which is related to auxiliary production, is given less attention than to the main production.\nThe article also considers general recommendations that are implemented during the operation of equipment for the production of livestock products at enterprises of the agro-industrial complex. The service life of the equipment largely depends on the maintenance personnel's strict compliance with the operating rules, careful handling and clean storage of machines and devices. It has been established that from 50 to 80% of all accidents occur as a result of violations of operating rules.</jats:p>",

In this paper, under the situation of discrete decision time, combining with the objective reality, we make discrete modification to the classical Bass diffusion model (Bass model), construct a manufacturer-led, retailer-followed supply chain differential game model, analyze the optimal decision-making of the manufacturer and the retailer by combining with the theory of discrete optimal control, and then verify the conclusions by numerical simulation. The results show that: when retailers purchase directly from the manufacturer and sell in the market, the optimal pricing of the innovative product can make the supply chain as a whole, realizing Pareto optimality; consumer’s purchase regret will increase the amount of returns, which will lead to the decrease of product sales and the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer; when the innovative product accounts for a different share of the market, the impact of purchase regret on the wholesale price and the retail price are also different. Therefore, manufacturers need to have an extensive comprehension of the market to minimize the negative effects of consumer regret and returns, and to formulate a reasonable pricing strategy for their products to gain as much profit as possible.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the fast-paced world of retail, having a strong and flexible supply chain is essential for success as businesses face increasing customer expectations and market uncertainties. Edge computing is emerging as a key technology that can enhance supply chain resilience by processing data in real-time, reducing delays, and improving responsiveness. This article explores how edge computing and supply chain resilience intersect within retail marketing and how they can optimize marketing strategies and customer experiences. Edge computing works by handling data close to where it is generated, which speeds up processing and reduces delays compared to traditional cloud systems. This real-time data processing is crucial for retailers who need to manage inventory, track shipments, and adjust to market changes quickly. With edge computing, retailers can get immediate insights into their supply chains, enabling faster and more accurate decision-making. The article reviews current research and case studies to illustrate the benefits of edge computing in retail. These benefits include better inventory management through real-time updates, more personalized and engaging marketing campaigns, and increased efficiency in logistics by automating processes. Edge computing also enhances the in-store experience with technologies like augmented reality, which can boost customer interaction and satisfaction. However, adopting edge computing also comes with challenges, such as high implementation costs, the complexity of integrating new systems, and concerns about data security. The article addresses these challenges and provides strategies for overcoming them, offering practical advice for effectively using edge computing. In summary, the article argues that edge computing will be a vital factor in retail’s future success and innovation. By making supply chains more agile, responsive, and efficient, edge computing helps retailers meet market demands and stay ahead of the competition. As technology continues to evolve, the role of edge computing in improving supply chain resilience and transforming retail marketing will become even more significant.</jats:p>"

This study further investigates how ethical culture moderates this relationship. Drawing on the resource dependency theory, the study involves developing a model and validating it using multivariate analysis among 120 dyads. The findings reveal that a business-to-business firm’s overdependence on its supply chain partners can lead to it being exploited, which in turn negatively impacts its willingness to prioritize sustainability within the supply chain. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the stronger the firm’s ethical culture, the weaker the effect of overdependence on exploitation, while at a lower level of the firm’s ethical culture, the effect of overdependence on exploitation is stronger. The utilization of resource dependency theory unveils the potential downsides of overreliance on business-to-business supply chain partners and its consequences within the supply chain. </jats:p>",

Industrial symbiosis can bring an effective solution by utilizing waste heat from other industries to meet the greenhouse heat demand. This study proposes an optimization framework by which optimum symbiotic relationships can be identified. For this aim, the spatial analysis is integrated into an optimization model, in which geographical, technical, and economic parameters are considered simultaneously to identify the optimal location for developing new agricultural greenhouses. The objective function is to minimize the heating costs, that is, the investment cost of piping and electricity cost for pumping heat‐carrying fluid from supplier to demand. The model is applied to the case study of Switzerland, and currently existing municipal solid waste incinerators, cement production plants, and biogas plants are considered potential waste heat sources. Results show that the import of tomato, cucumber, and lettuce to Switzerland can theoretically be replaced by vegetable production in new waste‐heat supplied greenhouses (zero import scenarios). Accounting for the economy of scale for pipeline investment costs leads to selecting large‐scale greenhouses with a cost reduction of 37%. The optimization results suggest that 10% of the greenhouses needed to satisfy the total domestic demand for lettuce, tomato, and cucumber could be placed on a suitable land plot in the direct vicinity of a waste heat source, with low costs of waste heat supply.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we construct a game model to explore the impact of the pharmaceutical supply chain's development of online channels on supply chain members. We conclude that under the zero profits policy, increasing the public hospital's public welfare level will increase the price of drugs, decrease the price of medical services, and reduce the overall cost of patients. In addition, the greater the sensitivity of medical services, the lower the likelihood that a drug supplier will open an online pharmacy, and the lower the level of public good, the greater the likelihood that a drug supplier will open an online pharmacy. In addition, under certain conditions, patients can receive a higher level of medical service and spend less on healthcare under a dual‐channel strategy. Finally, under a dual‐channel strategy, an appropriate profit‐sharing mechanism can eliminate instability in the pharmaceutical supply chain.</jats:p>",

Addressing these requires the examination of three interconnected SC paradigms, i.e. decarbonisation, resilience, and Closed-Loop SCs (CLSCs). This paper seeks to investigate and assess the criteria for decarbonised resilient CLSCs, as influenced by the global pandemic, specifically within the context of Iran's small and medium pharmaceutical enterprises, employing a mixed-method approach. Initially, a Systematic Literature Review was employed to identify a categorised list of decarbonised resilient CLSC criteria by determining the impact of COVID-19 on SCs. Afterwards, the list was indigenised via the fuzzy-Delphi method. Two popular Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision-Making methods, i.e. fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modelling-Matrix-based Multiplication Applied to a Classification (MICMAC), were then employed to investigate the finalised criteria. This paper has innovatively enhanced these methods by incorporating a multi-scenario analysis approach. The findings indicate that technological advancements, issues related to market and communication, and raw material markets significantly affect other criteria. Transportation and logistics are also crucial in reducing lead times, waste, and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Two countermeasures are recommended for senior managers, i.e. (i) the identification and application of suitable basic and advanced technologies across each SC process and (ii) engaging in a coevolutionary process beginning with SMEs' cooperation and collaboration towards their co-creation. The importance of regulatory bodies was also emphasised in devising effective policies to improve the markets for raw materials and finished products.</jats:p>"

The intervention consisted of three changes in the supply chain: organization of more efficient transportation routes, in-depth involvement of the community in supply chain management and bundling of contraceptives with other essential medications for efficient delivery. The intervention was implemented from October 2017 to October 2018 in the Katana health zone of the South Kivu province. Although there was not a statistically significant difference in availability of contraceptives during the pilot study period, there were sharp declines in the mean length of stockouts at health facilities and the monthly transportation costs of delivering contraceptives. Overall, the pilot study demonstrated it is feasible to adapt the IPM to a new location with complex geographical, political and socioeconomical influences.

GSCMPs, structured as the single second-order independent construct, were formed by three first-order independent constructs: green eco-design (GED), green supply chain partnering (GSCP), and internal green orientation (IGO). This study proposes that GSCMPs can contribute to the overall OP, structured as the single second-order dependent construct, comprising financial performance (FP), marketing performance (MP), and environmental performance (EP) as its first-order dependent constructs. Furthermore, this research involved the mediating role of perceived competitive advantage (PCA) on the relationship between GSMPs and OP as well as the moderating role of supply chain leadership skill (SCLS) on the relationship between PCA and OP. Primary data were gathered from 340 Bangladeshi respondents involved in higher-level and mid-level management roles at different manufacturing firms using a structured survey questionnaire. Partial least square-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed for statistical analysis using Smart-PLS 4.0. GSCMPs exhibited a significant positive correlation with OP. Additionally, PCA was found to partially mediate the relationship between GSCMPs and OP, while SCLS was found to strengthen the positive relationship between PCA and OP. This study explores the GSCMPs-OP nexus in the Bangladeshi manufacturing sector, aiming to inspire further theoretical and empirical studies. The findings offer insights for policymakers and managers in formulating and executing GSCM-related policies and strategies.</jats:p>"

Focusing on the rice supply chain, the study reveals how Agri Processing Company Limited (APCL), operating as a first‐tier intermediary, effectively launched and managed different levels of intermediaries through ‘multi‐actor’ and ‘multi‐level’ management approaches to extend sustainability upstream in the rice supply chain, especially in the lower‐tiers previously considered ‘commodities with no value’. Social networking and progressive farmers played the inclusive roles of change agents in bringing all the stakeholders of a traditional and fragmented supply chain into a coordinated platform. The bottom‐up strategic management approach of APCL gained the trust of local stakeholders and buying firms, resulting in a sustainable business strategy. Increased collaboration at different levels of farming communities led to a transformed methodology for sustainable development through intermediaries. The transformed business structure and mediated governance of ‘multi actors’ supply chains revamped socio‐ecological outcomes for the lower‐tiers and improved local living conditions through economic fairness and equal opportunities. This transformation contributed to significant advances in Pakistan's rice industry towards sustainable development.</jats:p>",

Given the high maternal morbidity and mortality in northeast Nigeria, this study, rooted in the Social Ecological Model (SEM) of behaviour change, investigated the structural and cognitive barriers that limit antenatal and family planning care-seeking behaviour among households in Gombe State, Nigeria.\n<bold>Method:</bold> Qualitative in-depth interviews (IDIs), each lasting 60-70 minutes, were conducted with 56 respondents, including mothers/expectant mothers (n=15), their household decision-makers/spouses (n=16), community leaders (n=16), and primary healthcare centre (PHC) service providers (n=9). The qualitative instrument was developed and analysed based on the four core elements of the SEM: individual, relational, institutional, and community-level factors. The study was conducted in Dukku, a rural local government area (LGA), and Yamaltu Deba, a peri-urban LGA.\n<bold>Results:</bold> The findings indicate that the direct and indirect costs of care, service quality, and PHC proximity were the main supply-side barriers rooted in institutional-level factors. Most of the demand-side barriers were associated with individual (poor salience), relational (limited spousal support), and community-level (traditional maternal practices) factors of the SEM model. Optimism bias, overconfidence bias, and present bias are some of the demand-side psychological barriers that impede maternal care uptake. Similarly, supply-side barriers, such as poor quality of care, can significantly undermine individual and community-level demand for PHC-based maternal care.\n<bold>Conclusion:</bold> The SEM model offers a comprehensive framework for understanding the complex, multi-layered factors influencing care-seeking behaviours toward antenatal care and family planning.</p>"

The study employed a pragmatic research philosophy involving a structured questionnaire. The sample size included 49 mid-managers from the logistics industry who were working at Sohar Port. The study found that entry-level graduates’ characteristics and LSCM program design positively and significantly influenced the transformation of knowledge and skills. However, the organisational environment had a negative and insignificant impact on the transformation. This study revealed several dimensions that may require further research. It is pertinent to broaden the research scope to other towns, ports, and other countries in the Gulf Council Countries (GCC) to broaden the scope and generalisability of the results. According to the study findings, several recommendations are proposed for the logistics and supply chain sector in Oman to enhance the transformation of knowledge and skills by entry-level graduates, as well as for higher education institutions (HEIs). To meet the sector requirements, HEIs may improve the current university-industry collaborations by increasing the inputs of the industry in designing and developing the LSCM program. The organisational environment must reconsider the knowledge and skills transformation by entry-level graduates in their strategic plan of resources management, which must be emphasised by the remuneration system and career paths incentive. While other studies have explored knowledge and skill transformation in the context of employee training, this study aims to fill a specific research gap by focusing on the transformation of knowledge and skills by entry-level graduates, an area which has not been extensively studied before. Furthermore, this study is unique as it examines the impact of the industry’s environment, entry-level graduates’ characteristics and the LSCM program on the transformation of knowledge and skills within the unique context of Oman. This novel approach provides an opportunity to understand the specific challenges and opportunities faced by entry-level graduates in Oman and suggests strategies for addressing them.</jats:p>"

This study examines the functional profiles of bacterial communities in drinking water resources in Mega Manila, Philippines, including Laguna Lake tributaries, pre-treatment plant sites, groundwater sources, and post-treatment plant sites. Using eDNA sequencing, flux balance analysis, and taxonomy-to-phenotype mapping, we identified metabolic pathways involved in nutrient metabolism, pollutant degradation, antibio- tic synthesis, and nutrient cycling. Despite site variations, there are shared metabolic pathways, suggesting the influence of common ecological factors. Site-specific differences in pathways like ascorbate, aldarate, and phenylalanine metabolism indicate localized environmental adaptations. Antibiotic synthesis pathways, such as streptomycin and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis, were detected across sites. Bacterial communities in raw and pre-treatment water showed potential for pollutant degradation such as for endocrine-disrupting chemicals. High levels of ammonia-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria in pre- and post-treatment water suggest active nitrogen removal and pH neutralization, indicating a need to reassess existing water treatment approaches. This study underscores the adaptability of bacterial communities to environmental factors, as well as the importance of considering their functional profiles in assessing drinking water quality resources in urban areas.</jats:p>"

Aiming to solve the certification and traceability problem of tradable green certificates, this paper proposes an integrated green certificate trading protocol, which solves its double-trading problem and helps to improve the credibility of renewable energy use. The main contribution is providing a solution based on the consortium blockchain technology to solve the main challenges mentioned above. The main solved scheme designs a series of protocols, which includes a purchase protocol, payment protocol, and non-transferable protocol. The whole process ensures the credibility, traceability, and non-transferability of green certificate trading. Multiple verification measures are adopted to address security and privacy challenges in green certificate management. Through security analysis, the protocol effectively defends against attacks such as double payments, transaction rollback, and transaction replays while ensuring users’ privacy.</jats:p>"

In plants, environmental nutrients can drive trade-offs between host growth and defence and can mediate interactions between co-infecting pathogens. Nutrients may thus alter the outcome of pathogen priority effects for the host, but this possibility has received little experimental investigation. To disentangle the relationship between nutrient availability and co-infection dynamics, we factorially manipulated the nutrient availability and order of arrival of two foliar fungal pathogens (\n            <jats:italic>Rhizoctonia solani</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>Colletotrichum cereale</jats:italic>\n            ) on the grass tall fescue (\n            <jats:italic>Lolium arundinaceum</jats:italic>\n            ) and tracked disease outcomes.

This study aimed to investigate the patterns of leaf transpiration in Quercus robur and Acer campestre in a maple-oak forest under varying water supply conditions. The research was conducted in the lower third of the lower third of the north-facing slope and the middle third of the south-facing slope in the Viiskova ravine. A silvicultural and taxation survey of model trees was conducted on both sample plots, where the plantations are moderately dense. The diurnal course of transpiration patterns of these deciduous species was studied throughout the vegetation period. This physiological process reached its highest values in both species on the north-facing slope during the summer months, especially in Quercus robur. On the south-facing slope, in May and June, the average daily transpiration values in both species were almost indistinguishable. During the remaining months of the vegetation period, the intensity of water evaporation by Quercus robur leaves was statistically higher than that of Acer campestre. It was established that on the south-facing slope, under more arid conditions, this process is less active. This pertains to the daily transpiration loss of water by leaves per unit of their mass, monthly transpiration, and the intensity of this process per tree. The difference between the results of water loss by the leaves of a single Quercus robur and Acer campestre tree is significant and is attributed to the lower transpiration rate of  Acer campestre, except in May and June under xerophytic conditions, as well as the smaller leaf mass of this species. Both Quercus robur and Acer campestre are hydrostable medium-transpiring species. The maple forest on the north-facing slope evaporates 30.6% more moisture per 1 ha per vegetation period than on the south-facing slope. The results obtained indicate that Acer campestre in a maple-oak forest, under fresh and dry forest-growing conditions, does not pose a significant competition for moisture for Quercus robur when they grow together. The results obtained can be used to develop effective forest management strategies in maple-oak forest</jats:p>",

We show how hydroclimatic variability and institutional complexity can create significant uncertainty in realized water supply benefits and heterogeneity in partners’ financial risks that threaten infrastructure investment partnership viability.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transition to renewable energy is essential for mitigating climate change and ensuring long-term energy security. As global demand for renewable energy technologies grows, establishing resilient supply chains becomes crucial. This paper examines strategies to build robust supply chains, reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, and enhance energy security. A major challenge in renewable energy is the dependence on a limited number of international suppliers, which risks supply disruptions due to geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, or natural disasters. Diversifying suppliers can mitigate these risks by encouraging alternative suppliers and fostering competition (Smith, 2020). Local manufacturing is another critical strategy, promoting supply chain resilience, economic growth, and job creation. Countries like the United States and Germany have incentivized local manufacturing of solar panels and wind turbine components (Jones, 2021), ensuring a steady supply of parts and aligning with broader industrial policies. Maintaining strategic reserves of critical materials, such as rare earth elements and lithium, is essential for buffering against supply disruptions and price volatility, ensuring continuous production of renewable energy technologies (Brown, 2019). Strategic planning and investment in reserves are vital for a comprehensive energy security strategy. Technological innovation enhances supply chain resilience. Advances in materials science, manufacturing processes, and recycling technologies can reduce dependence on scarce materials and improve renewable energy system efficiency. Developing alternative materials for battery storage, for example, can reduce reliance on lithium and cobalt sourced from unstable regions (White, 2022). Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are crucial for advancing the renewable energy sector. By leveraging both sectors' strengths, PPPs can accelerate technology deployment, improve infrastructure, and foster innovation. Successful examples include government-private collaborations on offshore wind farms and smart grid technologies (Green &amp; Associates, 2021). Favorable trade policies facilitate the global exchange of renewable energy technologies and components. Reducing tariffs, streamlining customs, and fostering international cooperation can enhance supply chain efficiency and reliability (Lee, 2020). This study advocates for trade agreements tailored to the renewable energy sector's needs. Integrated energy systems and smart grid technologies optimize renewable energy use and distribution. Advanced monitoring and control systems improve grid stability, reduce energy waste, and enhance renewable source integration (Adams, 2019). Investment in smart grid infrastructure is crucial for a resilient energy strategy. Robust policy frameworks are necessary to support these initiatives. Governments must enact policies providing clear guidance, incentives, and support for resilient renewable energy supply chains, including ambitious renewable energy targets, financial incentives for R&amp;D, and regulatory stability (Martinez, 2021).</jats:p>"

This study investigated the spatial–temporal evolution of the supply, demand, and supply–demand relationships of six individual ESs and comprehensive ESs in Jiangsu Province from 2000 to 2020. It revealed the key drivers of the changes in comprehensive ecosystem services supply–demand relationship (CESSD) using a geo‐detector model and a geographically and temporally weighted regression model to address the shortcomings of previous studies. The results showed that at the provincial level, the CESSD presented a surplus while the supply–demand state tended to be imbalanced. At the 1‐km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> grid scale, the spatial heterogeneity of CESSD was obvious, with surplus supply–demand zones primarily distributed in the Taihu Lake watershed, hilly areas, riverside zones, the watershed from Hongze Lake to Gaoyou Lake, and the eastern coastal zone, while deficit supply–demand zones were mainly clustered in areas with concentrated and contiguous construction land. From 2000 to 2020, the area of deficit in CESSD increased from 626 to 3257 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and the degree of deficit gradually deepened, with socioeconomic factors having the greatest influence on changes in CESSD.

Focusing on the five southern provinces, this study explores various impacts on the power generation side and the grid side under scenarios of reduced wind and solar power output, transmission line failures, and combined scenarios, proposing strategies for constructing a new power system. The main conclusions are: the reduction in wind and solar power output significantly affects provinces with a high proportion of these installations, like Guizhou, necessitating other stable power generation forms to compensate. Transmission line failures notably impact provinces like Guangdong, which rely heavily on imported electricity, requiring increased investment in new wind and solar installations and more self-generated power to offset the reduction in imported electricity. The combination of these factors amplifies their individual impacts, leading to the highest carbon reduction and electricity costs. The simulation results of this study are valuable for China’s five southern provinces in coping with extreme scenarios. As these provinces work on building a new power system and gradually retire fossil fuel units, they should expand the number and capacity of inter-provincial high-voltage transmission lines while considering system economics. Additionally, accelerating the deployment of energy storage is crucial for maintaining power system stability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: An alternative to unsustainable urban developments, rural living is on the rise, but it already has its challenges. To that end, rural logistics and transportation (RLT) calls for a comprehensive analysis of its context, especially in a climate-changed and socially turbulent world. Unlike urban logistics, there is limited focus on RLT in academic literature. However, rural areas’ lack of transportation and limited logistics operations negatively affect rural residents’ daily lives, especially socially disadvantaged groups such as older people, children, women, and low-income households. Methods: This study first identifies the key literature on RLT and sustainability using a systematic literature review. Then, it synthesizes from the extant literature the challenges in RLT and proposed solutions to understand how to improve accessibility and address some barriers to implementation, all through the perspective of quadruple bottom line (QBL) sustainability pillars. Results: The lack of opportunities presented to rural residents due to limited RLT leads to inequality between rural and urban populations, requiring academic attention. Moreover, despite the growing emphasis on sustainability in academic literature, there is a noticeable lack of attention to sustainability in RLT. Conclusions: This study leads policymakers toward a better understanding of rural communities’ complexities, directs practitioners to adopt the QBL perspective in decision-making, and aims to stipulate innovative RLT topics for further research for academicians.</jats:p>"

A major supply disruption occurred in 2020 when Indian onion exports, crucial for Malaysia, were halted due to a severe flood in India. This study aims to forecast the impact of lifting the export bans from India in May 2024 on Malaysian onion imports over the subsequent four months. Using the moving average method for analysis, results indicated a 12.9% decrease in imports, from 47,000 Mt to 42,000 Mt. This decline mirrors trends observed over the past three years, with lower imports typically during year end. The forecasting model demonstrated strong performance, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.7% and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 29,079,653; both suggesting accurate predictions. In response to these disruptions, the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MARDI) has initiated local cultivation efforts to reduce import dependency. These measures aim to enhance domestic production and mitigate risks associated with global supply chain vulnerabilities.</jats:p>"

This study confronts the dual challenges of rebuilding Ukraine’s energy system rapidly to mitigate civilian and economic disruption while aligning this to long-term goals of sustainability and energy security. We demonstrate that Ukraine can readily meet future energy demands through a fully renewable electrified system at costs comparable to those from fossil fuels and nuclear power. Contrary to previous reliance on high-carbon energy sources, we find a diversified renewable energy portfolio, including significant solar photovoltaic and wind contributions, can efficiently meet growing energy demands and position Ukraine as an energy exporter, capitalising on its geographical advantages. This study’s approach, based on open data and models, extends beyond national borders and offers a model for post-conflict reconstruction that harmonizes immediate recovery with sustainable energy transition.</jats:p>",

The research model was assessed with 263 responses from a survey with professionals of auto-parts companies in Brazil. Data were analyzed with the Partial-Least-Squares—Structural Equation Modeling method. Cluster analysis techniques were also applied. This study found that BDACs reduce reaction time, which, in turn, improves firms’ resilience. We also observed greater effects in first-tier and in companies with longer Industry 4.0 journeys, opening further perspectives to investigate the complex mediations of digital readiness, reaction time, and organizational resilience performance of firms and supply chains. Our research builds upon the dynamic capabilities theory and identifies BDACs as dynamic capabilities with the potential to enhance resilience by reducing data, analytical, and decision latencies, which are recognized as core elements of the reaction time concept, which is particularly crucial during disruptive supply chain events.</jats:p>"

We divided our study into two time periods for a comparative analysis of key risk issues in different degrees of environmental uncertainty. The year 2020 marked the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first period of our analysis is four years covering 2016-2019, prior to COVID-19 disruptions. The second period is also four years during 2020-2023 when the full force of COVID-19 disruptions affected healthcare supply chains. The keywords used to collect news media publications were “healthcare,” “healthcare industry,” “healthcare services,” “hospital,” “health center,” and “medicine.” The results of the study indicated that the major risks experienced in healthcare supply chains were due to the following factors: the type of patients who needed healthcare services, care services provided (lab tests, treatment, prescriptions, etc.), care service methods used (surgery, utilization of medical devices), and examination and diagnostics (clinical kits, etc.). While these factors were identified as possible causes of risk in the healthcare supply chains involving procurement of supplies and raw materials, these risks tend to intensify in the increased disruption period (year 2020-2023). Managing these risk issues in the disruptive periods contributes significantly not only to the performance of healthcare organizations but also to the well-being of the society at large.\r\nThis study offers theoretical implications in that it analyzes the causes of risks in the healthcare supply chains and provides a basis for a comparative analysis of the relationships of risk factors in healthcare supply chains during a normal environment and a very disruptive environment. From a practical perspective, this study suggests effective countermeasures for managing healthcare supply chain risks with examples that can be used as a guideline by healthcare executives, managers, and policy-makers of healthcare services.</jats:p>",

Through a literature review and consultation of Chinese experts, we identify 27 barriers in six categories and prioritize these using a group‐based fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to produce novel results. First, we identify six new I4.0 adoption barriers closely linked with China's economic, social and cultural environments, including acquisition of intelligent agricultural equipment subsidies based on <jats:italic>guanxi</jats:italic>. Second, our prioritization of barriers reveals that the key challenges to applying I4.0 are the increased cost of terminal logistics, acquisition of intelligent agricultural equipment subsidies based on <jats:italic>guanxi</jats:italic>, low compatibility of I4.0 technologies with existing agricultural equipment, and problems with the government subsidy model.

In recent years, supply chain finance (SCF) has become one of the most important solutions to SMEs’ financing difficulties. Promoting the digital and innovative development of SCF can better meet the financing needs of SMEs. This study is based on a case study of Zhejiang MYbank Co., Ltd. (MYbank) in Hangzhou, China, which is a representative institution of digital supply chain finance development in China and committed to realizing the digital innovation development of SCF. Based on MYbank’s financial index data from 2018 to 2022, the implementation effect of MYbank’s digital supply chain finance is quantitatively analyzed from the perspectives of SMEs and MYbank. The main findings are as follows.(1) In the practice of digital supply chain finance, MYbank implements the new concepts of SCF decentralization and full coverage of supply chain links while enhancing the sustainability of SCF. (2) For SMEs, MYbank’s digital supply chain finance development has led to an increase in the financing scale and financing availability of SMEs. (3) The analysis of MYbank’s comprehensive benefits shows that the digital innovation development of SCF effectively increased the overall economic value of the enterprise during the period of 2018–2022. Based on these findings, this study provides implications for commercial banks and other financial institutions to develop digital supply chain finance.</jats:p>"

In HFpEF mice hearts, we found a marked decrease in cardiac glucose oxidation, which is accompanied by an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Ketones have been proposed as an extra source of fuel for the failing, heart, although it remains unclear if ketones may adversely affect glucose and fatty acid oxidation.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold>\n            13-month-old C57BL/6N female mice were administered a 60% high-fat diet and L-NAME (0.5g/L/day) for 6 weeks to induce HFpEF. Control mice were fed with regular low-fat diet and regular drinking water. Hearts of the mice were excised and perfused in the isolated working mode aerobically with 5 mM glucose, 0.8 mM palmitate, 100 µU/ml insulin, with either low (0.6 mM) or high (1 mM) levels of β-hydroxybutyrate. Metabolic rates of the hearts were measured with radiolabelled [U-\n            <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>\n            C] glucose, [9,10-\n            <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>\n            H] palmitate, and [3-\n            <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>\n            C] β-hydroxybutyrate.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold>\n            In HFpEF mouse hearts, glucose oxidation was significantly decreased with a parallel increase in fatty acid oxidation. As a result, the HFpEF hearts showed overall preserved ATP production rates (79 ± 12 vs. to 106 ± 13 μmol\n            <jats:sup>.</jats:sup>\n            g dry wt\n            <jats:sup>-1.</jats:sup>\n            min\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            control vs. HFpEF). Increasing β-hydroxybutyrate levels from 0.6 mM to 1 mM resulted in a rise in ketone oxidation rates in HFpEF hearts (from 692 ± 47 to 952 ± 90 nmol\n            <jats:sup>.</jats:sup>\n            g dry wt\n            <jats:sup>-1.</jats:sup>\n            min\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            ). Interestingly, this increase in ketone oxidation did not further compromise the rates of glucose oxidation in HFpEF hearts, but actually increased glucose oxidation rates (from 95 ± 13 to 190 ± 17 nmol\n            <jats:sup>.</jats:sup>\n            g dry wt\n            <jats:sup>-1.</jats:sup>\n            min\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            ), and had minor effects on fatty acid oxidation rates (from 796 ± 123 to 678 ± 92 nmol\n            <jats:sup>.</jats:sup>\n            g dry wt\n            <jats:sup>-1.</jats:sup>\n            min\n            <jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>\n            ). This resulted in an increase in the contribution of ketone and glucose oxidation to ATP production from 15 % to 28 % in HFpEF hearts.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold>\n            In HFpEF mice hearts overall ATP production is not impaired, but rather the heart switches from glucose oxidation to fatty acid oxidation as the main source of ATP production.

Dual-direction silicon controlled rectifiers (DDSCRs) serve as ESD protection devices with high efficiency unit area discharge, enabling bidirectional electrostatic protection. However, the high trigger voltage of conventional DDSCR makes it unsuitable for ASICs used for the preamplification of biomedical signals, which only operate at low supply voltage. To address this issue, a self-biased triggered DDSCR (STDDSCR) structure is proposed to further reduce the trigger voltage. When the ESD pulse comes, the external RC trigger circuit controls the PMOS turn-on by self-bias, and the current release path is opened in advance to reduce the trigger voltage. As the ESD pulse voltage increases, the SCR loop opens to establish positive feedback and drain the amplified current. Additionally, the junction capacitance is decreased through high-resistance epitaxy and low-concentration P-well injection to further lower the trigger voltage. The simulation results of LTspice and TCAD respectively demonstrate that ESD devices can clamp transient high voltages earlier, with low parasitic capacitance and leakage current suitable for ESD protection of high-speed ports up to 1.5 V under normal operating conditions.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, using system dynamics, a Casual Loop Diagram is presented to define the relationships between each process, and a Stock-Flow Diagram is used to develop a model for simulating the container supply process. Based on the established simulation scenarios, a simulation of the container supply process for large vessels is conducted, analyzing the impact on the container supply process based on grouped uncertainties, and identifying both positive and negative influences.

However, it may require a control system that gathers feedback signals from both the primary and secondary sides of the transformer, which in turn complicates the derivation of a standard form linear model. The absence of such a model complicates control tuning, as well as the assessment of dynamics and stability of the converter system. The objective of this paper is to address this gap in knowledge. For the case study, a conventional H-bridge converter with a step-down transformer and an αβ-frame dual-loop grid-forming controller is considered. Initially, comprehensive guidelines on deriving a standard form linear model for this converter system are presented. Then, the impact of controlling the VSC in a dq frame and the changes in the transformer vector group on the small-signal model of the VSC are analyzed. The aspects of control tuning are also discussed in detail, and the model’s accuracy and efficacy are validated both theoretically and through control hardware-in-the-loop (C-HIL) tests using a Typhoon HIL setup.</jats:p>"

В ходе исследований в среднем за 2 года наблюдалось снижение содержания подвижного калия в варианте без удобрений, биопрепарата и сидерата при всех приемах обработки почвы. Наибольшее снижение – на 34 мг/кг, или 14,5% относительно исходного его содержания 233 мг/кг отмечено при вспашке; обеспеченность почвы подвижным калием в этом вари- анте переместилась из группы со средним содержанием калия в группу с низким содержанием (199 мг/кг почвы) по методу Мачигина.

Initial indicators when starting the experiment: the content of humus in the arable soil layer (according to Tyurin) is 4.2%, mobile phosphorus and potassium (according to Machigin) is 15 and 233 mg/kg, the reaction of the soil environment is neutral (pHKCl 7.1), uneven depth of pebble (50-100 cm). The crops of spring oats (variety Konkur) were placed according to the predecessor corn in a four-field grain-row crop rotation of peas – winter wheat – corn for grain – oats. During the research, on average over 2 years, a decrease in the content of mobile potassium was observed in the variant without fertilizers, biological preparations and green manure for all soil cultivation methods. The greatest decrease - by 34 mg or 14.5% relative to the initial content of 233 mg/kg was noted during plowing and the supply of soil with mobile potassium in this option moved from the supply group with an average potassium content to the group with a low content (199 mg/kg of soil) according to the Machigin method. During disking and chiseling, the initial average level of soil supply with mobile potassium is maintained, despite a slight decrease in its quantity. The application of mineral fertilizers, a biological product and their combined use against the background of the aftereffect of green manure made it possible to increase the amount of mobile potassium and the yield of oats during plowing by 23-44 mg/kg and 0.2- 1.0 t/ha, and when disking - by 20-76 mg /kg and 0.38-1.29 t/ha, with chiseling - by 27-63 mg/kg and 0.48-1.19 t/ha, respectively. The greatest increase in the content of mobile potassium - 76 mg/kg (up to 275 mg/kg) and oat yield - 1.29 t/ha (up to 2.64 t/ha) was achieved in the variant with the combined application of N80P60K60 and a biological product for the aftereffect of green manure against the background disking, although the increase was within the level of the initial average provision according to the Machigin method. The values of the potassium balance and its intensity for all soil treatments increased from negative in variants without fertilizers (˗24-32 kg/ha with an intensity of 40-47%), when using chemicalization and biologization means, increased to 76-101 kg/ha and an intensity of 212- 235%.

Through questionnaire surveys in three cities, i.e., Malang, Bogor, and Semarang cities, we found that the majority of the residents, namely, 82%, 58%, and 66%, respectively, drank packaged water. Although the piped water supply from Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM) has a good appearance, color, taste, and water quality, sporadic microbial contamination was detected due to the depletion of residual chlorine. However, packaged water was also contaminated by indicator bacteria owing to storage methods. There was a notable discrepancy between the residents’ perceptions of tap water safety and their choices of drinking water sources. The residents perceived spring water as a clean source, which influenced their selection of water sources more than the costs of water. Public drinking stations installed by PDAM helped to win consumers’ trust in PDAM water, indicating that installing more public drinking stations will encourage more people to drink piped water.</jats:p>"

Technologies in SC networks can achieve this by establishing a link between circular economy principles and Industry 4.0. Therefore, in this study, for the first time, a novel bi‐objective mixed‐integer linear programming model is developed to design a sustainable SC network by considering circular economy practices, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and the location‐routing problem with a simultaneous pickup‐and‐delivery (P&amp;D) strategy in the electric vehicle (EV) battery industry. The proposed model locates distribution and recycling centers and considers the routing problem with the P&amp;D strategy between the distribution centers and service providers. By applying the augmented epsilon‐constraint method, a balance is established between minimizing total costs and carbon emissions, and a set of Pareto‐optimal solutions is provided. It should be noted that the P&amp;D strategy reduces the total costs and carbon emissions, and the IoT technology provides conditions for designing a secure and traceable network. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using data from an EV battery module manufacturing company in the Far East. A sensitivity analysis of the parameters related to operational costs, carbon emissions, and demand demonstrated the accuracy of the performance of the proposed model.</jats:p>",

This study integrates sustainable supply chain management with location optimization to address trade-offs from climate change, economic viability, and environmental impact while assuming the constant social obligation inherent in the supply chain structure. Methods: This study employs a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework to optimize facility locations in North Dakota, including corn production zones as suppliers and ethanol plants as consumers. Primary objectives include cost minimization and greenhouse gas reduction, enabling the prioritization of economic or environmental goals as per organizational strategies and regulations. This approach ultimately maximizes resource utilization by ensuring efficient production and distribution practices. Results: The case study results highlight the optimal selection of 20 out of 30 corn production zones to meet statewide ethanol plant demand efficiently. Using compressed natural gas (CNG) instead of diesel could potentially save USD 2 million annually and cut carbon emissions by up to 1148 thousand tons per year, demonstrating meaningful progress toward economic and environmental sustainability within the supply network. Conclusions: The presented work offers a systematic methodology for designing sustainable supply chains for various agricultural products, aligning with the broader goal of promoting sustainability and resilience for efficient agricultural production and distribution systems.</jats:p>"

Government and regulatory bodies pressure the industry to reduce GHG emissions. Industries focus on cleaner and sustainable production by adopting net zero technique practices. Achieving the net zero goal needs technological integration, such as Caron Capture Technology (CCT) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Are LCA and CCT unlocking the potential for net-zero practices in MSC? This still needs to be answered. Therefore, this study aims to identify and prioritize potential enablers of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to facilitate the NZSC. We identified potential enablers using a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and expert opinion. An empirical study validated these enablers, followed by the application of the “Best-Worst Method (BWM)” to rank them and the “Fuzzy Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (F-DEMATEL)” to identify causal relationships. The outcomes of this study reveal that ‘Energy Management and Emission Reduction’ is the most critical category of enablers, followed by ‘Governance and Collaboration’, ‘Assessment and Digitalization’, and ‘Sustainable Materials and Production’. Outcomes highlight the importance of integrating technological innovations and stakeholder engagement to achieve net-zero goals. The implications of this study provide valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners. By focusing on the prioritized enablers, the manufacturing industry can effectively implement LCA, develop the NZSC business model, and enhance competitiveness in the global market. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on sustainable manufacturing practices and offers a strategic framework for achieving NZSC by 2050.</jats:p>"

The research involved developing advanced machine learning-based zero-trust algorithms using TensorFlow, integrating SMPC protocols for secure data computation, and utilizing Apache Kafka for real-time data processing. The algorithms were tested and validated in both simulated and real-world SME environments to evaluate their effectiveness. The implementation of zero-trust SMPC algorithms led to significant improvements in various cybersecurity metrics. The true positive rate (TPR) increased from 85% to 98%, and the false positive rate (FPR) decreased from 5% to 1%. Average incident response time was reduced from 4 hours to 1 hour, and the average cost per incident decreased by 80%, with data loss per incident reduced by 90%. Compliance with GDPR and CCPA standards improved by 35.71% and 38.46%, respectively. User satisfaction increased by 41.67%, and system availability improved from 95% to 99%, with network latency decreasing by 60%. The results demonstrate that zero-trust SMPC algorithms significantly enhance financial cybersecurity for SMEs, reducing security incidents and financial impacts, improving regulatory compliance, and increasing user satisfaction and system performance. These advancements are crucial for strengthening the resilience and stability of the U.S. supply chain, supporting economic growth.</jats:p>"

Under the background of average annual precipitation, kidney bean yield increased with increasing reservoir volume and shorter irrigation cycles. Under a 4-day irrigation cycle, the water demand satisfaction rate of kidney beans reached 100% water demand when the rainwater tank size was 15.7 m3. Against the wide variation in multi-year regional precipitation from 1992 to 2023, the annual effect of rainwater harvest was simulated using precipitation data collected 20 years with an 80% precipitation guarantee rate. The average minimum yield reduction rate obtained was 9.4%, and the corresponding minimum rainwater tank size was 29.5 m3. By superimposing the rainwater harvested in the shed and nonshed areas, the volume of the reservoir without yield reduction could be reduced to 20.0 m3. The sum of discharged and inventory water was much greater than the water scarcity in each water supply situation. Simulating and analyzing the effect of the relationship between rainwater tank size and water supply on rainwater harvesting in regional farmland by year provides important data affecting the construction of regional rainwater storage facilities and water supply efficiency. To achieve a high, stable yield of kidney beans grown in a greenhouse with shed film and shed area rainwater harvesting in north China, 2.6 m3 supplementary groundwater irrigation is still needed during the annual growing season.</jats:p>"

This study analyzed the distribution of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) across various sources within the animal-based food supply chain. A total of 500 samples were collected from livestock, poultry, the environment, fisheries, and dairy. Standard microbiological procedures were employed to isolate and identify E. coli isolates, which were further confirmed using MALDI-TOF and virulence-associated genes (VAGs) such as stx1, stx2, ompT, hylF, iutA, fimH, and iss. The phenotypic resistance patterns of the isolates were determined using the disc diffusion method, followed by molecular identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through PCR. STEC were subjected to PCR-based O typing using specific primers for different O types. Overall, 154 (30.5%) samples were confirmed as E. coli, of which 77 (50%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli. Among these, 52 (67.53%) isolates exhibited an array of VAGs, and 21 (40.38%) were confirmed as STEC based on the presence of stx1 and stx2. Additionally, 12 out of 52 (23.07%) isolates were identified as non-O157 STEC co-harbouring mcr-1 and blaNDM-1. O26 STEC was found to be the most prevalent among the non-O157 types. The results suggest that the detection of STEC in food supply chains may lead to serious health consequences, particularly in developing countries with limited healthcare resources.</jats:p>"

However, it is still ambiguous whether benthic diatom assemblages can well indicate the environmental status in an urban river with highly heterogeneous habitats. This study investigated the environmental heterogeneity of an urban river and explored the response of benthic diatom assemblages to environmental changes. First, the urban river showed significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity in both physical and chemical characteristics. Higher concentrations of total nitrogen and CODMn indicated eutrophic and organic pollution conditions in the river. In addition, benthic diatom assemblages also implied the habitat heterogeneity of the urban river. Dominant diatoms, including Nitzschia palea, Melosira varians, Cyclotella meneghiniana, and Achnanthidium minutissimum, are pollution-tolerant species, further confirming the eutrophic and organic status. Then, the interaction between environmental heterogeneity and benthic diatom assemblages was analyzed by redundancy analysis and Mantel tests. Results suggested that environmental variables, such as conductivity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a, significantly affected the composition of benthic diatom assemblages in the urban river. These findings demonstrated that environmental heterogeneity shapes the benthic diatom assemblages of the urban river, and benthic diatoms can be good indicators of environmental status for urban river monitoring and assessment.</jats:p>",

Amid this variability, the Blake Plateau harbors extensive reefs formed by cold‐water corals that were previously assumed to rely on narrow ranges of temperature, currents, and particulate supply. A benthic lander collected near‐bed conditions at the Richardson Reef Complex, a cold‐water reef dominated by the scleractinian <jats:italic>Desmophyllum pertusum</jats:italic> at 830 m within the path of the Gulf Stream. Specific behavior of the Gulf Stream resulted in recurring environmental patterns at depth. During offshore meanders, deep stream components intruded onto the reef and caused rapid (3.74°C per hour) temperature increases up to 10.8°C (&gt; 5°C above the site mean) and increased chlorophyll. Within 2 d of peak temperatures, intrusions were replaced by strong, turbid upwelling currents that rapidly cooled the site to temperature minima (4.13°C). While considerable environmental variability from the Gulf Stream may otherwise implicate a thermally stressful setting for corals, high‐temperature events were likely mitigated by their short duration (&lt; 37.4 h) and physical coupling with enhanced organic material. This hypothesis was supported by high‐density clustering of <jats:italic>D. pertusum</jats:italic> occurrences within 50 km around the Gulf Stream's position along the South Atlantic Bight. This suggests that cold‐water corals experiencing environmental variability can be sustained by relationships between food supply, temperature, and currents that vary in strength along stochastic time scales, shedding further light on the niche of cold‐water corals.</jats:p>",

Efficient cooling plate design with liquid-cooled channels is crucial for temperature control.

This paper proposes a Stacking Forest Ensemble method (SFE-NET) to forecast pork supply by considering both internal and external factors, thereby contributing to sustainable pork production. We first analyze the internal factors to explore features related to pork supply. External factors such as weather conditions, gas prices, and disease information are also collected from different sources. The combined dataset is from 2016 to 2022. Our SFE-NET method utilizes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost as members and a neural network as the meta-method. We conducted seven experiments for daily, weekly, and monthly pork supply using different sets of factors, such as internal, internal and external, and selected. The results showed the following findings: (a) The proposed method achieved Coefficient of Determination scores between 84% and 91% in short and long periods, (b) the external factors increased the performance of forecasting methods by about 2% to 12%, and (c) the proposed stacking ensemble method outperformed other comparative methods by 1% to 18%. These improvements in forecasting accuracy can help promote more sustainable pork production by enhancing market stability and resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: It is known that the quality of drinking water and its availability are key factors determining health of the population. The Vladimir water supply system is one of the oldest in Russia. Today, most of the pipelines of the urban water distribution network have significant physical wear, which can significantly affect the quality of tap water.\nObjective: To assess of the quality of drinking water from centralized sources in the city of Vladimir for compliance with hygienic standards.\nMaterials and methods: Water from intake sources, before supply to the distribution system, and in the tap was tested for compliance with water quality standards. We used the results of measuring 17 water quality parameters by the accredited chemical laboratory of the Water Quality Control Center of “Vladimirvodokanal” for 2019–2023 and our own results of testing 9 water samples, three samples per district, for 20 quality indicators in the chemical laboratory of the Department of Biology and Ecology of the Vladimir State University in 2023. The “Kapel-205” capillary electrophoresis system was used to determine the ions; heavy metals were measured using the Spectroscan MAX-G X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. Other water quality parameters were established using methods of potentiometry, conductometry, and titrimetry. Classical methods of variation statistics were applied for data analysis in Microsoft Excel.\nResults: We found that, depending on the source of water intake, the levels of fluoride ions and solids in some districts exceeded maximum allowable concentrations (mean values in the Leninsky district were 1.57 mg/dm3 and 7.54 mg-eq/dm3, respectively). At the same time, our findings for the ions of iron (0.007–0.028 mg/dm3), zinc (0.054–0.078 mg/dm3), copper (0.014–0.072 mg/dm3), cobalt (0.001 mg/dm3), potassium (the mean for the Leninsky district = 0.51 mg/dm3), sodium (the mean for the Leninsky district = 5.1 mg/dm3), and sulfate (the mean for the Frunzensky district = 18.08 mg/dm3) were below the lower limits of acceptable hygienic standards.\nConclusions: The quality of water from centralized sources of the city as a whole complies with the requirements of Russian Sanitary Rules and Norms SanPiN 2.1.3684–21, except for fluoride ions and solids; yet, it does not meet some acceptable hygienic standards. Artificial drinking water mineralization is recommended to the residents of the city of Vladimir to make up for possible deficiency of essential elements.</jats:p>",

However, the environmental impacts and emission reduction pathways of the lithium supply chain have not been clearly investigated, especially between Australia and China, where most lithium ore are mined and produced. This study analyzed and compared the environmental and human health implications of six key cross-border Li supply chains from Australia to China through material flow analysis (MFA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) methods. Key findings include: (1) approximately 30% of total Li extraction is lost in the beneficiation stage due to low recovery rates; (2) the Cattlin–Yaan routes exhibit superior environmental and human health performances than other routes attributed to lower diesel consumption, reduced electricity use, and a high chemical conversion rate; (3) the Wodgina production routes have a higher carbon footprint mainly due to low ore grade and significant diesel consumption; (4) the dominant environmental implications in the supply chain are associated with refining battery-grade lithium carbonate, driven by energy use (electricity, coal and natural gas), sulfuric acid, soda ash, and sodium hydroxide. In addition, lithium carbonate refining has the highest water consumption. Overall, the analysis highlights opportunities to improve environmental performance, advance data-poor environmental assessments, and provide insights into sustainable Li extraction.</jats:p>",

Thus, in strengthening the long-term resilience and reliability of water resources, a necessity in South Africa, research on climate change and the WEF nexus is needed for water resource planning and development. Employing the WEF nexus approach, we applied the Climate Land-Use Energy and Water Strategies (CLEWS) modelling framework to assess climate change impacts on the water supply-demand relationship, considering the domestic, agriculture (irrigation) and energy generation sectors, and adopting the Buffalo River catchment, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, as a case study. A threefold approach was utilized: (1) water supplies and demands and the total unmet demands were quantified; (2) the percentages of water demands covered per sector were derived; and (3) the reliability of the water system to meet each sector’s water demands was computed. The findings projected slight decreases (2%) in the Buffalo River catchment’s total water demands towards the end of the 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century, mainly due to changes in land suitability for agriculture. While the water system is projected to be reliable for highly populated municipalities (demand coverage index &gt; 70%; reliability index ≥ 20%), it is unreliable for sparsely populated and agriculturally intensive municipalities (demand coverage index ≤ 12%; reliability index = 0%). Such unreliability will strain agricultural production as more than 70% of irrigation water demands come from these municipalities. Nexus-smart water allocation and capacity development plans are recommended to manage these challenges and ensure a just and sustainable water supply-demand relationship in light of climate change.</jats:p>"

Optimizing the linkage relationship and accomplishing the rational distribution of resources from the perspective of the supply and demand for ecosystem services (ESSD) are imperative. Thus, in this study, a numerical indicator system for ESSD from the perspective of the WFE nexus was constructed with the incorporation of the water and carbon footprint. Based on this premise, the ecological management zoning method was enhanced by integrating supply and demand risks, and optimization suggestions were proposed for various zones. The results showed that (1) carbon sequestration (CS), food production (FP), and water yield (WY) supply and demand significantly increased between 2000 and 2021. High ESSDs were concentrated in the west side of northwest China. Maize, wheat, cotton, vegetables, and garden fruits had a higher demand for ecosystem services (ESs). (2) The three ESSDs were bound in a synergistic relationship. The synergy between supply exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity, while the synergies between demand showed similar distribution patterns. (3) Regarding quantity matching, the supply for FP and CS surpassed demand, while the WY supply could not meet the demand. The three ESs’ supply and demand deficits rose. Ecological supply–demand ratio (ESDR) regional differentiation for the three ESs was apparent. Regarding spatial matching, FP and CS concentrated on low supply–low demand, while WY focused on high supply–high demand. FP risk was concentrated in Qaidam Basin, whereas WY risk was mostly in Hexi inland river basin (HX), the Yellow River Basin area (HH), and both sides of the “Qice line”. (4) The ecological management zones were formed by integrating WTL’s three dominant weak functional zones, four categorized strategy regions, and four governance models. This study can serve as a scientific benchmark for regional ecological management, which is significant in ensuring northwest China’s water, food, and ecological safety.</jats:p>"

The research results show that under certain conditions, there is an optimal joint decision on price discount and live streaming service effort. In addition, the equal proportion settlement mode provides security for brand retailers but tends to expose the anchor’s capabilities of live streaming sales. Consequently, anchors can only obtain a higher proportion of the pit fee by putting in more effort.

The majority of those hospital pharmacies reported that patients who were discharged were typically provided with discharge summaries (89.2%), medication lists (59.5%) and if needed, discharge prescriptions (67.6%) and/or required medication (67.6%). About every second community pharmacy (49.0%) indicated that up to half of the recently discharged patients who came to their pharmacy typically presented medication lists. 34.0% of the community pharmacies stated that they typically received a discharge summary from recently discharged patients at least once per week. About three in four community pharmacies (73.3%) indicated that most discharge prescriptions were dispensed in time. However, one-third (31.0%) estimated that half and more of the patients experienced gaps in medication supply. Community pharmacies reported challenges with the legal requirements – such as patients´ poor comprehensibility of medication lists, medication discrepancies, unmet formal requirements of discharge prescriptions, and poor accessibility of hospital staff in case of queries. In comparison, hospital pharmacies named technical issues, time/personnel resources, and deficits in patient knowledge of medication as difficulties.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>According to the pharmacies´ perceptions, it can be assumed that discontinuation in medication information transfer and lack of medication supply still occur today during hospital-to-home transitions, despite the new legal requirements.

This paper investigates the impact of two factors, price and quality, on the operational decisions of hybrid competing supply chains. Supply chain I, which consists of a manufacturer and a retailer, is a decentralized structure. Supply chain II, where the manufacturer and retailer are integrated, is a centralized structure. Quality investment and vertical shareholding are introduced into the decentralized supply chain. Models are constructed for three different scenarios, examining whether the manufacturer makes a quality investment and whether the retailer holds shares in the quality investment. By comparing the equilibrium results, solved by the Stackelberg game method, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) Quality investment and shareholding can enhance product quality and price. (2) The retail price in a centralized supply chain is consistently lower than that in a decentralized one, leading to generally higher total profits for centralized supply chain. (3) The total profit of the decentralized supply chain only exceeds that of the centralized ones when the degree of substitution between products is lower than 0.6285 and the quality effort cost factor is within a specific range. While centralized supply chain is generally more advantageous, decentralized supply chain can outperform him under specific conditions.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to evaluate the sustainability aspect that affects rainwater harvesting based on five sustainability factors. Stages of the research methodology; 1) Preparation of the research area and respondents, 2) Collecting data through survey methods using interview techniques to obtain related data, 3) Conducting data analysis and characterizing the sustainability of rainwater harvesting, using multi-aspect analysis based on developed factors and attributes, and 4) Using two scenarios reasonably sustainable circumstances urban rainwater harvesting variables, adapting management strategies should be developed based on the urban rainwater harvesting sustainability research, which is in a reasonably sustainable environment. The results show that the sustainability status of urban rainwater harvesting in the City of Balikpapan is relatively consistent, with an indicator of 44.77%. Institutional and technological infrastructure are aspects of low sustainability. To raise sustainability status to 'sustainable,’ then choose scenario number 1, that is a realistic scenario in which the 10 sensitive factors are upgraded, thereby raising the sustainability indicator to 65.52%. The most sensitive attributes to be improved are poor groundwater quality, availability of funding for rainwater harvesting, need for roof cleaning, need for collaboration between stakeholders, and reduction of conflict over taking water sources.</jats:p>"

The introduction of the quadratic term results in significantly larger maximal Lyapunov exponents (MLE) compared to the original model, indicating increased system complexity. The existence, uniqueness, and Ulam–Hyers stability of the proposed system are verified. Additionally, we establish the global Mittag-Leffler attractive set (MLAS) and Mittag-Leffler positive invariant set (MLPIS) for the system. Numerical simulations and MATLAB phase portraits demonstrate the chaotic nature of the proposed system. Furthermore, a dynamical analysis achieves verification via the Lyapunov exponents, a bifurcation diagram, a 0–1 test, and a complexity analysis. A new numerical approximation method is proposed to solve non-linear fractional differential equations, utilizing fractional differentiation with a non-singular and non-local kernel. These numerical simulations illustrate the primary findings, showing that both external and internal factors can accelerate the process. Furthermore, a robust control scheme is designed to stabilize the system in finite time, effectively suppressing chaotic behaviors. The theoretical findings are supported by the numerical results, highlighting the effectiveness of the control strategy and its potential application in real-world supply chain management (SCM).</jats:p>"

The problem to be solved is a set of factors aimed at reducing the index of the average duration of long interruptions and the index of the average frequency of long interruptions (SAIDI, SAIFI), taking into account and applying effective measures of stimulating tariff formation (Rab - tariff) aimed at providing quality services to consumers of electric energy in accordance with the guaranteed standards established by the Resolution of the NCRECP. The analysis of the main indicators of the quality of SAIDI and SAIFI services for the period from 01.01.2022 to 03.31.2022 was carried out on the example of the operator of the distribution system JSC \"Kharkivoblenergo\". The impact of natural and unnatural factors on the formation of these indicators is analyzed, taking into account force majeure circumstances and military aggression on the territory of the Kharkiv region. The changes in the quality indicators of SAIDI and SAIFI services and their compliance with the normative values established by the NCRECP were analyzed. The conducted analysis of SAIDI and SAIFI service quality indicators allows us to state that achieving the target values of electricity supply continuity indicators is a fundamental factor for improving the quality of electricity supply services to consumers. The provision of the necessary guaranteed quality standards for the supply of electric energy to consumers is substantiated taking into account the stimulating tariff formation (Rab - tariff). It is shown that the introduction and development of stimulating tariff formation lays a reliable foundation for a strong and competitive Ukraine on the territory of the European Union and introduces dynamic development for a strong and independent Ukrainian economy.

This dipole PV pattern leads to anomalous descents in the YRD and associated anticyclones in the lower troposphere. As a result, the increased adiabatic heating and incident solar radiation cause the extreme daytime heat. The enhanced humidity in the YRD increases the downward longwave radiation, resulting in the extreme nighttime temperatures. As the increased temperature and humidity enhance stratification stability in the lower troposphere, the coupling between daytime and nighttime heat extremes persists, leading to a compound heatwave. During a YRD compound heatwave, the 10–30-day atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) exerts a potential influence on the electricity demand and supply. Continuous extreme heat leads to a dramatic surge in cooling demand. While the influence of 10–30-day ISO on wind energy resources is weak, the dipole pattern of 10–30-day PV anomalies strongly reduces solar energy resources over the mid–lower reaches of the Yellow River, thus exerting greater challenges for electricity supply to the YRD.</jats:p>",

We investigate both ex ante and ex post information sharing arrangements. Under each arrangement, the supplier needs to determine the sequence of the wholesale price setting and the information sharing stage. We find that (1) under ex ante information sharing, if the supplier sets the wholesale price before, the online platform always shares private information; otherwise, it prefers to share only when the commission fee is large. Interestingly, the online platform's information sharing incentive is independent of signal accuracy and market variability. (2) Under ex post information sharing, the online platform may manipulate the signal shared with the supplier. We characterize the conditions and influencing factors of truthful information sharing. (3) If the conditions for information sharing can be achieved, the supplier prefers to set the wholesale price later. Otherwise, the supplier sets the wholesale price before inducing the online platform to share information.</jats:p>",

This paper explores the decision-making problem of a low-carbon supply chain considering the heterogeneous preferences of consumers under different CSR situations, analyzes the influence of important parameters on each equilibrium solution, compares the size relationship of each equilibrium solution under different CSR situations, and verifies the conclusions obtained through numerical simulation. Then, based on the obtained equilibrium solution, a CSR evolutionary game model of the low-carbon supply chain is constructed, and the evolutionary stability strategies of the two sides on the CSR game are solved. Finally, the evolutionary trajectory of the game system is intuitively presented using a simulation method, and the influence of the main parameters on the evolutionary trends of the two sides is analyzed. The findings are as follows: (1) When both manufacturers and retailers undertake CSR, the retail price and wholesale price are their lowest, while carbon emission reduction, total market demand, manufacturer utility, retailer utility, and supply chain total utility are the highest. (2) When a company undertakes CSR, carbon emission reduction, total market demand, manufacturer utility, retailer utility, and supply chain total utility all increase with the increase in the CSR degree of the company and the ratio of the potential scale of low-carbon consumers to the potential scale of ordinary consumers. (3) The evolutionary stability strategy for both manufacturers and retailers is to undertake CSR. In addition, the initial proportion of manufacturers and retailers that undertake CSR, the low-carbon preference of low-carbon consumers, and the increase in the ratio of the potential scale of low-carbon consumers to the potential scale of ordinary consumers can encourage both members of the supply chain to undertake CSR.</jats:p>"

Die größten Schwierigkeiten bestehen in der Umsetzung interdisziplinärer Zusammenarbeit und der Anwendung der in Reviews formulierten Medikamentenempfehlungen durch die zuständigen Ärzt*innen. Gleichzeitig wird die zentrale Rolle der Pflegenden im Gesamtprozess zu wenig beachtet und aktiv gefördert, was ein weiterer Grund für die Schwierigkeiten bei der Umsetzung in der Praxis sein könnte.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n              <jats:title>Schlussfolgerungen</jats:title>\n              <jats:p>Es zeigen sich fast keine signifikanten Veränderungen als Folge der in den gesichteten Studien durchgeführten Interventionen.

In the study, the North China Plain was selected as the study area, and the Patch-Generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) model and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model were comprehensively applied to set up three land use policies, predict land use changes in 2030, and calculate carbon stock changes. Meanwhile, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used to analyze the degree of influence of different drivers on the supply of carbon stocks in different urbanization regions. Studies show that if the North China Plain prioritizes economic development, the area of farmland and forests will significantly decrease, leading to a substantial decline in carbon stocks. If ecological protection is the development focus, the reduction in farmland and forests will be less, and carbon stocks will remain relatively stable. If farmland protection is the development focus, the reduction in farmland will be minimal, but there will still be some impact on carbon stocks. The driving forces of carbon stock supply vary significantly across different regions. In underdeveloped regions, population density and vegetation cover have a greater impact on carbon stocks. In developing and urban–rural combined regions, vegetation cover and population migration have a greater impact on carbon stocks. In developed regions, the area of artificial land and gross domestic product (GDP) have a greater impact on carbon stocks. The study results provide scientific evidence for regional land use planning and policy formulation.</jats:p>"

Our global analysis highlights a few salient points: (i) a mismatch between economical hydrogen production and hydrogen demand across continents seems likely; (ii) region-specific limitations are inevitable since possibly more than 60% of large hydrogen production potentials are concentrated in water-scarce regions; and (iii) upscaling electrolytic hydrogen production could be limited by renewable power generation and natural resource potentials.</jats:p>"

Humate ureas stimulated soil mineral N accumulation and balanced the soil nitrate–ammonium ratio at 1:1; however, no significant difference existed between the two humate ureas under 60% WFPS. Humate urea enhanced soil ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) retention and delayed nitrate nitrogen (NH4−-N) release, leading to soil mineral N retention, especially in lignite humic acid urea (H2AU) treatments from lignite under flooding. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and linear regression revealed that humic acids elevated soil redox potential (Eh) and electrical conductivity (EC), stimulating soil N mineralization and adjusting the optimal nitrate–ammonium ratio. Humate urea improved soil mineral N supply compared to traditional urea treatments, and humic acids from lignite were more beneficial for crop cultivation from a mineral soil N supply perspective.

In Vietnam, goat numbers grew remarkably faster at 103% in the same period. To understand the reasons for this rapid growth and implications, we explored the characteristics of Vietnamese goat supply and demand and identified risks and opportunities for smallholder goat producers. Our analysis finds that the continued growth of goat consumption in Vietnam is driven by Vietnam’s: (1) large and growing population (97.3 million) and economy; (2) high meat consumption relative to Gross Domestic Product; (3) high social value placed on goat consumption; (4) increasing popularity of meat consumption; (5) established socio-cultural goat consumption practices; (6) increasing preference for grass-fed meat; and (7) increasing supply from neighbouring countries. As a result, growth in Vietnamese goat meat prices has continually outperformed growth in goat supply over the past decade. Supply is mainly produced by thousands of smallholder farmers in Vietnam and neighbouring Laos. Hence, there are important livelihood and rural development opportunities for producers to increase and diversify into goats. In Laos, each additional goat sold represents a 4.75% increase in smallholder household income per year. To reduce risks to goat producers, research is needed to: (1) forecast the current and future demand for goats in Vietnam to prevent oversupply leading to price collapse; (2) understand how premiums are awarded for goat characteristics; (3) investigate pathways for formalising trade and its impacts on smallholders; and (4) establish strategies for producers to improve supply without degrading natural resources, or increase disease outbreak risk.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In resource extraction regions, nation-states tend to be depicted as the legal authority sanctioning profitable mining operations in close collaboration with corporate actors in their domestic territories. Especially in post-colonial contexts, corporate sovereignty is the term deployed by anthropologists to depict the acts of power by legally sanctioned corporate actors within a space of negotiation authorised by the state. A problem arises with this framing of sovereignty in contexts where the international norms of liberal democracy and development are violated due to constraints on the domestic authority of the state. In this scenario, the international order imposes itself to restore the authority of the state by governmentalising the security, territory, and market access of the state. Through ethnographic and field survey research in south Kivu of eastern Congo, I argue that the restoration and extension of state authority is a grant given to the state on condition of the responsible exercise of norms and practices of international markets. The tin, tantalum and tungsten (3T) mineral supply chain in south Kivu are an example of such a grant extended by international market actors and their related resource policy regimes to strengthen the state by franchising its apparatuses through practical mechanisms and discourse aimed at implementing traceability of so-called conflict minerals. Here, sovereignty is a position that is made by international market rule delivered through infrastructure in the form of 3T-mineral supply chains that franchise the state with the aim of optimising its fiscal reach and penetration among upstream mineral producers in south Kivu. </jats:p>",

Our case study, based on a worker survey and semi-structured interviews across GVC actors, focuses on forced labour in the Malaysian medical gloves sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, linking production in Malaysia, end markets in the UK (primarily through procurement for the National Health Service) and migrant-sending countries, especially Nepal. We analyze the intermeshing effects of the different roles of states, operating at either the horizontal or vertical level of GVC governance, in terms of contributing to issues of forced labour. We identify three state roles in the Malaysia–UK medical gloves chain: producer state (Malaysia), migrant-sending state (Nepal) and regulator-buyer state (UK). We also identify some of the most persistent barriers to resolving forced labour in the value chain. Our research illustrates that Malaysia’s complex regulatory, political and institutional dynamics most directly influence forced labour in gloves production, but Nepal’s migration policies and the UK’s healthcare procurement practices also create forced labour risk in Malaysia. Advancing Gereffi and Lee’s (2016: 25) notion of “synergistc governance” and Jessop’s (2016) strategic-relational approach (SRA) to the state, we thus argue that the creation of sustained and positive regulatory synergies among states differently positioned in GVCs is necessary for the prevention and elimination of forced labour. </jats:p>",

The main problem of the microgrid capacity sizing is making a compromise between the planning cost and providing the EV charging load with a renewable generation-based system. Hence, obtaining the optimal capacity for the microgrid components in order to acquire the desired level of reliability at minimum cost can be challenging. The proposed planning scheme specifies the size of the renewable generation and battery energy storage systems not only to maintain the generation–load balance but also to minimise the capital cost (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX). To study the impact of renewable generation and EV charging uncertainties, the information gap decision theory (IGDT) is used to include risk-averse (RA) and opportunity-seeking (OS) strategies in the planning optimisation framework. The simulations indicate that the planning scheme can acquire the global optimal solution for the capacity of each element and for a certain level of reliability or obtain the global optimal level of reliability in addition to the capacities to maximise the net present value (NPV) of the system. The total planning cost changes in the range of GBP 79,773 to GBP 131,428 when the expected energy not supplied (EENS) changes in the interval of 10 to 1%. The optimiser plans PV generation systems in the interval of 50 to 63 kW and battery energy storage system in the interval of 130 to 280 kWh and with trivial capacities of wind turbine generation. The results also show that by increasing the total cost according to an uncertainty budget, the uncertainties caused by EV charging load and PV generation can be managed according to a robustness radius. Furthermore, by adopting an opportunity-seeking strategy, the total planning cost can be decreased proportional to the variations in these uncertain parameters within an opportuneness radius.</jats:p>"

Despite focusing on improving its own green standards, the supply chain needs to establish stable cooperative relationship. Thus, we focus on a supply chain consisting of a dominant manufacturer and a retailer, where the manufacturer opts for implementing blockchain and the retailer selects their stance on fairness. We construct a Stackelberg game model and use backward induction to obtain the equilibrium solutions. In the supply chain, the highest profits can be achieved when the manufacturer adopts blockchain technology, provided that the cost of application is relatively low. For manufacturer and retailer, when the cost of applying blockchain is relatively low, they can both obtain maximized profits without applying blockchain and the retailer does not have fairness concerns. However, as the cost of inducing blockchain and the product’s reduction in carbon emission increase, the optimal strategies for manufacturer and retailer begin to diverge, which may affect the stability of the supply chain.</jats:p>"

Hence, we propose a new ARIMAX‐LSTM hybrid forecasting model that integrates ARIMAX and LSTM models to improve the ability to capture different combinations of linear and nonlinear patterns in time series. Our proposed model is validated in a case study of coffee demand in Vietnam. The case study results show that our proposed model outperforms the well‐known single and current hybrid models regarding performance measures and degree of association. Moreover, to prove the model's robustness, we test and compare our proposed model to the previous study for Thailand's agricultural products (pineapple, corn, and cassava). Computational results demonstrate that our hybrid model is superior in the majority of experiments. It has a strong capability of predicting complex time series data. Furthermore, our proposed method increases forecasting accuracy and enhances supply chain performance (measured by the bullwhip effect; net‐stock amplification, and transportation cost.</jats:p>",

Herein, this work synthesizes and assembles a biomimetic materials system (BMS) consisting of an artificial plant, a hemispherical glass cover, and a reflective plate, capable of non‐selective and highly efficient remediation of soil contaminated by various HM ions under sunlight. Specifically, a water cycle is driven to establish between the soil, artificial plant, and atmosphere by solar energy in the BMS, which induced water‐soluble HM ions to enrich and precipitate at the top edge of the artificial plant. The formed HM precipitate is easily removed, contributing to the extremely strong recyclability of BMS. This system has significant advantages in terms of soil properties, contamination characteristics, energy consumption, processing time, and removal amount over other representative remediation methods, demonstrating its great potential for practical application in the remediation of various HM‐contaminated soils.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Standalone electric power supply systems that integrate wind and photovoltaic (PV) technologies are widely employed in various applications. These systems require a battery storage system to ensure a continuous power supply, regardless of changes in loads, wind speed, and solar irradiance. To ensure a reliable and uniform power supply, several modifications need to be implemented in these hybrid systems. Power quality is an essential parameter in autonomous power systems, especially those that depend on hybrid energy sources. The battery should undergo the process of charging when there is an excess of energy and discharging when there is a demand from the loads. To achieve this, a bidirectional power flow circuit is utilized to establish a connection between the battery and the network, incorporating an appropriate controlling mechanism. Even in scenarios where there is only partial shading, a Modified Invasive Weed Optimization technique is employed to achieve the most efficient power operation of the photovoltaic (PV) system. Additionally, a Sliding Mode Control strategy is utilized for the wind turbine. This research investigates the application of multiple photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind turbines, each configured with different arrangements of parallel and series combinations of PV panels. The goal is to determine the appropriate rating for the power supply system. The control units in this hybrid standalone power system utilize artificial neural network (ANN) controllers that are based on long short-term memory (LSTM). The aforementioned controllers, when combined with the proposed control methodologies, improve power quality in various scenarios. The results of this investigation are presented using Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) on the OPAL-RT platform to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methodology.</jats:p>",

Here, we propose a gas supply system for tri-gas multi-channel cell incubators to meet the specific needs of various cells. The system utilizes a circulating gas supply method powered by air pumps for each chamber. Gas inflow from the cylinder is independently controlled by Mass Flow Controllers (MFCs), and a quantitative step-by-step adjustment control strategy is employed to calculate the volume of different gases being introduced. Through mixing simulations and experiments, we identified the SV static mixer with an L/D ratio of 2.5 as the optimal choice. To evaluate the concentration accuracy and gas consumption of the gas system, we conduct gas mixing and distribution experiments under different conditions. The results show that the system could achieve a concentration range of 0–100% for O2 with an accuracy of ±0.5%, and a concentration range of 0–10% for CO2 with an accuracy of ±0.1%. The daily gas consumption during cultivation is 3570 mL of N2, 330 mL of CO2, and 115 mL of O2, significantly lower than conventional incubators. Overall, our system can effectively manage dynamic gas concentration changes, particularly in high O2 concentration environments. It offers advantages such as low gas consumption, a wide concentration range, and high accuracy compared to existing incubators.</jats:p>"

To further enhance the accuracy of runoff prediction, this study proposes a FA-LSTM model that integrates the Firefly algorithm (FA) with the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). The research focuses on historical daily runoff data from the Dahuangjiangkou and Wuzhou Hydrology Stations in the Xijiang River Basin. The FA-LSTM model is compared with RNN, LSTM, GRU, SVM, and RF models. The FA-LSTM model was used to carry out the generalization experiment in Qianjiang, Wuxuan, and Guigang hydrology stations. Additionally, the study analyzes the performance of the FA-LSTM model across different forecasting horizons (1–5 days). Four quantitative evaluation metrics—mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Kling–Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE)—are utilized in the evaluation process. The results indicate that: (1) Compared to RNN, LSTM, GRU, SVM, and RF models, the FA-LSTM model exhibits the best prediction performance, with daily runoff prediction determination coefficients (R2) reaching as high as 0.966 and 0.971 at the Dahuangjiangkou and Wuzhou Stations, respectively, and the KGE is as high as 0.965 and 0.960, respectively. (2) FA-LSTM model was used to conduct generalization tests at Qianjiang, Wuxuan and Guigang hydrology stations, and its R2 and KGE are 0.96 or above, indicating that the model has good adaptability in different hydrology stations and strong robustness. (3) As the prediction period extends, the R2 and KGE of the FA-LSTM model show a decreasing trend, but the whole model still showed feasible forecasting ability. The FA-LSTM model introduced in this study presents an effective new approach for daily runoff prediction.</jats:p>"

The impact of cultivar-by-nitrogen (N) interactions on the maize-root microbiome remains unclear, yet it is crucial for understanding N use efficiency in maize. This study evaluated the effects of maize cultivars and N forms, along with their interactions, on the diversity and composition of root bacteria and fungi. Additionally, we examined correlations between soil microbes and root metabolites. The maize cultivar Zhengdan 958 (ZD958) showed a positive response to the mixture of nitrate and ammonium N, resulting in increased in biomass, grain yield, shoot N content, grain N content, and root area. In contrast, the cultivar Denghai605 (DH605) did not exhibit a similar response. The diversity and composition of root bacteria and fungi differed between ZD958 and DH605. The N form primarily affected the community structure of rhizospheric fungi in ZD958 and rhizospheric bacteria in DH605, rather than endophytic microbes. A mixed N supply increased the relative abundance of Basidiomycota, which was positively correlated with ZD958 yield. For DH605, a mixed N treatment enhanced nitrification functions involving Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while it reduced the effects of ammonium N supply. The dominant rhizospheric microbes in DH605 showed a stronger response to changes in root metabolites compared to those in ZD958. A mixed N supply increased the content of palmitoleic acid in ZD958 root exudates, facilitating the recruitment of beneficial rhizospheric microbes, which promotes maize growth. In DH605, a mixed N supply decreased the concentration of sphinganine, which is significantly correlated with Acidobacteria (negatively), Proteobacteria (negatively), Bacteroidetes (positively), and TM7 (positively). Our findings suggest that different maize cultivars respond differently to N forms, causing distinct rhizospheric microbial effects, and that root metabolites send metabolic signals to regulate and recruit key bacterial and fungal communities.</jats:p>"

We take the Yangtze River Economic Belt as an example and use multi-source data to analyse land use and cover change, as well as the spatiotemporal evolution of ESSD and human well-being. We explore and reveal the coupling coordination relationship between ESSD and human well-being. The results show that from 2000 to 2020, the overall trend in ESs in the region improved significantly, and the supply notably increased, whereas the demand growth rate was even more pronounced. The supply–demand ratio for water yield and soil conservation showed little change, with variations of &lt;10%. However, the supply–demand ratio for carbon sequestration declined significantly by 41.83%, whereas that for food supply increased notably by 42.93%. The overall spatial pattern in ESSD presented a mismatch, which was characterised by ‘low supply and high demand in the eastern region and high supply and low demand in the western region’. Overall, human well-being remained stable and was in line with the level of socio-economic development, thereby exhibiting a distinct trend of well-being ‘polarisation between the rich and poor’. Well-being was higher in the eastern and central urban agglomerations and lower in the western plateau and mountainous areas. Over 20 years, the degree of coupling coordination between ESSD and human well-being increased by 0.0107, and the coupling level gradually transitioned from moderate imbalance to moderate coordination. Spatially, Hubei Province, Chongqing Municipality and the Yangtze River Delta were the main ‘high–high’ agglomeration areas, whereas the Sichuan Basin and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau were the main ‘low–low’ agglomeration areas. Based on these findings, we propose the following management recommendations for the Yangtze River Economic Belt and other related great river economic belts: optimise land use structure, rationally allocate natural resources, strengthen regional and external connections and promote regional coordinated development, enhance the implementation of policies for ecological and environmental protection, establish regional ecological compensation mechanisms and coordinate ecological protection in a full scope and focus on harmonising human–land relationships, build a multi-stakeholder collaborative governance mechanism and promote regional ecological protection and the elevation of human well-being.</jats:p>"

The motivation of this paper is to reveal the government’s promotion mechanism for the green development of the supply chain. To achieve this objective, an evolutionary game model (EGM) method is applied in this paper. The specific steps of this method include the following: a unified theoretical analysis framework was first developed in which integrated suppliers (ISs), government agencies (GAs), and financial institutions (FIs) were integrated into the EGM. Second, on the basis of dynamic evolution and differential equations, the evolution and stabilisation strategies of the stakeholders were examined separately. Finally, adopting a supply chain that includes ISs, GAs, and FIs as a case study, stability strategies under changes in various parameters were investigated. The research results indicated that the behavioural strategies of GAs could serve as a weathervane for ISs and FIs. Within a certain range, government compensation mechanisms could positively impact product R&amp;D, as well as IS green development, while the government subsidy phase-out system could be more suitable at the maturity stage. The contribution of this paper is to provide methodological support for the operational decision-making of GAs, FIs, and ISs.</jats:p>"

Based on field observations during the late summer of 2019, the physical controls of nutrient supply and the subsequent influences on phytoplankton chlorophyll‐a (Chl‐a) regime were investigated in the ECS. The coastal upwelling originating from the Kuroshio Subsurface Water (KSSW) intrusion serves as a nutrient source on the inner East China Sea (ECS) shelf, and this inshore upwelling combined with the coastal water largely governs the surface Chl‐a patterns. The halocline, thermocline and nutricline exhibit a vertically synchronous fluctuating phenomenon, and the coexistence of several subsurface cold rings/patches was significantly observed on the middle‐outer ECS shelf, indicating intense vertical advection and the occurrence of upwelling. The subsurface cold rings greatly regulate the vertical hydrodynamics, constituting unique upward pathways of the onshore intruded KSSW on the middle‐outer shelf. Nutrients can be upwelled within these cold rings to support primary production, thus partially leading to the spatial variability of subsurface Chl‐a maximum in terms of intensity and depth. Our findings would considerably contribute to our understanding of the physical‐biogeochemical‐ecological processes on the ECS shelf.</jats:p>",

Nitrogen (N) fertiliser has an important role in promoting crop growth, especially under abiotic stresses. However, its contribution to alleviating heat stress (HS) inhibition on maize photosynthesis during early grain‐filling stage is still unclear. Experiments with three N rates (LN, low nitrogen; MN, medium nitrogen; HN, high nitrogen) and two temperature (HS, heat stress; CK, ambient temperature as control) regimes were conducted to examine the effects of increasing N supply on photosynthesis, N assimilation, antioxidant system, and hormones homeostasis of maize during early grain‐filling stage using two maize hybrids Xianyu335 (XY335, heat‐sensitive) and Zhengdan (ZD958, heat‐tolerant). HS negatively affected photosynthesis of both two hybrids, exhibited lower net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content and activities of Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) compared with CK, and then decreased dry matter accumulation of maize, with a lesser extent for ZD958 than XY335. However, increasing N supply alleviated the adverse effects of HS on maize photosynthesis due to improved N assimilation capacity. Under HS condition, greater N content and higher activities of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase in maize ear leaf were found in treatment of HN compared with LN and MN. HN with higher N assimilation capacity directly increased the net photosynthetic rate due to improved chlorophyll content, activities of Rubisco and PEPC and antioxidant capacity. HS‐induced abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation was also repressed by HN, and then enhanced the stomatal conductance and transpiration rate to maintain higher photosynthetic capacity compared with LN and MN. Moreover, the positive effects of increasing N supply on maize photosynthesis under HS condition exhibited a larger extent for XY335 than ZD958. As a result of improved photosynthesis and N assimilation capacity by adequate N supply, maize accumulated more biomass under HS, especially for heat‐sensitive hybrid.</jats:p>",

On the recovered artifacts, macroscopic (to characterize its colour, fracture, and cortex), microscopic (by means of a petrographic microscope) and technomorphological analysis were conducted. The quartzites show varied knappable quality, with a predominance of good and very good fractures, with smooth and bright fracture surfaces. The colours are presented in a limited range, with predominance of ochre and pink. Among the recovered artifacts are cores in different stages of reduction and preparation, tools, and flakes.

In this paper, considering the government’s green subsidy to the leading enterprises in the green supply chain of livestock products, the article uses the stackelberg game method to establish the decision-making models of the green supply chain of livestock products led by the co-operatives and the slaughtering and processing enterprises, respectively, and measures the optimal greenness of the livestock products. Different from the previous optimal decision-making and coordination of interests in the case of only considering economic benefits, this paper combines economic and ecological benefits to construct a coordination mechanism of interests in the green supply chain of livestock products in line with the concept of ecological priority and green development. The conclusions showed that: (1) Under the background of considering economic and ecological benefits, the influence of greenness sensitivity factor, freshness sensitivity factor, and government subsidy factor on the decision-making of green supply chain of livestock products is not affected by the operation mode and decision-making scenario, with the increase in the three factors, the greenness, freshness, and total benefits of the green supply chain of livestock products. (2) The greenness, freshness, and total benefits of green supply chain of livestock products are higher in the operation mode led by slaughtering and processing enterprises, which is more favorable to the development of green supply chain of livestock products from the perspective of supply chain development. (3) Compared with decentralized decision-making mode, both benefit-sharing and cost-sharing contracts increase the greenness and freshness of livestock products, significantly reduce the retail price of livestock products, which improves the benefits of the co-operatives, slaughtering and processing enterprises, 3PL (third-party logistics) service providers, and retailers as well as the entire green supply chain of livestock products. Based on the research findings, this article proposes relevant management insights to better promote the coordination of interests in the green supply chain of livestock products.</jats:p>"

This study comprehensively analyzes the species diversity, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence factors of Staphylococci in salad vegetables from markets in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A total of 343 salad items were sampled from three major cities in the UAE from May 2022 to February 2023 and tested for the presence of Staphylococcus spp. using standard culture-based methods. Species-level identification was achieved using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using the VITEK-2 system with AST-P592 cards. Additionally, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of ten selected isolates was performed to characterize antimicrobial resistance determinants and toxin-related virulence factors. Nine Staphylococcus species were identified in 37.6% (129/343) of the tested salad items, with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) dominating (87.6% [113/129]) and S. xylosus being the most prevalent (89.4% [101/113]). S. aureus was found in 4.6% (14/343) of the salad samples, averaging 1.7 log10 CFU/g. One isolate was confirmed as methicillin-resistant S. aureus, harboring the mecA gene. It belonged to multi-locus sequence type ST-672 and spa type t384 and was isolated from imported fresh dill. Among the characterized S. xylosus (n = 45), 13.3% tested positive in the cefoxitin screen test, and 6.6% were non-susceptible to oxacillin. WGS analysis revealed that the cytolysin gene (cylR2) was the only toxin-associated factor found in S. xylosus, while a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolate harbored the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (LukSF/PVL) gene. This research is the first to document the presence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in the UAE food chain. Furthermore, S. xylosus (a coagulase-negative staphylococcus not commonly screened in food) has demonstrated phenotypic resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials. This underscores the need for vigilant monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in bacterial contaminants, whether pathogenic or commensal, at the human-food interface.</jats:p>"

Yunmai) growth, N accumulation, and soil microbial communities related to ammonia oxidization. The data showed that the N supply effectively mitigated the negative impacts of eCO2 on wheat growth by reducing intercellular CO2 concentrations while enhancing photosynthesis parameters. Notably, the N supply significantly increased N concentrations in wheat tissues and biomass production, thereby boosting N accumulation in seeds, shoots, and roots. eCO2 increased the agronomic efficiency of applied N (AEN) and the physiological efficiency of applied N (PEN) under N supply. Plant tissue N concentrations and accumulations are positively related to plant biomass production and soil NO3−-N. Additionally, the N supply increased the richness and evenness of the soil microbial community, particularly Nitrososphaeraceae, Nitrosospira, and Nitrosomonas, which responded differently to N availability under both aCO2 and eCO2. These results underscore the importance and complexity of optimizing N supply and eCO2 for enhancing crop tissue N accumulation and yield production as well as activating nitrification-related microbial activities for soil inorganic N availability under future global environment change scenarios.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents an original methodology to determine the optimal level of reactive energy transmission to low-voltage consumers supplied from MV/LV substations that guarantees the lowest total costs of reactive energy transmission through the DSO network and its generation in receiving installations within the reactive power compensation process. The average value of the optimal factor tgφ to be maintained by customers depends on the efficiency of the network, the characteristics of the load, and the market costs of energy losses due to the transmission of reactive energy through the network that are covered by the DSO and the costs of reactive energy generation in receiving installations. The results presented for real MV/LV substations operating in the Polish distribution network demonstrate the application of annual measurements of active and reactive energy consumed and generated registered by AMI systems to calculate the optimal reactive power compensation level. They can be applied to verify the permissible levels of reactive energy compensation applied by the DSOs until now within the yearly tariffs for customers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to its unique geographical location and rapid urbanization, Xiamen is particularly susceptible to geological disasters. This study employs 80 Sentinel-1A SAR images covering Xiamen spanning from May 2017 to December 2023 for comprehensive dynamic monitoring of the land subsidence. PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR techniques were utilized to derive the surface deformation field and time series separately, followed by a comparative analysis of their results. SBAS-InSAR was finally chosen in this study for its higher coherence. Based on its results, we conducted cause analysis and obtained the following findings. (1) The most substantial subsidence occurred in Maluan Bay and Dadeng Island, where the maximum subsidence rate was 24 mm/yr and the maximum cumulative subsidence reached 250 mm over the course of the study. Additionally, regions exhibiting subsidence rates ranging from 10 to 30 mm/yr included Yuanhai Terminal, Maluan Bay, Xitang, Guanxun, Jiuxi entrance, Yangtang, the southeastern part of Dadeng Island, and Yundang Lake. (2) Geological structure, groundwater extraction, reclamation and engineering construction all have impacts on land subsidence. The land subsidence of fault belts and seismic focus areas was significant, and the area above the clay layer settled significantly. Both direct and indirect analysis can prove that as the amount of groundwater extraction increases, the amount of land subsidence increases. Significant subsidence is prone to occur after the initial land reclamation, during the consolidation period of the old fill materials, and after land compaction. The construction changes the soil structure, and the appearance of new buildings increases the risk of subsidence.</jats:p>"

A new structural scheme for controlling an autonomous shunt active filter with extended functionality and increased speed is proposed, which can be used in both three-wire and four-wire power supply systems. Computer modeling confirmed the adequacy of the new formulas for calculating the unbalance power components and the effectiveness of the proposed active filtering strategies to minimize power losses in the transmission line.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The work on assessing the feed base of the Uglich Reservoir was carried out within the framework of annual monitoring studies by the Branch for Freshwater Fisheries of the Federal State Budgetary Scientific Institution “VNIRO” (VNIIPRH). Samples were taken in July 2021 and 2022 on three sections. During the year, 10 samples of zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities were collected and processed. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the fish food supply of the Uglich Reservoir according to the indicators of zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities in the period 2021–2022. The tasks of the study: to determine the number and biomass of zooplankton of the Uglich Reservoir in 2021–2022; to determine the number and biomass of benthic invertebrate communities of the Uglich Reservoir in 2021–2022. The Uglich Reservoir belongs to the Upper Volga cascade of hydro nodes. Located in the territory of two regions and having a length of more than a hundred kilometers, it has differences in water temperature and oxygen content in the water by reaches. Oxygen conditions in 2021 in the bottom layers, and in 2022 — both in the surface and in the bottom horizons, were unfavorable: deviations from the water quality standard were observed. The studies showed that the productivity of the Uglich Reservoir also varies by reaches. The maximum indicators of zooplankton development were observed in the channel part of the Upper reach of the reservoir. During the observation period (with incomplete determination), 21 taxa of planktonic organisms were recorded, including: Rotifera — 5, Cladocera — 12, Copepoda — 3 and Bivalvia — 1 species. In the composition of the plankton fauna, Cladocera dominated in number and biomass. The benthic invertebrate communities of the Uglich Reservoir is mainly represented by oligochaetes, chironomid larvae and bivalve molluscs. By the magnitude of the summer biomass of zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities, in accordance with the generally accepted classification of Pidgayko (1968), the Uglich Reservoir in 2021 can be assessed as a high-feed reservoir, and in 2022 — as a medium-feed reservoir.</jats:p>",
