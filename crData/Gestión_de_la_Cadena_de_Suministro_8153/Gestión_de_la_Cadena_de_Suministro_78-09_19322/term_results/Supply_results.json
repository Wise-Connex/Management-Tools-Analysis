      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally, models of urban growth have focused on demand factors. Housing has been the primary area of interest since it uses a great deal of land and thus is a major shaper of urban growth and structure. This emphasis on demand is sound in principle: consumer demand drives developer location and land using decisions, since developers' locational choices are derived from consumer preferences. This reasoning will pertain as long as developers can meet consumer preferences without difficulty. In actuality such preferences can only be met, within consumer budget constraints, by working within existing and often constraining institutional settings. This paper explores urban growth, from the supply side by examining residential developer location criteria as obtained from surveys. These behavioral findings are then used to obtain allocation functions for a simulation model. The allocation functions are based on the stated locational preferences of developers. The resulting simulation output is compared with actual growth in the Greater Vancouver Region of British Columbia for the period 1971–1975. The results are encouraging and point up areas where additional work is needed to better test the utility of the behavioral data in forecasting urban growth.</jats:p>",

This root‐sink description of water use, recognizing both measured change in water content and vertical redistribution (upward or downward) of water by flow between soil layers, is needed for a better understanding of plant‐soil and atmospheric factors involved in water stress when the wheat plant must rely on stored soil water for long periods. Water content changes were estimated from neutron meter measurements. Soil water flux was estimated from field measurements of both hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic head gradients; unsaturated conductivity beyond the range of field measurement was calculated with the pore interaction model of Marshall matched to field measured values at 250 mb. Seasonal water‐uptake patterns, determined by the root‐sink description, differed from those shown by only water content measurements. Peak water‐use rates did not coincide with maximum leaf area index, but coincided with the period from heading to completed head extension. Water flux in the profile was important for supplying water during grain filling and was critical in this layered soil, which restricted rooting to depths less than 150 cm.</jats:p>",

The populations exhibited great variability in their patterns of calcium uptake similar to that previously reported for zinc. The effects of variation in calcium supply on yield and calcium and zinc uptake by one zinc‐tolerant and one non‐tolerant population are described. Little difference in yield‐response to calcium was detected between the two populations but they showed major differences in the uptake and accumulation of zinc and calcium and their transport from root to shoot. Total zinc uptake was little affected by increases in calcium level in the tolerant plants but was decreased significantly in the non‐tolerant plants. At the higher calcium levels, total zinc uptake by tolerant plants was also significantly greater than by the non‐tolerant but the populations did not differ in total calcium uptake. Evidence for a reduction in zinc transport in both populations resulting from increased calcium uptake is presented. Marked stimulation of zinc accumulation by the roots of the tolerant population resulting from increases in the external calcium level is interpreted as a possible corollary of zinc tolerance in this tolerant population. The role of calcium in the internal detoxification of zinc is discussed.</jats:p>",
