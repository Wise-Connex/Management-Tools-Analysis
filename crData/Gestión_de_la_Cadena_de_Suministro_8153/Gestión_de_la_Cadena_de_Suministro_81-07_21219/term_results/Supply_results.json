The ability to satisfy future domestic natural gas demand and to access export markets depends on forecasts of future reserves and deliver ability. These depend not only on the size of the resource base, but also on the rate at which resources are converted to reserves through successful exploratory drilling. Exploratory activity in turn is almost totally dominated by producer economics.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This study attempts to synthesize the historic performance of the industry in Alberta using statistical techniques to identify the most important variables governing the generation of new gas reserves for the 1957–1977 period. By far the most significant variable found was the \"PV factor\"- a measure of the present value of gas in the ground in the average discovery made from time to time within each of nine Alberta gas supply areas. The PV factor simultaneously reflects costs, netbacks, success ratios and market lead times from the producer explorer viewpoint.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>An econometric model is proposed which exhibits excellent efficiency in matching historic reserves additions. The model lends itself to forecasting future reserves additions in Alberta making use of projections of netback prices,\" costs, success ratios and other variables.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The nature of the natural gas industry is such that long-term forecasts of almost every aspect of the business are mandatory. Large investment in plant pipeline and distribution facilities requires the spreading of costs over two decades or- more in order to achieve reasonable unit cost levels. Project approvals from government regulatory agencies along with long-term financing arrangements can only be satisfactorily completed if adequate supply can be guaranteed with reasonable assurance for a like period of time. Appropriate energy policy can only be formulated by governments in possession of accurate forecasts of total gas reserves and supply.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The strategic importance of natural gas as an energy source the involvement of municipal governments and the reliance of consumers on gas as a household fuel leads to regulation of the industry along public utility lines. However, the drilling of exploratory wells and the finding of new reserves is dominated by free enterprise, risk-taking and the profit incentive. It is characterized by the spending of billions of dollars on drilling dry holes in the ground-an industry that somehow seems beyond the ken of governments. Perhaps never have these differences been more clearly demonstrated than in the current federal-provincial energy controversy in Canada.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The dramatic fluctuations in Canada\"s natural gas industry over the past couple of decades are familiar to most of us:Prior to 1957, natural gas was produced in Western Canada for local utility use only; Alberta production was in the range of 300–400 MMCFD; natural gas was regarded as a by-product of oil exploration and production and priced accordingly at 10¢ per MCF or less. (See Figure 1 for historic gas prices.)From 1957 to 1973, the industry was characterized by high rates of-growth and a rapid buildup in reserves and production capability as sales increased in Eastern Canada and-the export markets through three major pipeline systems.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impact of an exogenous increase in the price of oil on aggregate supply is felt not only through its effect on the demand for oil but also through its effects on the demand for other factors. Except under special assumptions concerning the production technology, the price of one factor is an argument in the demand for all other factors. This paper will explore the impact of an increase in the price of oil, an imported, exogenously-priced input, on the demand for labor and on lanor market equilibrium under varying assumptions aboud the behavior of wages. The response of factor demands to an oil price \"shock\" will then be used to infer the effect of the shock on the aggregate supply schedule. In order to obtain unambigous solutions to the analysis, specific assumptions are made concerning production condictions. The paper does nto attempt to explain fully the impact of such an oil price shock. Tather, it highlights the possibility of a discrete change in labor demand (and therefore aggregate supply) behavior in response to such a shock when production involves fixed-coefficient relationships. The results reported here suggect that pre-oil price shock experience may provide little or no useful information about the elasticity of labor demand with respect to the real wage or of output with respect to the price level in the post-oil shock world.</jats:p>"

The present study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that permit a more precise appraisal of whether the speed of supply response varies over the business cycle. Analysis of data for the period 1972–76, during which a severe recession occurred, shows, as predicted, that as unemployment increases workers are less able to adjust their hours of work in response to changes in their health, wages, and other factors that determine desired work levels. The author also finds, however, that the more rapid response of supply in the recovery phase makes peak-to-peak adjustment relatively complete. </jats:p>",

Radial and tangential force components are dependent on the supply/cavitation pressure ratio in addition to the eccentricity parameters.

A reliability factor for a single failure or for a selected time period can be defined in terms of the capacity lost during failure, which is measured as a fraction of the demand rate or the demand volume. Since the lost capacity is a random variable, so is the reliability factor, and its probability density function can be derived analytically from that of the lost capacity. Reliability, defined as the probability that a given reliability factor will be achieved, can be increased by adding facilities, storage, pumping capacity, pipelines. The least‐cost combination of facilities can be identified from the cost functions and the probability distributions of the reliability factor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magnetospheric processes at Mercury are investigated to determine how they affect the source and loss rates of the neutral He and H atmosphere. The atmospheric source rate caused by direct impact of the solar wind on the planetary surface is estimated by using a model that included the effect of the large planetary core upon the compressibility of the magnetosphere. As the nonconducting planetary surface could inhibit Birkeland currents that cause erosion of the dayside magnetosphere, the impact of the solar wind on the surface is modeled with and without the effects of erosion. The solar wind impacts the surface, at most, only about 6% of the time, and the resulting atmospheric supply rate is negligible. The flux on closed dayside field lines is estimated to be roughly comparable to the flux to the surface along open dayside field lines in the polar cap region. The flux to the surface from the plasma sheet is estimated as being about three times either of these sources, provided that all sunward convected particles in the tail precipitate to the surface. A comparison of the flux available from convection with the flux that would precipitate to the ‘auroral zones’ under the assumption of strong pitch angle scattering shows that the strong pitch angle scattering assumption may be invalid at Mercury, owing to the large size of the loss cone. Observations of a correlation between the lunar atmosphere He content and <jats:italic>Kp</jats:italic>, and consideration of surface processes, suggest that a significant fraction of the He striking the surface eventually enters the atmosphere. Loss mechanisms are also investigated. The extent to which magnetospheric convection recycles photoions (created at both high and low latitudes) back to the planetary surface, and to a lesser extent the uncertainty in the number of atoms exposed to sunlight, leads to considerable uncertainty in atmospheric loss estimates. An examination of atmospheric losses caused by electron impact ionization in the ‘auroral zone’ indicates that this mechanism does not compete with photoionization. The estimated solar wind supply of He to the surface is in the range 3.9 × 10<jats:sup>22</jats:sup>−2.3 × 10<jats:sup>23</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, the estimated radiogenic supply is between 6.9 × 10<jats:sup>21</jats:sup> and 4.6 × 10<jats:sup>22</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and the loss rate is estimated as between 1.2 × 10<jats:sup>22</jats:sup> and 1.1 × 10<jats:sup>23</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.</jats:p>",

The supply and utilisation of acetate has been estimated simultaneously in the whole animal and tissues of sheep using a combination of isotope-dilution and arteriovenous-difference techniques. Animals were made alloxandiabetic and acetate metabolism was compared when stabilized to normal metabolite levels with insulin (ITA sheep) and when food and insulin had been withdrawn for 36 h (fasted, diabetic sheep).</jats:p><jats:p>2. Acetate was simultaneously produced and utilized by all tissues. The exogenous (or gut) supply of acetate was the most important determinant of circulating acetate level. Endogenous acetate was produced mainly in the liver; 77 and 94% in fasted, diabetic and ITA sheep respectively. The production of endogenous acetate remained fairly constant and was not related to ketogenesis, which supports the idea that circulating acetate is largely a product of fermentation. The liver, gut and muscle utilized 17, 25 and 54% respectively (96% total) of the acetate entry rate in ITA sheep; a similar percentage utilization was found in fasted, diabetic sheep.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Acetate is largely oxidized to carbon dioxide in the gut and muscles of sheep and may account for 30–40% of their oxidative metabolism. This figure is similar to that for the whole animal. The total acetate taken up by the liver could account for 30% of the oxygen consumption; however, the liver may not directly oxidize all the utilized acetate.</jats:p><jats:p>4. The over-all conclusion from this study is that acetate is largely of dietary origin and the major factor determining its rate of utilization is the arterial concentration.</jats:p>",
