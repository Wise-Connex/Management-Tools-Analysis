      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The increasing pressure on businesses to remain competitive has made dominant practices more prevalent, particularly in the automotive and retail industries. Financial, exclusionary and exploitative practices seem to be the main occurrences in the global supply chain when analysing dominant behaviours.Objectives: The study explores the global existence of dominant supply chain behaviour and the type of dominant supply chain practices to which smaller supply chain affiliates are subjected.Method: Because of the sensitive nature of the topic, it was not possible to collect primary data. Therefore, secondary qualitative data sourced from surveys, journal articles, news reports, websites, governmental publications and academic reports were analysed and quantitised.Results: A total of 60 cases of dominance were reported in regions across the globe, with Europe and the United States experiencing the most. Although companies in African and Asian markets experienced dominance, the reporting of these incidents seems to be limited.Conclusion: It emerged that dominance is more prevalent in certain industries such as the automotive and retail sectors, mainly through resented practices. Furthermore, small firms that experience bullying have either had to close down or conform to the requirements of the bullying firm to maintain its operations.</jats:p>"

The authors show that trust is the main predictor of supply chain quality practices and supply chain quality performance outcomes. In addition, the findings show that the impact of trust on process improvement is mediated by information sharing, inter-firm trust and information sharing are significant predictors of supply chain satisfaction, and inter-firm trust and process improvement are significant predictors of supply chain performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research investigates purchasing managers’ responses to adverse supply chain events. We build on attribution theory to examine how individual‐level factors—managerial personality traits, cognitive modes, and attribution of supplier responsibility—combine with firm‐level factors—buffering and bridging—to affect coping success. We combine an inductive process‐tracing approach with the neo‐configurational method of fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Findings suggest that dark personality traits—traits that are generally regarded as socially aversive—are useful in coping with adverse supply chain events in combination with cross‐functionally integrated bridging, while the absence of dark personality traits is useful in combination with cross‐functionally integrated buffering. Our study contributes to the extant supply chain management literature in three ways: First, it highlights the role of dark personality traits in how purchasing managers react to supply chain risks. Second, it advances behavioral SCM literature by presenting nuanced findings on the effect of rational vs. intuitive cognitive processes in coping with such adverse events. Third, it contributes to attribution theory by providing a differentiated view on behavioral reactions following responsibility attributions. For managers, we find that high coping success might be achieved by seeking a fit between dark personality traits and firm actions. In addition, the results of the fsQCA demonstrate that supply chain research using configurational studies serves as a productive complement to traditional net effect analyses.</jats:p>",

We argue that the presence of misaligned institutional logics between these focal organizations and their supply chain stakeholders generates tensions. Building on institutional theory and paradox theory, we analyzed seven dyadic relationships between a single focal social enterprise with a goal of migrant integration and its supply chain stakeholders. We propose relationship management mechanisms related to relationship governance, power, and trust to manage such tensions. We observe the application of different relationship management mechanisms relative to different types of tensions. Finally, we relate different relationship management mechanisms to specific tension management approaches referred to as complementarity, acceptance, and accommodation, and offer propositions based on our findings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Attributes of suppliers such as capabilities are considered important aspects of successful buyer–supplier relationships. Previous research relates supplier attributes largely to intraorganizational supply chain practices, such as supplier selection and evaluation, and assumes that supplier attributes can be objectively assessed independently of the relationships with suppliers. This study expands on this literature by (1) exploring supplier attributes as perceived by purchasing managers in ongoing buyer–supplier relationships and (2) examining how these perception‐based supplier attributes are associated with performance‐influencing practices, which can in turn shape relational outcomes of the relationships. In doing so, we combine two exploratory qualitative studies. We conduct 60 repertory grid interviews with purchasing managers in Study 1 and 25 semi‐structured interviews with another set of purchasing managers in Study 2. The findings of this study are finally theorized through the supply chain practice view and are summarized into an integrative theoretical model. This study thus provides a more nuanced understanding of perception‐based supplier attributes and their implications on performance‐influencing practices and relational outcomes in buyer–supplier relationships.</jats:p>",

The gradual, or zone-by-zone, transition from IWS to continuous water supply is very effective in terms of economic scarcity. This work focused on designing a theoretical ‘hybrid’ hydraulic model where both types of services, intermittent and continuous, were included in the modelling. The preliminary, not calibrated model, which was applied in a district in Amman, has shown to be efficient on both the technical and economic sides as it achieves independent district metering areas. Sustainable access to water, however, necessitates an integrated solution taking into account the technical, economic, social and psychological factors along with the modelling aspect highlighted in this work.</jats:p>",

Then, the article analyzed the influence of service cost on the choice of the EW provider. Finally, it shows that if only part of consumers purchases the product with the EW, the manufacturer benefits from EW provided by the retailer. However, the retailer has to balance the ratio of the service cost coefficient. Furthermore, all consumers purchase the product with the EW, both the manufacturer and the retailer has to balance the ratio of service cost coefficient between manufacturer and retailer.</p>",

Water utilities, as heavy electricity consumers, could participate in the scheme through shifting power demand by modifying pump operation schedule, utilizing reservoirs' buffering stock capability. We developed a conveyance/transmission pump scheduling algorithm to be applied in the scheme that requires a quick modification of pumping schedule to respond to a request. In addition, we made test bedding through a simulation approach utilizing actual data from Osaka Water Supply Authority to show the scheme's potential for waterworks and the effectiveness of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Buyer–supplier engagement leads to numerous opportunities for unexpected positive benefits to occur. How these events come about and are managed (i.e., what entities are responsible for the outcomes and how the benefits are shared) remains an under‐investigated phenomenon in the supply chain literature. This research uses attribution theory and a systems thinking perspective to investigate a supplier's experience of psychological contract over‐fulfillment followed by a buyer claim. We hypothesize that a supplier's reaction to a buyer's claim depends on whether the type of claim (economic versus social) fits with the locus of causality the over‐fulfillment is attributed to: (1) the buying organization (<jats:italic>buyer‐only attributions</jats:italic>), (2) the buyer and the supplier jointly (<jats:italic>dyad attributions</jats:italic>), or (3) a third party in the buyer's innovation network (<jats:italic>buyer‐network attributions</jats:italic>). Results from a multi‐stage scenario‐based experiment suggest that following the supplier's experience of psychological contract over‐fulfillment, the supplier's trust toward the buyer is highest for dyad attributions, while the supplier's appreciation for the buyer's network is highest with dyad and buyer‐network attributions. Once the buyer claims value, however, the influence of attributions diminishes. While social reward claims had almost no impact on relational outcomes, economic reward claims significantly harm the supplier's perceptions of the buyer. Regardless of the type of claim, the locus of causality was largely irrelevant for the supplier's reaction to the buyer's reward claim. Our study contributes to the supply chain psychological contract literature by investigating positive over‐fulfillments of the psychological contract, as opposed to previous literature that has focused on negative breaches. We also extend attribution theory by introducing a novel supply chain‐specific attribution for the locus of causality, and we establish boundary conditions of attribution theory in the face of supply chain‐typical claiming mechanisms. For managers, locus of causality for a positive event seems to be irrelevant once claiming sets in.</jats:p>",

Practitioners and researchers alike who take a relational perspective widely regard supplier involvement as a potentially effective strategy to cope with technology uncertainty, as focal manufacturers can tap into their upstream supply networks for complementary resources and capabilities. However, the literature lacks a nuanced understanding of the supplier involvement processes. Specifically, the role of resource dependence for supplier involvement has yet to be systematically understood. To fill this gap, this study aims to combine the relational perspective with the resource-dependence perspective to explore how buyer dependence, supplier dependence and buyer–supplier interdependence influence buyers’ decision-making on tapping into upstream supply networks for coping with technology uncertainty.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>To test the hypotheses, a survey is conducted among Dutch firms with more than 50 employees in the discrete manufacturing industries (ISIC 28-35), resulting in a sample of 125 manufacturers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>First, there is a significantly positive relationship between technology uncertainty and supplier involvement, giving support to the expectation that buyers are indeed involving their key suppliers in the product/process design and improvement, as a response to technology uncertainty.

The aim is to uncover the distinctive role of each dimension in achieving environmental sustainability along the supply chain. A conceptual model is proposed to link supplier and customer integration to both internal GSCM within the company and external GSCM with the suppliers as well as business performance. The study is based on a survey of Chinese manufacturing companies. The results show that integration with suppliers only supports external GSCM while integration with the customer supports both internal and external GSCM. It also finds that external GSCM has no positive relationship with business performance but supports internal GSCM, which positively influences companies’ business performance. The results suggest that considering construct multidimensionality brings the opportunity of closely scrutinizing the relationships between SCI, GSCM, and business performance. Different dimensions have different effects in achieving environmental sustainability by integrating different partners along the supply chain. The separation of internal and external GSCM and the exploration of the result of the multidimensionality of the proposed constructs may be contributions to this field. The implications of supporting a green supply chain are explored.</jats:p>"

Moreover, the issue of intrinsic imprecision of input parameters should be gingerly regarded in the design of supply chain networks because it could have inverse impact on the quality of long-term planning decisions. Consequently, to handle the noted problems, in this paper, a reliable closed-loop supply chain network is formulated in which a new reliability method is introduced. The proposed formulation can effectively enable the design of a reliable network under different kinds of disruptions besides seeking for minimum overall costs of network design. On the one hand, a new effectual robust possibilistic programming (RPP) model is developed to confront with business-as-usual uncertainty in input parameters. Lastly, a real industrial case study is employed to validate the utility and practicability of the rendered model as well as presenting the efficiency and felicity of the developed RPP model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>HdGOSP-2 was designed to be fully dependent on Haradh Water Injection Plant (WIP). Haradh WIP receives disposal water from HdGOSP-2 disposal system and sea water from Hawiyah Central Water Injection Plant (HCWIP). Therefore, Haradh WIP can only be run when HCWIP is online. As a result, if HCWIP is down, HdGOSP-2 total oil production is also locked due to lack of alternative solutions to inject disposal water. During the past three years, HdGOSP-2 oil production was locked for (13) days due to the loss of water supply from HCWIP. The idea is to operate (1) turbine driven injection pump solely with HdGOSP-2 disposal water for a temporary period to be fully independent from Hawiyah WIP. The current produced water rate at HdGOSP-2 is 120 MBD and in order to meet the minimum flow requirement for the injection pumps, a total of 90 MBD needs to be recycled. It has been evaluated the potential increase in water temperature due to recycling using HYSYS simulation revealing no significant temperature rise. In addition, the simulation output along with reliability &amp; rotating equipment evaluation revealed that this option can only work if the pump discharge pressure is maintained above 2200 psig. This can be achieved by isolating some of HdGOSP-2 Flanks and reducing the number of water injection wells on service.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This mode of operation was started on April 26, 2018 and lasted for six (6) days. During this period, the sea water rate was gradually decreased to zero while maintaining HdGOSP-2 disposal water flowing through GT-4001 with partial recycle and without having any impact on HdGOSP-2 oil production rate or crude quality specifications.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Upon completing the 1st implementation of this initiative, HdGOSP-2 has produced total of 1.98 MMBOD of oil during the outage of HCWIP in 2018. HdGOSP-2 has produced 1.98 MMBOD of oil during the outage of HCWIP which is equivalent to $96,000,000 during six (6) days outage of HCWIP in 2018. The production gain will continue in the future whenever HCWIP is down.</jats:p>",

The most important decision to evaluate the chain performance is the correct selection of indicators. The closed-loop supply chain method consists of a whole of forward and reverse logistics activities. For this reason, advanced supply chain management and reverse supply chain management performances are handled separately in this study. The performance evaluation criteria which are discussed by the authors who work on the supply chain management performance evaluation issues are analyzed and it is stated that the authors make a study by taking into consideration the evaluation criteria. At the same time, the articles examined in reverse supply chain management performance evaluation studies are examined and all criteria are summarized as a table. In the light of these studies, the planned criteria for the use of closed loop supply chain management performance evaluation of the enterprises have emerged. With the main criteria being divided into Economic, Social and Environmental headings, which are supposed to bring innovation to the literature, the sub-criteria are detailed. These titles were brought together both for the first time in closed loop supply chain management performance evaluation and as a main topic in advanced supply chain management. The performance criteria reduced to subheadings will help the experts to continue their studies, and it is thought that they will guide the future studies.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the speeds of adjustment to target leverage are faster in the postderegulation periods. I also find that the positive effect is driven by firms that are financially constrained, are financially dependent on banks, and have less access to the public debt market and by deregulated banks’ ability to geographically diversify the credit risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>As a policy tool aimed at raising parental labor supply, childcare subsidies come with high expectations. Using data from a factorial survey, we examine whether childcare subsidies reach their goal. Because of the simultaneity of the decision to take up a job and arranging childcare, we experimentally alter hypothetical income (e.g., gross earnings from a job, income from other sources) as well as aspects of the childcare setting including subsidy levels. Using an alternative specific conditional logit model, we show that subsidies have the expected effect of increasing parents’ labor supply. Moreover, the results from simulations based on the estimated utility function show that varying subsidy levels have different effects on subgroups of parents. Subsidies are especially efficient in raising the labor supply of high income, Swiss-born parents, and especially for women. We also find that subsidies already have the desired effect at 25% of total childcare costs and that the marginal utility of higher subsidy levels decreases quite sharply beyond that threshold. Subsidies covering 25% of the total costs for childcare lead to an approximately 3 hours per week increase in the labor supply of women.</p>"

However, the actual implementation is still lagging behind. Acknowledging the gap between concept and reality, the benefits of a demand-oriented approach have to be reconsidered by the various stakeholders in politics, the economy, planning and civil society. In order to address this issue, we created a factual use-case by redefining empirical data (qualitative interviews) from Berlin, which our department collected in 2013 for a research project on e-mobility. The initial objective was to find out what kind of charging infrastructure would be necessary to persuade on-street parkers in densely-populated inner city areas to switch to e-mobility vehicles in the future, basically following the conventional ‚predict and provide‘-approach characteristic of traditional transport planning. In the course of the research, we decided to go against the directive and switched perspective completely in favour of a demand-approach, enquiring into people’s needs, which otherwise would have remained unidentified and invisible. Rather than creating the data to support proposed planning interventions, our method led to a much more sustainable, bottom-up planning strategy in line with the social and ecological benefits of an integrated transport planning approach and revealed the real mobility needs of people living in inner-city areas of Berlin.</jats:p>"

All three methods have major shortcomings and limitations but with additional effort in data collection they can provide a basis for comparing arms production values among countries as well as for regional and global totals. Furthermore, as the three methods use different definitions of the scope of arms production, comparison of the data produced by them can provide additional insights.</jats:p>"

If sedimentation can be managed successfully, as it has been in some reservoirs, the loss in reservoir storage space due to this phenomenon can be lowered significantly. The purpose of this research is to develop the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) algorithm and apply it and to select the most preferred alternative with different Orness levels for sediment management in dam reservoirs to satisfy the technical and executive requirements, economic factors, social welfare, and environmental impacts. In this way, we present analytic forms of OWA operator weighting functions, each of which has properties of rank-based weights and a constant level of Orness, irrespective of the number of objectives considered. The model are successfully applied to the Dez hydropower reservoir, which has faced serious sedimentation problems. Results of this study provide a general class of parameterized aggregation operators that include the min, max, and average and have shown themselves to be useful for modeling many different kinds of aggregation problems.</jats:p>",

The measurement instruments for LM, SCR, and SP were developed from comprehensive literature reviews, verified by experts, and statistical techniques to assure reliability and validity. The hypothesized model was tested with path analysis of structural equation modeling. It was found that the set of LM, SCR, and SP frameworks were reliable and valid for Thai manufacturing industries. LM had not only a direct effect on the SCR and SP but also an indirect effect on the SP through the SCR. The SCR also had a direct impact on the SP. This paper presents insights into the debate concerning the impact of transaction-based SCM on relationship-based SCM and SP.</jats:p>"

The market share of footwear industry has expanded rapidly which attracted more and more new entrants. However, the competition of shoe industry more incline to the competition of the supply chain, so, it is essential to maintain a certain competitiveness in terms of supply chain. Sustainable development is an emerging but important topic. Some processes of the supply chain of the sportswear industry have been accused of restricting its development, such as the use of polluting raw materials and sweatshops. Supply chain development should not only focus on the economic level, but also pay more attention to the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development. Therefore, this paper will take Nike, the most representative company in the footwear industry, as the analysis target to reflect the development of the supply chain of the footwear industry.This paper will start with the general analysis of the footwear industry, followed by considering the industry change; then, analyse Nike’s core product – Nike Flyknit. Further, before making the conclusion, this paper will explore the impact of external factors, i.e. Nike’s cooperation with the US government and footwear related associations, on its supply chain development.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current principles of doing business differ radically from those that were applied a few years ago. Global economic crises have shown that business must have a more social character. This gave rise to the creation of management solutions that would guarantee the satisfaction of a wide range of corporate stakeholders. In this context, ideas based on social potential began to emerge. As a consequence, the concept of social business models was born, accompanied by an attempt to search for the best business models possible in order to build the appropriate configuration of their components. According to the authors, an attribute of trust may be such a component based on which effective social business models can be built. As water supply companies are social enterprises, they have become the object of scientific research in this case. The purpose of the article is to determine the position of trust in the construction and application of social business models of water supply companies. The scope of the article includes scientific research into water supply companies in the most industrial region of Poland, Upper Silesia, with the most extensive and dense water supply network in the country. In this article, the AHP (analytic hierarchy process) method was used to conduct research. The aim of the analysis was focusing on the issue of trust as a key factor in shaping the social business model of the company. In the questionnaires, respondents were asked to answer questions on the following issues: trust-based organizational behavior at the company; trust-based social capital at the company; trust-based relationships at the company; trust-based processes and activities at the company; trust-based risk at the company; and the trust-based business model at the company. The adopted logic of the scientific argument conducted indicates that trust and its place and role in the social business model of a water supply company have a significant impact on the social and economic performance of the water supply company, and as a consequence, on increased social responsibility towards stakeholders as well. Trust even stabilizes the organization and its business model; it is also a value catalyst and neutralizes the potentially negative impact of the organization on other entities gathered around it. Trust as a stabilizer can also affect the consistency and scalability of the social business model of a water supply company.</jats:p>"

The power-law relationship reveals that greater autonomy in management helps in realizing economies of scale. The chapter also measures technical and scale efficiency in the provision of these services in Indian cities. Estimates of technical efficiency uncover that water and sanitation service providers have the potential to increase service levels by 37 and 48 per cent respectively. Note that most Indian urban water and sanitation utilities are operating at decreasing returns to scale. This implies that services may be charged following the rule of marginal cost pricing. The chapter also finds that there are consumption-metering advantages in improving efficiency of water utilities.</jats:p>",

The study employed a case study research strategy using semi-structured interview guide as data collection tool. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative interviews involving five senior officers from the company. They served as Key Informants for the study. Major Themes that were derived from supply chain management were supply chain approach, management of risk to avoid supply chain break down and supply chain management pitfalls facing organisations. The supply chain approach involved sourcing of raw materials, route to market and distribution of products. Management of safety stock for its flagship brands, using multiple sourcing and technological innovations were adopted in managing risk to avoid supply chain breakdown. Unreliable supply of packaging and labeling materials from suppliers and disruption from Food and Drug Authority were the key supply chain management pitfalls facing the company. The study suggests that if herbal medicine companies want to retain competitive edge then they must pursue supply chain operational excellence by reassessing and adjusting its distribution capabilities periodically to improve responsiveness.</jats:p>"

This generator can feed a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) load with sinusoidal voltages up to 20 kV peak and frequencies in the range 10–60 kHz, with a maximum output power of 200 W. Output voltage can be produced either in a continuous mode, or with on/off modulation cycles, according to treatment/application requirements. This power source is equipped with on-board diagnostics used to measure the output voltage and the charge delivered to the load. With a sample frequency of 500 kHz, Arduino DUE allows to evaluate both the high voltage and the average power feeding the discharge without the use of an expensive external measurement setup. Lissajous techniques are utilized to calculate discharge average power in a quasi-real-time manner. When a load is connected to high-voltage terminals, a self-tuning procedure is carried out to obtain the best working frequency. This parameter allows to minimize power-electronic component stress and to maximize generator efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background</jats:title><jats:p>Collagen is a structural protein that provides mechanical stability and defined architectures to skin. In collagen-based skin disorders like Epidermolysis bullosa, EDS the ability to offer such stability is lost either due to mutations in collagens or defect in the chaperones involved in collagen assembly, which leads to chronic wounds, skin fragility, and blisters. Existing approaches to study and develop therapy against such conditions are the use of small molecules like 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) or growth factors like TGF-β. However, these approaches are not collagen specific resulting in unsolicited responses. Therefore, a collagen specific booster is required to guide the correct folding and deposition of collagen in a highly regulated manner. Hsp47 is a chaperone with a major role in collagen biosynthesis. Expression levels of Hsp47 correlate with collagen production. This article explores the stimulation of collagen deposition by exogenously supplied Hsp47 (collagen specific chaperone) in skin cells, including specific collagen subtypes quantification.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Here we quantify the collagen deposition level and the type of deposited collagens by different cell types from skin tissue (fibroblasts NHDF, L929 and MEF, keratinocytes HaCat and endothelial cells HDMEC) after Hsp47 stimulation. We find upregulated deposition of fibrillar collagen subtypes I, III and V after Hsp47 delivery. Network collagen IV deposition was enhanced in HaCat and HDMECs and fibril-associated collagen XII were not affected by the increased Hsp47 intracellular levels. The deposition levels of fibrillar collagen were cell-dependent i.e. Hsp47-stimulated fibroblasts deposited significantly higher amount of fibrillar collagen than Hsp47-stimulated HaCat and HDMECs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>A 3-fold enhancement of collagen deposition was observed in fibroblasts upon repeated dosage of Hsp47 within the first 6 days of culture.

The purpose of this research is to investigate the process that is commonly used for calculating a “score” for each supplier when certain attributes are used. In decision making theory, the selection of “best” alternative can be done under three different conditions: certainty, risk, and uncertainty. Most of the current research uses “certainty” conditions. This article suggests that the “uncertainty” condition should be used in supplier selection as it corresponds to real-life more than the certainty or risk condition. “Maximum entropy” method is used to ascertain the probability function of the outcomes. Once the probability functions are known, means and variance can be calculated, and the suppliers can be evaluated.</p>",

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust green supply chain network design model to minimize the total cost and to effectively cope with uncertainties. A scenario tree method is applied to model the uncertainty, and a green supply chain network design model is developed under the p-robustness criterion. Furthermore, the solution method for determining the lower and upper bounds of the relative regret limit is introduced, which is convenient for decision-makers to choose the corresponding supply chain network structure through the tradeoff between risk and cost performance. In particular, to overcome the large scale of the model caused by a high number of uncertain scenarios and reduce the computational difficulty, a scenario reduction technique is applied to filter the scenarios. Numerical calculations are executed to analyze the influence of relevant parameters on the performance of the designed green supply chain network. The results show that the proposed p-robust green supply chain network design model can effectively deal with carbon and demand uncertainties while ensuring cost performance, and can offer more choices for decision-makers with different risk preferences.</jats:p>"

Transformative business models necessitate innovative CSR modelling that will provide supply chain managers with sufficient scope for enhancement of stakeholder value. Businesses appear to respond in a variety of ways to CSR demands and stakeholder pressure. This article aims to investigate the notions of CSR in organisations within the UAE, thereby providing a platform for Business Organizations (profit and not-for-profit) to formulate CSR agenda for their supply chain managers. The results from this analysis will enable managers to be equipped with knowledge of the underlying CSR themes, thereby empowering them to apply the right tools &amp; techniques – in fulfilment of the very core attributes of responsive and compliant CSR. A case study design was adopted using selected organisations in the UAE and a semi-structured questionnaire was administered. A comparison was to be made to establish the key determinants of CSR issues within UAE organisations. The study makes a significant contribution to the specialist body of knowledge by providing insights into organisational CSR practices in the UAE from a stakeholder perspective.

While probabilistic based approaches are used for handling uncertainty of random type, the possibilistic based approach considers uncertainty of fuzzy nature. Some key issues and serious limitations of the existing approaches for modeling uncertain parameters related to water distribution networks are identified. The uncertainty in water demands is due to both their random nature and lack of information about their values. Therefore, a combination of both types of approaches, called the fuzzy random approach, is found to be more effective. The fuzzy random approach can provide optimal design solutions that are not only cost-effective but also has higher reliability to cope with severe future uncertainties.</jats:p>",

The photovoltaic converters system and low-voltage system of an electric vehicle have a shared low-voltage battery, which allows the implementation of two schemes of electric vehicle power supply. Initially, the aggregate base was selected, then, taking into account the efficiency of each device included in the design of the new electric vehicle, mathematical modeling was carried out and showed good efficiency results of the photovoltaic converters system. Then, the prototype was manufactured and tested. The aggregate base included the battery of photovoltaic converters assembled in a certain way on the vehicle roof, the MPPT (maximum power point tracking) controller, the buffer storage device in the form of a 12 V battery, and the DC (direct current) converter that allows transmitting electricity from the buffer battery to the high-voltage system. Modeling of the electric vehicle motion considered typical operating modes, including energy costs for the operation of assistant systems of the electric vehicle, as well as including the consumption of low-voltage components. The tests were carried out according to the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle). As a result, implementation of photovoltaic converters with 21% efficiency allowed for the power reserve of the electric vehicle to be increased by up to 9%.</jats:p>"

It is necessary to understand if the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP) can assist lean period water supply by indirectly increasing groundwater storage, through diverting excess water supply to groundwater recharge zones. The current study analyzed long-term groundwater depletion to assess available groundwater storage, followed by assessment of groundwater balance for the Kathmandu Valley. Results show that total groundwater extraction for Kathmandu was 69.44 million cubic meters (MCM) and drawdown of the groundwater surface was 15–20 m since the construction of wells in 1984/85, indicating substantial overexploitation. Results indicate that the ongoing unmet demand of 170 MCM/year can be easily satisfied if groundwater storage is recharged effectively, as underground water storage potential is 246 MCM/year due to a groundwater depletion rate of 2–10 m. From results, it is evident that that the timely implementation of the MWSP can help ease ongoing water stress and aid in reversing the damage caused to groundwater storage. In the long run, MWSP can supply water and recharge groundwater during monsoon periods, thus improving the quality of life and socio-economic status in Kathmandu.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector are one of the major contributors to global warming today. Freight share to GHG emissions is likely to increase 2-fold by 2050. This makes it critical for CO2 emissions to be reduced through an optimized transportation strategy. Vehicle routing, when done efficiently, can reduce these emissions across countries. In this attempt, the traditional distance minimization objective of the vehicle routing problem has been replaced with an energy-emission-centric objective. A model is formulated taking energy and emissions into simultaneous consideration and a typical VRP problem has been evaluated using a genetic algorithm. The application of the proposed model is observed to reduce emissions significantly compared to conventional models. Considering the possibility of increase in carbon tax in future, energy-emission minimized routing would not only aid “green logistics,” but also reduce the environmental costs incurred.</p>",

Individual businesses no longer operate in isolation and neither should their strategic orientation be wholly individualistic. This attracted supply chain management concept to be used. Supply chain management primarily designed by firms to get competitive advantage over the rival firms and to overcome the intense global competition coming from globalization, innovation, free trade and economic cooperation formed in different region. The concept led to cooperation and integration among firms and with their suppliers, distributors, consumers, and transport agency. It is totally systematic coordination and management from upstream to downstream paths of an organization. The importance and research interest in supply chain management are growing from time to time; however, the number of professional materials and well-organized review literature is limited relative to the growing trend of the area. Therefore, this paper reviewed different supply chain management articles, reports, and books by concentrating on logistics practices and information sharing on supply chain performance to develop a well-organized research article that advances supply chain management understanding. Under the logistics practices, the major variables discussed were the effect of the road network, transportation cost, facility location, waiting time, inventory management and mode of transportation, whereas the effect information sharing discussed from the viewpoints of the level of information sharing and quality of information on supply chain performance.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the design of a forestry-based payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme, which improves stream water supply while simultaneously helping conserve forests and supporting livelihoods in communities of Uttarakhand, India. Under a PES arrangement, upstream communities reduce fuelwood harvesting to restore forest quality and improve stream flow in the downstream communities. Results suggest that such PES projects can play a crucial role in supporting forest conservation efforts and mitigating water scarcity in the region. For instance, PES-based payments required to meet the water needs of downstream communities can be three times lower than the costs of municipal water supply. Whereas, if communities do not receive any monetary incentives for reducing fuelwood harvesting, it results in a significant degradation of the forests in the long run. However, hydrological and ecological constraints can reduce the effectiveness of PES programs in the region. A high displacement of oak forests by the pine forests would lower the benefits from PES participation for the local communities. When the shifting species composition of forests also increases the failure risk of PES projects, optimal response requires further restricting fuelwood harvesting. </jats:p>",

It is uncertain to what extent logistics and supply chain management (SCM) literature has been able to close research gaps regarding e.g., empirical scope and sustainability dimensions addressed. A systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out to synthesize the existing knowledge and ongoing trends, and to propose a research agenda. The trend analysis shows that the gap between the environmental and social dimension is increasing, that Asian studies grow nearly exponentially, and that the focal firm perspective gains more ground. The research agenda calls for participatory studies of multiple actors and for studies addressing, e.g., the invisible logistics service providers. This study provides an important complement to existing literature reviews on sustainable supply chain interaction, primarily by its focus on the development over time, the empirical scope, the focus on publications in logistics/SCM journals, and its narrow focus on the interaction among firms in supply chains.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on how state-subsidized privately-run low-fee schools (S-LFPSs) compete with free public schools in some of the poorest neighborhoods of the City of Buenos Aires. In particular, we explore how S-LFPSs follow different logics of action to attract (and shape) enrollment profiting from their extended autonomy and some regulatory gaps. We applied discourse analysis on data from eight months of ethnographic case study research in nine S-LFPSs. Student selection and operational changes (e.g., increasing the student/teacher ratio) prevail over academic and curricular changes. Selection is operated by means of aptitude tests and screening interviews, and other symbolic artifacts aimed at signaling differences with state-run schools and the potential fit between schools and families. We present a heuristic typology of the different logics of action systematizing the schools’ responses as their leading orientations toward the competitive environment. We suggest that policy inconsistencies and deficient governmental oversight tilt the field against state-run schools. Rather than ensuring equality of educational opportunity, the policy contributes to shape and deepen a highly segregated and inequitable educational landscape.</jats:p>"

Several editing and graphical tools available with QEPANET are introduced to model new and existing water distribution systems, to read and modify existing text-based EPANET files, to run simulations and visualize results in a geo-referenced framework. In addition, an application is illustrated to underline the novelty and the practical functionality of the presented tool, such as 3D pipe lengths' automatic calculation and the supporting functionalities for the network drawing.

As population and land values increase, older, smaller buildings are replaced with higher density, higher value structures. However, direct costs of redevelopment and institutional barriers such as zoning may constrain replacement of older structures, leading to alternate forms of supply adjustment. In this paper, I use data on building permits in Washington DC to examine three different forms of residential investment: new construction, expansion of existing structures, and renovation. Results suggest that new construction accounts for a relatively small part of residential investment and is highly concentrated in a few neighborhoods. Expansions and alterations of existing structures are more frequent and more evenly dispersed across space. Recent increases in housing values are correlated with more new construction, but only among neighborhoods with relatively more permissive zoning. Additions and alterations are more prevalent in neighborhoods with high property values, older housing, and more restrictive zoning.</jats:p>",

A starting point of this paper is the fact that integration of water management issues (i.e. drinking water management) into land use planning is essential in achieving sustainable development. Considering this, the paper focuses on analysis of land use planning solutions given within three spatial plans that include areas of water supply reservoirs. The authors give an analysis of the set of measures prescribed by zoning ordinances within spatial plans concerning water protection and protection from water (i.e. flood water evacuation). The authors conclude that analyzed spatial planning documents give sustainable land use solutions, since land use planning, through the zoning, represent a starting point in water protection.Keywords: Spatial Planning, Sustainable Land Use, Water Management, Water Reservoirs, Serbia</jats:p>"

Therefore, the perturbations of timing are presented until the possible obsolescence, with parallel execution of the network simulation model (NSM) to evaluate the impact of the finite lifespan on the value of the chain. The EMRP, as well as the NSM, are based on the skeleton of the material requirements planning model, where delays and their perturbations are presented transparently. Contrary to the previous studies of the net present value (NPV) in the EMRP skeleton, where the infinite horizon is assumed, the impact of shortening the horizon of activities is shown here, in order to also evaluate the risk of financing investments in the SC with a shorter lifespan of products or technology. Owing to the simultaneous appearances of the stochastic variables, the parallel execution and exchanging of data, using NSM is advised. The procedures for estimation of correction factors of the NPV and their values are given.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. Correct control and assessment of compliance of the composition and properties of drinking water sources with the established safety criteria are necessary conditions for ensuring the quality of life and health of the population in a situation of increasing exposure to chemical factors. Therefore, the most important is to increase the reliability of sanitary and hygienic conclusions. Material and methods. To achieve the goal of the work, there was used the Bayesian approach, methods for checking data homogeneity and evaluation of the measure of the statistical homogeneity. It is shown that the evaluation by Bayes method, requiring consideration of limiting factors, provides a correct solution to the problem of the implementation of the established sanitary and hygienic requirements. Representation of Bayesian relations in the form of estimates of the mixture of distributions allows taking into account the degree of statistical homogeneity of the combined samples, which significantly expands the scope of the method. Although the samples selected for consideration in the simple case can be considered homogeneous in the examples of the assessment of hygienic safety of water, it turned out that the transition from the binomial distribution law to a more strict normal one reduces the risk of accidental error of the desired conclusion. This provides the researcher with the opportunity to use, depending on the requirements for the accuracy of the assessment, different algorithms of a risk-based approach to the assessment of hygienic safety. results. On the example of the study of the water quality in the Verkhny Isetsky Vodokanal recreational area and source of water in Northern part of Ekaterinburg the inclusion of the homogeneity of merged data was shown to allow “forgetting” the earlier information (e.g., 2009) and thus to give more weight to recent data (2010). It is also shown that in this case, the combined estimates with the degree of homogeneity of the data series are not worse than the Bayesian estimates. It is concluded that the lower the degree of uniformity, the faster the above “forgetting” occurs. And the risks of violation of hygienic requirements depend on the choice of the law of distribution of controlled indicators. Conclusion. There was established the possibility of increasing the reliability of sanitary and hygienic conclusions by correctly combining the latest measurement information with outdated data, taking into account their gradual “forgetting”. The developed methods of the used for this risk-based approach can be widely applied to assess the hygienic safety of the population under the influence of a wide range of chemical factors.</jats:p>"

In fact, as local companies continue to expand their operations internationally, they remain bound to local financial institutions and their fees. This article proposes a model aimed at minimizing transaction fees by introducing an architecture and a prototype enabling “low-fee” transaction processing between customers and suppliers across the entire supply chain. The notion of web services is proposed as a communications method to open up options to new and international financial institutions. Vendors can now negotiate fees with financial institutions from all over the world.

Given this interest, engineering and management scholars have examined various concepts and theoretical developments of green supply chain management (GSCM), especially during the past decade. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to critically review the extant literature on pressures, practices, and performance of GSCM. The paper surveyed more than 150 research articles published in high‐impact refereed academic journals. The review synthesis has been discussed through <jats:italic>GSCM pressures</jats:italic> (government rules and regulations, corporate social responsibility, investment recovery, and green market), <jats:italic>GSCM practices</jats:italic> (eco‐design, internal environmental management, waste management, green purchasing aspect, quality, and product recovery), and <jats:italic>GSCM performance</jats:italic> (financial, operational, and environmental).

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. The target population was heads of procurement and heads of finance in the 66 tea processing firms in Kenya. The study conducted a census since the number of respondents was less than 200, which is a rule of the thumb. The study combined two methods in its data collection, that is, questionnaires and key informant interviews. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.Results: The independent variables reported R value of 0.846 indicating that there was perfect relationship between dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.715 means that 71.5% of the corresponding variation in performance of tea processing firms can be explained or predicted by (green product design, green distribution and transportation, green warehousing and reverse logistics) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 0.715), p=0.000 &lt;0.05).Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that green product design, green distribution and transportation, green warehousing and reverse logistics have a positive relationship with performance of tea processing firms.Policy recommendation: The study recommends that tea processing firms should embrace green operations strategy so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Hospital supply chains are responsible for several economic inefficiencies, negative environmental impacts, and social concerns. However, a lack of research on sustainable supply chain management specific to this sector is identified. Existing studies do not analyze supply chain management practices in an integrated and detailed manner, and do not consider all sustainable performance dimensions. To address these gaps, this paper presents a systematic literature review and develops a framework for identifying the supply chain management practices that may contribute to sustainable performance in hospitals. The proposed framework is composed of 12 categories of management practices, which include strategic management and leadership, supplier management, purchasing, warehousing and inventory, transportation and distribution, information and technology, energy, water, food, hospital design, waste, and customer relationship management. On the other side, performance categories include economic, environmental, and social factors. Moreover, illustrative effects of practices on performance are discussed. The novelty of this document lies in its focus on hospital settings, as well as on its comprehensiveness regarding the operationalization of practices and performance dimensions. In addition, a future research agenda is provided, which emphasizes the need for improved research generalizability, empirical validation, integrative addressing, and deeper analysis of relationships between practices and performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Investment on product greenness in green supply chain is always restricted by the emerging supplier’ financial constraints, so manufacturers always share the suppliers’ investment to encourage the suppliers’ green innovation. Based on the two-stage cooperation model between one manufacturer and one emerging supplier, and the assumption that emerging suppliers need to reach a certain survival threshold at the end of each period, this paper studies investment on product greenness and sustainability of cooperation in the supply chain. The impacts of consumers’ preference for greenness (CPG), market volatility, financial constraints, and investment-sharing proportion are also examined. It was found that when market volatility and CPG exist at the same time, compared with the deterministic environment, emerging suppliers will improve (or reduce) the wholesale price and greenness at the same time to balance the short-term bankruptcy risk and the long-term profit, and suppliers’ green investment would be stimulated by the increasing demand uncertainty. Besides, when suppliers’ financial constraints increase, manufacturers will also increase its sharing proportion of green investment. Lastly, there always exists an investment-sharing proportion that optimizes the sustainability of cooperation and profits jointly.</jats:p>"

An effective supply chain system allows companies to plan and utilize resources from a global perspective. Through the construction of management strategies, management processes, partnerships and information systems, real-time monitoring and regulation of the operation of various business activities within the enterprise. Fundamentally speaking, whether the supply chain node enterprises establish cooperative partnership is a game problem between node enterprises. We need a lot of practical support, more efforts and research work. Only by establishing long-term strategic partnership among supply chain node enterprises can a win-win situation be created and higher profits be brought to enterprises. That is to say, to achieve collective rationality on the basis of individual rationality and to achieve optimal cooperation.</jats:p>",

A-share manufacturing companies listed from 2013 to 2015 are chosen as the initial samples, and large sample supply networks are constructed with relational embeddedness and structural embeddedness. The location of supply network is depicted by network centrality and structural hole with social network analysis, and the influence of supply network position on the corporate performance is examined with multiple OLS regression analysis. This paper observes that a firms’ supply network position is an important factor affecting its performance. The higher the network centrality is, the richer the structural holes are, and the worse the company’s performance is. The results suggest that firms that have a high level of centrality or rich structural holes in their supply networks will gain limited information, resource and control benefits and face great business risks that may negatively influence their performance.</jats:p>",

From online business to multiple locations across the globe, companies are not just growing in revenue and reputation but also in staff. Most companies focus on building processes and relationships amongst staff through thorough communication. However, sometimes, it can be difficult in implementing processes and relationships with staff due to reliability and power. With these two factors, many people can either thrive in their interactions or otherwise, be unsuccessful.In many studies, reliability and power are two known components that helps reflect performance in a supply chain. However, what bridges the gap between reliability and power? What makes an individual validate a person as reliable and powerful? What makes a process implemented in the supply chain reliable and powerful? This paper implies that trust is a component that bridge the gap between the two constructs. An individual or process that is reliable will often be trusted and obtain powerful exchanges. This paper will address and evaluate the relationship between trust, power, and reliability. The paper will briefly show a constructed model to illustrate the relationship between the variables and how it affects performance in a supply chain. Next, limitations of research will be addressed followed by suggestions for future research.</jats:p>"

The researcher preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. The target population was heads of procurement and heads of finance in the 66 tea processing firms in Kenya. The study conducted a census since the number of respondents was less than 200, which is a rule of the thumb. The study combined two methods in its data collection, that is, questionnaires and key informant interviews. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20.Results: The independent variables reported R value of 0.846 indicating that there was perfect relationship between dependent variable and independent variables. R square value of 0.715 means that 71.5% of the corresponding variation in performance of tea processing firms can be explained or predicted by (green product design, green distribution and transportation, green warehousing and reverse logistics) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 0.715), p=0.000 &lt;0.05).Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that green product design, green distribution and transportation, green warehousing and reverse logistics have a positive relationship with performance of tea processing firms.Policy recommendation: The study recommends that tea processing firms should embrace green operations strategy so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

However, few quantitative studies on green supply chains have considered environmental and economic benefits to realize multi-objective optimization. To study operation and cooperation strategies with a consideration of the different objective on the level of supply chain, we first establish a green supply chain game model with profit and environment objectives simultaneously considered by the manufacturer. Then, we analyze the multi-objective decisions of the supply chain members under centralized control using a manufacturer-led Stackelberg game and revenue-sharing contract. Using the manufacturer’s environmental preference as a variable, the effects of environmental benefits on the supply chain are also investigated. Finally, this study determines that the manufacturer’s profit will be reduced after considering the objective of environmental benefits, while the retailer’s profit, product greenness, and environmental benefits will be improved. Meanwhile, the total profit of the green supply chain will first increase and then decrease. In particular, a revenue-sharing contract can facilitate the coordination of multiple objectives; in this way, both the manufacturer and the retailer achieve higher profits and environmental benefits compared to a decentralized control condition, which is of great significance in achieving a win–win situation for the economy and the environment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper focuses on coordination issues related to the green supply chain with capacity constraints and green marketing efforts. We build a two-stage green supply chain, in which the upstream manufacturer has a certain amount of installed capacity to produce green product, yet can expand its capacity through a Cloud Manufacturing (CM) Platform once its existing capacity becomes insufficient, while the downstream retailer expends green marketing effort to promote the green product. In particular, we analyze the interaction between the capacity expansion options of the manufacturer and the green marketing efforts of the retailer. Aiming to mitigate the inefficiency under a decentralized green supply chain, we design a contract that combines cost-sharing and revenue-sharing in green marketing in order to coordinate the supply chain. The results show that: (1) when the manufacturer’s existing capacity falls below a certain threshold, it will choose to expand its capacity. The threshold is related to existing capacity, capacity expansion cost coefficient, green marketing cost coefficient, and sensitivity coefficient of demand to green marketing. (2) Under low capacity, if the capacity expansion cost coefficient is large, a higher consumer environmental awareness or preference for green products will weaken the retailer’s motivation for expending green effort. (3) A contract for cost-sharing and revenue-sharing in green marketing can fully coordinate the green supply chain, whereby the two share proportions are equal and meet certain constraints.</jats:p>"

One of the most crucial ways for attracting and retaining human resource was to create a productive process and supply chain. The human resource supply chain was an integrated approach to planning, locating and controlling human resource in different businesses, from human resource’s suppliers to replacing them in relevant jobs. According to the lack of supply chain of human resource in organizations, the importance of this issue was clear to everybody. After considering the sources extracted from databases, 136 sources were obtained as samples. In this research, the design of the supply chain human resource model was done by the qualitative research method of thematic analysis, and by studying the theoretical foundations and thematic literature. The process of thematic analysis was done manually and using MAXQDA software. The results of this research show that the human resource supply chains could be summed up in six main themes of organizational needs assessment, human resource planning, recruitment and selection, human resource improvement, performance evaluation, and human resource management. By integrating these themes with the components of the supply chain, the supply chain of human resources derived from theoretical literature can be achieve. Based on the theoretical foundations of the supply chain and human resources management, the following model was present. For the amount of credibility of the human resources supply chain pattern, a model derived from theoretical literature among seven experts in the field of human resources was presented and using the Delphi technique to present the final pattern of the chain Provision of human resources.</jats:p>"

Through extended functionality, it can also be operated as pump to provide hydraulic power in certain flight phases. The paper elaborates and presents different concepts for the integration of such a multifunctional PCU and evaluates the potential regarding mass savings and improvement of reliability. In subsequent simulation studies, the most promising concept is validated and analysed regarding the arising challenges.</jats:p>",

In order to obtain the optimal solution of a looped network, non - linear hydraulic analysis and optimization of network is to be performed. In this study, non - linear hydraulic analysis is made a part of optimization by adding loop head loss and node continuity equations as constraints to the objective function. The model developed is solved by GA-NLP hybrid approach in MATLAB. Near optimal solution obtained by GA is taken as initial solution of NLP for obtaining optimal solution. By adopting GA-NLP hybrid approach, convergence is faster when compared to GA avoiding the complexity in selection of suitable trial values of GA parameters.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Many researchers applied different techniques like linear programming, integer linear programming, linear programming gradient method and branch &amp; bound algorithm etc. and optimized the looped pipe network by minimizing the cost.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A key motivation for managing invasive alien plant (IAP) species is their impacts on streamflows, which, for the wetter half of South Africa, are about 970 m3∙ha−1∙a−1 or 1 444 mill. m3∙a−1 (2.9% of naturalised mean annual runoff), comparable to forest plantations. However, the implications of these reductions for the reliability of yields from large water supply systems are less well known. The impacts on yields from the WCWSS were modelled under three invasion scenarios: ‘Baseline’ invasions; increased invasions by 2045 under ‘No management’; and under ‘Effective control’ (i.e. minimal invasions). Monthly streamflow reductions (SFRs) by invasions were simulated using the Pitman rainfall−runoff catchment model, with taxon-specific mean annual and low-flow SFR factors for dryland (upland) invasions and crop factors for riparian invasions. These streamflow reduction sequences were input into the WCWSS yield model and the model was run in stochastic mode for the three scenarios. The 98% assured total system yields were predicted to be ±580 million m3∙a−1 under ‘Effective control’, compared with ±542 million m3∙a−1 under ‘Baseline’ invasions and ±450 mill. m3∙a−1 in 45 years’ time with ‘No management’. The ‘Baseline’ invasions already reduce the yield by 38 mill. m3∙a−1 (two thirds of the capacity of the Wemmershoek Dam) and, in 45 years’ time with no clearing, the reductions would increase to 130 mill. m3∙a−1 (capacity of the Berg River Dam). Therefore IAP-related SFRs can have significant impacts on the yields of large, complex water supply systems. A key reason for this substantial impact on yields is that all the catchments in the WCWSS are invaded, and the invasions are increasing. Invasions also will cost more to clear in the future. So, the best option for all the water-users in the WCWSS is a combined effort to clear the catchments and protect their least expensive source of water.</jats:p>"

Since fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are manufacturing materials that usually require special warehousing as well as different distribution systems, and since companies of food products tend to fall into this area, the safety of their manufactured materials is a vital global challenge. For this reason, organizations in addition to governments have realized the importance of the green supply chain in these industries. Therefore, the present study examines the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the green supply chain in the FMCG industry. There are several performance indicators for the green supply chain. In this study, the KPIs were extracted based on the literatures as well as the opinions of experts through which key indicators in FMCG industries were identified. Using the fuzzy decision -making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method, the relationships and interactions of these key indices were determined. Moreover, a fuzzy nonlinear mathematical modeling was used to investigate the significance of these indicators. It is revealed that the organizational environmental management factor has the highest priority.</jats:p>"

This study examines the various drivers of watershed degradation in the basin and their implications for potable water supplies. It gives an assessment of the spatio-temporal changes in land use and its effect on water yield and erosion rates, and also assesses the probable interaction of global climate change and anthropogenic factors on water yield. The study employed a combination of field observations, informal interviews and the consultation of secondary data to investigate these drivers. The data obtained were analysed using descriptive statistical techniques, and presented in both qualitative and quantitative terms. A series of maps and photographs were used to portray land use and land cover changes in the basin. It was observed that population pressure and incompatible land use changes account for watershed degradation in the basin. The implications have been increased runoff and surface overland flow, a reduction in potable water quality and quantity resulting to frequent water cuts. The paper recommends the sustainable management of watersheds whereby, all critical components need to be included into the planning process for the watercourses and their catchments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using a contingent claims framework, we develop a single period model in the context of an exchange option in a discounted value maximization setting. Given this framework, we study the classic problem of determining stockpiling levels prior to demand realization when the procured/produced levels are subject to random yield variations. In this set up, both demand and yield variables are modeled as Wiener processes. A pure noise (zero drift) process initially models yield dynamics. Later, we consider improving the average yield rates, subsidized through increasing unit costs in a constrained cost environment. In either case, “yield adjusted” critical fractiles, the optimal order/production levels, and their corresponding expected values are established. As a special case, we relax the yield uncertainty constraint and instead use the long‐term average yield estimate to assess the yield's impact on production/procurement levels. In this context, we establish that the above results collapse to the well‐known Black‐Scholes/Merton (1973) option‐pricing model. Given the original framework of this study, we show the counterintuitive results that unit profits, due to improved average yield rates, may actually decrease. We also demonstrate that a reliable metric to justify yield improvements is the relative net positive marginal unit profit. Our paper also provides detailed comparative statics, both analytically and numerically. These results provide useful insights into policy making by identifying operating regions where the expected marginal unit profits warrant yield improvement. The results provided can readily be generalized to other economic‐based Newsvendor model parameters. </jats:p>",

The study preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. To gather data, structured questionnaire were used to collect data from a sample of one hundred and thirty (130) respondents, who were selected using simple random sampling, from the four strata. Once collected, data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Quantitative data was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The qualitative data generated was analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.Results: The response rate of the study was 74%. The regression results revealed that the IFMIS platforms identified in the study, that is, online inventory management, electronic vendor evaluation, online payments and online contract management combined could explain approximately 71.5% of the variations in the procurement performance among parastatals. The other 28.5% may be attributed to other strategies not explained by the model or the variables.Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that online inventory management, electronic vendor evaluation, online payments and online contract management have a positive relationship with procurement performance among parastatals in Kenya.Contribution to theory, policy and practice: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace IFMIS technology so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

Prior works have identified the effects of supply chain integration on firm innovation in advanced economies; however, so far, there has been limited research on the relationships between supply chain integration and firm innovation in emerging and developing countries. Hence, building upon transaction cost and resource dependence theories, this study used China’s manufacturing industry as the research setting, probing the dynamic mechanisms between supply chain integration and firm innovation. The results show that the degree of supply chain integration positively relates to firms’ patent output but negatively relates to their innovation efficiency, and that a sustainable policy moderates the foregoing associations.

This was achieved through secondary water data trends, on-site water quality assessments, visits of water supply and sanitation authorities, and assessment of their performances. It was observed that water supplied in rural-based authorities was quite different from that supplied in an urban setting as far as quality and quantity are concerned; urban-based supplies are more affordable to users than rural ones. A new strategy on water management is presented for sustainable water supply; it is based on controlling groundwater abstractions and preference of surface water in public water supplies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider a decentralized supply chain consisting of a retailer and a supplier that serves forward-looking consumers in two periods. In each period, the supplier and the retailer dynamically set the wholesale and retail price to maximize their own profits. The consumers are heterogeneous in their evaluations of the product and are strategic in deciding whether and when to buy the product, choosing the option that maximizes their utility, including waiting for a price markdown. We derive the equilibrium and study the value of price and quantity commitments from both the retailer’s and the supplier’s perspectives. We find that, although a centralized system always benefits from making price and quantity commitments, this is not true for a firm in a decentralized supply chain due to how the other firm responds to these commitments. We show that the retailer suffers from making a price or quantity commitment and that, similarly, the supplier does not benefit from making a price commitment. In these cases, commitments can harm not only the firm itself but also profitability of the other firm in the supply chain, thereby disadvantaging the entire supply chain. This happens because such commitments aggravate double-marginalization inefficiency in the supply chain. Furthermore, we show that eliminating this inefficiency through a coordinating contract (e.g., a two-part tariff or quantity discount) makes commitments beneficial. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Martin Lariviere, operations management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1977 the government of Sri Lanka implemented a series of economic reforms to create a more open economic environment and integrate the economy with the global trading system with the ultimate objective of creating an enabling economic environment so that production and other resources are used more efficiently to improve the living standards of people. The benefits of trade liberalisation, however, do not seem sommensurate with the extent of reforms in comparison to other countries that introduced similar reform measures. This paper argues that one of the main reasons for the failure in Sri Lanka's poor attention to the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory framework that would have enhanced the supply capacity of the country. Without paying adequate attention to the creation of an enabling policy and regulatory framework, Sri Lanka will not be able to reap the benefits of freer international trading environment of domestic trade liberalization.</jats:p>"

The water availability situation was assessed using the catchment data analysis of the main surface and groundwater sources and the supply data, subdivided into four categories of use. Simulations were carried out by evaluating historical data and further simulations of future scenarios. The average annual consumption was 15.8 million m3. The volume of water catchment in 2017 was more than 35 million m³, and from this total 43.5% of treated water was wasted due to losses. Domestic consumption accounts for more than 80% of the total and greywater reuse can reduce this impact, which means economizing approximately 9 million m3/year.

The St Venant equations without lateral inflow have been discretized in explicit as well as in implicit form and solved numerically, for unsteady, subcritical flow. The inflow hydrograph used can be applied for different flood events by adjusting its parameters accordingly. The results presented are derived from the explicit schemes Lax-Diffusive, MacCormack, Lambda as well as the implicit Preissmann scheme, and are compared to those from the Muskingum-Cunge method and the widely used commercial software HEC-RAS. The peak flow computed by the Lax-Diffusive scheme was reduced at the downstream end of the channel and the arrival time of the peak increased if compared to the other methods. The Muskingun-Cunge method forecasted the shortest peak flow arrival time at the downstream end cross section. Mass conservation computed from inflow and outflow hydrographs has been confirmed, since the maximum error did not exceed 2.60%. All codes were implemented in house using Matlab®.</jats:p>",

These policies are data-driven and model many features of the demand such as correlation and remain robust to parameter misspecification. We present a model that can be generalized to multiproduct settings and extended to multiperiod problems. This is accomplished by modeling the uncertain demand via sets. In this way, it offers a natural framework to study competing policies such as base-stock, affine, and approximative approaches with respect to their profit, sensitivity to parameters and assumptions, and computational scalability. We show that the periodic-affine policies are sustainable—that is, time consistent—because they warrant optimality both within subperiods and over the entire planning horizon. This approach is tractable and free of distributional assumptions, and, hence, suited for real-world applications. We provide efficient algorithms to obtain the optimal periodic-affine policies and demonstrate their advantages on the sales data from one of India’s largest pharmacy retailers. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yinyu Ye, optimization. </jats:p>",

With the gradual increase of DSCF suppliers and various requirements of small and medium-sized enterprises for suppliers in providing financing services, selecting the most suitable DSCF supplier is of great significance for most small and medium-sized enterprises to expand reproduction and improve competitiveness. To address such a decision-making problem, this paper proposes a new multi-expert multiple criteria decision-making model by integrating the Best Worst Method (BWM) and Additive Ratio ASsessment (ARAS) method under the hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment, in which the hesitant fuzzy linguistic BWM method is applied to determine the weights of criteria while the hesitant fuzzy linguistic ARAS method is proposed to rank the candidate suppliers. A case study is given to demonstrate the procedure of the proposed method for the selection of optimal DSCF suppliers, which shows the feasibility of the proposed method. Finally, sensitivity analysis and comparative analyses are provided to testify the applicability and superiority of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to identify the influence of knowledge management capability (KMC) on green supply chain management (GSCM) practices adoption of the manufacturing firm and subsequently the impact on firm performance. The data were collected from 262 Bangladeshi textile manufacturing firms and analyzed using structural equation modeling, typifying that exploratory and quantitative research. Drawing upon the resource-based view the study revealed that KMC has a significant positive effect on internal and external-GSCM practices adoption. Further, the study revealed that internal-GSCM practices have significantly positive effects on both economic and environmental performance while the external-GSCM practice has positive environmental performance but negatively affects economic performance. Finally, this study indicates that KMC is an intuitive resource of a firm that can bring sustainable performance through GSCM practices.</jats:p>"

The study preferred this method because it allowed an in-depth study of the subject. To gather data, structured questionnaire were used to collect data from a sample of one hundred and thirty (130) respondents, who were selected using simple random sampling, from the four strata. Once collected, data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Quantitative data was analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The qualitative data generated was analyzed by use of Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.Results: The response rate of the study was 74%. The regression results revealed that the IFMIS platforms identified in the study, that is, online inventory management, electronic vendor evaluation, online payments and online contract management combined could explain approximately 71.5% of the variations in the procurement performance among parastatals. The other 28.5% may be attributed to other strategies not explained by the model or the variables.Conclusion: The findings of the study indicated that online inventory management, electronic vendor evaluation, online payments and online contract management have a positive relationship with procurement performance among parastatals in Kenya.Contribution to theory, policy and practice: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace IFMIS technology so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

Artificial intelligence methods, especially the fuzzy inference system, have proven their ability in TMWE quality evaluation in complex and uncertain systems. The primary aim of this study was to use a Mamdani fuzzy inference system to present an index for agricultural application based on the Iranian water quality index (IWQI). Since the uncertainties were disregarded in the conventional IWQI, the present study improved this procedure by using fuzzy logic and then the fuzzy effluent quality index (FEQI) was proposed as a hybrid fuzzy-based index. TMWE samples of the Gheitarie wastewater treatment plant in Tehran city recorded from 2011 to 2017 were taken into consideration for testing the ability of the proposed index. The results of the FEQI showed samples categorized as ‘Excellent’ (21), ‘Good’ (10), ‘Fair’ (4), and ‘Marginal’ (1) for the warm seasons, and for the cool seasons, the samples categorized as ‘Excellent’, ‘Good’ and ‘Fair’ were 17, 18 and 1, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To extend previous research, this study focuses on how a firm’s supply chain agility affects performance through the lens of resource orchestration theory. We offer an additional extension to theory by examining the impact of environmental uncertainty in the resource orchestration process. Research indicates that a firm’s capabilities must be considered within the context of larger uncontrollable and environmental factors. While the Fisher model focuses explicitly on a product’s demand volatility, the contemporary environment for many firms can be portrayed as rapidly changing with turbulent markets, rapid product life cycles, and a changing competitive landscape. Focusing on three underlying dimensions of environmental uncertainty, namely dynamism, munificence, and complexity, we theorize that this uncertainty facilitates market orientation and moderates the mediating relationship between the firm’s market orientation and supply chain orientation and a firm’s supply chain agility. In short, orchestrating resources for a firm’s supply chain agility may or may not be as significant to achieving financial performance, depending on environmental uncertainty. Therefore, our overall contribution rests in the understanding that firms must determine the appropriate level of supply chain agility.</jats:p>",

Failures of water pipes may cause water losses (leaks), interruptions in the water supply to consumers and can be the cause of secondary water pollution in the water supply network. It was proposed to use Bayesian inference to locate failures on the water supply network and to determine a posteriori probability of water network failure. It was found that the conditional probability of distribution water supply network failure is definitely higher than the conditional probability of home connections failure. The research results should be used by the water supply company during the development of an operational strategy for the renovation and modernization of the water supply network.</jats:p>",

An autoregressive distributed lag model is used to test the relationship between Omani oil price fluctuations and the money supply over time from 37 annual observations.

Simulations were carried out by evaluating historical data and further simulations of future scenarios. The average annual consumption was 15.8 million m3. The volume of water catchment in 2017 was more than 35 million m³, and from this total 43.5% of treated water was wasted due to losses. Domestic consumption accounts for more than 80% of the total and greywater reuse can reduce this impact, which means economizing approximately 9 million m3/year.

Since productivity increases with specialization, it is presumably difficult for such producers to achieve high levels of labor productivity in each of the tasks they perform (in terms of organizing the work and controlling for costs). This study reports on the results of a detailed analysis of the apparent labor productivity in each activity segment (production, processing and distribution) on farms in Quebec (Canada) that market through short food supply chains. We adapted the concept of a complex activity system and the Work Assessment method to reflect the context in Quebec and the unique features of integrated farming models based on direct marketing. In total, we analyzed work organization on 32 Quebec farms to determine how added value and work hours are allocated among different activity segments. Our analysis of apparent labor productivity highlights the heterogeneity of farms involved in direct marketing as every farm studied had a unique profile. In addition, work patterns reflected the background, choices and skillsets of farmers and different combinations of production factors were utilized. Overall, labor productivity was lower in production-related tasks, although this was often offset by higher productivity levels in other activity segments. Our results indicate that greater productivity in the areas of processing or distribution allows farms in short food supply chains to be financially sustainable. The findings of our study also confirm that farmers involved in direct marketing work hard to sustain their activity systems, even though net earnings are often low when compared to the amount of effort involved. However, farmers are partially compensated in other ways, such as through client appreciation and work enjoyment.</jats:p>",

Thus, the macroeconomic and financial risks in the short term with influences on financial markets and investor confidence (economic sentiment) can be identified and correlated. In addition, the monthly GDP series provides a condensed set of information (monthly data) needed to develop potential GDP estimating models correlated with inflation, unemployment and relevant indicators of labor market. Another applicability is quarterly GDP forecast at least two months ahead of the flash estimate published by National Institute of Statistics (NIS2). This article presents a method of estimating the monthly GDP on the supply side. Gross value added has been broken down into five components: industry, construction, trade and transport, other market services, other activities, the first four of which are well interpolated with unifactorial regressions and some monthly explanatory variables. The results show a high correlation between the 4 components of supply and the additional aggregated quarterly series that are also available on a monthly basis. The highest dynamics of monthly GDP was recorded in August 2017 (+9.3%) and the lowest increase in August 2014 (+1.4%) over the period 2014-2018.

Therefore, one of the most important tasks in the sphere of creating the sanitary and epidemiological welfare of the population of the Russian Federation is to provide it with benign drinking water, safe in epidemiological terms and harmless in chemical composition. The purpose of this work. Conducting a hygienic assessment of the quality of drinking water for the content of this trace element at the regional level is very relevant as fluorine is important for human health, and the main way of its entry into the body is water. Material and methods. The paper presents data of own research for 2018. During this period, there were studied about 150 water samples of centralized water supply in the Vladimir region, most of which were selected in the largest settlements. The content of fluoride ions in water was determined by the method of capillary electrophoresis (HDPE F 14.1: 2: 4.157-99). As a result of the study, the Vladimir region was found to be characterized by a significant differentiation (from 0.05 mg/l to 2.75 mg/l) in the content of fluoride ions in the centralized supply water. A map was constructed for ranking the regions of the region for the content of fluoride ions in the centralized supply water. Discussions. In eight districts of the region, the fluorine content in water is much lower than the optimal values; in five regions, an exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations was detected; and only in three regions the average values are close to optimal. The different content of fluorine in water in the districts of the region is due to the natural factor of the given geographic zone. Conclusion. Providing the population of the region with benign drinking water requires a set of various measures with the development and implementation of programs to improve the water supply of populated areas. At the forefront is the individual prevention of tooth decay and fluorosis, in which an important role is played by health education, advertising of preventive drugs that have been praised by specialists.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, corporate Social Responsibility (hereafter CSR) is defined as the social and ethical behavior of supply chain members against stakeholders such as shareholders, final customers, employees and executives. Moreover, the observance of the social responsibility obligations is of great importance for consumers and shareholders of companies. The decisions of the supply chain’s members play a direct role in determining the profits of each. These decisions are in conflict with other members in a competitive environment.\nIn this paper, the contradictory variables encompasses the cost resulting from the performance of corporate social responsibility, inventory, shortage, advertising and pricing in a two-level supply chain, consisting a manufacturer and a retailer. After identifying the quantitative variables for measuring the social responsibility using Delphi-Fuzzy methods and Interpretive Structural Modeling, the most important and influential variable of measuring the social responsibility performance (forced labor ratio) has been selected. Subsequently, after modeling the profit function of each player, optimal results were emanated according to the bargaining power of each member and based on Nash and Stackelberg games. Afterwards, with numerical examples, the optimization and sensitivity analysis of social responsibility in each model has been discussed. The results indicate that the profit of manufacturer and retailer reduces by increasing the proportion of forced labor. Based upon Nash equilibrium, the manufacturer’s profit decreases with a slight slope; nonetheless, on retailer and manufacturer leadership models, the profit decreases with a slight increase of the forced labor.</jats:p>",

It is assumed that no negative sequence voltage component is present, i.e. the supply three-phase system voltages are symmetric and sinusoidal. The so called “new coordinates” and being defined with the help of them barycentric coordinates on a balanced supply line-to-line voltages triangle have been introduced. The proposed approach made it possible to obtain simple enough analytical expressions. A RMS value of the positive sequence component and further a static phasor of the zero sequence voltage unbalance factor are described. They are based on three line-to-neutral load voltages voltmeter RMS readings only. Accordingly, these calculations need no phase measurements. The presented neutral bias voltage coordinates calculations might be useful in a three-phase load circuit monitoring, diagnostics (fault detection), protection and voltages unbalance compensation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A previous paper proposed a supply chain model, comprised of a retailer and manufacturer, in which the manufacturer uses product pricing to maximize the profit of the entire supply chain. The increased profits gained from integration are then shared among all the supply chain members. The optimal pricing strategy was shown to be “products on consignment” for sale. The present study extends this simple two-layer supply chain model to a more complicated three-layer model, in which the supply chain comprises not only the retailer and manufacturer, but also an intermediate distributor. In contrast to the previous model, the present model not only considers the role of the distributor, but also the effects of product nonconformance at each facility in the supply chain. The profit function of each facility in the supply chain is established, including the sales revenue, procurement cost, and quality control cost. The investment cost at the retailer to improve the service level is also considered. It is shown that the total profit of the supply chain is maximized when the retailer’s optimal service level is adopted, where this service level is adjusted in accordance with the distributor’s unit sale price. Furthermore, after price integration, the overall profit of the supply chain is found to equal the retailer’s profit. In other words, the total profit of the manufacturer and distributor is equal to zero. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed pricing integration model under different quality environments. The results are contrasted with those obtained using a traditional pricing model, namely the “make up on cost’’ model. Overall, the present results show that the manufacturer is always the winner under partial price integration (<jats:italic>i.e.</jats:italic>, only the retailer and distributor join the integration). Furthermore, partial integration is far less profitable for the retailer and distributor than full integration.</jats:p>",

The weekly data from the TWTP were used and the predictive models were evaluated based on several numerical indicators. Four different non-linear ensemble techniques (GRNN-E, HW-E, NARX-E, and LSSVM-E) were subsequently employed. The comparison of the results of modeling showed that HW served as the best model for the simulation of Hardness, Turb, and SS while the NARX model demonstrated high capability in predicting pH. Yet, the HW and NARX as system identification techniques attained best overall predictive performance among the four modeling approaches. The HW model offers, therefore, a reliable and intelligent approach for predicting the treated Hardness, Turb, and SS and should be explored as a predictive tool in TWTP. Among the non-linear ensemble models, GRNN-E proved of high merit and increased the accuracy of the best single models significantly up to 30% for Hardness and Turb, 34% for pH, and 37% for SS with regards to the single models.</jats:p>",

The community management model of rural water services has proven to be a noteworthy approach to ensure the continuity of water supply where private and public entities do not operate. However, its sustainability depends on several aspects. The authors of the current paper performed a thorough review of relevant publications in the rural sanitation field of study using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) methodology, which enabled the creation of a list of essential factors capable to ensure the sustainability of Rural Water Supply Services (RWSS). Using the Nominal Group Technique with a selection of participants from a national conference held in Brazil in 2015, specialists hierarchized the factors, demonstrating their perception of the most important aspects necessary in RWSS throughout Brazil. Consequently, the authors noticed the necessity of a strong enabling environment, which recognizes small communities and their local services. Water quality control, post-construction support and the existence of a financial scheme were also pointed out as important aspects to ensure RWSS’s sustainability.</jats:p>"

The results show that (a) the likelihood of zero leverage increases significantly following a downgrade in credit rating; (b) zero leverage is the outcome of the past attempts by firms to issue more overvalued equity capital; and (c) firms with overconfident CEOs are more likely to choose zero leverage. The results clearly suggest that the conditions prevailing in both credit and equity markets exert significant influence on zero‐leverage policy. The analysis also advocates the inclusion of managerial biases in conjunction with the market‐wide conditions in the analysis of zero‐leverage policy. Overall, the findings reveal that zero‐leverage firms find that the benefits of issuing overvalued equity outweigh the benefits associated with debt financing.

In the present study, the risk factors for the utilization of floodwater resources in water diversion projects were identified, the index system was constructed, and the fuzziness and randomness of the risk were considered. Assessment was performed with respect to the following three projects: water storage, water conveyance, and water pumping. The specific methods to improve the cloud model are as follows: analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to calculate subjective weights, entropy weight method and projection pursuit method are used to calculate objective weights, X-conditional cloud is used to calculate index membership degree, and finally combination weight and membership degree are combined to obtain the risk level of flood resource utilization. The above methodology was applied to the risk assessment of floodwater resources utilization in the Jiangsu Province of the East Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The risk of floodwater resources utilization in high-flow, normal-flow, and low-flow years was evaluated, and the validity and applicability of the assessment method were verified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a renewable water supply option for nonpotable use, most commonly used for landscaping irrigation. Water rights in Colorado prohibit all RWH except residential rain barrels and a pilot project program that allows centralized rainwater harvesting for new development. Development of a natural catchment creates impervious surfaces, thereby increasing runoff, with a subsequent decrease in infiltration and losses to evapotranspiration; pilot projects are allowed to harvest a volume equal to the predevelopment runoff losses that would have occurred on new impervious areas at the site. To support this administrative policy, a tool was developed for the efficient calculation of daily allowable harvest at nearly any project site in Colorado. A reliable and useful policy tool requires the incorporation of hydrologic science with widely applicable, user-friendly design, a challenging balance of rigor and accessibility that is welcomed by engineers and policymakers alike. The daily allowable harvest is determined for each soil group as a percentage of infiltrated rainfall less the groundwater return. Horton’s infiltration method is used to model rainfall‒runoff for a range of soil parameters (NRCS hydrologic soil groups) and precipitation events (0.25- to 25-year return periods and 15-min to 24-h durations). For most events, the percent infiltration is 90% of the precipitation depth; this ratio decreases when precipitation exceeds the infiltration rate. Results are simplified in a spreadsheet tool for policy application, with allowable harvest rules binned by event duration and frequency. Simulations using the tool for a 2010‒2017 precipitation record from Colorado’s Front Range showed that RWH can supply up to 50% of the annual demand for traditional landscaping and over 100% of the water-smart landscaping demand.</jats:p>"

In the first setup, a cylindrical parabolic collector (CPC) was used together with 300-watt and 500-watt solar panels, the results of which were then compared with each other. Based on the results the system best performed when more powerful solar panels and a longer CPC device were used. In the second setup, solar heating was achieved by direct use of solar still units. According to comparative results between the two experimental setups, the use of direct thermal elements in the solar still unit provided better performance compared with the use of indirect thermal energy.

Additionally, in many sectors, Scope 3 indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the sourcing and distribution of goods and services are larger than firms' own carbon footprints. Here we study how firms engage their key stakeholders in their supply chains in obtaining, processing, and transferring relevant climate change‐related information designed to overcome information asymmetry and drive sustainable development. Grounded in organisational information‐processing theory (OIPT), we draw on data from the Carbon Disclosure Project's Climate Change Supply Chain initiative for a qualitative content analysis of a large sample of global firms. Consistent with OIPT, we find that although firms primarily engage their supply chain partners in a variety of ways to reduce information uncertainty around indirect emissions data, effectively interpreting and managing broader sustainability information equivocality becomes a growing priority. Our findings further suggest that firms engage suppliers, customers, and other supply chain partners through basic, transactional, and collaborative types of engagement. We contribute to literatures on interorganisational information processing and sustainable supply chain management by providing a more detailed understanding of how firms engage supply chain partners in the context of climate change.</jats:p>",

The salt-responsive mechanisms have been well studied in differentiated organs (e.g., leaves, roots, and stems), but not in unorganized cells such as callus. High-throughput quantitative proteomics approaches have been used to investigate callus development, somatic embryogenesis, organogenesis, and stress response in numbers of plant species. However, they have not been applied to callus from monocotyledonous halophyte alkaligrass ( Puccinellia tenuifora ).\nResults: The alkaligrass callus growth, viability, and membrane integrity were disturbed by 50 mM and 150 mM NaCl treatments. Callus cells accumulated the proline, soluble sugar, and glycine betaine for the maintenance of osmotic homeostasis. Importantly, the activities of diverse ROS scavenging enzymes (e.g., SOD, APX, POD, GPX, MDHAR, and GR) and antioxidants (e.g., ASA, DHA, and GSH) were all induced by salinity. The abundance pattern of 55 salt-responsive proteins indicated that salt signal transduction, cytoskeleton, ROS scavenging, energy supply, gene expression, protein synthesis and processing, as well as other basic metabolism processes were altered in callus to cope with stress.\nConclusions: The undifferentiated callus exhibited unique salinity-responsive mechanisms for ROS scavenging and energy supply. Activation of the POD pathway and AsA-GSH cycle was universal in callus and differentiated organs, but salinity-induced SOD pathway and salinity-reduced CAT pathway in callus were different from those in leaves and roots. To cope with salinity, callus mainly relied on glycolysis, but not the TCA cycle, for energy supply.</jats:p>"

Little information is known about unregulated, untreated greywater reuse practices under emergency conditions in suburban communities where consumers have become accustomed to reliable potable water supplied via a pressurised, piped distribution system. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the sources of greywater used, collection methods, storage and distribution of greywater, the application points, the level of treatment (if any) and the perceived risks associated with the greywater reuse. The City of Cape Town was selected as a case study site for research into greywater reuse under the threat of ‘Day Zero’ and stringent water restrictions, implemented during the 2017/2018 summer season. A consumer survey and analysis of relevant online forums was conducted in order to obtain the necessary information. Greywater reuse practices from a sample group of 351 consumers were identified and classified. Untreated greywater reuse was found to be common, mainly for garden irrigation and toilet flushing. The results point to high-risk activities in the study group.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters are operated in a quasisteady state with about 1.0 ms pulse created by a pulse forming network (PFN). However, there is still no precedent to verify the operation time quantitatively. The nonsteady region of the pulse can lead to an error of the thrust performance against that of steady state operation. In addition, the propellant gas outside the discharge chamber can be consumed since the exhaust velocity exceeds the estimated velocity. This paper shows the first step in quantitative evaluation of the quasisteadiness of an MPD thruster operation. First, we developed a new power supply that outputs a flat-topped and less nonsteady region pulse with a variable pulse width. Compared with that of a PFN, the nonsteady region “tr + tf” decreased from 0.532 to 0.110 ms. By implementing the circuit shorter and adjusting the gate resistance, the surge voltage in the experiment was suppressed to 309 V, which is less than 2% error of that in the PSIM simulation, 305 V. Second, we operated an MPD thruster using the new power supply for discharge and the external magnetic field. As a result, we obtained operation time characteristics by sweeping the operation time from 0.3 to 5.0 ms. The current waveforms are in a range of 620 ± 70 A. We confirmed the consistency of the thrust, 0.32 ± 0.03 N. From the correlation between the input energy and the impulse, it is possible to discuss quasisteadiness of the MPD thruster operation using the determination coefficient and the offset.</jats:p>",

However, the spatial-temporal randomness of EV charging behavior may cause insufficiency of power supply capability. This paper simulates the charging loads with massive EV integration, proposes a probabilistic evaluation index to evaluate the probability of insufficient power supply capability, and gives improvement measures for power distribution networks without hardware upgrading. First, the spatial-temporal distribution of EV charging loads is simulated via Monte Carlo method, which particularly divides EVs into three categories, private cars, buses, and taxis. Then, aggregated with conventional loads, total supply capacity of a power distribution network can be calculated on different time periods. Second, for the uncertainty of EV charging loads both in time and space, a probabilistic evaluation index is addressed to evaluate the probability of power supply capability insufficiency. After that, several improvement measures of the charging strategy are given to relieve the insufficiency of power supply capability. Finally, taking the simplified distribution network of a typical power supply mode in China’s Fujian province as an example, three scenarios with different vehicle quantities and parameters are designed, and the effectiveness of the evaluation index and improvement measures proposed are identified. The results can provide evidences for constraining EV charging behaviors with massive integration.</jats:p>"

Therefore, due to increasing water demands, increases in the population, and economic development, water supply systems are under constant stress. One of the critical uncertainties surrounding the effects of rainfall variability in Africa is the significant impact that it imposes on rural water supply services. The present study analyzes the trends in annual and seasonal rainfall time series in the Wami River Basin to see if there have been any significant changes in the patterns during the period 1983–2017 and how they affect the access to water supply services in rural areas. The study analyzes the trends of rainfall series of three stations using simple regression, Mann–Kendal Test and Sen’s Slope Estimator. The water point mapping datasets were analyzed considering seasonal variation. The analysis showed a statistically significant positive trend in annual rainfall at Kongwa and March–April–May (MAM) seasonal rainfall at Dakawa. The maximum increase in annual rainfall occurred at Kongwa (5.3 mm year−1) and for MAM seasonal data at Dakawa (4.1 mm year−1). Water points were found to be significantly affected by seasonal changes, both in terms of availability and quality of water. There also exists a strong relationship between rural water services and seasons.</jats:p>"

The EPRC dosage (2g/L) and the optimal number of Ipomoea aquatica plants (6 plants/10 L) suitable for the floating beds were determined experimentally. Results revealed that EPRC and Ipomoea aquatica composite floating beds had the best P removal effect among the three floating beds. Moreover, the root growth ratio of Ipomoea aquatica in the composite floating bed and the plant-only floating bed was 1.90 and 1.25, respectively. The stem growth ratio of Ipomoea aquatica in the composite floating bed and plant-only floating beds was 1.54 and 1.21, respectively. The leaching experiments showed that the leaching of heavy metals from the EPRC was negligible.</jats:p>",

This is made possible by networking several buildings in the same district in order to produce a sustainable, efficient and self-sufficient supply of electrical and thermal energy. The second elementary topic is the conversion from combustion engines to electric mobility, i.e. from thermal to electrical energy. A novel concept of networking different storage facilities, energy producers and consumers will enable a sustainable, self-sufficient energy supply for districts. A special feature of this energy management design is networking of electrical and thermal systems with subsequent integration of electro-mobility into the districts plant system. Energy consumption and energy generation were simulated in an exemplary project of a district containing three new low-energy buildings. The results show that a self-sufficient supply of this district is possible with intelligent control of charging cycles and charging capacity and with the use of a new storage facility for electrical energy - a Compressed Air Energy Storage system. This model concept makes not only a considerable contribution to the electro-mobility conversion, but also enables an energy-efficient and sustainable electrical and thermal supply of the district.</jats:p>",

To minimize the undesirable effects of drought, there is a need to quantify and project the drought trend. In this research, the drought was estimated and projected using Standardized Supply-Demand-Water Index (SSDI) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Field meteorological data was used in which interpolated was conducted using kriging interpolation technique within ArcGIS environment. The results indicate those moderate, severe and extreme droughts at varying magnitudes as detected by the SSDI during 1972-2010 at different meteorological stations, with SSDI values equal or less than -2.0. In a spatial domain, the areas in south-eastern parts of the UTaRB exhibit the highest drought severity. Time-series forecasts and projection show that the best networks for SSDI exhibit respective ANNs architecture. The projected extreme droughts (values less than -2.00) and abundant water availability (SSDI values ≥ 2.00) were estimated using Recursive Multi-Step Neural Networks (RMSNN). The findings can be integrated into planning the drought-mitigation-adaptation and early-warning systems in the UTaRB.</p>",

This study undertaken in hardwood and white cypress pine (Callitris glaucophylla) native forests and at sawmills in Queensland, Australia, demonstrated that there are potentially substantial quantities (up to 10.5 m3 per hectare of Crown native hardwood, 14 m3 per hectare of private forest hardwood and 75,000 m3 per year of Crown white cypress pine) logs suitable for spindleless lathe rotary veneer processing. However, access to and utilization of these logs will depend on many factors including accommodating Government policies and log supply agreements; potential alterations in the code of practice for native forest harvesting, silviculture, tree marking and sales practices; diversion of logs from other uses; and development of appropriate log specifications.</jats:p>"

The results show that the carrying capacity of water resources in Alar cannot meet the demand of social economic development in recent years, and case 3 could effectively alleviate water scarcity.

However, in practice, challenges of pursuing this strategy lie in different perspectives related to budgetary, operational and regulatory constraints. Seismic surveys performed in a compressed manner in time and/or space can provide high-quality seismic data sets in a cost-effective and productive manner. This way of acquisition normally accompanies decompression of recorded data such as deblending and/or data reconstruction. The performance of the recovery process is of fundamental importance in determining the technical success of compressed measurements. Our proposed approach aims at realizing the benefits from compression in data acquisition, contributing to cost and efficiency, while recovering deblended and reconstructed data of sufficient quality. The approach deals jointly with deblending and data reconstruction via a sparse inversion in the frequency–wavenumber domain, coupled with constraints on causality and coherency. Additionally, we formulate a single objective function aimed at sharing static information among vintages and, at the same time, at extracting dynamic changes in the reservoir of interest according to prior subsurface information. We apply the proposed approach to both synthetic and real data. A comparison with a strategy that independently recovers compressed data sets demonstrates the viability of the proposed simultaneous method to effectively enhance the quality of recovered data and extract reliable time-lapse signatures.</jats:p>",

Few studies have compared different types of green roof models under the same rainfall intensities; thus, in this study, the predictions of a non-linear storage reservoirs model, Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), and a physical process model (HYDRUS-1D) were discussed. Both models were compared against measured data obtained from a series of laboratory experiments, designed to represent different storm categories and rainfall events. It was concluded that the total runoff of the SWMM model is always less than that of HYDRUS-1D. The maximum flowrate of the SWMM model is more than that of HYDRUS-1D during all events.</jats:p>",

Therefore, appropriate management practices on supply chain of agricultural commodity could be a substantial matter since it has been facing problems in efficiency, supply, and minimizing cost. The higher the economic value of a commodity, the more important the role of management on its supply chain. One of Indonesia’s strategic and high valued commodity is shallot due to its high consumption and great contribution on regional economic development of production areas. Performance of shallot supply chain may impact on the parties involved, as farmers, traders, and suppliers. Thus, in order to formulate an accurate strategy to improve shallot supply chain performance, a measurement model is needed. This research employed Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) method to identify the model, while analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the weight of each indicator in the model. Findings of this research indicate that production is the key aspect on shallot supply chain. Furthermore, quality and order-fulfilment the most significant parameter in defining its performance is quality. Cost and order-fulfilment are proven as the highest weight-scores attribute and indicator, respectively, in measuring the performance of shallot supply chain.</jats:p>",

The morphology and distribution of the TiO2 and TiO2/GO on the membrane surface were assessed by various analyses including field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray and contact angle analysis. The results demonstrated that the reverse salt flux was only 0.2 g/m2 h. Moreover, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) removal efficiency in the cellulose triacetate with TiO2 and TiO2/GO membrane under UVC radiation was 62% and 78%, respectively, while the data obtained in visible light reached 80%. The use of TiO2 and TiO2/GO membranes significantly improved the permeability, water flux, photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and desalination of produced water.</jats:p>",

The results suggest opportunities that are related to intellectual property (IP) rights management, the monitoring of printed parts throughout their lifecycle, process improvements, and data security. The most important barriers for blockchain adoption in AM are an absence of blockchain‐skilled specialists on the labor market, missing governance mechanisms, and a lack of firm‐internal technical expertise. By addressing important limitations of AM, blockchain is expected to improve the competitiveness of AM in parts’ production, catalyzing the trend toward more decentralized manufacturing resulting in more agile, resilient, and flexible supply chains and reduced logistics costs. Beyond that, blockchain‐based AM platforms are expected to enhance supply chain visibility, drive supply chain digitalization, support supply chain finance, and contribute to the emergence of shared factory systems.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the risk assessment methodology has become the leading tool for assessing the health of various groups of the population, allowing identifying priority negative environmental factors. Material and methods. There were explored 212 wells, including 150 in collective gardens and 62 in cottage settlements. The priority oral route of chemical intake into the body was studied. Results. Nitrates and arsenic compounds create the main non-carcinogenic risk in the sources of non-centralized water supply in the territory of the Municipal Settlement of the city of ekaterinburg. When using water from wells in cottage settlements levels of non-carcinogenic risks are significantly lower than non-carcinogenic risks in horticultural partnerships. Acceptable level of non-carcinogenic risk for children under 6 years are related with 17.4% of water sources in collective gardens and 25% of wells in cottage settlements; for adults - 60.8% and 93.8% respectively. The detected nitrate concentrations in individual wells of horticultural associations can create a high non-carcinogenic risk. The total individual lifetime carcinogenic risk, both in the water of collective gardens and in the water wells of cottage settlements ranges from 10-5 to 10-4 and, therefore, is at a low level, the greatest contribution is made by arsenic compounds. Discussion. In contrast to the earlier traditional assessment of drinking water quality, when the main substances for which the discrepancy was found to hygienic standards were manganese, nitrates, iron and silicon, in the assessment of water danger using the methodology of risk assessment, nitrates and arsenic come to the first place, with a much smaller role of manganese. The calculation of carcinogenic risks using age correction factors (ADAF) has increased the risk values calculated by the traditional method by almost 2 times. Summary Levels of non-carcinogenic risks when using water from wells in cottage settlements are significantly lower than non-carcinogenic risks in horticultural partnerships.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain network design (SCND) is an important strategic decision determining the structure of each entity in the supply chain, which has an important impact on the long-term development of a company. An efficient and effective supply chain network is of vital importance for improving customer satisfaction, optimizing the allocation of resources, and increasing profitability. The environmental concerns and social responsibility awareness of the whole society have spurred researchers and managers to design sustainable supply chains (SSCs) integrating the economic, environmental, and social factors. In addition, the innate uncertainty of the SCND problem requires an integrated method to cope. In this regard, this study develops a multi-echelon multi-objective robust fuzzy closed-loop supply chain network (CLSCN) design model under uncertainty including all three dimensions of sustainability. This model considers the total cost minimization, carbon caps, and social impact maximization concurrently to realize supply chain sustainability, and is able to make a balance between the conflicting multiple objectives. Meanwhile, the uncertainty of the parameters is divided into two categories and addressed with two approaches: the first category is missed working days related to social impact, which is solved by the fuzzy membership theory; the second category is the demand and remanufacturing rate, which is settled by a robust optimization method. To validate the ability and applicability of the model and solution approach, a numerical example is conducted and solved using ILOG CPLEX. The result shows that the supply chain network structure and the value of the optimization objectives will change when considering sustainability and different degrees of uncertainty. This will enable supply chain managers to reduce the environmental impact and enhance the social benefits of their supply chain activities, and design a more stable supply chain to better cope with the influence of uncertainty.</jats:p>"

We analyzed the spatial variability of the parameters of SWCC in gravel-mulched fields using classical statistics and geostatistical methods. Soil samples were collected from the layer in 64 evenly distributed 1 × 1 m quadrats 4 m apart, center to center. SWCC in the gravel-mulched fields could be fitted well by both the van Genuchten and Brooks–Corey models, but the fit was better with the van Genuchten model. The type of fitting three parameters was tested. The model parameters θs and n of each type of soil were weakly variable, and α was moderately variable. The results indicate that the gravel-mulched field has better water retention, and the water retention effect of the new gravel-mulched fields is most obvious. The spatial variation of the parameters in SWCC can therefore be used to infer soil hydraulic properties, which is important for simplifying the calculation of SWCC and quantitatively determining the retention of soil water and for managing the capacity of soil to retain water in gravel-mulched fields in arid regions.</jats:p>",

The timely detection of these problems and the optimisation of the system requires information on the dynamics of the main parameters (flow rates, pressure measurements at each unit and the amount of gas pumped). In the conditions of high cost of multiphase flowmeters at the Orenburg field well flow rates are not measured often enough, and the task of identification of the most unstable wells in real time by auxiliary parameters measured with greater discreteness becomes urgent.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Often important production decisions based on monthly data, and less often on daily measurements. In the paper the necessity to go down to the level of analysis of highly discrete information (dozens of measurements per day) is proved by the example of the Orenburg field, because in conditions of unstable operation the averaging inside the day can lead to distortion of the general view of the operating mode. Within the framework of the analysis of dynamic parameters of gas-lift wells operation in unstable conditions, the notion of well operation quality index was introduced, i.e. a normalized metrics reflecting the general state of stability of a gas-lift well operation. This metric considers uncoordinated changes in the main parameters of the system.

Thin-film solar cells are arranged in parallel to produce a fixed voltage and a large enough current to be able to charge the battery drone. Each output of the solar cell is connected with a step-up device so that the voltage rises to 5 volts. Then all the output from the step-up will be inserted into the power booster supply so that the voltage rises to 28 volts. The unique form of thin-film solar is lightweight and flexible, so the power plant will be placed right above the frame of the drone. The goal is that sunlight can be directly received by the top layer of the solar cell to be converted into voltage. The design of this power supply circuit is expected to be able to increase the length of the drone’s flight in the air.</jats:p>",

This research was intended to find out whether the supply chain triggers the main increase of beef prices as assumed by various parties. This qualitative descriptive study found that there were three supply chain pathways with the shortest chain that was a producer to consumer. The longest chain were suppliers, producers, consumers, and two intermediaries (blantik and retailer). Long and short of supply chain did not impact on selling prices to consumers and only affected the number of producer profits. Fluctuations in beef prices should not be based on the supply chain because the supply chain is a bridge at the limitations of the parties in the supply chain. There are other determinants that can be the focus of solutions for controlling beef prices.</jats:p>",

Determination of company supply chain distribution priorities is done by using the DEMATEL method in knowing the criteria influences the selection of supply chain distribution centers. The criteria used are the four Balance Scorecard criteria, namely Financial, Internal, Customer and Learning &amp; Growth. Then distributing priorities are obtained and the relationship of influence between criteria and distribution center. Based on the analysis of the distribution center in the company (Jambi, Medan, Aceh, Riau and Padang), it is obtained that the weighting value for prioritizing the distribution in sequence is 1,0035; 1,5649; 1,3789; 1,2605 and 1,2688.

In this model, the industrial water demand function is expressed as the sum of the general industrial water demand and the power industry water demand, the urban water supply function is expressed as the Cobb–Douglas production function, investment and labor input are used as the control variables, and the difference between supply and demand in various situations is simulated by adjusting their values. In addition, the system simulation is conducted for Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China, with 16 sets of different, carefully designed investment and labor input combinations for exploring a most suitable combination of industrial water supply and demand in Suzhou. We divide the results of prediction into four categories: supply less than demand, supply equals demand, supply exceeds demand, and supply much larger than demand. The balance between supply and demand is a most suitable setting for Suzhou City to develop, and the next is the type in which the supply exceeds demand. The other two types cannot meet the development requirements. We concluded that it is easier to adjust the investment than to adjust the labor input when adjusting the control variables to change the industrial water supply. While drawing the ideal combination of investment and labor input, a reasonable range of investment and labor input is also provided: the scope of investment adjustment is     0.6  I 0  − 1.1  I 0     , and the adjustment range of labor input is     0.5  P 0  − 1.2  P 0     .</jats:p>"

During evaporation, ammonia (g) volatilization is the preferred route of NH4-N transformation and nitrate formation is initiated thereafter. Ammonia volatilization ceased at residual blackwater contents of 16–40% owing to loss of air-void connectivity. Experimental results indicated that owing to ammonia volatilization and reduced blackwater content only 23–35% of initial NH4-N concentration was transformed to NO3-N. This study also predicted the nitrate accumulation in Mulbagal town aquifer due to blackwater discharge from pit toilets. The prediction indicated that the permissible (45 mg/L) nitrate concentration in the aquifer may have been breached several decades ago, exposing the populace to prolonged drinking water contamination.</jats:p>",

However, scant attention has been paid to investigating the implementation of sustainable supply management practices from the perspective of multitier suppliers located in challenging institutional contexts. Drawing on institutional theory, this qualitative study examines how institutional pressures, mechanisms, and challenges influence the sustainability implementation of a developing country’s multitier apparel suppliers. The study not only captures the viewpoints of 46 owner–managers across 33 multitier suppliers, but also provides complementary evidence from a wide range of institutional actors. The findings show that first‐tier and second‐tier suppliers experience more collective coercive pressures than mimetic and normative pressures toward sustainability implementation. However, only coercive pressure from second‐tier suppliers influences third‐tier suppliers’ sustainability implementation. The identified key collective coercive pressures were stemming from the selection and assessment requirements of direct buyers, followed by third‐party auditors, governments, and newly emerged collective buyers’ consortia. Finally, building on empirical findings, this study presents a framework and research propositions for understanding the diffusion of sustainability to multitier suppliers.</jats:p>",

Meeting world energy needs with lower GHG emissions is its big challenge in the current context of energy transition. The possibility to use renewable power for the energy supply to offshore O&amp;G E&amp;P activities, thus reducing its emissions is discussed in this paper. In Brazil, there are today three E&amp;P environments: onshore, conventional offshore and pre-salt. In conventional offshore, the reuse of fixed platforms as structures for offshore wind development is an opportunity to be assessed. In the pre-salt, as FPSOs demands are energy intensive, the next generation of offshore wind power floating turbines might be employed. This paper presents some examples of trends in using offshore wind power, highlighting the electrification of O&amp;G platforms associated with GHG reduction. We are in the early days of offshore wind power in Brazil and the promising outlook is not for the short-term, but for the Pre-Salt country, in the current context of energy transition, it will become increasingly important to assess and implement the generation of offshore wind power.</jats:p>",

Loss-averse consumers prefer avoiding losses to gain utility with respect to their reference point while purchasing the product. Two product categories are classified: (1) basic product and (2) luxury goods which have lower and higher reference utility to consumers, respectively. The research objective is to determine the optimal price strategy in dual-channel supply chains and discuss the decision behind loss-averse consumers. To model consumers’ valuation of a product, prospect theory is adopted to calculate the demands of each channel. Then, the optimal pricing strategy and the corresponding profits are found out in a Stackelberg game manner. The results encourage manufacturers of basic goods to engage in dual-channel strategy. Effect of “double marginalization” is reduced if consumers are loss-averse in the dual-channel supply chain. Furthermore, the direct channel online contributes larger demand to the manufacturer. However, manufacturers of luxury goods are not suggested for dual-channel strategy because the demand for direct channel online is negligible and the demand for the retail channel remains unchanged. Nevertheless, retailers cannot obtain benefit from dual-channel and as a result, the profit of basic goods retailers will be reduced. </jats:p>",

Six production networks located in Manaus, Brazil are analyzed using the Global Production Network framework and factors related to plant type and supplier relationships. A multiple case study was conducted. Data was collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews administered in loco, and the selected the firms were leaders in three different industries: transportation, mechanical assembly and chemicals. The results indicate that, if effectively applied, incentives can impact production network configuration from an embeddedness perspective, causing a firm to change its strategic role. Based on the analysis, we propose five propositions that challenge the relationships among autonomy, value creation, plant types and levels of embeddedness. The propositions are particularly useful for suppliers and distributors, as well as public agencies, including infrastructure providers and policymakers.</jats:p>"

The Atacama Desert in Chile, which is the driest region on Earth and rich in nitrate deposits, is used as a Mars analog in this study to explore the potential effects of high nitrate levels on growth of extremophilic ecosystems. Seven study sites sampled across an aridity gradient in the Atacama Desert were categorized into 3 clusters—hyperarid, middle, and arid sites—as defined by essential soil physical and chemical properties. Intriguingly, the distribution of nitrate concentrations in the shallow subsurface suggests that the buildup of nitrate is not solely controlled by precipitation. Correlations of nitrate with SiO2/Al2O3 and grain sizes suggest that sedimentation rates may also be important in controlling nitrate distribution. At arid sites receiving more than 10 mm/yr precipitation, rainfall shows a stronger impact on biomass than nitrate does. However, high nitrate to organic carbon ratios are generally beneficial to N assimilation, as evidenced both by soil geochemistry and enriched culturing experiments. This study suggests that even in the absence of precipitation, nitrate levels on a more recent, hyperarid Mars could be sufficiently high to benefit potentially extant Martian microorganisms.</jats:p>"

The methodological approach to improving the efficiency of power supply systems for rural consumers requires the development of efficiency criteria that would allow all measures to improve the reliability of electricity supply, power quality, shorten time and improve the quality of technological connections to lead to uniform indicators by which to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures. The costs arising from the operation of power supply systems can be divided into stimulating and providing. Both of these components, in turn, are also divided, while the stimulating costs include those components of costs that stimulate electricity supply companies to comply with the requirements of reliability of power supply, power quality, quality of services of technical connections. Regulation of incentive costs, which include damages from interruptions in power supply, compensation costs, lost profits, etc. allows you to manage the efficiency of power supply systems. Providing costs include investment and operating costs, since these types of costs provide the ability to fulfill the conditions of quality of services provided by electricity supply companies. All components of the costs associated with the values ​​of the time of interruptions in the power supply, the time of the mismatch of the quality of electricity and the time of the technical connections. The dependencies of component costs on the time of interruptions in power supply are shown. These dependencies can be interpreted in the opposite version, as time dependencies on costs. This reading allows them to develop incentive mechanisms for energy companies and consumers to improve the reliability of power supply, power quality and quality of connection services.</jats:p>",

Water resources depletion has become a significant problem in this region that is likely to worsen. Current research by remote sensing analysis indicates a descending trend of water storage in the Middle East region, where agriculture plays a crucial role in socio-economic life. This study introduces an approach quantifying water depletion in the Middle Eastern countries, which are being challenged in the management of their water resources. Furthermore, this paper presents results of a survey assessing the status of water use and supply in Middle Eastern countries and outlines some potential remedies. Specifically, Iran's water use is evaluated and compared with its neighbors'. The water equivalent anomaly (WEA) and total water storage (TWS) depletion are two indexes of water scarcity calculated for Middle Eastern countries surveyed herein. Our analysis reveals that Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Iran are countries with very negative water scarcity indexes. These estimates prove that international cooperation is needed to manage available regional water resources and reverse depletion of natural water sources. It is demonstrated herein that virtual water trade can help remediate regional water shortage in Middle Eastern countries.</jats:p>",

The supply chain deals with two raw materials suppliers. The production facility produces two products which are shipped to customers through distribution centers. A mathematical model is developed to determine optimum quantities of purchased raw materials, production schedule (MPS), delivered quantities and raw material and products inventory for predetermined number of periods. The model is solved to maximize total supply chain profits. Results showed that at high capacity and low holding cost, the supply chain tends to produce only one product each period, for limited capacity and high value of holding cost, the supply chain may produce the two products together each period.</jats:p>"

To overcome resulting supply difficulties, innovative multimodal systems via rail terminals are promising options offering the potential to increase buffer capacity, improve supply chain resilience, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a train terminal is included in a virtual simulation environment spanning the entire wood supply chain from forest to industry to test, analyze, and evaluate a complex multimodal system in different scenario settings. Furthermore, the simulation model provides intuitive decision support through animation and a cockpit of key performance indicators, facilitating hands-on workshops with supply chain managers. Results show the advantage of a combination of unimodal and multimodal transport in the wood supply chain of the observed case-study region. This combination proves to be resilient and outperforms other tested supply chain strategies by avoiding both bottlenecks and ill-timed plans and reducing carbon dioxide (CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) emissions. Furthermore, workshops conducted with industry experts indicate that adapting collaborative supply chain control strategies by means of a participatory simulation environment enhances the development of advanced risk management and therefore improves supply chain resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. </jats:p>",

There is a linear part and a nonlinear part in the combined feedback. The new method of storing data mode is “data turning to picture”. In the second step, image features were extracted by the hybrid method of SURF-GoogLeNet and used for case matching via the grey cloud method. SURF-GoogLeNet was firstly used to update the weight proportion of the defect points in the whole image via the speeded up robust features (SURF) method and secondly to self-extract features using the GoogLeNet method.

Selected variables include operating variable of water supply system, floating population and meteorological variables and 330 observations were collected. The result shows that daily average temperature and floating population that are equivalent to mobile population influences to the daily water supply, and vice versa. Other weather factors such as average precipitation and wind speed showed little causality with the daily water supply.

Inappropriate exercise of market and contractual power may bring about inefficient allocation of tasks together with undesirable distributional consequences. A distinction should be made between isolated UTPs, whose effects mostly remain within the bilateral contractual relation, and systemic UTPs, whose effects directly or indirectly spread along the chain. The latter create much more severe consequences, both distributional and exclusionary. By examining the recently adopted EU Directive on UTPs in agri-food chains and its complementarities in respect to private regulation, the authors develop a conceptual framework that might be useful to complement existing and forthcoming regulation at EU and national level with rules reflecting the supply chain dimension of UTPs. More particularly, the authors suggest that both distributional and exclusionary systemic effects should be considered in (a) the definition of the practice, (b) the type of prohibition and the extent to which agreed terms may allow the use of some of the practices, (c) the nature and scope of liability of the infringer(s), (d) the use of presumptions concerning the practices’ effects, (e) the choice and content of sanctions and remedies. These distinctions fit within the discretionary space allowed to Member States (MSs) when implementing the directive, making the implementation more effective and consistent with its regulatory goals.</jats:p>",

Using data from 2010 and 2012 of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this study employed a difference-in-difference (DD) strategy to investigate the average treatment effect of affected adults on their spouses’ working hours. The results show that, after their spouses were diagnosed with chronic diseases, the average weekly working hours of wives and husbands would be significantly reduced by 3.7–4.2 h and 3.8–4.4 h, respectively. Specially, the average weekly hours of full-time work would be reduced by 2.1–3.3 h for wives and 3.6–3.8 h for husbands. The effect was stronger for those married couples with lower socioeconomic status (SES), such as low-level education, family asset, non-labour income, while the effect was insignificant for high-level SES households. Therefore, as a result of the adverse spillover effects on household labour supply, chronic diseases could cause a greater loss of labour force productivity. Additionally, households in low levels of SES may suffer more losses from reduced labour supply when spousal chronic diseases take place.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we focus on one of the UK’s largest water utility companies and its eight main contractors and analyze the factors influencing partner and network communication in a managed programme of their asset supply chain. We employ social network analysis to conduct the cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of partner communication. Factors found to influence the communication network are grouping of projects within the programme, individual’s organisational affiliation, status, tenure, elapsed time through the programme lifecycle, and co-location. Our contributions to practice include demonstrating water programme management factors that influence communication and trust and how social network analysis can better inform them about intra- and interorganisational relationships. Moreover, the methodology introduced in this study may be applied to water management in other parts of the world.</jats:p>"

Water scarcity and water supply disruption have caused residents of Bechar city connected to the water supply system to invest in relatively expensive storage and pumping facilities to meet their domestic needs. The survey was conducted on a sample of 20% of the population of Bechar city in a period of 4 months. Through the survey, we have reached that 74% of citizens of Bechar city are not satisfied with the quality and quantity of water and 59% of respondents are not satisfied with the water pressure and are therefore forced to use the pumps.</jats:p>",

Measurement of operational risk required in an effort to improve the performance of the palm oil supply chain, the method used in the assessment of this type of risk is Failure Mode and Effect Analysis-House of Risk (FMEA-HOR) through two stages of modelling, the analysis and evaluation stages used to know the risk event and risk agent known as HOR 1. Meanwhile the stages of risk mitigation measures applied to handle the potential risk types known as HOR 2. Based on the results of operational risk identification in the palm oil supply chain, 31 types of risk events and 20 risk agents were obtained. Furthermore, risk mitigation measures were based on the potential risk agents generated, converged into 8 risk proactive actions that are prioritized based on costs and resources effectiveness. The results of priorities proactive actions show that 1) maintenance’s labor training, 2) committing routine preventive and predictive maintenance, and 3) preparing alternate stand by equipment and machine units were necessary mitigation actions to be done.</jats:p>",

The following design and operating parameters are considered in this study: (i) spacer thickness, (ii) dimension of the permeate channel, (iii) number of leaves, and (iv) BW water pressure. The performance of PAO BW with respect to membrane cleaning efficiency is analyzed for three different high recovery RO systems by purifying 1,500 liters of water. The membrane cleaning efficiency is measured by examining the rate of permeate quality and quantity decline using ASTM D4516 method. Finally, to quantify the membrane fouling with respect to different high recovery configurations, the thickness, and composition of foulants present in the used membrane's surface are measured by using field emission scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray (FESEM-EDX). The result concludes that the RO membrane operated at high recovery with PAO BW is found to have less fouling deposits than membrane without PAO BW.</jats:p>",

This paper assesses the effect of moral hazard and adverse selection associated with the federal crop insurance program (FCIP) on the acreage and yield of major specialty crops in California. An econometric method that expands the switching regression model is developed to assess the effect. Results suggest that federal crop insurance can change specialty crop growers’ production responses to climate and soil conditions. The moral hazard effect tends to increase the acreage and yield of the specialty crops, whereas the adverse selection effect tends to have the opposite effect. The overall effect of the FCIP on acreage and yield of specialty crops is found to be moderate.</jats:p>",

However, the Greater Bay Area is located in the Pearl River Delta, where the energy is scarce and the economic development cannot be separated from the supply of energy, so solving this contradiction is a problem that cannot be bypassed in the development of the Greater Bay Area. Under the background of advocating energy-saving and environmental protection and green development, the energy utilization in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is more and more important. Based on the analysis of the energy predicament in the Greater Bay Area and the energy strategy of Japan and the United States, this paper puts forward some ideas to solve the energy dilemma in the Greater Bay Area.</jats:p>",

The parameter as well as current, voltage, and frequency to achieve of the power system, it will be considered value due to the electrical power distribution system is failing to obtain the continuous and reliable electrical power supply. In perspective of these, propose of the smart uninterruptible Power Supplies (SUPS) with control of self-healing is a fundamental component of the smart grid. The smart grid works with an automatic technique to deal with enhancing the reliability, efficiency and power quality of the system. In the proposed concept can interface with the sustainable power sources to achieve the cost-effective energy moreover detecting the fault earlier and providing an achievable respond for self-healing in the smart grid. This paper tries to clarify the continuous and reliable power supply with providing the conceivable solution from Smart-UPS (SUPS) with self-healing control over Smart Grid.

This article aims to analyze how strategies were developed to meet sustainability requirements, if this solution has ensured good quantity and high quality after ten years of operation, and the extent of the project’s economic impact on consumers. The project was analyzed as an evidence-based case study using semi-structured interviews, surveys, and document analyses. The study found that the chosen options succeeded in guaranteeing outstanding quality and secure delivery. Over 90% of water users were satisfied and had trust in it, and less than 3% were dissatisfied. The design time for withdrawal capacity has been extended from 30 to 50 years through planned measures. The study clarifies also that, due to some externalities, there has been virtually no economic impact on users. Bergaåsen is a clear case for the value of developing long-term strategies and implementing them in real life.</jats:p>"

And the results of the analysis can correspond to the consequences of pipeline failure which can be used as a basis for evaluating pipeline. The second conclusion is the node can be divided into the failure node and the influence node based on node impact evaluation of the water supply network. And the failure node can be set to monitor the water supply system focus because of the sensitivity of these two types of nodes to cascading failure. The third conclusion is the pipeline evaluation is a comprehensive evaluation of pipeline operation and node influence, and pipeline can be divided into key sections, the main pipe, the general pipe, and the key pipe and the main pipe are the greatest threats to the hydraulic reliability of the water supply pipe network, so they should be considered as the key part of system optimization and system monitoring.</jats:p>",

In order to improve the grid-connected quantity of green power, the purpose of this paper is to design the pricing mechanism for renewable energy power generator with revenue-sharing contract in a two-stage “multi-single” electricity supply chain which contains a single dominant power retailer and two kinds of power suppliers providing different power energy species.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Considering the dual uncertainties of renewable energy power output and power market demand, the authors design the full-cooperative contract decision-making model, wholesale price contract decision-making model and revenue-sharing contract decision-making model to compare and optimize grid-connected pricing in order to maximize profit of different parties in power supply chain.

The revenue-sharing contract can realize the Pareto improvement for all parties’ interest of the supply chain, and promote the grid-connected quantity of green power effectively. The grid-connected price will reduce with the increase of revenue-sharing ratio, and this impact will be greater on the renewable energy power. The greater the competition intensity in power supply side, the smaller the revenue-sharing ratio from power purchaser. And for the same rangeability of competition intensity, the revenue-sharing ratio reduction of thermal power is less than that of the green power. The more the government subsidizing green power supplier, the smaller the retailer sharing revenue to it.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>Facing with the dual uncertainties of green power output and market demand and the competition of thermal power in hybrid electricity market, this study can provide a path to solve the problem of renewable energy power grid-connecting.

Field studies have shown that due to pipe wall build-up, the shape of the inner pipe surface can vary temporally and spatially. This will lead to unrealistic pipe roughness values when calibrating the WDS model using nominal pipe diameters. Therefore, in this study, three types of pipe wall build-up were investigated using EPANET2 and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to estimate the velocity correction coefficients for EPANET2 calculations. It was shown that in old rough pipes, the mean velocities are higher than expected, indicating that in water quality estimation in a WDS, actual pipe diameters with reasonable roughness need to be defined.</jats:p>",

The system design was adapted to reduce the number of connection tubes, allowing for a series connection of multiple stacks at low cost and high reliability. One coupled PEM/PV system was tested under various temperature and irradiance conditions. All system components were also thoroughly characterized. The characterization was used to calibrate simple models of the individual components.

This paper considers four different governmental subsidy strategies, which includes none of members is subsidized (NS Scenario), only retailer is subsidized (RS Scenario), only manufacturer is subsidized (MS Scenario) and both members are subsidized (SS Scenario). A Stackelberg game model, which incorporates both governmental regulation and consumer’s awareness of carbon emission, is developed to present the pricing and emission reduction behaviors for the supply chain members as well as the subsidy policies of government under different governmental subsidy strategies, and analyze the impact of relevant coefficients on the decisions and supply chain profits. It can be concluded that subsidizing to both members is more profitable for supply chain members and government in terms of environment protection and economic development.

Under a decentralized decision dominated by the manufacturer, the manufacturer determines the wholesale price and its CSR investment, and then the retailer decides the order quantity and its CSR investment. After showing that the revenue-sharing (RS) contract is not able to coordinate the SC, a modified RS (MRS) contract is proposed to coordinate the SC.

As field–development strategies continue to evolve, refracturing and infill–well drilling must be carefully combined to optimize shale–project profitability. Moreover, operators must bear in mind the undulating natural–gas demands persisting in an oversupplied shale–gas environment. In this paper, we use data–driven approaches to predict successful refracturing candidates and local gas demand for the second–tier optimization of a shale–gas supply–chain network.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A strategic–planning (SP) model is developed for optimizing the net present value (NPV) of a case–study shale–gas network in the Marcellus Play. This SP model uses a mixed–integer–nonlinear–programming (MINLP) formulation developed in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS, Release 27.1.0.2019). This model relies directly on input from reservoir simulation, local–gas–demand forecast, water–availability forecast, and natural–gas and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude–oil price forecasts.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Before reservoir simulation, machine learning (ML) is used to predict successful refracturing candidates, using a feed–forward neural network (NN), random–forest (RF) classifier, and a t–distributed stochastic–neighbor–embedding (t–SNE) visualization technique. Using the obtained results, best–practice field–development strategies are implemented in the area of interest (AOI) using reservoir simulation. Local gas demand is forecasted using a long–short–term–memory (LSTM) recurrent NN (RNN) that uses a multivariate data set created from local and global variables affecting shale–gas demand. A water–management structure is also developed for the optimization framework.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Using a 300–well data set (with 17 input features), successful refracturing candidates were proposed according to the joint outcome of an optimal 17/23/128/2 feed–forward NN, a t–SNE plot, and a techno–economic review. After ranking F1 scores, the developed NN outperforms the RF and support–vector–machine (SVM) algorithms for frac/refrac–well classification. The developed 32/256/128/120 LSTM model showed at least a 93% (±1%) prediction performance using three or five input features. The results illustrate the ability of the developed LSTM model to accurately predict local gas demands during periods of high or low gas demand.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>After SP optimization over a 10–year planning horizon, the economic results indicate an NPV of USD 481.945 million, using the proposed physics–data–driven–based approach. An NPV of USD 611.22 million is obtained when no ML was used. The results reveal that the application of ML to strategic planning can prevent erroneous feedback of project profitability while allowing early–time decision making that maximizes shale–asset NPV.</jats:p>",

Firstly, this paper analyses the changes of the related factors of power construction after the reform of power system, and then constructs the coordination evaluation system of Yunnan power transmission network and power construction from the aspects of power development mode, energy policy and new energy access. Finally, taking Yunnan Province as an example, it evaluates the coordination of power transmission network and power construction in 2017, which proves the feasibility and science of the evaluation system.</jats:p>",

The government has come up with various facilities regarding the water supply and sanitation but there are various factors which curtail their utilization. The present study deals with the extent of utilization and factors impeding the utilization of such services at the village level.Methods: The present impeding cross-sectional study was carried out in village Nagkalan, Amritsar, where the eldest adult member present in the house at the time of the visit was interviewed. Every house of the village was visited during the period of January 2017 to December 2017, and a total of 1123 families were included in the final analysis. Thereafter, data was compiled and analyzed.Results: Out of total 1123 families, only 31.4% were using government water supply (tap water); while 42.7% had no government connection at all and used submersible as their sole source of water supply. 20.2% did not have a toilet at their house and therefore practiced open defecation; out of which majority families belonged to lower socio-economic status (statistically significant). Out of total 896 families having a toilet at their house, there were only 30 families (3.4%) who responded that some of the family members practice open defecation. Also, only 6.1% of the respondents were aware about the functions of Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC).Conclusions: More number of families (42.7%) were dependent on submersible pump as sole source of water supply. 20.2% lacked separate toilet facility, mostly belonging to lower socio- economic status. Only 6.1% were aware regarding the VHSNC. All the families disposed of their household waste on the roads.</jats:p>"

However, little attention has been paid these problems of water quality in raw water, water treatment, and household drinking water. Based on water quality data from 1979 to 2016, we show that microbes (TBC), eutrophication (TP, TN, and NH3–N), heavy metals (Fe, Mn, and Hg), and organic contamination (chemical oxygen demand (COD), detergent (Linear Alklybenzene Sulfonate, LAS), and volatile phenols (VP)) pollute the raw water sources of the Huangpu River and the Changjiang (Yangtze River) estuary. The average concentrations of these contaminants in the Huangpu River are almost double that of the Changjiang estuary, forcing a rapid shift to the Changjiang estuary for raw water. In spite of filtering and treatment, TN, NH3–N, Fe, COD, and chlorine maxima of the treated water and drinking water still exceed the Chinese National Standard. We determine that the relevant threats from the water source to household water in Shanghai are: (1) eutrophication arising from highly concentrated TN, TP, COD, and algal density in the raw water; (2) increasing salinity in the river estuary, especially at the Qingcaosha Reservoir (currently the major freshwater source for Shanghai); (3) more than 50% of organic constituents and by-products remain in treated water; and, (4) bacteria and turbidity increase in the course of water delivery to users. The analysis presents a holistic assessment of the water quality threats to metropolitan Shanghai in relation to the city’s rapid development.</jats:p>"

To implement this method, a cluster pumping station (CPS) with an autonomous power supply, thermal and water-gas impact on the formation was used. The article considers water saturation with carbon dioxide and its heating to increase oil recovery and prevent harmful combustion products from being released into the atmosphere. All the associated gases enter the heat engine turning mechanical energy into electrical one. Exhaust gases released from the heat engine are not emitted into the atmosphere. Using a smoke exhauster, they enter the mixing heat exchanger. In the mixing heat exchanger, water is heated and saturated with carbon dioxide. Then it enters the well which increases oil recovery, prevents air pollution and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</jats:p>",

Rather than becoming function-oriented, firms are now selectively deploying valuable resources on automated processes operated through technology-enabled ‘information communication’ platforms to improve performance. However, there are visible gaps in integrating business processes with information-enabled domain like enterprise resource planning (ERP), which has the potential to bring in the radical improvement in firm’s performance. Again, integration always does not come with positive results, specifically to Indian capital goods sector. Under this consideration, an attempt has been made to explore this unknown domain with conceptualization of a hypothesized model. Data for validation of this study were collected through questionnaire from 25 different units under Indian capital goods industry and relationship proposed in the hypothesized framework is tested by using structural equation modelling. Analysis of result indicates a favourable disposition of the model framework wherein synergy between business processes and ERP, on an integrated mode, can fetch higher level of performance. Considering multiple performance-related issues deterring growth of India’s capital goods industry, it is strongly recommended to synergize business processes under information system domain in order to make business sustainable. </jats:p>",

The non-cooperative strategy is used by the vendor and buyer to gain their optimal revenue. Thereby, game theoretical solution which is Nash equilibrium concept is used to determine the economic order quantity of this system. In this study, several assumptions are considered like the existence of the imperfect quality product in the manufacturing process and inspection error (Type I and Type II) in buyer’s place.

The VOB indicators were made from canola oil (CA), soybean oil (SB), and olive oil (OV) that have blended with palm oil (PO). Nine formulas of indicator were designed in combination with the oils blendings i.e (A) PO:CA:SB, (B) PO:SB:OV, (C) PO:CA:OV and the combination of various ratio were (1) 50:40:10 %v/v, (2) 50:25:25 %v/v, and (3) 50:10:40 %v/v, then the blendings were added 0.25 %m/v red lake (C.I. 16255). The diffusion kinetics of this TTI indicators have tested on a waterproof photopaper material and storaged at 4, 18, 29, 37, and 40°C.

In this way, the use of educational software has been increasingly recognized as a useful tool to promote students’ motivation to deal with, and understand, new economic concepts. Current digital technology allows students to work with a large number and variety of graphics in an interactive way, complementing the theoretical results and the so often used paper and pencil calculations. The computer algebra system Mathematica is a very powerful software that allows the implementation of many interactive visual applications. Thanks to the symbolic and numerical capabilities of Mathematica, these applications allow the user to interact with the graphical and analytical information in real time. However, Mathematica is a commercially distributed application which makes it difficult for teachers and students to access. The main goal of this paper is to present a new dynamic and interactive tool, created with Mathematica and available in the Computable Document Format. This format allows anyone with a computer to use, at no cost, the PES(Linear)-Tool, even without an active Wolfram Mathematica license. The PES(Linear)-Tool can be used as an active learning tool to promote better student activity and engagement in the learning process, among students enrolled in socio-economic programs. This tool is very intuitive to use which makes it suitable for less experienced users.</jats:p>"

Namely, it addresses the main issues of quantitative and qualitative mixture formation, the correct location of the fittings for supplying additional air is selected, the effect of additional air on the physical processes occurring in the cylinder of the power unit during its operation is determined. In addition, it considers the theoretical aspects of the dynamics of additional air introduced at the end of the filling and at the beginning of compression in the cylinder of the power unit. All of the above must be done so that the measures taken to improve the technical, economic and environmental indicators of the power unit do not contradict the conditions and requirements that were originally laid down by the manufacturer when developing this power unit. Firstly, today it is quite difficult to achieve this, the reason for this is the fact that the power units each time become more powerful in order to meet all the requirements that arise in the context of fierce competition between different manufacturers, and secondly - a high degree of unification of the constituent parts of automotive - tractor equipment and other transport technological machines and equipment that are equipped with ICE. Based on this, any refinement, even the slightest, leads to significant changes in all the main output parameters of the nodes and assemblies of the machine. In addition, it is necessary, whenever possible, to take into account all types of modernization that have been done by other researchers to improve the abovementioned parameters of the power unit.</jats:p>",

The methodology followed in this paper is based on providing weightages to machine utilisation, spindle production, end breaks, HOK (number of operative hours required to produce 100 kg of yarn), roving production, yarn realisation, CSP (count strength product), units/kg of Yarn and to compute the overall Key Performance Index in a logical manner. It has come to light that some mills have achieved an overall Key Performance Index (OKPI) of more than 100 and less than 100 in certain other mills. Also the important factors which are significant for supply chain management have been highlighted. A very useful source of information and advice for various spinning mills to develop their own supply chain strategies is provided.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lencucha and Thow have highlighted the way in which neo-liberalism is enshrined within institutional mechanisms and conditions the policy environment to shape public policy on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). They critique the strong (but important) focus of public health policy research on corporate interests and influence over NCD policy, and point toward neo-liberal policy paradigms shaping the relationship between the state, market and society as an area for critique and further exploration. They also importantly underline the way in which the neo-liberal policy paradigm shapes the supply of unhealthy goods and argue that health advocates have not engaged enough with supply side issues in critiques of policy debates on NCDs. This is an important consideration especially in the Asia-Pacific where trade and agricultural policies have markedly shaped production and what is being produced within countries. In this commentary, I reflect upon how neoliberalism shapes intersectoral action across trade, development and health within and across institutions. I also consider scope for international civil society to engage in advocacy on NCDs, especially where elusive ‘discourse coalitions’ influenced by neoliberalism may exist, rather than coordinated ‘advocacy coalitions.’</jats:p>"

Here, we investigate the resilience of urban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that citizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability and robustness of critical system elements or “capitals” (water resources, infrastructure, finances, management efficacy, and community adaptation). We translate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven contrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled system dynamics model. Water services are disrupted by recurring stochastic shocks, and we simulate the dynamics of impact and recovery cycles. Resilience emerges under various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio. Systematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water resilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a continuous gradient from water insecure and nonresilient to secure and resilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge steady‐state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and nonresilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have developed excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping point from high to low services and collapse. Where public services are insufficient, community adaptation improves water security and resilience to varying degrees. Our results highlight the need for resilience thinking in the governance of urban water systems under global change pressures.</jats:p>",

This article uses an input-output method to calculate the water use coefficients in each industrial sector in Beijing and analyses the water use characteristics of the various industrial sectors. Then, an industry association index that represents the influence and sensitivity of sectors is combined with the water use characteristics to readjust the industrial structure with the objectives of water conservation and sustainable economic development. The results indicate that the agricultural water use coefficient is the highest and that the coefficients are generally higher for sectors in secondary industry than for those in tertiary industry. In addition, all coefficients display a downward trend. The water use multipliers vary widely among sectors. In secondary industry during the study period, the number of high water use sectors remained stable, the number of potentially high water use sectors increased and the number of general water use sectors decreased. A comprehensive analysis of the water use characteristics and industrial structure correlations could provide a reference for the optimal allocation of water resources.</jats:p>",

During the composting process, retorted oil shale (ROS) and dicyandiamide (DCD) were added to PS to mitigate gaseous N losses. The study was developed in a greenhouse where four treatments were evaluated, three with compost addition (PS compost, PS compost + ROS, and PS compost + ROS + DCD) and one without compost (control) in two contrasting soils (clayey and sandy-loam). The best result was obtained with the compost without additives (PS compost), which increased the arugula dry matter yield 2.2 times in clayey soil and 6.1 times in sandy-loam soil compared to the control treatment. The presence of ROS in composts reduced arugula dry matter yield in 27% in clayey soil and 35% in sandy-loam, while DCD did not affect arugula dry matter yield. The results of this study show that the addition of ROS to PS during composting reduces N supply to arugula, both in the immediate (first cut) and residual effect (second cut).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cap-and-trade regulation is an effective mechanism to control carbon emissions. The optimization problem for a two-stage supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer under cap-and-trade regulation was investigated in this paper. Consumers’ low-carbon awareness level was considered in the decision models. Optimal decision policies, corresponding emissions, and profits were calculated for decentralized and centralized decision-making modes. Under a decentralized mode, the two-stage supply-chain optimization problem was formulated as a Stackelberg game model, where the manufacturer and retailer were the leader and follower, respectively. The manufacturer decides the emission-reduction levels per product unit and the retailer decides the retail price per unit product. The optimal decisions are derived using the reverse-solution method. By contrast, the two-stage supply-chain optimization problem under a decentralized mode was formulated as a single-level optimization model. The nonlinear model is handled by KKT optimality conditions. The influence of the regulation parameters (caps and carbon prices) and consumers’ low-carbon awareness on the optimal decision policies, the corresponding emissions, and profits is discussed in detail. A comparison between the two modes implies that the decentralized mode is dominated by the centralized mode in terms of profit and emissions. In order to provoke the decision makers under decentralized modes to make the decisions under the decentralized mode, a profit-sharing contract was designed. This study shows that higher consumer low-carbon awareness and carbon prices can improve the manufacturer-decision flexibility when there exists a profit-sharing contract. Finally, numerical experiments confirmed the analytical results.</jats:p>"

The opposite of the financial and environmental dimensions, which are already rooted in the business environment. In agrifood chains, social aspects are essential when suppliers are often impoverished farmers, and labor practices are generally painful and exploitative. This paper aims to identify, in the international literature, the state-of-the-art research related to social sustainability in agrifood supply chains. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review covering papers published in the Science Direct, Directory of Open Access Journals and Emerald Insight databases was carried out. Results indicate that academic production is still low, despite its growth in recent years, and is limited to approaches containing indicators of social sustainability related to support communities affected by agrifood business. In addition, it evidences arrangements among members of supply chains, mostly of the cooperative type, having collaborative arrangements with more limited approaches among the analyzed works.</jats:p>"

The equilibrium could be attained within 2 h when the MNB interacted with phosphate-containing water. The intercepting capacity was almost unaffected when the solution pH was varied from 4 to 10. The laboratory-scale trial showed that the MNB could positively intercept phosphorus liberated from sediment when the MNB covered the sediment, and the MNB was easy to replace once it became phosphate saturated, making its actual application feasible. Generally, the novel MNB can be considered to be a possible pathway for eutrophication control in shallow surface aquatic systems and scenic water.</jats:p>",

The characteristics of surface water have been slightly modified by adding mine water in different ratios. The process has been optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) considering pH, current density, mix ratio, and contact time as factors. At the optimized condition, the EC method has significantly reduced total organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and UV254 absorbance values up to 24%, 27%, and 80%, respectively. The cumulative impact of sample alteration and EC method has exhibited outstanding coagulant activity in terms of UV254 abs, DOC, turbidity, phenol, and absorbance slope index (ASI) as well. A decrease in ASI values indicated the reduction of trihalomethane's formation in water-containing chlorine. This was validated by reduced chlorine demand. It can be concluded that mixing mine water with surface water can be a feasible and efficient method for treating water with a high NOM content.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Different from conventional low‐rise buildings, in high‐rise buildings, the gas pressure can easily exceed the safe limit, and the hot water cannot be easily transported to the higher floors owing to the effect of gravity. Therefore, overcoming these problems to supply heating for high‐rise buildings remains a great challenge. Accordingly, gas‐hanging stoves are introduced in this study as a provision for decentralised heating supply. To analyse the influence of gas hanging stoves on high‐rise buildings and on the entire urban micro integrated energy system (UMIES), two models were developed: a scenario‐based two‐stage stochastic model for optimal scheduling of the UMIES and a gas overpressure model taking both additional overpressures caused by the frictional resistance and gravity into account. Numerical experiments based on two microgrid test systems show the efficiency of gas hanging stoves with regard to reducing operation costs of the UMIES; moreover, the gas pressure in high‐rise buildings becomes more uniform and concentrated. Thus, the supply of gas and heat to high‐rise buildings can be significantly improved.</jats:p>",

In the EU, regulatory developments are stimulating the mobilization and production of bio‐based chemicals / materials and biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass. We used an attributional life‐cycle assessment approach based on region‐specific characteristics to determine the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) performance of different supply‐chain configurations with internationally sourced lignocellulosic biomass (stem wood, forest residues, sawmill residues, and sugarcane bagasse) from the USA, the Baltic States (BS), and Brazil (BR) for the simultaneous production of lactide and ethanol in a biorefinery located in the Netherlands (NL). The results are compared with a biorefinery that uses locally cultivated sugar beets. We also compared GHG emissions savings from the supply‐chain configurations with the minimum GHG saving requirements in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) and relevant fossil‐based counterparts for bio‐based materials. The GHG emissions ‘from cradle to factory gate’ vary between 692 <jats:styled-content>g CO<jats:sub>2eq</jats:sub>/kg<jats:sub>lactide</jats:sub>\n</jats:styled-content> (sawmill residues pellets from the BS) and 1002 <jats:styled-content>g CO<jats:sub>2eq</jats:sub>/kg<jats:sub>lactide</jats:sub>\n</jats:styled-content> (sawmill chips from the USA) for lactide and between 15 <jats:styled-content>g CO<jats:sub>2eq</jats:sub>/MJ<jats:sub>ethanol</jats:sub>\n</jats:styled-content> (sawmill residues pellets from the BS) and 28 <jats:styled-content>g CO<jats:sub>2eq</jats:sub>/MJ<jats:sub>ethanol</jats:sub>\n</jats:styled-content> (bagasse pellets from BR) for ethanol. Upstream GHG emissions from the conversion routes have a relatively small impact compared with biomass conversion to lactide and ethanol. The use of woody biomass yields better GHG emissions performance for the conversion system than sugarcane bagasse or sugar beets as result of the higher lignin content that is used to generate electricity and heat internally for the system. Only the sugar beet from the NL production route is able to comply with RED II GHG savings criteria (65% by 2021). The GHG savings from polylactide acid (a derivate of lactic acid) are high and vary depending on choice of fossil‐based counterpart, with the highest savings reported when compared to polystyrene (PS). These high savings are mostly attributed to the negative emission credit from the embedded carbon in the materials. Several improvement options along the conversion routes were explored. Efficient feedstock supply chains (including pelletization and large ocean vessels) also allow for long‐distance transportation of biomass and conversion in large‐scale biorefineries close to demand centers with similar GHG performance to biorefineries with a local biomass supply. © 2019 The Authors. <jats:italic>Biofuels, Bioproducts, and Biorefining</jats:italic> published by Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

This resulted in a total maximum daily load to be imposed on the Bayou by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These designated use water quality criteria include fecal coliform (FC) levels for drinking water source, primary contact recreation, and secondary contact recreation. The goal of this study was to identify and enumerate anthropogenic nonpoint source FC contamination from malfunctioning home sewage systems in the Bayou's watershed. Thirty-four sites along the Bayou were selected for the study. Samples were analyzed for optical brightener ratios, FC CFU/100 mL (mFC), Escherichia coli, and three human markers, including human polyomavirus BK, the Archaeon Methanobrevibacter smithii, and the human-associated Brevibacterioides HF 183 eubacteria. Frequencies of sites with all three anthropogenic molecular markers are considered positive for human fecal contamination. This study provided data to address the problem of malfunctioning on-site sewage systems in the Bayou Lafourche watershed.</jats:p>",

Groundwater is found throughout Bangladesh but its quality (i.e., arsenic and salinity contamination) and quantity (i.e., water-storage depletion) vary across hydrological environments, posing unique challenges to certain geographical areas and population groups. Yet, no national-scale, multi-parameter groundwater hazard maps currently exist enabling water resources managers and policy makers to identify vulnerable areas to public health. We develop, for the first time, groundwater multi-hazard maps at the national scale of Bangladesh combining information on arsenic, salinity, and water storage. We apply geospatial techniques in ‘R’ programming language and ArcGIS environment, linking hydrological indicators for water quality and quantity to construct risk maps. A range of socioeconomic variables including access to drinking and irrigation water supplies and social vulnerability (i.e., poverty) are overlaid on these risk maps to estimate exposures. Our multi-parameter groundwater hazard maps show that a considerable proportion of land area (5–24% under extremely high to high risks) in Bangladesh is currently under combined risk of arsenic and salinity contamination, and groundwater-storage depletion. As small as 6.5 million (2.2 million poor) to 24.4 million (8.6 million poor) people are exposed to a combined risk of high arsenic, salinity, and groundwater-storage depletion. Our groundwater hazard maps reveal areas and exposure of population groups to water risks posed by arsenic and salinity contamination and depletion of water storage. These geospatial hazard maps can potentially guide policy makers in prioritizing mitigation and adaptation measures in order to achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals across the water, agriculture, and public health sectors in Bangladesh.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to explore the natural variation among eggplant accessions from different origins, in response to Low (LN) and High (HN) Nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>‐</jats:sup>) supply, to identify NUE‐contrasting genotypes and their NUE‐related traits, in hydroponic and greenhouse pot experiments. Two eggplants, AM222 and AM22, were identified as N‐use efficient and inefficient, respectively, in hydroponic, and these results were confirmed in a pot experiment, when crop yield was also evaluated. Overall, our results indicated the key role of N‐utilization component (NUtE) to confer high NUE. The remobilization of N from leaves to fruits may be a strategy to enhance NUtE, suggesting glutamate synthase as a key enzyme. Further, omics technologies will be used for focusing on C‐N metabolism interacting networks. The availability of RILs from two other selected NUE‐contrasting genotypes will allow us to detect major genes/quantitative trait loci related to NUE.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Facilitated by physical showrooms, many online first retailers have embarked on the practice of omni‐channel retailing. This offline to online mode (information delivery offline and product fulfillment online) empowers consumers’ showrooming behavior in two ways, namely, intra‐product showrooming (intra‐SR) and inter‐product showrooming (inter‐SR). As the physical showroom usually displays a partial assortment of the online products, consumer inter‐SR, i.e., the behavior of inspecting one product offline but buying a different or related product online, is critical to firms’ decisions. Moreover, inter‐SR facilitated by the retailer's omni‐channel operations changes the nature of upstream competition between manufacturers. In this article, we develop a theoretical model to investigate consumer inter‐SR behavior and the information service provision in an omni‐channel supply chain. Our main findings are as follows. First, consumer inter‐SR benefits the manufacturer whose product is displayed online exclusively but hurts the manufacturer whose product is dual‐channel displayed; inter‐SR is beneficial to the omni‐channel retailer only when the inter‐SR intensity is not too high. Second, under the service compensation contract, the dual‐channel manufacturer and the retailer can be coordinated to provide enhanced information service; the online‐exclusive manufacturer, however, may be either better off or worse off depending on the relative strengths of the utility‐increasing effect and the service‐differentiating effect of the information service enhancement. Third, the consumers located far from the showrooms are more likely to be hurt by the inter‐SR behavior and the information service compensation, while the local consumers generally benefit from them. Finally, the in‐store inventory that facilitates immediate product fulfillment has a positive impact on the retailer's information service provision.</jats:p>",

This research was conducted at the Laboratory of Agro-climatology and Statistics, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Hasanuddin, Makassar. This research was conducted in February-March 2016. Simulation of the DSSAT model was determined from primary data in the form of plant management data, soil data, and other supporting data, and secondary data in the form of climate data. The results of the study, based on the paired t-test, the DSSAT model for simulating soybean plants can predict each treatment on the parameters of vegetative weight and number of pods. A t-test on leaf root weight showed that the DSSAT model could predict all treatments except in the treatment of watering every ten days and 3.0 tons/ha of compost. Based on the value of MSE, the DSSAT model for simulating soybean plants can predict the yield of each treatment for the parameters of the number of seeds. The average difference between simulation and observation on seed weight of 314.44 kg/ha and simulation results tend to predict below observation in the field.</jats:p>",

To understand the impacts on current flows, a baseline is required. Although recent studies have improved the scope of reported greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, no quantitative overview exists including intermediate and final product flows. To address this knowledge gap, we structured the meat and dairy supply chains into a connected set of transformation nodes and distribution nodes. The former are processes transforming inputs into outputs, whereas the latter distribute the outputs to other processes using them as inputs. Currently, livestock play a central role in agriculture and other industries through the consumption of 271 Mt fodder crops, 108 Mt grain, 85 Mt grazed biomass, 49 Mt oil meal, and 16 Mt feed by‐products. This feed is transformed into 64 Mt dairy and 35 Mt meat which ensures that the EU28 is a net exporter of meat and dairy while providing 25 Mt of by‐products. This production also leads to 435 Mt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐eq. with the main contribution from beef cattle (35%), dairy cattle (32%), and swine (20%). Thus, the lower GHG intensities of dairy products compared to meat do not imply a low contribution to the total emissions. By mapping the material, energy, and GHG emission flows, we have created a baseline suitable for identifying potential supply chain changes and their related GHG increase or decrease resulting from the protein transition.</jats:p>",

One of the popular benefits is instant cash discount due to advance payment. If a retailer pays off his total purchase cost before receiving the products, then he receives a certain percentage of cash discount instantly. However, if the retailer pays off a certain fraction of the total purchasing cost, then price discount is given only at the time of receiving the products while paying the remaining amount of the total purchasing cost. Using this concept, this paper formulates, under both cases of advance payment (full or partial), an inventory model for deteriorating products where shortages are allowed and demand function is considered as price and stock dependent. The closed‐form solutions for each case are presented and two numerical examples are solved. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is also performed to show the effects of advance payment with discount facility.</jats:p>",

In modeling the AWS for paddy fields, it is still common to determine parameter values, such as infiltration rates and irrigation efficiency, solely based on literature and rough assumptions due to data limitations; however, the impact of parameter uncertainty on the estimation has not been fully discussed. In this context, a relative sensitivity index and the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method were applied to quantify the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty in an AWS simulation. A general continuity equation was employed to mathematically represent the paddy water balance, and its six parameters were investigated. The results show that the AWS estimates are sensitive to the irrigation efficiency, drainage outlet height, minimum ponding depth, and infiltration, with the irrigation efficiency appearing to be the most important parameter; thus, they should be carefully selected. Multiple combinations of parameter values were observed to provide similarly good predictions, and such equifinality produced the substantial amount of uncertainty in AWS estimates regardless of the modeling approaches, indicating that the uncertainty should be counted when developing water management plans. We also found that agricultural system simulations using only literature-based parameter values provided poor accuracy, which can lead to flawed decisions in the water resources planning processes, and then the inefficient use of public investment and resources. The results indicate that modelers’ careful parameter selection is required to improve the accuracy of modeling results and estimates from using not only information from the past studies but also modeling practices enhanced with local knowledge and experience.</jats:p>"

A current control scheme is presented in which current delivered by solar supply is used to control the current in mains supply in such a way that both currents are inversely proportional to each other. Any increment in solar current opposes mains current in the same proportion and vice versa. A balanced common physical output is resulted from the electrical load supplied by each source separately. A natural variation in solar radiation is utilized to fluctuate the solar current which is further used to change the mains current.

We also interviewed a randomly selected sample of chicken farmers (n = 96) and described their linkages with veterinary drug shops. Antimicrobials represented 15.0% [inter quartile range (IQR) 6.0–25.0] of the shops’ income. Fifty-seven percent shop owners had been/were affiliated to the veterinary authority, 57% provided diagnostic services. The median number of drug shops supplying antimicrobials to each farm during one production cycle was 2 [IQR 1–2]. Visited shops were located within a median distance of 3.96 km [IQR 1.98–5.85] to farms. Drug shops owned by persons affiliated to the veterinary authority that did not provide diagnostic services had a higher fraction of their income consisting of antimicrobial sales (β = 1.913; p &lt; 0.001).

Farmers need more sustainable and productive ways to be employed to seize a prominent place in the market with compelling profits. One effective way to do that is by using Blockchain to eliminate the middleman and scaling the product effectively. A Blockchain is a distributed and immutable ledger that holds a permanent record of transactional data. It operates as a decentralised database managed by the peers in the network eliminating the middleman. Blockchain helps the farmers to secure more profits, achieving them at least 30% more than what they are earning by currently followed conventional techniques. Especially in the Indian market, the price gap is high between producer and retailer due to the intervention of a middleman. Blockchain not only increases the profits but also ensures the authenticity of the product in real time, providing the customers and peers more information about the product as it is easier to trace the details of the product back and forth through the chain. This also enhances and regulates the price variations providing farmers with the best price they can expect for their product. This will gradually increase the involvement of more people and drives more investors towards the agriculture industry, funding more agriculture-based businesses increasing food production that can be able to feed the massive population sooner.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have become increasingly frequent and intense in public supply reservoirs as a result of eutrophication and global climate change. The semi-arid region of Brazil has a well documented history of CyanoHABs but the underlying factors that control the excessive proliferation of these organisms and the production of their bioactive secondary metabolites are not comprehensively understood. This study aimed to identify the environmental factors that explain the spatial and temporal variations in the abundance of cyanobacteria and the concentration of cyanotoxins (microcystins, saxitoxins, and cylindrospermopsin) in semi-arid reservoirs. The following hypotheses were tested: (a) the largest biovolumes of potential toxin producing cyanobacteria occur when cyanotoxin concentrations are highest; and (b) the environmental factors that explain variations in biovolume of cyanobacteria also explain changes in cyanotoxins concentrations. Samples were taken from four reservoirs located in the Northeast region of Brazil, over a three-month period (October 2016 and February and June 2017). Of the 24 species of cyanobacteria identified, 13 were potentially toxin-producing. Physicochemical variables such as water volume of the reservoir, water transparency, soluble reactive phosphorus, and total phosphorus explained the abundance of cyanobacteria and the levels of cyanotoxins. These results corroborate the hypothesis that similar physicochemical conditions influence the abundance and diversity of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. Cyanobacterial blooms composed of more than one potential toxin producing species were observed in the studied reservoirs, where potential microcystin-producing species were the most common. Microcystins and saxitoxins were detected in all the reservoirs studied, while cylindrospermopsin and the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii were simultaneously recorded in only one reservoir (Camalaú Reservoir). Cylindrospermopsin was only detected in a reservoir for the first time in the State of Paraíba. Canonical redundancy analysis showed that the cyanotoxins were related to potential toxin producing species. These results corroborate the proposed hypothesis that there is a correlation between cyanotoxins and the biomass of potential producers. Also, there were situations where cyanotoxins were detected without the presence of potential producers. These results demonstrate the need for reassessment of potential toxin producing species of cyanobacteria in semi-arid reservoirs. This may lead to the identification and characterization of novel producers of these bioactive secondary metabolites.</jats:p>"

Increasing focus on environmental concerns has driven critical changes in industries’ strategy by incorporating sustainability in their supply chain. A supply chain which does not threaten the opportunities for future generations by considering environmental and social impact in addition to the economic impact leads to the concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). Firms adopt sustainability by implementing specific practices - named as SSCM practices, in supply chain. However they struggle to identify the influential practices.This Paper intends to analyze the SSCM practices in plywood Industries in Visakhapatnam using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). ISM method is used to develop a structural model to identify the influential practices. The SSCM practices are identified through literature review and from domain experts and managers of industries. Then practices are grouped under the dimensions of sustainability namely economic, environmental and social. And ISM model is built through which the most dominant practice among them in each dimension is identified.</jats:p>"

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is first validated with experimental results. Then, the impact of grille diameter, deflector angle, and air supply layout on the data center thermal performance is investigated. The results show that the larger grille diameter may reduce the volumetric flowrate through the upstream grille, causing insufficient air supply and strong hot-air recirculation at the first rack A1. By decreasing the grille diameter from 335 mm to 235 mm, the average rack cooling index (RCI) and supply heat index (SHI) can be improved from 25.4% and 0.292 to 65% and 0.258, respectively. However, implementing small diameter grilles is not an economic way for data center performance improvement as far as the energy consumption is concerned due to the high pumping power. Meanwhile, raising the deflector angle below 30 deg in grille S1 can provide moderate improvement on temperature of the A1 rack. A further rise in the deflector to 40 deg may impose severe deterioration with a pronounced hot-spot area. The data center performance can be improved by changing from center-cold-aisle arrangement to center-hot-aisle layout. The layout provides much higher return air temperature and the RCI and SHI can be improved by 32.7% and 34.5%, respectively.</jats:p>",

The paper shows that modern assessment procedures do not take into account any features of such objects. The paper identifies factors that affect the indicator framework for assessing the physical deterioration of the main groups and components of water supply and sanitation facilities. Based on these factors, the paper proposes an algorithm for assessing the physical deterioration of facilities using a riskoriented approach for three levels: an object itself, its engineering components (facilities), and their functional elements (buildings, equipment). The paper indicates that the use of the algorithm would provide for developing recommendations for adjusting the frequency of monitoring indicators of the physical deterioration level of facilities of public water supply and sanitation systems and their elements. The implementation of the developed algorithm would contribute to the successful introduction of advanced approaches to managing risks associated with the level of physical deterioration and assessing the probability of potential negative consequences of natural, anthropogenic, and other origins. The introduction of the algorithm would also allow identifying vulnerable areas and taking preventive measures against the threat of violation of mandatory requirements including measures for reducing risks (technical and engineering renovation of buildings, facilities, equipment). This is required for objective and substantiated planning of overhaul, restoration, and development of water supply and sanitation facilities and their components.</jats:p>"

After 12 h of ENS treatment, the root/shoot rate of both cultivars were lower than that of CLN, but at 24 h it was no significant difference between ENS and CLN. Enriched N at R1 stage, soybean kept a balance of sucrose synthesis and decomposition in leaf by affecting sucrose synthetase (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities. Under N limitation condition the plant dry matter accumulation supported root growth priority. Enriched N at R1 stage resulted in the rapid shoot biomass accumulation. In high yield cultivar, the shoot growth was priority to root growth, the common yield cultivar was on the contrary. Our result suggest that enrich N at R1 stage resulted in the accumulation of biomass in shoot rapidly.</jats:p>"

The Panasqueira Mine has been operating for more than a century, extracting tungsten and tin ore. Its first processing plant, “Rio”, was located near the Zêrere river, where mineral-processing residues were deposited on the top hillside on the margin of this river in the Cabeço do Pião tailings dam. The lack of maintenance and monitoring of this enormous structure in the last twenty years represents a high risk to the environment and the population of the surrounding region. A field-sample campaign allowed the collection of data, and resulted from laboratory tests to use regression optimization. Re-mining the tailings by hydrometallurgical methods was considered to satisfy the two conditions of metal demand and environmental risk. The metal content in Cabeço do Pião was shown be enough for environmental restoration.

We combine hydrological, sedimentological, and climatological data with analysis of historical maps and photographs to show that long‐term patterns of lateral marsh change can be explained by large‐scale variation in sediment supply and its wave‐driven transport. Over 150 years, northern marshes in Great Britain expanded while most southern marshes eroded. The cause for this pattern was a north to south reduction in sediment flux and fetch‐driven wave sediment resuspension and transport. Our study provides long‐term and large‐scale evidence that sediment supply is a critical regulator of lateral marsh dynamics. Current global declines in sediment flux to the coast are likely to diminish the resilience of salt marshes and other sedimentary ecosystems to sea level rise. Managing sediment supply is not common place but may be critical to mitigating coastal impacts from climate change.</jats:p>",

Thirteen miRNAs, leptin and adiponectin were determined in milk. Leptin, adiponectin and miRNA showed a decrease over time of lactation in normal-weight mothers that was altered in overweight/obesity. Furthermore, negative correlations were observed in normal-weight mothers between the expression of miRNAs in milk and the concentration of leptin or adiponectin, but were absent in overweight/obesity. Moreover, miRNAs negatively correlated with infant BMI only in normal-weight mothers (miR-103, miR-17, miR-181a, miR-222, miR-let7c and miR-146b). Interestingly, target genes of milk miRNAs differently regulated in overweight/obesity could be related to neurodevelopmental processes. In conclusion, a set of miRNAs present in breast milk, in close conjunction with leptin and adiponectin, are natural bioactive compounds with the potential to modulate infant growth and brain development, an interplay that is disturbed in the case of maternal overweight/obesity.</jats:p>"

In plant mitochondria, the last step of AsA synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme L-galactone-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (L-GalLDH). By using GalLDH-RNAi silencing plant lines, biochemical and proteomic approaches, we here discovered that, in addition to accumulate this antioxidant, mitochondria synthesize AsA to down-regulate the respiratory activity and the cellular energy provision. The work reveals that the AsA synthesis pathway within mitochondria is a branched electron transfer process that channels electrons towards the alternative oxidase, interfering with conventional electron transport. It was unexpectedly found that significant hydrogen peroxide is generated during AsA synthesis, which affects the AsA level. The induced AsA synthesis shows proteomic alterations of mitochondrial and extra-mitochondrial proteins related to oxidative and energetic metabolism. The most identified proteins were known components of plant responses to high light acclimation, programmed cell death, oxidative stress, senescence, cell expansion, iron and phosphorus starvation, different abiotic stress/pathogen attack responses and others. We propose that changing the electron flux associated with AsA synthesis might be part of a new mechanism by which the L-GalLDH enzyme would adapt plant mitochondria to fluctuating energy demands and redox status occurring under different physiological contexts.</jats:p>"

Direct and continuous measurements of Fe from glaciers throughout an entire melt season are very limited to date. Here we present extensive seasonal data on 0.45‐μm‐filtered Fe (dFe) from three glaciers in Asia. Concentrations of dFe are negatively correlated with glacier discharge, and dFe yields are closely related to specific discharge. Based on our study and previously published dFe data, we estimate the release of dFe from Asian glaciers to be 23.8±14.1 Gg/a. We further compile a global data set of dFe from more than 12 glaciers, which, when combined with data on glacier discharge, suggest that the release of dFe from glaciers globally is on the order of 185±172 Gg/a. This finding suggests that glaciers may provide a substantial, but largely unrecognized source of potentially labile Fe, and may become increasingly important for the Fe biogeochemical cycle in a warming climate.</jats:p>",

Intrusion volume is a significant indicator of health risks when a pollution incident occurs. A pilot-scale platform was constructed to simulate the contamination intrusion through leakage holes caused by low or negative pressure events. The intrusion device was improved from the author's previous study by substituting the replaceable pipes in the main pipe for the side connecting pipe. Comparison between the two intrusion devices demonstrated that the intrusion device with the side connecting pipe may underestimate the intrusion volume. The orifice diameter range is extended to be 3–19.0 mm to analyze the effects of leakage sizes on the intrusion volume. The results show that the intrusion volume first increased and then decreased with increase of the orifice diameter. The calculated intrusion volume by the orifice discharge equation using the measured discharge coefficient is slightly different from the measured intrusion volume.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the ability of a combined buy-back (BB) and revenue sharing (RS) contract to improve the efficiency of a supply chain involving a risk-neutral supplier and a risk-averse retailer facing stochastic demand. We show that the combined contract can coordinate the supply chain under mild conditions. Further, the effects of risk aversion and contract parameters on the agents’ decision-making are analyzed when the retailer’s risk aversion is modeled by the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) criterion. In contrast to individual BB and RS contracts, the combined contract is able to mitigate the effect of risk-aversion and allow the supplier to obtain higher expected profit. Moreover, situations exist where the combined contract can coordinate the supply chain when neither the BB nor the RS contract can coordinate it. Numerical experiments conducted further confirm the analytical results derived. </jats:p>",

The plan projected population in the area is 223,176 with an average of 5 persons per household. Similarly, there are 1,038 existing water supply infrastructures in form of wells and boreholes in seven (7) districts where 2,135 households out of 42,729 households in the LGA were sampled randomly to ascertain their level of access to water supply so as to provide strong basis for the planning activity. Results of the research indicated that 50.0% of the households are water-stressed, 40.6% are partially water-stressed while only 9.4% are not water-stressed. This therefore calls for a drastic planning action through rainwater harvesting system. The objectives of the plan are to provide more water supply to augment the shortfall in domestic water requirement, reduce the effects of domestic water stress on the socio-economic indicators in the area and optimise the use of water to avoid wastage and ensure sustainability. Design standards for rainwater collection, conveyance and storage are spelt out to ensure efficiency and viability of the project with materials are in conformity with the existing standards.</jats:p>"

This study responds to the recent demand from both regulatory bodies and Distribution System Operators about the need for accurate and validated methods for this frequency band, due to the limited knowledge of the impedance values in the electrical grid and their influence on NB-PLC transmission channels. In this paper, the results of a collaborative work to develop different proposals to overcome the challenges for the proper characterization of the frequency and time-varying grid impedance, from different theoretical approaches, are presented. The methods are compared in a controlled and isolated scenario: the impedance characterization of passive filters. Then, the results are validated two-fold: first, against theoretical simulations, based on the schematics provided by the manufacturer, and second, against the measurement results of a precision impedance meter, used as a reference of accuracy. The results demonstrate a high degree of precision of the three proposals to characterize the access impedance of the LV grid.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we propose a new coordination mechanism of contract farming supply chain (hereinafter refer to as “company + farmer + option premium subsidy” or “the new/proposed mechanism”). In the new mechanism, the farmer’s interests are fully guarded by the protection price. Options are adopted by the company to hedge the downside risk and the government provides the company with option premium subsidies aiming to avoid default risk. The superiorities of the proposed mechanism compared with the traditional mechanism are illustrated in the theory and practical application. The results demonstrate that the proposed innovative subsidy mechanism is superior to the traditional and direct subsidy mechanism in regard of enhancing profits and increasing the order quantity, further to reduce the corporate default rate of the company. We also provide suggestions to determine the order quantity for the company and put forward a policy proposal to design the subsidy rate for the government. We advocate that the contract price and the strike price should be decided by the government rather than the company. We deem that the contract price should be the expected primary product price. The coordination of the proposed mechanism is reflected in making the entire supply chain more stable by balancing the interests of both the farmer and the company. By illustrating the predictions of our model under the case of a sudden change in the underlying parameters, we find that the proposed mechanism is robust even when higher volatility happens.</jats:p>",
