      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Low affinity methanotrophic bacteria consume a significant quantity of methane in wetland soils in the vicinity of plant roots and at the oxic-anoxic interface. Estimates of the efficiency of methanotrophy in peat soils vary widely in part because of differences in approaches employed to quantify methane cycling. High resolution profiles of dissolved methane abundance measured during the summer of 2003 were used to quantify rates of upward methane flux in four peatlands situated in Wales, UK. Aerobic incubations of peat from a minerotrophic and an ombrogenous mire were used to determine depth distributions of kinetic parameters associated with methane oxidation. The capacity for methanotrophy in a 3 cm thick zone immediately beneath the depth of nil methane abundance in pore water was significantly greater than the rate of upward diffusion of methane in all four peatlands. Rates of methane diffusion in pore water at the minerotrophic peatlands were small (&lt;10%) compared to surface emissions during June to August. The proportions were notably greater in the ombrogenous bogs because of their typically low methane emission rates. Methanotrophy appears to consume entirely methane transported by pore water diffusion in the four peatlands with the exception of 4 of the 33 gas profiles sampled. Flux rates to the atmosphere regardless are high because of gas transport through vascular flora, in particular, at the minerotrophic sites. Cumulative rainfall amount 3-days prior to sampling correlated well with the distance between the water table level and the depth of 0 μmol l−1 methane, indicating that precipitation events can impact methane distributions in pore water. Further work is needed to characterise the kinetics of methane oxidation spatially and temporally in different wetland types in order to determine generalized relationships for methanotrophy in peatlands that can be incorporated into process-based models of methane cycling in peat soils.\n                        </jats:p>"

There are many implicationsa supply strategy has on demand-side opportunities. They should beconsidered carefully. This integration of supply and demand-side plan-ning often does not take place because they have been thought of as twoindependent disciplines. They require two separate sets of expertise.Historically, demand-side planning has been a responsibility forengineering and operations while supply-side planning was the domainof purchasing and procurement. The integration of supply and demandis critical to control of your total energy picture. The right hand needsto know what the left hand is doing. There are a number of situationsthat illustrate where an integrated supply and demand-side approach isvitally important.This article will examine two situations as examples. We will showhow your supply-side strategy affects your true energy costs and howthat is different than in the past. We will also show how a supply-sidestrategy gives new triggers for demand-side actions.</jats:p>"

Pre-assembled kits create new kinds of inventory:a circulating inventory and its safety stock. The classic replenishment formula of the periodic review system is affectedby the use of kits. The paper establishes simple formulas to determine the size of the circulating inventoryand of its safety stock. The theme was inspired by the activities of an importer-distributor of orthopedic surgicalgoods, based in São Paulo, Brazil, who imports these items from an American manufacturer and loans the kits tohospitals for a few days to perform surgeries. Working with pre-assembled kits offers many advantages: less errors,less losses, more speed, which offset the moderate inventory increase they cause.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper considers network supply chains with price dependent demand by modelling them as large acyclic networks. Such large networks are common in the automobile and apparel industries. We develop a model to analyze the effect of these large-scale problems involving long sequences of contracts, and show that contract leadership, as well as leader position in the network, affect the performance of the entire supply chain. We generalize Spengler (Spengler, J. 1950. Vertical integration and anti-trust policy. J. Political Econom. 58 347–352) to a game on a “contract tree” for a particular supply chain and extend the concept of double marginalization so that it can be applied in the form of a transformation to each contract that is offered by one member to another in the “contract tree.” We construct an algorithm to find the equilibrium solution, and derive the optimal location of the leader (“optimal” being the leader location that maximizes total supply chain profits). Our work formalizes many intuitive insights; for example, member profits are determined by systemwide rather than individual costs. Finally, we model Cournot competition between competing supply chains (both two heterogeneous trees and multiple identical trees) and show the effect of changes in leader position as well as cost structure on the equilibrium. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Firms compete in supply functions when they offer a schedule of prices and quantities into a market; for example, this occurs in many wholesale electricity markets. We study the equilibrium behaviour when firms differ, both with regard to their costs and their capacities. We characterize strong equilibrium solutions in which, given the other players' supply functions, optimal profits are achieved for every demand realisation. If the demand can be low enough for it to be met economically with supply from just one firm, then the supply function equilibria are ordered in a natural way. We consider equilibria in which, for the highest levels of demand, all but one of the firms have reached their capacity limit. We show that there can be at most one supply function equilibrium with this property. We also propose a new numerical method to find asymmetric supply function equilibria, using piecewise-linear approximations and a discretization of the demand distribution. We show that this approach has good theoretical convergence behaviour. Finally, we present numerical results from an implementation using GAMS to demonstrate that the approach is effective in practice.</jats:p>",

However, buyers should approach online reverse auctions with caution as total cost savings can be misleading and participation may result in damaged relationships with suppliers. This can be seen in the results portrayed in the buyer and supplier industry survey which shows that buyers are more keen to participate in online reverse auctions in order to gain advantage of the lower prices and global potential of suppliers, whereas some buyers are keen on making a strong relationship with existing suppliers through direct contact.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>Buyers' determination to use online reverse auctions relies on product specifications, supplier relationships, the current supply and demand environment, indirect costs, and several other factors which will vary for each product and for each buyer.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate whether voluntary traceability labelling, introduced by Regulation 1760/2000, can be considered a useful instrument for both the producers and consumers of meat products. Attention is focused on the vertical coordination effects of introducing voluntary labelling along the beef chain and on the interest the Italian consumer shows in labelled information on meat products. Two surveys were conducted: one addressing Italian meat organizations that signed voluntary labelling agreements and the other a sample of 1,025 Italian consumers. With regard to supply, the survey revealed that improved traceability led to a better redistribution of liability among the agents of the meat supply chain and to a strengthening of vertical agreements. Regarding the consumers, the results showed a notable consumer interest in the labelled information such as the meat origin and the information related to the system of cattle breeding, cattle feeding, and the date of slaughtering. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.,</jats:p>",

Under such a contract, at the beginning of the horizon a buyer has to commit requirements for components for each period into the future. Usually, a supplier provides limited flexibility to the buyer to adjust the current order and future commitments in a rolling horizon manner. We present a general model for a buyer's procurement decision under RHF contracts. We propose two heuristics and derive a lower bound. Numerically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristics for both stationary and non‐stationary demands. We show that the heuristics are easy to compute, and hence, amenable to practical implementation. We also propose two measures for the order process that allow us to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of RHF contracts in restricting the variability in the orders, and (b) measure the accuracy of advance information vis‐a‐vis the actual orders. Numerically we demonstrate that the order process variability decreases significantly as flexibility decreases without a dramatic increase in expected costs. Our numerical studies provide several other managerial insights for the buyer; for example, we provide insights into how much flexibility is sufficient, the value of additional flexibility, the effect of flexibility on customer satisfaction (as measured by fill rate), etc. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A dynamic optimization model of conservation agriculture adoption is presented, where farmers optimize over expected utility of profits from agriculture and carbon sequestration. Adoption impacts on agricultural productivity are modeled as a combination of the technological effects of the new system, and productivity effects of changes in soil carbon on agricultural output. Comparative static results indicate increases in soil carbon sequestration price and the discount rate have unambiguous impacts on equilibrium soil carbon levels; the former leading to higher, and the latter to lower, carbon levels. Increases in the price of agricultural output and risk aversion have ambiguous impacts, depending on the relative strength of the productivity and technology effects. The paper concludes with a discussion of designing soil carbon payment mechanisms to benefit low income farmers.</jats:p>",

We use an ocean biogeochemistry model to assess the importance of the coastal nutrient supply to global ocean biogeochemistry. The model includes full cycles of P, Si, and Fe, as well as the representation of two phytoplankton groups, two zooplankton groups, and two organic detritus pools. When coastal mixing is enhanced to reproduce the action of tides and storms, primary production and chlorophyll‐a (Chla) concentrations show a large increase at the coast and a smaller increase in the open ocean. When coastal nutrient supply is enhanced to reproduce sediment resuspension or river supply, both the coastal ocean and the open ocean primary production and Chla concentration increase in comparable amounts. In agreement with the definition of nutrient limitation areas in the model, coastal export of P‐excess impacts mainly the subtropical oligotrophic areas, Si‐excess impacts the Arctic Ocean and some coastal areas, and Fe‐excess impacts the east equatorial Pacific, North Atlantic and North Pacific, and the Southern Ocean. Modeled Chla is closest to observations when the input ratio of Fe to P and Si is enhanced.</jats:p>",

Accurate forecasts of variables affecting supply and demand benefit both producers and consumers. Past forecasts of supply and demand of feed grain for livestock production in China are reviewed and reasons for discrepancies between projections are explored.

This is not only true because firms are more exposed to catastrophes, but also the result of investments made in recent years to operate supply chains with fewer human and capital resources, especially inventory. Consequently, there is today less “slack” available in supply chains to deal with catastrophic events. Thus, proactively planning for these types of events should be a priority for supply chain managers. A catastrophic event has a very low probability of occurrence but has significant consequences if it does occur. The goal of this research is to develop a process to proactively plan for catastrophic risk events through an integration of diverse research streams related to the management of risk. In particular, the proposed process builds upon an existing risk analysis framework by incorporating an innovative methodology used by the insurance industry to quantify the risk of multiple types of catastrophic events on key supply chain locations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The direct activation by calcium ions of ATP usage and feedback activation of ATP production by ADP (and Pi) alone cannot explain this perfect homoeostasis. A comparison of the response to adrenaline (increase in rate-pressure product and [PCr]) of the intact beating perfused rat heart with the elasticities of the PCr producer and consumer to PCr concentration demonstrated that both the ATP/PCr-producing block and ATP/PCr-consuming block are directly activated to a similar extent during physiological heart activation. Our finding constitutes a direct evidence for the parallel-activation mechanism of the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in heart postulated previously in a theoretical way.</jats:p>",

Economic analysis revealed that the composition of the total assets of hazelnut farms seemed to be unbalanced. In addition, the efficiency of resource use was not adequate in sample hazelnut farms. Research results also showed that hazelnut production would stop on the Carsamba Plain completely when the hazelnut price is less than $ 0.57 per kilogram. Calculated price parities between hazelnut and corn, rice, and sugar beet were 3.87, 1.77, and 15.21, respectively. In conclusion, relying on market forces would increase land and labor use efficiency.</jats:p>",

As there is little congruence between logistics and supply chain management in the emergent intersectionist model, this is eliminated from consideration at the outset. However, an examination of the new unionist and relabelling models, offering differing permutations of the relationship between logistics and supply chain management, suggests that they offer a misleading foundation for examining the costs involved with the dispersal of supply chain activities across the world. The root problem is the failure to integrate the industrial goods transformation network operated by multinational corporations with the global transport and communications network. Reverting to privileging the global transportation and communications network over the industrial goods transformation network in a revamped traditionalist model can overcome this difficulty and open up new research vistas.</jats:p>",

The supplier determines the wholesale price with a production cost decreasing with experience. The retailer orders products from the supplier to meet demands. Negative effects of a vertical competition in static supply chain models are typically attributed to a double marginalization. Using an intertemporal supply chain problem, defined by a differential game, we show that in addition to the “cost” of double marginalization, the margin gained from reducing production costs affects the supply chain performance as well. In our analysis, performance is shown to deteriorate even more than the deterioration observed in static problems with no learning (experience). To improve the performance, we provide a time‐variant version to the well‐known, pure, two‐part tariff strategy, which in its dynamic framework may coordinate the supply chain only partially. Efficient coordination in a supply chain is shown to be possible if a mixed two‐part tariff strategy is employed, however.</jats:p>",

This transition is currently piloted in the three provinces of the northeast PRC, and is expected to be extended to the whole country in the coming 2 or 3 years. Using a two-region dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations, this paper investigates the macroeconomic and welfare effects of the VAT transition in PRC. The distribution effects between generations are also analyzed to get a sense of public opinion toward the reform. We put special emphasis on the pace of reform by analyzing the pre-announcement effects and the inter-regional impacts of tax reform that began in one pilot region. The simulation results suggest large welfare gains from the VAT transition. However, the pilot reform in the northeast provinces, which delays the national implementation of consumption-based VAT, would involve substantial transitional costs for the rest of the PRC. </jats:p>",

We use panel data models with fixed and random effects to investigate the effect of the repeal. We find that male workers whose predicted marginal wage rate increased because the earnings test was repealed had the largest increase in the subjective probability of working full‐time after age 65.

We model this manufacturer and supplier as a two‐machine flow shop, consider several variations of this problem, and design effective due‐date quotation and scheduling algorithms for centralized and decentralized versions of the model. We perform extensive computational testing to assess the effectiveness of our algorithms and to compare the centralized and decentralized models to quantify the value of centralized control in a make‐to‐order supply chain.

It determines all feasible combinations of water discharge and water quality, and can be represented by a point, a line, or an area in a diagram of water discharge versus solute flow rate (a <jats:italic>Q–J</jats:italic> diagram). The shape of the <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic> is the result of dilution of two or more flows from sources of different water quality. (assuming conservative substances) Several types of <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic>s were analyzed at sources, inner nodes of a network, and of consumer outlets. The effect of water discharge constraints (due to flow limitations in the network) on the <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic>s was formulated and analyzed. Computation of <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic>s of dilution junctions by vector addition of their inflows was described. The method was extended numerically to nonlinear mixing due to dependence of water salinity. Use of this method enables computation of <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic>s for inner nodes in networks, including dilution junctions. The effect of network topology and flow direction was discussed.

To evaluate the effect of the total change only, microsimulation can be used; but for a subgroup of lone parents, a few components of this policy change can be analysed through two alternative approaches — microsimulation and quasi‐experimental evaluation. Both approaches examine the effects on the probability of employment and on average working hours. The results from microsimulation show that the combined changes introduced in July 2000 — involving reduced withdrawl rates, changed family payments and lower income tax rates — have increased labour supply for lone parents to a moderate extent. The estimated effect on average working hours when using microsimulation is very close to the effect estimated in a quasi‐experimental approach using matching techniques to control for alternative influences.</jats:p>",

Traditional design methods of irrigation systems consider primarily the hydraulic aspects. Inclusion of water quality aspects requires new tailored design methods. The method suggested herein is part of a continuous effort taken in that direction. Earlier works paved the way for the presently suggested design model which computes the feasibility domain of water discharge and quality of supply networks. Steady‐state conditions, conservative water quality parameters, instantaneous and complete mixing of water from diverse water quality sources were assumed. The <jats:italic>Q–C</jats:italic> (chemical transport sub‐problem) was dealt with and the <jats:italic>QC</jats:italic> feasibility domains of sources for the inner nodes and outlets were computed for every feasible flow pattern in a given network. Feasibility of supply was evaluated by comparing demand (water discharge and quality) values with the supply values computed by the <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic>. Real water supply in a rural community in the Arava desert, Israel, was designed using the <jats:italic>QCFD</jats:italic> model. Feasibility of various irrigation schedules was tested and a guideline for operation derived. The method, however, needs further improvement. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In the first experiment, the effect of two levels (30 and 70 kgN/ha/year) was studied during 15 years on Cabernet-Sauvignon vines grafted onto SO4 and Riparia Gloire de Montpellier (RGM). In the second one, Cabernet-Sauvignon and Merlot vines grafted on SO4 and RGM were submitted to two levels of soil fertility shortly after plantation: control and high (100 kgN/ha/year + irrigation) and data from the plantation to year 6 were recorded. In both experiments, vine vigour and yield were significantly affected by rootstocks and fertilisation/irrigation treatments. No interaction was recorded. The devigorating effect of RGM in comparison to SO4 was observed in both experiments, regardless of other parameters. Cabernet-Sauvignon was more affected by rootstock than Merlot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align: justify;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Rootstock effects on vine vegetative and reproductive development were consistently expressed, indicating that scion-rootstock interactions are governed not only by adaptative, but also by specific physiological traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"text-align: justify;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significance and impact of study&lt;/strong&gt;: This work provides information on scion-rootstock interactions which may be useful in rootstock breeding programs and may help to better choose the rootstock according to the scion and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lettuce is one of the leading vegetables in Brazil. However, studies concerning its fertilization for the Northeastern region of the country are still scarce. This work was carried out to evaluate the effects of mineral Nitrogen supply and organic fertilization on the production and nitrate accumulation in lettuce, cultivar Elba, in the semi-arid zone of Paraíba, Brazil. A randomized block design, with four replications, was used to test five doses of cattle manure (30; 60; 90; 120, and 150 t ha-1), five doses of N supplied as urea (30; 60; 90; 120, and 150 kg ha-1), and a control without fertilization. Along with mineral N, the other nutrients were also supplied using mineral sources. No additional nutrients were supplied where organic fertilization was used. Lettuce yield was significantly higher when organic fertilization was used, compared to the mineral nutrient supply. Taking into account most of the fertilization doses recommended for growing lettuce in the Brazilian Northeastern States, N mineral fertilization in sandy soils with low organic matter contents can be fully replaced by organic fertilization with cattle manure. Plant total (PTY) and commercial yield (PCY) as affected by the mineral N supply fitted into a quadratic model, in which the doses 94.5 and 95.7 kg ha-1 corresponded to respectively the highest PTY (381.9 g plant-1) and PCY (321.6 g plant-1). Where organic fertilization was used, PTY and PCY fitted into a linear model. Therefore, the highest PTY (523.9 g plant-1) and PCY (449.48 g plant-1) were observed at the highest manure doses. Nitrate content on roots, stems, and leaves increased linearly with Nitrogen and manure application. In roots, the nitrate content (mg kg-1 of fresh matter) reached 93.96 (N mineral (Nm)) and 65.09 (organic fertilization (OF)); in stems, 183.45 (Nm) and 98.22 (OF); and in leaves, 121.98 (Nm) and 75.62 (OF). The maximum nitrate content observed in leaves was far below the risk level for human health.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent trends in urbanization of the population, increased need for bio-security on large farms, and more food-animal or mixed-animal practitioners approaching retirement age are forcing a renewed focus on recruiting and training veterinary students with an interest in production-animal medicine. The increasing number of veterinary students coming from urban backgrounds has led to a need to expose these students to standard animal-production practices and to interest them in a career involving food animals. This article describes one such program developed at Iowa State University, in which 14 students obtained hands-on experience in all aspects of swine and dairy production across a wide sampling of herd size, housing style, bio-security levels, and production phases. The participating students, ranging from senior undergraduates to third-year veterinary students, gained valuable insight not only into daily farming practices but also the knowledge and skills necessary to provide quality veterinary care to these clients. The first year of this program has yielded positive feedback from all participants, including the veterinary practices, private producers, corporate sponsors, and students. Current applicants cite positive comments from past participants as motivating their interest in the program. This program has the potential to expand as an opportunity to educate selected students in the field of food-supply veterinary medicine and to help fill the anticipated void in this area. </jats:p>",
