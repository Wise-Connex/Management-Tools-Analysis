Empirical evidence is mixed, however, and the concept of buyer–supplier collaboration is under‐developed. This work develops a new construct, buyer–supplier collaboration quality, defined as the extent to which a buyer and supplier exploit shared resources while minimizing waste through interacting during project planning and execution. We use resource dependence theory to formulate interfirm and project‐level antecedents of buyer–supplier collaboration quality and argue how it affects new product development project outcomes. Data from an empirical survey of 214 buying organizations validate the measurement structure of the new construct and support its positive associations with design quality and project efficiency. We also find that goal congruence, complementary capabilities and interfirm coordination efforts increase buyer–supplier collaboration quality, while interfirm relationship‐specific investment reduces it.</jats:p>",

In this sense, performance-based contracting (PBC) entails increased financial risk for providers.

However, none address reducing interactive complexity prior to adopting countermeasures to mitigate everyday or normal supply chain disruptions. Most mitigation strategies focus on adding capabilities or resources to protect an organization. Here, the authors aim to consider an alternative strategy of examining current processes to determine whether processes can be simplified by using the normal accident theory and its constructs of interactive complexity and coupling as a theoretical basis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– The authors develop a model based on the normal accident theory and use logistic regression to test their propositions in the context of a steel processing plant and its customers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The findings show the importance of reducing interactive complexity to mitigate supply chain disruptions.

The authors suggest a strategy in which countermeasures that increase slack in the system should be considered only after the system is sufficiently simplified to mitigate disruptions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The purpose of this research was to determine if product strategies and supply chain practices of small craft business are aligned. Personal in-depth interviews were conducted with nine craft businesses operating in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The findings revealed that craft businesses struggle to match their product strategies with their supply chain strategies.

Hypotheses are developed regarding the implications of the network structure for a firm's partner selection in manufacturing joint ventures. The roles of network theory constructs such as ego network size, ego network density, and ego network betweenness centrality on new manufacturing joint venture formations are explored using a dynamic framework. A comprehensive time series panel dataset with 3,247,124 observations containing the joint venture information of 1,158 automotive firms collectively engaging in 589 manufacturing joint ventures over 19 years is utilized to test the hypotheses. Results provide strong empirical support for the role of network structure in equity‐based partnership formation. Specifically, ego network size and ego network betweenness centrality of both the focal manufacturer and potential partner have significant effects on new manufacturing joint venture formations. Findings regarding the role of ego network density are mixed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As with most mining activities, the mining of manganese and phosphate has serious consequences for the environment. Despite a largely adequate and progressive framework for environmental governance developed since 1994, few mines have integrated systems into their supply chain processes to minimise environmental risks and ensure the achievement of acceptable standards. Indeed, few mines have been able to implement green supply chain management (GrSCM). The purpose of this article was to explore challenges related to the implementation of GrSCM and to provide insight into how GrSCM can be implemented in the South African manganese and phosphate industry. This article reported findings of a qualitative study involving interviews with 12 participants from the manganese and phosphate industry in South Africa. Purposive sampling techniques were used. Emerging from the study were six themes, all of which were identified as key challenges in the implementation of GrSCM in the manganese and phosphate mining industry. From the findings, these challenges include the operationalisation of environmental issues, lack of collaboration and knowledge sharing, proper application of monitoring and control systems,lack of clear policy and legislative direction, the cost of implementing GrSCM practices, and the need for strong leadership and management of change. On the basis of the literature reviewed and empirical findings, conclusions were drawn and policy and management recommendations were accordingly made.</jats:p>"

In this research note the authors propose the critical realism (CR) philosophy of science as a particularly suitable philosophical position (not to the exclusion of others) to review the mechanisms of OSCM knowledge generation and to provide philosophical grounding and methodological guidance for both OSCM theory building and testing. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – To demonstrate potential benefits of CR-based structured approach to knowledge generation in OSCM research, this conceptual paper uses a case study that illustrates the adoption of one of the OSCM theories – i.e. the theory of swift, even flow. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – CR interprets the accumulated empirical information about OSCM phenomena as observable manifestations of the underlying causal mechanisms that cannot be perceived otherwise. CR can provide epistemological support to the choice of performance measures that manifest the underlying causal mechanisms of interest. Extensive accumulation of empirical data from multiple innovative sources will not dramatically add to understanding of the system under investigation, unless and until the underlying causal mechanisms that trigger the observed behaviour are identified and tested. The CR abductive mode of reasoning emphasises the role of uncertainty in complex process behaviours and can facilitate enrichment and refutation of OSCM theories. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – CR has a clear potential to contribute to OSCM research by enabling better understanding of causal relationships underlying complex behaviours of different elements of business process by providing robust and relevant mechanisms of generating knowledge about business processes that explicitly link empirical and causal aspects of theory building and testing.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

While researchers recognize that these stakeholder entities have different saliency and influences over a focal firm, the influences from multiple stakeholders are often aggregated as a single factor, overlooking differences among them. Stakeholders may have competing demands: A buyer may consider only potential environment‐cost trade‐offs, while the government balances the environment, increased cost‐competitive manufacturing and job creation. Such demands compete for the same resources within the supplier's organization, forcing suppliers to satisfice and compromise. This study qualitatively examines Chinese suppliers' responses to requests to adopt energy efficiency (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EE</jats:styled-content>) initiatives in their production plants by two of their most critical stakeholders: buyers and the government. We identify three categories of<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EE</jats:styled-content>initiatives implemented by the suppliers and find that their implementations are contingent on their ownership characteristics and value alignment with these two stakeholders. Further, we find that suppliers interpret buyers' motives regarding<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EE</jats:styled-content>in the context of buyer–supplier relationships and environmental positioning of the buyers' products.

Two samples of 153 and 199 companies, operating as key suppliers of two focal buyers, a European multinational retail chain and an American multinational spare parts distributor, respectively, constitute the empirical base of the study. Results derived from structural equation modeling and, more precisely, multi‐group confirmatory factor analysis and a formal test of mediation, strongly indicate for both samples that AC mediates between organizational compatibility on the one hand and innovation and efficiency performance on the other hand. Results also indicate that the mediating effect of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AC</jats:styled-content> related to innovation increases with demand uncertainty.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Governance is critical to an alliance relationship as it aids in curbing opportunism and thus in achieving higher performance. While research suggests relational governance as well as formal control mechanisms as viable means to reduce opportunistic behavior in an alliance relationship, the effectiveness of the interplay of these governance forms remains an important issue. This research addresses this challenge by applying social contract theory to resolve the uncertainties surrounding whether relational governance, exercised by joint actions in the performance measurement process (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PMP</jats:styled-content>), can be effectively complemented by the formal control mechanisms of output and process controls. Based on a survey of 197 horizontal alliances of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">G</jats:styled-content>erman logistics service providers and using structural equation modeling, we find that if formal control mechanisms are legitimized by underlying agreements, which are established through relational governance (i.e., joint actions), the two governance forms indeed complement each other. However, if no such legitimization through social contracts is present, the complementation is counterproductive. Furthermore, it is shown that opportunism in the setting of horizontal alliances is also detrimental to alliance success.</jats:p>",

Using a meta‐analysis, we examine empirical studies to clarify the actual relationship, suggest new directions, and ultimately contribute toward the development of supply chain management theory. We focus on “strategic” supply chain integration rather than on functional or operational/tactical studies, which would weaken the practical value of the analysis and findings. To ascertain focus and homogeneity of the sample, we adopt a rigorous search protocol and sample construction. We find that integration–performance relationships are complex and nuanced such that integration should not be universally viewed as improving performance. We identify relationships that are more generalizable and also those that need additional scrutiny. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and provide directions for future research.</jats:p>",

Because the overconfident retailer's profits are always less than the rational one's, we discuss how supplier could take contractual mechanisms to achieve the maximize profits of supply chain, when confronted with an overconfident retailer.</jats:p>"

Weak links in a supply chain may be caused by a range of drivers beyond the safety, financial, quality and schedule indicators that have historically been considered in supplier selection and management. Sustainability aspects including environmental, social and governance issues can weaken supplier performance by causing lost production, supply interruptions, schedule delays, material inefficiencies, price increases, safety impairment, regulatory violations, employee issues and community resentment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes elements of ConocoPhillips’ Supply Chain Sustainability program as expanded in 2013 to support the improvement of our project execution and operations management through strengthening our supply chain on sustainability drivers that impact our business.

Therefore, a crop's cycle (from planting to felling) should be long enough in order to cover the fixed cost and become profitable. The problem becomes involved when the cycle's duration is stochastic due to occurrence of uncertain event that terminates the cycle prematurely. Studying orchard management under stochastic drought events, we show that to each perennial crop that is profitable without drought hazard, there exists a critical drought hazard above which the crop turns loss making. We refer to this critical drought hazard as the crop's drought vulnerability index and show that it increases with the length of the gestation period, the ratio of fixed cost to average annual profit and the interest rate, and decreases with the natural (uninterrupted) cycle length. We then investigate the economic value of a stable water source, such as recycled water, that stabilizes the water supply and diminishes the drought hazard. An empirical application in northern Israel reveals that the stabilization value of recycled water due to its role in eliminating the drought hazard far exceeds its supply cost.</jats:p>",

This study identified the leading procurement practices as: procurement strategy and leadership, the procurement process, human resource management, procurement information systems, supplier management and procurement performance management. These practices were then tested in public entities, mainly in Gauteng Province, South Africa, to determine the extent to which they are applied. The study found that there is a major divide between the perception of the level of application of the leading practices and actual implementation. Processes, skills, performance management, information technology (IT) systems and supplier management are applied inadequately or inappropriately. Most entities thus show a poor understanding of customer needs and there seems to be a general lack of customer focus. The study highlighted the best practice areas in which public entities are able to focus their efforts to better achieve excellent customer service and thus service delivery.</jats:p>"

Data for the paper were collected from twelve village communities, where water is being supplied either through their community based institution or through the local government institution of the Gram Panchayat. The findings suggest that the two types of institutions performed differently in implementing the DRA. It depicted that the DRA under the broader rubric of institutional reforms in the water sector has failed to address the question of social inequality, and rather had reinforced and extended the already existing inequity of Indian society to access to safe and secure drinking water in rural areas. The study highlights that participation, cost recovery, full operation and management transfer may be an efficient proposition, but not sustainable in the long run without proper investment in institution building and support from the state, especially in provisioning of basic services like drinking water to rural poor.</jats:p>",

Secondly, it argues that the SADC Water Division and International River Basin Organizations (RBOs) in Southern Africa can play a crucial role in DRR in the water sector, providing a platform where agreements on data and information sharing are reached, best practices are exchanged, policies harmonized, new collaboration mechanisms are discussed, and coordinated interventions are decided upon. Moreover, RBOs can facilitate the adoption of basin-wide Integrated Water Resource Management plans, building on the pillars of economic efficiency, social equity and environmental sustainability with the result of reducing hazards and increasing resilience. RBOs can represent the shared interests of riparian states from a basin perspective to other international actors. To achieve these goals, RBOs in Southern Africa face significant challenges: broadening stakeholder participation, gaining buy-in from Member States on their representation and facilitation of specific matters. Possible approaches to overcome these challenges will be suggested in this paper.</jats:p>",

Using both across- and within-state variation in exposure to the disenrollment, we estimate large increases in labor supply, primarily along the extensive margin. The increased employment is concentrated among individuals working at least 20 hours a week and receiving private, employer-provided health insurance. We explore the dynamic effects of the disenrollment and find an immediate increase in job search behavior and a steady rise in both employment and health insurance coverage following the disenrollment. Our results are consistent with a significant degree of “employment lock”—workers who are employed primarily to secure private health insurance coverage.</jats:p>",

Penalty, subsidy and water price increase are often considered the main policy tools for encouraging water supply companies to upgrade their production facilities. However, the implementation of upgrading water supply facilities is being confronted with some uncertainties because of the conflicts of involved stakeholders. This study develops a game model between municipal government and a water company to analyze their conflicts of interests and optimize the strategy for upgrading water supply facilities. Empirical analyses from three Chinese urban water companies are presented. Using theoretical and numerical analysis, the effects of penalty, subsidy and water price increase on strategies of upgrading water supply facilities were obtained. The main findings are that water price and penalty are the effective policies to optimize key stakeholders' strategies, while subsidy policy is not useful. The conclusion has important policy implications for ensuring water supply safety and reliability.</jats:p>",

In this paper we study the possibility of using a non-magnetic adsorbent powder mixed with magnetite and a coagulant such as ferric chloride added after the adsorption to create magnetic flocs that can be magnetically separated (magnetic seeding). A natural zeolite and Na-activated zeolite mixed with magnetite and ferric chloride are tested. The combination of sedimentation (with coagulant) followed by magnetic filtration is from six to 30 times faster than only sedimentation (with coagulant) in attaining the same final turbidity. Also, a magnetic activated carbon (MAC) powder with and without the addition of ferric chloride is tested. The process conditions that lead to a residual turbidity less than 10% after 5–10 min of magnetic separation are defined for all the powders. The tests on Mn(II) adsorption on Na-activated zeolite–magnetite mixtures show that the adsorption improvement due to activation is not affected by the addition of the coagulant. Moreover, adsorption of the tested cationic surfactants on MAC is up to 30% higher by adding ferric chloride. Negligible concentrations of Fe(III) are found in all treated samples. This technique can potentially be applied to any non-magnetic adsorbent powder and/or to any existing coagulation/flocculation treatment.</jats:p>",

Despite this, very little has changed over the last 30 years, although projects such as the Gautrain high-speed rail service and a few bus rapid transit routes have been introduced recently. These projects, however, are not integrated in a logical manner into the broader public transport system and are often referred to as stand alone interventions because of a lack of managing public transport in terms of integrated transport plans. The traditional commuter rail, bus and 16-seat taxi industries therefore operate in policy silos and, in the case of the bus and rail industries, are planned and funded independently of each other, leading to a further lack of integration. Policy interventions have been implemented partially or not at all, leaving the public transport sector in a state of flux. The methodology followed in researching this paper was to briefly trace the historical public transport policy developments, with a focus on the commuter bus industry, in order to identify possible impediments to policy implementation and to identify policy interventions for addressing the currently stalled policy implementation programme. The main finding of the paper is that it would be advisable to establish provincial transport authorities between local and provincial governments. That should speed up the development and implementation of integrated transport plans, which ought to lead to integrated public transport systems and a more optimal spend of the available governmental funds aimed at subsidising public transport.</jats:p>"

An important aspect of a passenger’s mode choice is the sensitivity to factors such as access time and access cost. The objective of this research was to analyse air passenger’s sensitivity to access mode choice attributes, that is,access time, access cost, parking time and parking cost at two airports in Johannesburg, South Africa. A stated choice experiment was used to obtain the information and a latent class model was estimated. In general, discrete choice experiments are designed to reveal respondent(preference) heterogeneity and the latent class model allows for this heterogeneity to be modelled discretely. The estimated results indicated that three latent classes provided the best fit with preference heterogeneity evident from the set of parameter estimates. The access mode used was found to be the only significant covariate in the class assignment model. The respondents’ willingness to pay for a reduction in access time was estimated and it indicated that respondents had the highest access time willingness-to-pay value for the taxi as access mode. In addition, it was estimated that passengers being dropped off at the airport had a higher access time willingness-to-pay than passengers that used their own vehicles to the airport. The research results confirmed the presence of respondent heterogeneity (according to access mode) which resulted in different access time willingness-to-pay values.</jats:p>"

The per hectare cost of cultivation of the three selected vegetables on supermarket and traditional market supply farms revealed that cost of cultivation of vegetables was remarkably higher for traditional farms than supermarket supplying farms. This was mainly due to excessive use of manures and fertilizers, irrigation, plant protection chemicals and human labour. The returns per rupee invested have been noted higher for supermarket supply farmers than that of traditional farmers. The evidence indicates that innovative institutions contribute in reducing production cost and augmenting farm profits. Discriminant function analysis shows that price, manures and fertilizers, yield, hired labour and net income contributed mostly to discriminate between two groups viz., supermarket and traditional market supplying farmers.

Although several new materials and processes are being developed to address the challenges of future technology nodes, in the coming years they will be limited with respect to functionalities that future devices will require. As a consequence a clear trend of moving from CMOS to package and system architecture can be observed. Three-dimensional (3D) technology using the well-known Through Silicon Via (TSV) interconnect is one the emerging solutions, considered today the most advanced technology, that could enable various heterogeneous integration. 3D Integration is not limited to the CMOS scaling in itself, it is rather based on bringing more functionalities by stacking different type of devices (Logic, Memory, Analog, MEMS, Passive components) while reducing the form factor of the packaging. This functional diversification is also known as More-than-Moore.</jats:p>",

The case study comprised three South African commercial fleets. Using data from these fleets, critical incident triangles were used to determine the ratio data of risky driver behaviour to near-collisions and collisions. Based on managing the riskiest driver behaviours as causes of more serious incidents and accidents, the results indicated that through the implementation of an effective driver risk management system, risky incidents were significantly reduced.</jats:p>"

A classic case occurs in the metropolitan Atlanta area, which is a rapidly growing, large population centre that relies solely on surface water for supply. Lake Lanier currently supplies about 70% of the water demand and has been involved in a protracted legal dispute for more than two decades. Drought and environmental management of the reservoir combined to create a water shortage which nearly caused a disaster to the region in 2007 (only about 35 days of water supply was in reserve). While the region has made progress in controlling water demand by implementing a conservation plan, per capita use projections are still very high (at 511 L/day in 2035). Both non-potable reuse and indirect reuse of treated wastewater are contained in the most current water supply plan with up to 380,000 m3/day of wastewater treated using advanced wastewater treatment (nutrient removal) to be discharged into Lake Lanier. The water supply plan, however, includes no additional or new supply sources and has deleted any reference to the use of seawater desalination or other potential water sources which would provide diversification, thereby relying solely on the Coosa and Chattahoochee river reservoirs for the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the 20th century, freight transport in South Africa was employed to attain politicoeconomic ideals, resulting in the overprotection of rail and overregulation of road transport. Increasing industry pressure, combined with the international deregulation trend, led to deregulation in 1988. Myopia resulted in a rail investment hiatus and exponential growth in high-value, long-distance road transport, causing excessive logistics and externality costs for the country. The aim of this study was to propose a freight rail reform agenda based on, (1) lessons from past freight transport policy efforts and (2) the results of freight transport market segmentation driven by models developed over the past two decades. For the study, freight flows were modelled by disaggregating the national input–output model into 372 origin–destination pairs and 71 commodity groups, followed by distance decay gravitymodelling. Logistics costs were calculated by relating commodity-level freight flows to the costs of fulfilling associated logistical functions. The standard management approach of founding strategy development on market-driven segmentation provides a neutral input to steer rail reform discussions in South Africa. Market segmentation points to a dualistic rail reform agenda, enabling both a profit-driven core and a development-driven branch line network. Freight flow insights are steering the policy reform debate towards long-term freight strategy development and optimal freight logistics network design.</jats:p>"

We argue the emerging case for demand chain management, in which new manufacturing techniques (such as additive manufacturing) and enhanced information flows (big data) enable our supply chains to run, concurrently, with lower inventory and fast customer response. Remodeling our supply chains into demand chains creates the possibility that waste and obsolescence can be reduced; companies in this world will not create demand unless they can supply it. Increasingly, demand chains that exhibit both lean and agile characteristics (“leagile”) will challenge the received wisdom of lean versus agile. We explore some antecedents for the development of demand chains, the implications for the relationship between marketing and supply chain management in organizations, and the consequences for academic discourse—both research and teaching—in these two fields. In particular, we argue that offerings such as Rolls‐Royce's TotalCare® challenge siloed academic perspectives, and we formulate a cross‐functional research agenda to examine a number of these boundary‐spanning practices.</jats:p>",

In this study, long-duration tests were conducted in the laboratory to investigate the influence of two important operating parameters, namely the pause period (idle time) and the charge volume on the performance of BSF by using full-scale BSFs. The filters were charged daily with 20 or 40 L of tap water spiked with Escherichia coli or sewage with different pause periods. Results indicated that during the ripening (maturation) of the filter, which took about one month, E. coli removal was low, with an average value &amp;lt;90.0%. Maximum E. coli reduction observed in the test was around 3 log10 units. Doubling the daily charge volume from 20 L to 40 L significantly reduced E. coli removal by at least one log10 unit. Reducing residence time within the filter also impaired the filtrate quality. Cleaning of the filter considerably reduced the bacterial removal efficiency. The aesthetic quality of treated water was good, with a mean effluent turbidity of &amp;lt;1.5 NTU, and was not affected by the variations in charge volume and pause period.</jats:p>",

With a focus on the service delivery management process, we compare and contrast the different service supply chains of our typology along four key characteristics: (a) the separability of the customer from the process, (b) the level of customer-induced uncertainty in the process, (c) the importance of providing the customer with physical access to the process, and (d) the type and degree of customer interaction with the process.

Its most succinct description is ‘the water–food–energy nexus for a green economy’. The water, food and energy nexus aims at the most efficient, best practice principles applied throughout the full food supply chain. This includes consideration of reducing wastage of the food for various reasons in the supply chain. This paper describes the global opportunities for better efficiency and resources conservation in the water, food, and energy supply chains with examples from Australia. Food wastage equates on average to 243 l day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of water per person in the food they throw away, which is 1.5 times the daily water use per person in the UK. The concepts of virtual water and water footprint can help in identifying opportunities to save water by targeting reduction of wastage of food that has the highest virtual water content. A green economy aims at achieving optimised supply chain objectives in a manner that espouses the sustainability principle, gives due attention to environmental concerns and helps with eradication of poverty and hunger.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A country’s competitiveness can be severely hampered by an uncompetitive freight logistics system. During the first decade of the 21st century, two in-depth models were developed for South Africa which provide a framework for measuring and improving the country’s freight logistics system – the cost of logistics survey and the freight demand model. These models also allow for the development of scenarios for key identified risks. The objectives of this study were to provide an overview of South Africa’s surface freight transport industry,identify key risks to national competitiveness and suggest ways in which these risks could be mitigated. Freight flows were modelled by disaggregating the national input–output model into 372 origin–destination pairs and 71 commodity groups, followed by distance decay gravity-modelling. Logistics costs were calculated by relating commodity-level freight flows to the costs of fulfilling associated logistical functions. South Africa’s economy is highly transport intensive. Excessive dependence on road freight transport exacerbates this situation. Furthermore, the road freight transport’s key cost driver is fuel, driven in turn by the oil price. Scenario analysis indicated the risk posed by this rising and volatile input and should provide impetus for policy instruments to reduce transport intensity. As such, this study concluded that a reduction in freight transport intensity is required to reduce exposure to volatile international oil prices.</jats:p>"

As a stated preference survey was not carried out prior to the launch of the new BRT system in the City of Cape Town, it became difficult to assess commuters’ preferences,which would have provided City policymakers and planners with an understanding of customer satisfaction of the proposed bus service. The commuting trend of the BRT system in the City indicates that tickets sales and utilisation by commuters is gradually picking up, but one would have expected high commuter engagement in terms of the modernity profile of the BRT system. This study investigated commuters’ (n = 260) satisfaction levels with 30 service quality variables on a self-rated questionnaire, using quantitative research methodology.The study result showed that passengers were not satisfied with the transport fare and the availability or accessibility of ticket sales outlets. In the context of this study, this result implies that the ‘responsiveness and affordability’ variable of the service quality dimensions should be an area of interest and review to City of Cape Town policymakers and planners. Service quality trends in public transport were also highlighted.</jats:p>"

The biodegradation of MCs is a safe and natural method of removal from water. The [Dha7] MC-LR was purified by chromatography, identified by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and used for examining the biodegradation of MCs. Analysis of MC levels revealed degradation of the [Dha7] MC-LR by the bacterium Novosphingobium sp. KKU15, with complete degradation occurring within 3 days under conditions in batches of a flask experiment. The ability of the bacterium to degrade the MCs through a slow sand filter was also investigated. Removal of the [Dha7] MC-LR by biological sand filtration was assessed using a polyvinyl chloride column experiment. In MC-dosed water, degradation of the MC was observed specifically in the inoculated samples (bacterial concentration of 1.6 × 107CFU/cm3 of sand), with complete degradation occurring within 7 days compared to the uninoculated controls. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specifically targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Novosphingobium sp. KKU15 was used to monitor the presence of the bacterium in the experimental trials. PCR products indicative of a bacterial population were observed at all of the sample sites in the column where the degradation of the MCs was observed, indicating that this bacterial isolate was active in the degradation of MCs.</jats:p>",

A portion of these resources are inaccessible at current cost targets with conventional feedstock supply systems because of their remoteness or low yields. Reliable analyses and projections of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> biofuels production depend on assumptions about the supply system and biorefinery capacity, which, in turn, depend upon economic value, feedstock logistics, and sustainability. A cross‐functional team has examined combinations of advances in feedstock supply systems and biorefinery capacities with rigorous design information, improved crop yield and agronomic practices, and improved estimates of sustainable biomass availability. A previous report on biochemical refinery capacity noted that under advanced feedstock logistic supply systems that include depots and pre‐processing operations there are cost advantages that support larger biorefineries up to 10 000 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DMT</jats:styled-content>/day facilities compared to the smaller 2000 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DMT</jats:styled-content>/day facilities. This report focuses on analyzing conventional versus advanced depot biomass supply systems for a thermochemical conversion and refinery sizing based on woody biomass. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the economies of scale enabled by advanced logistics offsets much of the added logistics costs from additional depot processing and transportation, resulting in a small overall increase to the minimum ethanol selling price compared to the conventional logistic supply system. While the overall costs do increase slightly for the advanced logistic supply systems, the ability to mitigate moisture and ash in the system will improve the storage and conversion processes. In addition, being able to draw on feedstocks from further distances will decrease the risk of biomass supply to the conversion facility.</jats:p>",

Instead, farmers take into account that the contractual obligation to supply a certain amount of beets in combination with the volumetric production risk produces an asymmetry in revenues. They also consider risk and dynamic changes of the relative competitiveness of sugar beet and competing crop alternatives.

Constraints on budgets are ongoing and the staffing of emergency response activities is often difficult because volunteers have little to no training. The management of material resources has also been a challenge because 1) the categories of material vary by the type of emergency, 2) the necessary quantities of material are often not located near the ultimate point of need, and 3) the transportation assets are rarely available in the form and quantity required to allow timely and effective response. The logistics and resource management functions of EM (what we refer to as EM logistics) have been largely reactive, with little to no pre-event planning for potential demand. We applied the Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) model to EM logistics in an effort to transform it to an integrated and scalable system of physical, information, and financial flows into which are woven the functions of sourcing, making, delivering, and returning, with an overarching planning function that transcends the organizational boundaries of participants. The result is emergency supply chain management, which embraces many more participants who share in a larger quantity of more useful information about the resources that need to be deployed when responding to and recovering from emergency events. </jats:p>"

Recent advances in telemetry technology provide high-resolution consumption data at the consumer level, allowing for a remarkable knowledge improvement on the different water balance components. However, few studies focus on systematic approaches for improving system operation and maintenance by processing and analysing large amounts of consumption data. This paper presents a new methodology to calculate real losses and apparent losses in distribution networks using data collected from telemetry systems. The methodology proposes a set of algorithms that are simple to implement. These algorithms were tested on different district metered areas (DMA) to improve understanding about water loss components and have already been included in commercial software. The results showed that these algorithms are robust and allow for accurately estimating the background leakage level (and unreported leaks and bursts), detecting earlier the occurrence of bursts and providing important insights into the type of illegal water uses. The use of these approaches reduced non-revenue water by more than 10% in the majority of the DMA tested. These findings are promising and demonstrate the strong potential of telemetry systems to reduce water losses and to improve the understanding of water uses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Water supply systems (WSSs) are one of the most important and expensive core public infrastructures. The primary objective of a water supply utility is to have this valuable asset operate at its maximum possible efficiency with minimum cost throughout its design period. To achieve this objective, the first step is to evaluate the existing efficiency of all the components of the WSS using suitable performance indicators (PIs). Various agencies and organizations worldwide have developed detailed performance evaluation frameworks including several indicators to comprehensively cover all the aspects (e.g., physical asset, staffing, operational, customer satisfaction, economical) of the WSSs. Most of these frameworks and indicators have been developed for large-sized WSSs. Small- and medium-sized water supply systems (SM-WSSs) have specific performance-related issues, ranging from difficulties in collecting the data required to use the available systems of PIs to lack of skilled personnel and financial resources for efficient operations. A comprehensive review of the literature has been carried out to assess the suitability of reported performance evaluation systems for SM-WSSs in terms of their simplicity (easy and simple data requirements) and comprehensiveness (i.e., all the components of a WSS). This review also evaluates the individual PI with respect to its understandability, measurability, and comparability (i.e., within and across utility comparisons). On the basis of this detailed review, a conceptual performance evaluation system for SM-WSSs, consisting of a list of PIs grouped into their respective categories, has been proposed. The proposed system provides a stepwise approach, starting the performance evaluation process with the most significant and easy to measure PIs for small-sized WSSs and moving to a relatively complex set of indicators for SM-WSS depending on the availability of resources and specific operating conditions. </jats:p>",

Some water utilities use trichloramine (NCl3) as an index of chlorinous odour and are attempting to control its levels in drinking water. In the present study, the effects of two-step chlorination, involving addition of chlorine twice, on NCl3 control were investigated. The results regarding ammonia (NH3), glycine solutions and raw waters at water purification plants (WPPs) indicated that NCl3-formation potentials (FPs) were reduced by two-step chlorination when NH3 was a primary NCl3 precursor and the 1st chlorine addition was set at an excess breakpoint (BP). However, no effect on NCl3-FP was observed when the 1st chlorine addition was set below BP. Two-step chlorination was not effective for NCl3 control regardless of the amounts of the 1st chlorine addition when organic nitrogen compounds were the primary NCl3 precursors. Moreover, the NCl3-FPs in raw water with relatively high NH3 were reduced at actual WPPs when two-step chlorination was applied.</jats:p>",

From historical perspective, this agreement is the first water agreement signed between Johore as a British protectorate and Singapore as the capital of the British Colony of The Straits Settlements. Despite the fact that this agreement had been abrogated in 1961 with the signing of the subsequent water agreements, most of its fundamental provisions still remains in effect. Thus, this article reveals the preceding events leading to the signing of the agreement, analyses the water agreements of 1927 and its implication for historical development of water supply to Singapore during the period from 1930’s to the 1950’s. It demonstrates that the issue of water supply between the two entities has tended to be in favour of Singapore because of Singapore’s political economic supremacy derived from her status of being the British Imperial, in South East Asia and from being the bearer of capital expenditure in the water construction in Johore. Consequently, Singapore was able to continuously exploit the water deal as one of those economic means to preserving her advantage.</jats:p>"

When the SEMW theory is used, the electromagnetic analysis of SMPC becomes possible by using only the real parameters based on the physics. The technologies of the low impedance lossy line (LILL) which is used to the DC line and the matched impedance lossy line (MILL) which is used to the switching line are also presented. They are effective for suppressing the electromagnetic interference. SMPC can be reconfigured to the quasistationary state closed circuit (QSCC) by applying LILL and MILL in accordance with the SEMW theory. No electromagnetic interference exist in QSCC. The buck converter which is one of the most popular DC-DC converters is presented as an example of the method for being reconfigured to QSCC. The conventional design tools which includes SPICE based on the AC circuit theory will be effective for the design and analysis of the inside circuit of QSCC.</jats:p>",

Data analysis included descriptive statistics and adherence tests to normal, log-normal, rectangular, exponential and gamma distributions. A reliability analysis was conducted in three steps: (i) estimation of mean values for monitored parameters based on the established percentage of compliance and comparison with observed mean; (ii) estimation of expected percentage of compliance based on observed mean values and comparison with the observed percentages; and (iii) evaluation of the applicability of reliability analysis to parameters with upper and lower limits. When the comparison between estimated and observed percentages of compliance was made, reliability analysis led to inaccurate results for parameters whose observed percentage of compliance remained below 90%. For parameters whose observed percentage of compliance tended to fullness, deviations were not observed. It is believed that such a conclusion can be extrapolated to estimated mean values: most accurate results are obtained for parameters that have percentages of compliance near 100%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Optimal reservoir operation changes and adaptation strategies for the Zayandeh-Rud River Basin's surface water supply system are examined for a changing climate during the 2015–2044 period. On average, the monthly temperature in the basin is expected to increase by 0.46–0.76 °C and annual precipitation is expected to decrease by 14–38% with climate change, resulting in a reduction of the Zayandeh-Rud's peak stream flow and the amplitude of its seasonal range. Snowfall decrease in winter months will generally lead to an 8–43% reduction in annual stream flow under climate change. A reservoir operation model is developed and optimal reservoir operation strategies are identified for adaptation of the basin's surface water supply to climate change in the face of the increasing water demand. Results indicate that the reservoir drawdown season starts 2 months earlier under climate change. Smaller storage levels and greater water releases must occur to meet the increasing water demand. The optimized water release can provide sufficient water for non-agricultural water demand, but agriculture will experience more severe water shortage under a changing climate. Having the highest vulnerability, the agricultural sector should be the main focus of regional management plans to address the current water challenge and more severe water shortages under climate change.</jats:p>",

The technology is especially useful when installed with a stormwater infrastructure in countries teeming with abundant rainfall. It is upon this concept that this study is being pursued to assess the implementation of microhydropower within a stormwater infrastructure. In order to achieve sustainability of development, small-scale hydropower should be beneficial in the implementation of stormwater infrastructure, especially in countries that have abundant rainfall. The aim of this study is to provide an assessment method for microhydropower implementation within a stormwater infrastructure. PCSWMM software was used to simulate the flowing water at a detention outlet. Modification of the current detention pond was made to optimise the quantity and quality of water supplied to the turbine. Two important parameters in the modification design are quantity and quality of storm water, which optimise the energy generated. The total power that can be harnessed from the design is theoretically from 500 W to 0.5 MW. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that the implementation of microhydropower within a stormwater infrastructure is technologically feasible.</jats:p>",

Thisgrowth has increased pressure on services, including the public transport systems used bythe majority of people. In the last two decades public transport provision has undergoneconsiderable changes. Concomitant to these changes there has been debate on the formof public transport to be operated. Such debate has been informal, general, and at timesacademic, and therefore not able to provide substantive understanding of the views of keystakeholders. Zimbabwe has had an explosion of informal transport activity in the formof minibuses, and decision makers appear to be in a policy dilemma because of a need tostrike a balance between maximising passenger welfare whilst protecting the livelihoods ofindigenous minibus operators and striving to build an efficient and environmentally soundurban transport system. Critical questions for policy dialogue in this conundrum include,inter alia: How do stakeholders perceive the current public transport system? How can publictransport be sustainably provided? This study seeks to answer these questions using a casestudy of Harare. A qualitative research approach blended with some quantitative aspects wasused. Initial steps involved the identification and clustering of key urban public passengertransport stakeholders, followed by structured and unstructured interviews. Although thereis lack of consensus on the form of public transport that the City of Harare should adopt, thereis a strong view that a mass transit system is the backbone of sustainable public transport.</jats:p>"

Analysis of historical water‐quality samples from public‐supply wells completed in deep basin‐fill aquifers in Modesto, California (134 wells) and Albuquerque, New Mexico (95 wells) indicates that several wells have seasonal variability in concentrations of contaminants of concern. In Modesto, supply wells are more likely to produce younger groundwater with higher nitrate and uranium concentrations during the summer (high) pumping season than during the winter (low) pumping season. In Albuquerque, supply wells are more likely to produce older groundwater with higher arsenic concentrations during the winter pumping season than during the summer pumping season. Seasonal variability in contaminant concentrations in Modesto is influenced primarily by effects of summer pumping on vertical hydraulic gradients that drive migration of shallow groundwater through the aquifer to supply wells. Variability in Albuquerque is influenced primarily by the period of time that a supply well is idle, allowing its wellbore to act as a conduit for vertical groundwater flow and contaminant migration. However, both processes are observed in each study area. Similar findings would appear to be likely in other alluvial basins with stratified water quality and substantial vertical head gradients. Results suggest that even in aquifers dominated by old groundwater, changes to seasonal pumping patterns and/or to depth of well completion can help reduce vulnerability to selected contaminants of either natural or anthropogenic origin.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Marine microbial communities mediate many biogeochemical transformations in the ocean. Consequently, processes such as primary production and carbon (C) export are linked to nutrient regeneration and are influenced by the resource demand and elemental composition of marine microbial biomass. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that differential partitioning of element resources to various cellular components can directly influence overall cellular elemental ratios, especially with respect to growth machinery (i.e., ribosomal RNA) and phosphorus (P) allocation. To investigate whether allocation to RNA is related to biomass P content and overall C : P biomass composition in the open ocean, we characterized patterns of P allocation and C : P elemental ratios along an environmental gradient of phosphate supply in the North Atlantic subtropical gyre (NASG) from 35.67° N, 64.17° W to 22.676° N, 65.526° W. Because the NASG is characterized as a P-stressed ecosystem, we hypothesized that biochemical allocation would reflect sensitivity to bioavailable phosphate, such that greater phosphate supply would result in increased allocation toward P-rich RNA for growth. We predicted these changes in allocation would also result in lower C : P ratios with increased phosphate supply. However, bulk C : P ratios were decoupled from allocation to nucleic acids and did not appear to vary systematically across a phosphate supply gradient of 2.2–14.7 μmol m−2 d−1. Overall, we found that C : P ratios ranged from 188 to 306 along the transect, and RNA represented only 6–12% of total particulate P, whereas DNA represented 11–19%. We did find that allocation to RNA was positively correlated with phosphate supply rate, suggesting a consistent physiological response in biochemical allocation to resource supply within the whole community. These results suggest that community composition and/or nonnucleic acid P pools may influence ecosystem-scale variation in C : P stoichiometry more than nucleic acid allocation or P supply in diverse marine microbial communities.\n                    </jats:p>"

Further, the quantitative impact of factors accounting for the supply and demand of protection is likely to be misestimated unless the simultaneous determination of supply and demand is taken into account.

Some managers have tended to judge improvements in water supply management based on partial performance indicators. The question is which of these partial indicators should be used to say, unequivocally, that the company is approaching best practice? In this study, an input stochastic frontier analysis distance function is utilised to compute an aggregate measure – technical efficiency (catch-up). Unbalanced panel data are used from 12–15 water utilities under the National Water and Sewerage Corporation of Uganda for the period 2000–2006. The study concludes that individual partial operating efficiency indicators may exhibit varied improvement and statistical consistency trends compared to performance-compatible technical efficiency trends for water infrastructure management. </jats:p>",

Motivated by the extensive use of long‐term contracts, market concentration, the lag between vine planting and grape production and the lingering impact of unexpected export demand, a market disequilibrium model is employed to estimate demand and supply elasticities. Demand is found to statistically significantly depend upon own prices, and fluctuations in income, exchange rates and the level of wine stocks. Important identified supply determinants include current prices, a quantity partial adjustment process, a time trend and lagged relative prices with regard to non‐premium and other premium varieties. The resulting elasticity estimates provide important information for model simulations relating to potential tax changes and the impact of research and development. The results also identify key changes in market conditions, including the export‐driven excess demand of the 1990s and measures of the subsequent excess supply of the 2000s.</jats:p>",

We define coordinating contracts and show that the supply chain is coordinated only when the least risk‐averse agent bears the entire risk and the lowest‐cost supplier handles all production. However, due to competition, not all coordinating contracts are stable. Thus, we introduce the notion of contract core, which reflects the agents' “bargaining power” and restricts the set of coordinating contracts to a subset which is “credible.” We also study the concept of contract equilibrium, which helps to characterize contracts that are immune to opportunistic renegotiation. We show that, the concept of contract core imposes conditions on the share of profit among different agents, while the concept of contract equilibrium provide conditions on how the payment changes with the order quantity. </jats:p>",

It also illustrateshow policies and procedures are a meansto effective supply chain systems and describes the research method, population and sample. Findings based on the set outcriteria for good institutionalisation of policies and procedures showed that although SCM policies and procedures areprovided to employees and they were aware of the existence of theseinstruments, there was very little participation of employees in the development and review of these policies.  Based on the findings of the research, a key recommendation is that practitioners, are involved in the day to day implementation of the SCM process in public institutions, should also be involved in the development processes of SCM policies and procedures. The research also argues that for public institutions to be effective and efficient, clear departmental guidelines should be simple and straight forward language should be used so as to avoid different interpretations by implementers. These two critical points will contribute to the effective and efficient development and institutionalization of SCM policies and procedures in government institutions.</jats:p>"

The retailers possess private information regarding their local market profitabilities. The distributors can partially observe the retailers' profitabilities and are heterogeneous with regard to the precision of that information. The supplier determines the level of production, but knows neither the local market profitabilities nor the precision of the distributors' information. The supplier first allocates finished products to distributors, and the distributors then contract with local retailers with a capacity constraint. We find that due to the distributors' superior information, the quantity distortion on the retailers' side is mitigated, and the upstream information asymmetry subsequently affects the quantity allocation among the downstream retailers. The supplier may not benefit from contracting with the distributors. In addition, no distributor is excluded based on the heterogeneity of the information precision, even though some distributors do not have better information than the supplier. In the numerical examples, we further analyze how the local market heterogeneity and inventory costs affect the capacity allocation, the retailers' payoffs, and the supply chain profits. We document some counter‐intuitive quantity allocation rules that arise from the distributors' information advantage. </jats:p>",

The objectives of the current study were to explore the adaptive changes of morphological and physiological leaf traits of red beet to water and light stress, and identify traits as potential suitable selection indicators in breeding programs. Red beet was treated with RED (red/far red ratio (R/FR): 1.29; transmitted photosynthetically active radiation (PAR): 66.9%), GREEN (R/FR: 0.43; PAR: 25.8%) photo‐selective films, and with two water conditions i.e., 50% of water holding capacity (WHC) (W50) and 30% of WHC (W30). Plants subjected to GREEN had higher specific leaf area (SLA) (248.6 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and leaf area ratio (LAR) (232.2 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and lower soil‐plant analysis development (SPAD) and water index (WI) (1.076) values. Water stress reduced leaf area index (LAI) by 39 and 59% (W50 and W30, respectively), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and leaf zinc accumulation. Conversely, water shortage enhanced SLA, leaf mass ratio (LMR) (0.786 and 0.761 g g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for W50 and W30, respectively) and chlorophyll concentration. Red beet showed a strong plasticity under unfavorable growth conditions. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that suitable selection indicators of early adaptive changes were LMR, WI for drought and SLA, LAR for modification of PAR transmittance.</jats:p>",

The ASC framework aims at explaining the dynamic agent‐system relationships in supply chains whereby both action‐influencing properties of human agents (e.g., beliefs, personalities, attitudes) and governance‐influencing properties of supply chain systems (e.g., social norms, power‐dependence, partnerial/adversarial relationship forms) mutually influence each other over time. Two empirical studies are conducted to illustrate how ASC can be a useful theoretical framework in supply chain research and to partially validate the central thesis of ASC in the contexts of partnerial/adversarial supply chain relationships and cooperative/competitive attitudes of human agents in supply chains. The results of both studies support the central thesis of ASC regarding the dynamic agent‐system relationships. From two replicated experiments in Study 1, the results suggest that agents’ cooperative and competitive attitudes in business relationships are altered as they are exposed to different supply chain conditions of partnerial and adversarial relationships. In addition, from the multi‐method research efforts in Study 2, the results from two survey studies and an experiment are largely consistent with one another, suggesting that personnel turnovers in existing supply chain systems can eventually lead to changes in supply‐chain‐system properties including the degrees of long‐term commitment, information sharing, and joint problem‐solving between supply chain partners, as well as the frequency of opportunism occurrences in the supply chains. Finally, we propound that the dynamic agent‐system relationships proposed in the ASC framework can be a useful analytical lens in viewing various supply chain issues, such as supply chain evolutions and changes, supply chain designs and personnel decisions, and self‐reinforcing feedback loops and decision tendencies in supply chains.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The age distribution was computed using a ternary mixing model that combines three lumped parameter models of advection‐dispersion transport of environmental tracers, which represent relatively recent recharge (post‐1950s) containing volatile organic compounds (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">VOCs</jats:styled-content>), old intermediate depth groundwater (about 6500 years) that was free of drinking‐water contaminants, and very old, deep groundwater (more than 21,000 years) containing arsenic above the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">USEPA</jats:styled-content> maximum contaminant level of 10 µg/L. The ternary mixing model was calibrated to tritium, chloroflorocarbon‐113, and carbon‐14 (<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C) concentrations that were measured in water samples collected on multiple occasions. Variability in atmospheric <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C over the past 50,000 years was accounted for in the interpretation of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\"><jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C</jats:styled-content> as a tracer. Calibrated ternary models indicate the fraction of deep, very old groundwater entering the well varies substantially throughout the year and was highest following long periods of nonoperation or infrequent operation, which occured during the winter season when water demand was low. The fraction of young water entering the well was about 11% during the summer when pumping peaked to meet water demand and about 3% to 6% during the winter months. This paper demonstrates how collection of multiple tracers can be used in combination with simplified models of fluid flow to estimate the age distribution and thus fraction of contaminated groundwater reaching a supply well under different pumping conditions.</jats:p>",

Although multiple decision-making techniques exist, five prevalent techniques were considered in this article, namely the Kepner-Tregoe, Delphi, stepladder, nominal group and brainstorming techniques. A descriptive research design was followed, using an empirical survey which was conducted among 210 workers employed in a transport work environment and studying in the field of transport management. The purpose was to establish to what extent the five decision-making techniques are used in their work environment and furthermore how the decision-making practice of using gut-feel and/or a step-by-step decision-making process and their perception of their decision-making success relate. The research confirmed that the use of decision-making techniques is correlated to perceived decision-making success. Furthermore, the Kepner-Tregoe, stepladder, Delphi and brainstorming techniques are associated with a step-by-step decision-making process. No significant association was confirmed between the use of gut-feel and decision-making techniques. Brainstorming was found to be the technique most frequently used by transport employees; however, it has limitations as a comprehensive decision-making technique. Employees working in a transport work environment need training in order to select and use the four comprehensive decision-making techniques.</jats:p>"

High-resolution sediment-acoustic data combined with sedimentary facies analysis, AMS-<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C ages, and neodymium isotopic data allowed us to reconstruct late Quaternary sedimentary dynamics in relation to the two major sediment sources, the La Plata Estuary and the Argentine margin. Sediments from these two provinces show completely different dispersal patterns. We show that the northward-trending La Plata paleo-valley was the sole transit path for the huge volumes of fluvial material during lower sea levels. In contrast, material from the Argentine margin sector was transported northwards by the strong current system. Despite the large sediment volumes supplied by both sources, wide parts of the shelf were characterized by either persistent non-deposition or local short-term depocenter formation. The location and formation history of these depocenters were primarily controlled by the interplay of sea level with current strength and local morphology. The high sediment supply was of secondary importance to the stratigraphic construction, though locally resulting in high sedimentation rates. Thus, the shelf system off the La Plata Estuary can be considered as a hydrodynamic-controlled end-member.</jats:p>",

Center (TINRO) in the Pacific waters at Kuril Islands in 2004-2012 are summarized to consider forage base and food relationships of nekton and plankton and to estimate consumption of forage resourced by nekton. The total stock of zooplankton and micronekton in the epipelagic layer changed from 62 to 158 million tons over the shelf and slope of the surveyed area and from 41 to 75 million tons in its deep-water part. Mezopelagic fishes, squids, pacific salmons, and subtropical fishes were the main consumers of these forage resources in summer. The portion of zooplankton stock consumed annually by nekton was relatively low: 4.2-9.3 % for shelf and slope areas (data for 2004, 2007, and 2011) and 4.5-15.6 % for the deep-waters (data for 2004, 2007, 2009, and 2011), without significant year-to-year changes in the diet composition and feeding intensity of nekton. There is concluded that zooplankton and micronekton of the studied area serve successively the food needs of its consumers and carrying capacity of the epipelagic layer in the Pacific waters at Kuril Islands is quite substantial.</jats:p>"

The majority of these studies have taken place in continental climates of North America and Europe, with less work investigating waters in tropical and subtropical climates. This study evaluated the occurrence, precursors and formation potentials of a range of DBPs across nine water treatment plants (WTPs) in South East Queensland, Australia. Average total organic nitrogen concentrations in raw and final waters were 0.35 and 0.15 mg N/L, respectively, and total organic carbon levels were 9.2 and 3.7 mg C/L in raw and final waters, respectively. DBP formation potential was lower on average in final waters of advanced compared to conventional WTPs, demonstrating the effectiveness of ozone/biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment at removing DBP precursors. While ozone on its own increased the formation potentials of chloral hydrate, halonitromethanes, and haloketones when followed by chlorination or chloramination, subsequent BAC treatment reduced the potential to produce these DBPs, except for tribromonitromethane. DBPs measured in the finished water leaving the WTPs were all below the Australian Drinking Water Guideline levels.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Both supply chain relationships and process connections between organizational units have been studied in business research, to enhance the understanding of supply chain integration, and to explore the differential outcomes of both types of connections for business and functional performance. However, the extant research remains deficient in two ways: within individual studies, researchers have operationalized supply chain connectivity unidimensionally, with the concept of connectivity constrained to either social relations or operational/process ties while disregarding the other viewpoint. Additionally, researchers have persistently designed studies to evaluate dyadic structures, while foregoing the larger, more intricate structures representative of complex supply chains. We address these issues by modeling supply chain connectivity as having multiple relational‐ and process‐based threads comprising linkages, and by empirically testing a set of theorized relationships describing vertical triadic supply chain networks (manufacturer, broker, retailer) within the U.S. restaurant industry. We find that increased supply chain connectivity improves chain performance, but this improvement is more directly attributable to process‐based linkages than relational linkages, which impact performance only through the process mediator variable, suggesting that current theories of interorganizational relationalism may lack complete conceptualization. Implications of these findings for managers and the academy are highlighted, and areas of follow‐on research are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Agriculture in India is the most important sector for food security and socio-economic development. Agriculture accounted for about 14 per cent of the GDP and employed about 60 per cent of the country’s population. This article tries to explore the problems faced by Indian agriculture for food security in terms of inadequate infrastructure and highly inefficient supply chain in context of information technology (IT). This article examines the critical issues at each sub-system of agriculture supply chain, starting from the input to the consumer, with a view to integrating them in efficient and effective manner. As proper flow of information across the chain constitutes an integral part, the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in improving supply chain efficiency in agriculture is discussed in detail. Thus, this article broadly covers some of the important aspects of agriculture supply chain in India—identification of issues at different levels in the supply chain; transformation in agriculture due to various supply chain interventions; the role of ICTs in supply chain management (SCM)—and the suggestion to improve efficiency at different levels in the supply chain. There is a wide research gap in this sector; having such potential and prospect for overall growth, not much research has been done in this field. The article concludes that ICT plays a very important role for the development and contemporary issues of agriculture; therefore, the government action must address the issue of infrastructure development to achieve the objective of food security for all. </jats:p>",

The objective of this 2‐y study was to vary N application and water supply in order to achieve a more mechanistic insight into the effects of underlying differences in the site‐specific productivity on heterogeneous fields. Two N fertilizer rates (120 and 180 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>) and three different water supply treatments (rain sheltering, irrigation, rain‐fed) were compared on field sites with lower or higher plant available soil water capacities. On the whole, the site, rather than rainfall or N fertilisation, was the primary factor that accounted for variability in grain yield. Rainfall distribution during the growing season affected the overall yield level in a given year. The sites characterised by lower plant available water capacity did not show higher grain yield and improved quality with the increased N rate. This suggests that the reduced N rate should be recommended on these sites to take into account the environmental sustainability of N fertilisation. With respect to the higher N application at sites of high plant available soil water capacity, although the already high yield levels were not increased further, the protein quality was significantly improved in the first season within all treatments and in the second season in the irrigated treatments. Therefore, a higher N‐rate proved to be advantageous, especially considering that the residual nitrate levels after harvest were low. The study demonstrated that the response of winter wheat to water shortage or abundance and N fertilisation is site‐specific and dependent on the availability of soil water.</jats:p>",

The linearity of the proposed OTA is achieved by nonlinear terms cancelation technique, using two paralleled differential topologies with opposite signs in the third‐order harmonic distortion term of the differential output current. The proposed OTA uses 0.8 V supply voltage and consumes 31.2 μW. The proposed OTA shows a total harmonic distortion of better than −40 dB over the tuning range of the transconductance, by applying 800 mV<jats:sub>ppd</jats:sub> sine wave input signal with 1 MHz frequency. The OTA has been used to implement a third‐order low‐pass Gm‐C filter, which can be used for wireless sensor network applications. The filter can operate as the channel select filter and variable gain amplifier, simultaneously. The gain of the filter can be tuned from −1 to 23 dB, which results in power consumptions of 187.2 to 450.6 μW, respectively. The proposed OTA and filter have been simulated in a 0.18 µm CMOS technology. Simulations of process corners and temperature variations are also included in the paper.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the coming decades, demand for electricity will increase considerably on the African continent. Investment in power generation, transmission and distribution is necessary to meet this demand. In this paper a cost-optimization tool is used to assess investment opportunities under varying scenarios of GDP growth, electricity trade and CO2 taxation. Business as usual fuel price outlooks are assumed, and related assumptions are relatively conservative. The goal is to find if there are economic indications that renewable energy might play a significant role in the expansion of the African electricity system. The results show that there is potential of renewable energy (RE) resources to have a significant share in the generation mix. By 2030, 42% and 55% of the total generation is powered by renewables in the high and low GDP scenarios respectively. Promotion of interregional trade can assist in unlocking RE potential across the continent, such as hydro in Central Africa and wind in East Africa; these regions are projected to be net exporters of electricity. Additionally, generation by off-grid technologies increases over time, reaching 12% of the total generation by 2030 in Sub-Saharan Africa.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For the Green Village at the campus of Delft University of Technology, an autarkic water circuit was developed. The aim was to avoid connections to the public water supply system, the sewerage, the electricity grid and cable systems. It should produce its own drinking water and electricity, and clean its organic waste streams in a sustainable way. Due to the strict Dutch drinking water regulations, only one water quality will be supplied: drinking water. Drinking water will be produced from greywater (53%) supplemented with rainwater (47%). In the treatment scheme, the multiple barrier approach will be used to comply with the Dutch drinking water quality standards. For greywater treatment, a triple barrier is suggested: ozonation – ultrafiltration – UV disinfection. For rainwater treatment a dual barrier is suggested: ultrafiltration – UV disinfection. By separating wastewater streams at the point of origin into greywater and blackwater, and by replacing conventional toilets with low water consumption vacuum systems as part of the water conservation measures, it will be possible to collect a concentrated blackwater stream suitable for recovery energy. For this purpose the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor is suggested. The proposed water circuit results in an autarkic water management, but not in an autarkic energy management.</jats:p>",

The monitoring relevance of toxins from cyanobacteria in reservoirs for public supply is notorious given its high toxicity to mammals, included humans beings. The most recurrent toxins in Brazilian water bodies are microcystins (MC). However, the recent record of cylindrospermopsin (CYN) in northeastern Brazil, Pernambuco state, alerts us to the possibility that this could be escalating. This study reports occurrence of MC and CYN, quantified with ELISA, in 10 reservoirs, devoted to public drinking supply in northeastern Brazil. The composition and quantification of the cyanobacteria community associated with these water bodies is also presented. From 23 samples investigated for the presence of MC, and CYN, 22 and 8 out were positive, respectively. Considering the similarity of the cyanobacteria communities found in reservoirs from Pernambuco, including toxin-producing species associated to MC and CYN, we suggest that geographic spreading can be favored by these factors. These issues emphasize the need for increased monitoring of MC and CYN in drinking supply reservoirs in Brazil.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be typically used to achieve continuous monitoring (CM) or event detection inside the supervised area. In CM applications, each sensor node transmits periodically its sensed data to the sink node, while in event-detection driven (EDD) applications, once an event occurs, it is reported to the sink node. Hence, CM applications entail much higher energy consumption since all nodes are actively transmitting information much longer than typical EDD applications. Furthermore, in highly dense WSNs, the energy consumption is even higher. As such, the use of autonomous devices that provide a constant energy supply is becoming relevant for these environments. In this work, we propose to take advantage of the electromagnetic waves found in the radio-electric spectrum in order to supply the energy to each node in the network. To this end, the antenna and the storage and amplifications system for such device are designed. Additionally, the performance of dense CM WSN is studied using a Markov chain in order to calculate the lifetime of the system.</jats:p>",

Given the technical and functional similarities of these systems, the question arises as to why regulatory institutions in the US and the EU gas markets have developed in such different ways. In this study we have adopted a historical and dynamic approach, in which institutional outcomes are explored not only by focusing on ‘historic breaks’ in structural technological and economic conditions in the US and Europe, but also by looking at the ‘politics of regulation’. We illustrate the analytical value of applying a framework of incremental change over time within regulatory institutions, identifying different modes including displacement and layering, and introducing a new mode: ‘compartmentalization.’ We show that both pre-existing and newly created actors play important strategic roles in the process of institutional change and the creation of regulation, influencing the coordination between public and private parties as well as the interaction of federal and state levels in the US and supranational and national ‘orders’ in the EU. Our exploration is based on a systematic analysis of the literature on US and EU regulation of the natural gas supply systems since their early beginnings. </jats:p>",

Although a number of works have been done to achieve the aforementioned targets, few of them are able to provide an overall integration and intelligence support for such system management. In this context, a novel intelligent supply chain integration and management system based on Cloud of Things is presented, in order to provide flexible and agile approaches to facilitate the resource sharing and participant collaboration in the whole supply chain life cycle. Furthermore, the enabling technologies, such as intelligent supply chain condition perception, heterogeneous network access convergence, and resource servicisation, are also studied. Finally, a case study together with the prototype system is implemented and demonstrates that the developed system can efficiently realise the integration of supply chain processes in the form of services, and also provide the effective intelligence support for physical resource management, so as to achieve an overall performance assurance for the system operation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Subclinical ketosis is a metabolic disorder which often goes undiagnosed and leads to constricted performance and an impairment of general condition. In the current study subclinical ketosis was characterised by a β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration of &gt;1·2 mmol/l in blood serum. To generate this metabolic situation, an animal model was created. The model, based on group-specific interaction of dietary energy supply and body condition, is appropriate for testing the medical effectiveness of treating this kind of ketosis and its concomitants. During the trial, 18 dairy cows (primiparous and pluriparous) were assigned, according to their body condition score (BCS) 6 weeks before expected parturition, to a normal [6·78 MJ net energy for lactation (NEL)/kg dry matter; 20% concentrate] or to a high-energy feeding group (7·71 MJ NEL/kg dry matter; 60% concentrate). Therefore cows with the highest BCS were allocated to the high-energy group to enhance the contrast with the control group. Statistical analysis was done using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Effects were declared significant when P-values were ⩽0·05. Owing to the higher energy concentration and dry matter intake, the energy intake and balance was significantly higher in the high-energy feeding group, with strong effects on lipid metabolism and health in blood and liver post partum. Within the first 2 weeks after calving, 8 out of 9 cows (89%) of the high-energy group had BHB values indicative of subclinical ketosis. These cows also had significantly higher values of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), aspartate transaminase (AST) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) post partum, as well as a raised total lipid content of the liver. RQUICKI, a calculated parameter which is based on serum concentrations of glucose, insulin and NEFA to assess the insulin sensitivity, was not affected by treatment. Therefore, RQUICKI does not seem to be the right parameter for diagnosing decreased insulin sensitivity in cows affected by subclinical ketosis. The milk fat and the fat:protein ratio of the high-energy group was also higher, even though there was no decrease in milk yield for cows with subclinical BHB values.</jats:p>",

Tanzânia and<jats:italic>Stylosanthes guianensis</jats:italic>cv. Mineirão grown with varying levels of S availability. In an experimental setting, plants of both species received rates of S calculated to reflect suboptimum, adequate and excessive levels of the element. S had a direct effect on morphology and production in both species. S limitation altered the allocation of photosynthates between the aboveground and belowground portions of Guinea grass and stylo, and was associated with lower root dry mass production. Guinea grass plants increased root surface area as an adaptive mechanism when S was limiting in the growth medium. The relative chlorophyll index of recently expanded leaves was correlated with aboveground dry mass production. After the initial growth, Guinea grass and stylo plants showed similar S requirements and use efficiency to achieve the maximum of aboveground productivity, although leguminous plants have a substantially higher capacity for store S in the shoot tissue as compared to gramineous plants growing under similar availability of S in the medium. While applying S was necessary for increasing dry mass production in both species, planting these species together is a promising strategy for guaranteeing high yields of forage with a nutritional value that satisfies the S requirements of ruminants.</jats:p>",

However, to the best of our knowledge, the publication focusing on the supply chain model for product-service system is still scant. Based on the findings of a half-year investigation in an air compressor manufacturer in China, the article is trying to develop a comprehensive framework of supply chain for product-service system. By exploring the structure and the unique features of the supply chain for product-service system, the research leads to a better understanding of the subject. Following the analysis, the supply chain model for product-service system is developed and elaborated in the value co-creation, functional process management, and the enabling process management. It is hoped that the exploration will form the frontier basis for further research on supply chain for product-service system. </jats:p>",
