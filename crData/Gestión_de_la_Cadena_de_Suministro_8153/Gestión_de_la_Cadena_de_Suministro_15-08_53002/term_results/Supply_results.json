Both construction cost and housing price impact supply with a one-year time delay. The construction cost elasticities range from 0.74 to 1.51, while housing price elasticity is 2. The authors also find that plot ratio may play more important role in the developer’s first housing sale than either plot area or sales price.

The performance of an ERSC can be measured by several performance measures some of which may conflict with each other. The purpose of this paper is to propose an ERSC design framework by simultaneously taking total logistics cost (TLC), risk level, and amount of demands covered in an ERSC into consideration. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The study considers TLC of an ERSC as the sum of logistics cost from distribution warehouses (DWHs) to Break of Bulbs (BOBs) and from BOBs to affected neighborhoods. The risk level of an ERSC is measured by estimating the expected number of disrupted relief items (EDI) distributed from DWHs through BOBs to neighborhoods. The covered demand (CDM) is defined as total populations that are supported in case of an emergency, the populations within the maximal coverage distance (MCD) from relief facilities. Based on these performance measures, the authors formulate a Goal Programming (GP) model to distribute emergency relief items to affected locations. Ideal values of these performance measures are decided, and the GP model seeks to minimize the weighted sum of the percentage deviations of those performance measures from the ideal values. The relationships among performance measures have been thoroughly analyzed through detailed trade-off studies under two realistic case studies by changing weights of each performance measure. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Three performance measures are interdependent over specific values of weights. TLC and EDI have a trade-off relationship when the weight on each measure increases. TLC and CDM also have a trade-off relationship when the weight on EDI increases. However, this relationship becomes less apparent when the MCD increases. EDI and CDM also have the same trade-off relationship when the weight on TLC changes. Therefore, decision makers should thoroughly analyze these trade-off relationships when they design ERSCs. Overall, the study identified that an ERSC with higher MCD outperforms one with lower MCD in terms of TLC, EDI, and CDM. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The study presents a design framework to generate more balanced ERSCs by simultaneously taking three conflicting performance measures into consideration, and demonstrated the feasibility of the framework through realistic case studies. The trade-off analysis provides useful insights and theoretical knowledge to researchers and practitioners in the discipline of emergency logistics management. The results from this study are expected to contribute to the development of more balanced ERSCs.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

Electric power supply for a higher number of devices through fixed connections to the public electrical grid is technically complex and requires large investments. Powering monitoring devices, which are installed in areas where electrical power supply is lacking, is difficult and considerably increases personnel and operational costs due to frequent battery changes. In such cases, harvesting energy from the water distribution systems or the environment would be an attractive option. In this work, an energy-self-sufficient system has been developed to solve these problems. The system transforms, by use of an energy harvester, the kinetic and hydraulic energy of water flow in a pipeline to electrical energy, stores this energy, and uses it via a micro-controller unit for measurements and wireless data transmission to a central server.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, multilevel analysis has made the simultaneous testing of hypotheses at multiple levels a reality. However, while other disciplines have made steps toward adopting a multilevel perspective, the majority of SCM research still conceptualizes research questions at a single level. We provide theoretical reasoning for incorporating multilevel research into our discipline and a framework that outlines future research opportunities that would benefit from the incorporation of a multilevel approach. We also provide examples from the SCM literature to demonstrate how multilevel research can be used to enrich understanding of real‐world SCM phenomena.</jats:p>",

A few researchers have addressed this topic, building on classical measurement theories and trying to identify the salient features of the humanitarian sector. This young body of literature must now be tested against current practice. The paper aims to discuss these issues. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The practitioners’ perspective is explored through a multiple case study, based on qualitative evidence, within three major humanitarian organizations. Results are discussed using a situation-actor-process – learning-action-performance model of inquiry. Preceding this investigation, a literature review delves into research on humanitarian supply chain performance measurement and presents the most relevant pieces in a general framework. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Humanitarians have elaborated measures whose essential focus is laid on service level. The more comprehensive approach advocated by researchers has received some consideration but is still poorly implemented. An issue that is given more priority by humanitarians is the accelerated supply chain integration they are going through. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – In addition to an unprecedented literature review, this paper offers a comparative study of humanitarian organizations’ practices in the field of supply chain performance measurement.

A fixed effects logistic regression model is designed, with a Bayesian approach, to relate the supply chains’ odds for success in disaster-relief to potential environmental predictors, while accounting for distinctive supply chains’ proneness to failure.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Analysis of simulated data demonstrate the model’s ability to distinguish relief supply chains with regards to their disaster-relief failure odds, taking into account pertinent external factors and supply chain idiosyncrasies.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– Due to the complex nature of natural disasters and the scarcity of subsequent data, the paper employs computer-simulated data to illustrate the implementation of the proposed methodology.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The 3R principle offers a simple and familiar basis for evaluating failure in relief supply chains’ response to natural disasters.

Despite their significant popularity, there still exists the problem with their power supply systems, especially in applications that require precise adjustment of the composition of the produced layers.\nThis paper presents one possible solution to this problem: The high-resolution power supply for magnetron plasma sources with triple processing, dedicated for power systems of PVD equipment. The module for power factor correction (PFC) is described as well as the module for increasing the resolution setting of the output waveform, and the DC/DC converter module with fast dynamic response to changes in output parameters. The results of experimental studies of individual modules are presented.</jats:p>"

The cost functions used in the tool were developed based on standard designs, bills of quantities and a database of country-specific unit rates. In order to make reasonable economic comparison among system alternatives, the simulations of the tool should be able to predict costs of actual systems efficiently. In this paper, various statistical validation measures were employed to evaluate the simulation accuracy of the CLARA-SPT for eight water supply and nine sanitation technologies commonly implemented in Ethiopia. After evaluating the simulated outputs against observed cost data, appropriate corrective measures were introduced for technologies that did not replicate reality fairly. Costs of seven water supply and six sanitation technologies were able to be represented by the CLARA-SPT with good accuracy. Disinfection was however mimicked fairly. In addition, poor simulation accuracy was identified for three sanitation technologies (i.e. UDDT, Composting toilet and Faecal sludge collection). Therefore, the tool developers are advised to correct internal design assumptions of these three sanitation technologies to improve the simulation accuracy of the CLARA-SPT.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the restrictions imposed on carbon emission force enterprises to take carbon emission into consideration when making production decisions. In this paper, in the context of allowing emission trading and investment of emission reduction technology, models were presented for a two-stage supply chain to analyze the optimal investment and pricing decisions. The results indicate that manufacturer’s endurance capacity of reduction difficulty is higher in the cooperation model than in the Stackelberg game model, and that perfect coordination of supply chains can be realized by a revenue sharing contract. From the perspective of a consumer, low-carbon products mean higher price, so that subsidies or tax exemptions should be provided to keep low prices. Meanwhile, the government can promote investment in emission-reduction technologies and achieve its emission reduction targets by controlling emission trading price, strengthening emission reduction publicity and providing technology investment subsidies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Pioneer cellulosic biorefineries across the United States rely on a conventional feedstock supply system based on one‐year contracts with local growers, who harvest, locally store, and deliver feedstock in low‐density format to the conversion facility. While the conventional system is designed for high biomass yield areas, pilot scale operations have experienced feedstock supply shortages and price volatilities due to reduced harvests and competition from other industries. Regional supply dependency and the inability to actively manage feedstock stability and quality, provide operational risks to the biorefinery, which translate into higher investment risk. The advanced feedstock supply system based on a network of depots can mitigate many of these risks and enable wider supply system benefits. This paper compares the two concepts from a system‐level perspective beyond mere logistic costs. It shows that while processing operations at the depot increase feedstock supply costs initially, they enable wider system benefits including supply risk reduction (leading to lower interest rates on loans), industry scale‐up, conversion yield improvements, and reduced handling equipment and storage costs at the biorefinery. When translating these benefits into cost reductions per liter of gasoline equivalent (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LGE</jats:styled-content>), we find that total cost reductions between –$0.46 to –$0.21 per <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LGE</jats:styled-content> for biochemical and –$0.32 to –$0.12 per <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LGE</jats:styled-content> for thermochemical conversion pathways are possible. Naturally, these system level benefits will differ between individual actors along the feedstock supply chain. Further research is required with respect to depot sizing, location, and ownership structures. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

As technology and populations increase, so do the demands and pressure on this limited resource. Demand far too often outstrips supply, requiring authorities to impose restrictions on water use. Recent research undertaken by Rand Water, in the Rand Water supply area (in and around Gauteng, South Africa) points to the desire from end users to be empowered with knowledge to make their own decisions on water use reduction, rather than to have authoritative restrictions imposed on them. This observation indicates the importance of water conservation education and awareness campaigns to facilitate the reduction in water consumption by consumers, and suggests that education is a priority in the implementation of water conservation strategies.</jats:p>",

The previous course reserve process included a non-automated process. Implementing the LibGuides CMS eReserves module training for circulation staff consisted of in-person instruction and creating a tutorial with step by step directions for staff. The library sent out many email announcements and corresponded with individual faculty members. The authors also worked with the instructional designers for feedback and best practices when developing Blackboard courses, specifically online courses. The authors also developed an information page with a tutorial. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – Findings indicate that the LibGuides CMS eReserves module is a success. The quick implementation process and ease of use for end-users and staff have proven to be beneficial. With the launch of the new system in fiscal year: 2013-2014, this revitalized the Seton Hall University eReserves program with a 142 per cent increase in usage. There could be many contributing factors to the increase in usage: the online form, direct links to Blackboard, the increase in online courses, etc. eReserves are up 42 per cent as of April for this year. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – At the time of our evaluation, there were no other libraries using the eReserves module.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we consider a company including both a forward supply chain producing and supplying products to markets and an after-sales supply chain providing spare parts to fulfill after-sales commitments. Uncertainties in estimating product demand in the pre-markets, spare parts demands in the after-sales markets and qualified outputs of production facilities throughout these two chains are considered in this problem. Stochastic qualified output of production facilities are due to their imperfect productions systems. We show that uncertainties propagate and qualified flow depreciates by moving material, components and products from the upstream to the downstream of these supply chains and these phenomena should be quantified to determine the service levels of this company in the pre and after-sales markets. Reliable flows preserve chains’ service levels against uncertainties and their propagated effects. The consideration of the interactions of pre- and after-sales operations as concurrent planning of these two chains and considering both demand and supply side uncertainties and their propagated effects are the important contributions of this paper. Here, we propose a mathematical model for determining the best marketing strategies for this company (price, warranty length and service levels) and preserving reliable flow dynamics throughout the chains’ networks. The proposed model and its solution approach are tested using data from an engine production company. We derive some managerial insight by analyzing the correlations among the marketing strategies and how they affect each other.</jats:p>",

The traditional methods and models which neglect the frost heave are trial procedures and may result in failure of channels in design of irrigation channels. To improve the total cost, reliability and effectiveness, the model which is used in this study, is not only minimizing the cost of land acquisition but also the cost of concrete lining considering cost as the objective function. The constrained optimization model which considers values of thickness of channel concrete slab constraint simultaneously along with the objective of minimization of cost is propounded and solved using a recent global optimization technique, namely cat swarm optimization (CSO). The optimized channel section not only satisfies the optimal hydraulic cross-section but guarantees the safety and stability of the side walls so that both the amount of the concrete lining and the land acquisition are optimized. Finally, we take a main channel of Qinghe Irrigated Area of Farm 853 in Heilongjiang Province as a study area. The results obtained using the CSO approach are satisfaction and the method can be used for reliable design of artificial open channels. Furthermore, we compare the CSO algorithm with a genetic algorithm (GA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to verify the effectiveness of the cat swarm algorithm in the channel section optimization.</jats:p>",

By using collapsible containers, the frequency of return freight can be reduced and the return of containers can be optimized, leading to potential logistic cost savings. However, the dynamic behavior of container flows due to demand, inventory, storage, and repair requirements make it difficult to accurately analyze container system performance.

The presented mathematical formulation enables the evaluation of the system performance. A case study of collapsible container supply chain system demonstrates the advantages of this methodology. In addition, a simulation model of this stochastic system is presented to verify the mathematical model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cloud manufacturing (C-Manufacturing) paradigm, as an advanced form of networked manufacturing, has recently been proposed based on a combination of existing manufacturing systems and emerging technologies, such as cloud computing, virtual manufacturing, agile manufacturing, manufacturing grid, Internet-of-things (IOT), and service-oriented technologies. In this study, through investigating the main goals of C-Manufacturing and today's hypercompetitive global marketplace circumstances, a prospective conceptual model called cloud-based global supply chain (CBGSC) has been developed which can overcome or mitigate the issues and risks associated with supply chain processes on a global scale. CBGSC extends the conventional three-tier customer–manufacturer–supplier supply chain model into a new five-tier customer–cloud provider of manufacturing applications (CPMA)–manufacturer–cloud provider of supplying applications (CPSA)–supplier model, in which the CPMA and CPSA tiers act as intermediators in order to enhance the diversity and intensity of the markets and businesses of conventional supply chain parties while securing their own profits. On the other hand, CBGSC enriches the notion of C-Manufacturing by incorporating CPSAs to safeguard smooth and continuous supply of raw materials and goods to manufacturers (physical resource providers), thus prevailing the “share to gain” philosophy within the whole network. Also, aiming to facilitate practicalizing the CBGSC, we have proposed a multilayer architecture for the CBGSC with seven layers of user, interface, application, service, resource virtualization and service encapsulation, perception, and resource, which are blended together via four basic aspects of security, optimality, resilience, and information technology (IT) and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure.</jats:p>",

In this context, comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of transportation can play a critical role towards quantifying the midpoint environmental and human health related impacts associated with the transportation activities triggered by manufacturing sectors. This study traces the life cycle impact of the U.S. transportation and manufacturing sectors’ nexus using Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) in the context of the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) framework considering the following midpoint impact categories: ‘global warming’, ‘particulate matter’, ‘eutrophication’, ‘acidification’, and ‘smog air’. Both direct (onsite) and indirect (supply chain) industries’ relationships with transportation industry are considered as the main scope. Results indicated that top ten contributor manufacturing sectors accounted for over 55% total environmental impacts on each impact category. Additionally, based on the decomposition analysis, food manufacturing sector was found to be the major contributor to smog air with an approximate share of 21% in the entire supply chain. Automobile related manufacturing sectors also have significant impact on all five life cycle impact categories that the environmental impact of transportation is higher than on-site (direct) impact. Overall decomposition analysis of 53 manufacturing sector indicated that the environmental impact of transportation has severe effects on ‘smog air’, ‘eutrophication’ and ‘acidification’ with a share of 16.4%, 10.5%, and 6.0%, respectively. When we consider the average percentage share of transportation related environmental impact on the entire supply chain, U.S manufacturing sectors have a negative impact with a share of 18.8% of ‘smog air’, 16.8% for ‘eutrophication’, and 8.1% for ‘acidification’. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The mixotrophic reactor was supplemented with methanol at CH3OH/NO3−-N ratio of 1 or 1.4. The mixotrophic reactor completely reduced perchlorate in the feed up to 1,000 μg l−1. The autotrophic reactor also showed high perchlorate reduction performance and decreased perchlorate from 1,000 μg l−1 to around 33 μg l−1. Complete reduction of 25 mg NO3−-N l−1 was achieved in both reactors, corresponding to a maximum nitrate reduction rate of 300 mg NO3−-N l−1d−1 and 400 mg NO3−-N l−1d−1 in the autotrophic and mixotrophic processes, respectively. Autotrophic denitrification caused an increase of effluent sulfate concentration, which may exceed the drinking water guideline value of 250 mg l−1. In the mixotrophic denitrification process, the effluent sulfate concentration was controlled by adjusting the C/N ratio in the influent. Mixotrophic denitrification was stimulated by 25 mg l−1 methanol addition and 53% of influent nitrate was reduced by the heterotrophic process, which decreased the effluent sulfate concentration to half of the autotrophic counterpart. Therefore, the mixotrophic process may be preferred over the autotrophic process when effluent sulfate concentration is of concern and a higher perchlorate reduction efficiency is desired.</jats:p>",

In order to provide the thermal spa sector with means to achieve this goal, the team at the Institut du Thermalisme – Bordeaux University aimed at finding a relevant solution, i.e. designing and making two original and innovating prototypes which reproduce – in miniature – the natural mineral water system we can find in thermal spas. These two prototypes are different due to the nature of the materials they are made of. It is possible to get significant improvements in the research: on the one hand, linked to the general working of a thermal water system connected to individual or collective care units and, on the other hand, improvements in the research on keeping the quality of natural mineral water. Also, to solve microbiological and physico-chemical contamination issues, chemical and thermal treatments can be used.</jats:p>",

We find that concavity of the objective function is preserved under the introduction of risk aversion if the source of uncertainty is demand, but it is not necessarily preserved if the source of uncertainty is supply. We identify a structural difference that explains this result, and show that this difference can lead to opposing directional effects of risk aversion on optimal decisions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>– Much has been said about the nature of the agro-food supply chain. Yet, the consequences of reforming supply chain institutions have less often been studied, especially from an empirical perspective. The purpose of this paper is to examine the economic consequences of a radical reorganisation of the system of exchange in the agro-food sector in Central and Eastern Europe, during the process of transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy. By considering a historical example from the dairy sector in Poland, the author provides evidence that the disorganisation of vertical linkages between upstream and downstream producers can be very costly. The most conservative estimates suggest that the dislocation of inter-firm relationships accounted for approximately 20 per cent of the drop in milk production observed in the early-transition phase in question.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– The empirical approach is based on econometric analyses. The empirical strategy the author adopts is similar in spirit to a standard difference-in-differences method. More specifically, to study the outcomes of the disruptions in supply chain the author adopts an event-study approach. Thus, the author compares the relative changes in milk production in the post-treatment period relative to pre-treatment period between regions more or less exposed to disruptions to supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– The most conservative estimates suggest that the dislocation to inter-firm relationships accounted for approximately 20 per cent of the fall in milk production observed in the early-transition phase.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– Two key features distinguish the approach from the previous studies. First, through the use of a more direct measure of problems affecting vertical relationships between farmers and processors the author has access to higher quality proxies for the supply chain disruptions. To this end, the author focuses on the dislocation to milk procurement system that arose in the very early phase of transition, manifesting itself in the break up of vertical linkages between farmers and dairy industry. Second, in contrast to the existing studies which exploit variation between transition countries, the author focus on within-country evidence. To best of the author knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate agricultural output during transition using within country variation.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Traditional approaches are focused on discovering the bidders’ best response but neglecting the bidders’ adaptation. This paper presents an algorithm based on decision theory to estimate the bidders’ behavior along the auction. The proposed model uses portfolio concepts and historical data of spot market to estimate a long term contract supply curve. This model was applied to evaluate the Colombia’s Organized Market (MOR). Demand curve parameters and round size were varied to evaluate their impact over auction outputs. Results show that demand curve has a quite small impact over bidders’ decisions and round size management is useful to avoid non-competitive bidders’ behavior. In addition, it is shown that auction’s starting prices strongly influence auction’s clearing prices. These results are extremely helpful to design market structures in power markets.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The metropolitan city of Istanbul is becoming overcrowded and the demand for clean water is steeply rising in the city. The use of analytical approaches has become more and more critical for forecasting the water supply and demand balance in the long run.  In this research, Istanbul’s water supply and demand data is collected for the period during 2006 and 2014. Then, using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the time series water supply and demand forecasting model is constructed for the period between 2015 and 2018. Three important sustainability metrics such as water loss to supply ratio, water loss to demand ratio, and water loss to residential demand ratio are also presented. The findings show that residential water demand is responsible for nearly 80% of total water use and the consumption categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture, outdoor, and others have a lower share in total water demand. The results also show that there is a considerable water loss in the water distribution system which requires significant investments on the water supply networks. Furthermore, the forecasting results indicated  that pipeline projects will be critical in the near future due to expected increases in the total water demand of Istanbul. The authors suggest that sustainable management of water  can be achieved by reducing the residential water use through the use of water efficient technologies in households and reduction in water supply loss through investments on distribution infrastructure.</jats:p>"

It has been shown that these measures improve the performance of supply chains by mitigating the risks associated with uncertainties. However, it is also important to assess the uncertainty under which a supply chain network can perform well and manage risk. Flexibility is defined in terms of the bounds of uncertain parameters within which supply chain operation is feasible. A hybrid simulation‐based optimization framework that uses two‐stage stochastic programming in a rolling horizon framework is proposed. The framework enables taking optimum planning decisions considering demand uncertainty while managing risk. The framework is used to study the trade‐offs between flexibility, economic performance, and risk associated with supply chain operation. © 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 61: 4166–4178, 2015</jats:p>",

This paper quantifies the impact of supply voltage distortion on the harmonic current emission of individual devices and the summation of multiple devices. After a classification of the commonly used circuit topologies a time-domain model is developed for each of them. Then the individual and combined impact of voltage harmonics on the harmonic current emission of the modeled devices is analyzed based on simulations.

This technology is commercially applied in point-of-use water treatment as a post-treatment for filtrate water. However, the current process of synthesizing AgNPs has several disadvantages including the use of hazardous chemicals, consumption of a large amount of energy and the formation of hazardous byproducts. Here, we report an alternative and green synthesis using plant extracts. In this work, the plant extracts came from radish (R) and tea (T), and the AgNPs were derived from a microwave irradiation method. The AgNPs synthesized by chemical-based microwave irradiation (Ag-C) were also used as a control material. The novel method produced a smaller size of nanostructures with good dispersion ability and less agglomeration than those from chemical synthesis. The antibacterial properties of AgNPs on Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were investigated. The results revealed that AgNPs from both green synthesis and chemical-based methods inactivated both types of bacteria. The green-synthesized AgNPs from radish juice provided a higher percentage of inhibition of E. coli than that of S. aureus. The inactivation rates of the AgNPs increased with increasing concentration of AgNPs. As the concentration of the Ag/AgCl-R and Ag-R increased from 150 μg/mL to 300 μg/mL, complete inactivation required a reduced time for the reaction from 300 minutes to only 30 minutes. Finally, the Ag/AgCl-R and Ag-R offered high antibacterial activity while the Ag-T provided the lowest antibacterial activity. This work provides an alternative method for the eco-synthesis of antibacterial nanomaterials for water treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Forward osmosis (FO) is attracting worldwide attention as an emerging technology in the fields of power generation, water reuse, desalination, pharmaceuticals and food processing. Still, the critical challenge of finding a suitable draw solute for FO persists. Therefore the current research focuses on synthesizing hydrophilic magnetic nanoparticles (HMNPs) and systematically investigating their potential as draw solutes. HMNPs were synthesized using functional groups polyethylene glycol (PEG 400) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). These functional groups under different ratios with a metal precursor react by one-pot polyol and thermal decomposition methods respectively to give different diameter HMNPs. In addition the effect of different sizes of synthesized HMNPs was investigated for their recovery under an external magnetic field and reusability in FO performance. The physical properties and chemical compositions of the resultant MNPs are fully characterized. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses show the characteristics as spherical morphology with a narrow size distribution, and a mean size from 9 to 32.5 nm for PEG and 8 to 30 nm for PAA coated HMNPs depending on the ratio of the functional group and metal precursor. The PEG and PAA layer on the MNPs is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis demonstrates a hydrophilic surface composition. The PEG and PAA coated HMNPs generate high osmotic pressures and exhibit good dispersibility in aqueous solutions. Water fluxes of &amp;gt;13 L m−2 h−1 are achieved across Hydration Technologies Inc. flat sheet membranes at a concentration of 0.05 M of HMNPs using deionized water as the feed solution. The HMNPs can be easily recaptured from draw solutions by applying an external magnetic field and recycling them back as draw solute in the FO process. The MNPs remain active after nine runs of recycling but with a total water flux decrease of 5% in PEG and 3% with each successive recycling due to slight aggregation, and reduced surface to volume ratio is observed. Results of the present study have demonstrated that PEG and PAA coated HMNPs can viewed as promising and potential draw solutes in the FO process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on a serial supply chain model with two periods and price‐sensitive demand, we present the first experimental test of the effect of strategic inventories on supply chain performance. In theory, if holding costs are sufficiently low, the buyer builds up a strategic inventory (even if no operational reasons for stock‐holding exist) to limit the supplier's market power, and to increase the own profit share. As it turns out, this enhances the overall supply chain performance. The supplier anticipates the effect of the strategic inventory and differentiates prices to capture a part of the increased supply chain profits. Our results show that the positive effects of strategic inventories are even more pronounced than theoretically predicted, because strategic inventories empower buyers by shifting the perception of the fair split. Overall, strategic inventories have a double positive effect, a strategic and a behavioral, both reducing the average wholesale prices and dampening the double marginalization effect. The latter effect leads to more equitable payoffs. </jats:p>",

Whereas the earlier literature often concluded that aggregate labor supply elasticities were small, we argue that recent work using structural models and micro data credibly supports large aggregate elasticities. We focus on three issues. First, earlier analyses abstracted from several key features, including human capital accumulation, that severely negatively biased estimates of a key preference parameter. Second, failure to understand that aggregate labor supply adjustments can occur along both the hours per worker and employment margins has led economists to misinterpret the implications of preference parameters for aggregate labor supply. Third, structural estimation of models that feature choice along the extensive margin using micro data typically finds large responses.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential for this technology to be used in support of the preparation and response to a natural disaster or complex emergency and as part of developmental activities, and to offer a number of key insights following a pilot trial based in the East African HQ of a major international non-governmental organisation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>– Using an illustrative example from the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) field this paper demonstrates, from both a theoretical and practical standpoint, how 3DP has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian logistic (HL) operations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>– Based on the pilot trial, the paper confirms that the benefits of 3DP in bespoke commercial contexts – including the reduction of supply chain lead times, the use of logistic postponement techniques and the provision of customised solutions to meet unanticipated operational demands – are equally applicable in a humanitarian environment. It also identifies a number of key challenges that will need to be overcome in the operationalisation of 3DP in a development/disaster response context, and proposes a hub-and-spoke model – with the design and testing activities based in the hub supporting field-based production at the spokes – to mitigate these.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>– In addition to an extensive review of both the HL and additive manufacturing literature, the results of the pilot trial of 3DP in support of humanitarian operations, are reported.

With low capital and running costs, it offers a way of mitigating delays in the supply chain through on site fabrication to meet an identified requirement more swiftly and effectively than via the traditional re-supply route, and it allows for adaptive design practice as multiple iterations of a product are possible in order to optimise the design based on field testing.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Social implications</jats:title><jats:p>– The logistic challenges of responding in a disaster affected or development environment are well documented. Successful embodiment of 3DP as part of the humanitarian logistician’s portfolio of operational techniques has the potential to deliver more efficient and effective outcomes in support of the beneficiaries as well as a sense of empowerment in relation to problem solving. In addition, it has the longer term potential for the creation of a new industry (and, hence, income source) for those living in remote locations.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>– The research demonstrates that, whilst 3DP is increasingly found in a commercial environment, its use has not previously been trialled in a humanitarian context.

As a case study, we focus on the Xinanjiang-Fuchunjiang reservoir cascade in eastern China, for which adapted operating rules were proposed as a means to reduce the impact of climate change and socio-economic developments. The optimizations were based on five different water supply and demand scenarios for the future period from 2011 to 2040. Main uncertainties in the optimization can be traced back to correctness of the assumed supply and demand scenarios and the quality and tuning of the applied optimization algorithm. To investigate the robustness of proposed operation rules, we (1) compare cross-scenario performance of all obtained Pareto-optimal rulesets and (2) investigate whether different metaheuristic optimization algorithms lead to the same results. For the latter we compare the originally used genetic algorithm (Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, NSGA-II) with a particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO). Reservoir performance was measured using the shortage index (SI) and mean annual energy production (MAEP) as main indicators. It is found that optimal operating rules, tailored to a specific scenario, deliver at most 2.4% less hydropower when applied to a different scenario, while the SI increases at most with 0.28. NSGA-II and MOPSO are shown to yield approximately the same Pareto-front for all scenarios, even though small differences can be observed.</jats:p>",

Mean concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes were found to be 1.53 μg/L, 1.76 μg/L, 2.11 μg/L and 0.30 μg/L, respectively. Ecological and human health risk assessments were conducted to evaluate potential adverse effects of the BTEX compounds in terms of toxicity. Toluene posed a severe ecological risk, xylenes a moderate risk, while benzene and ethylbenzene were both considered to be a low risk. The mean cancer risk for benzene was estimated to be 1.14 × 10−6, which is higher than the acceptable risk level of 1.0 × 10−6. The mean non-carcinogenic risks for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes were lower than the standard threshold level of 1.0, both individually and cumulatively. In terms of a screening assessment, these results indicate that BTEX in groundwater may pose a threat to the ecosystem and residents in the Songyuan region of the Songhua River basin. This information will be useful for the further evaluation and risk management of groundwater in this area.</jats:p>",

Trophic dynamics in these habitats are driven by resource availability, and species that move between cave and outdoor environments may play a major role in resource availability. Spiders are among the most abundant invertebrates in caves; however, very few studies have tested factors hypothesized to affect the distribution of spiders among caves, and it is not known whether the trophic features of caves play a role in determining the occurrence, abundance, or breeding success of spiders. We assessed the distribution of the cave‐dwelling orb‐weaver spider <jats:italic>Meta menardi</jats:italic> in Italy, in a Mediterranean and in a Pre‐alpine area during summer and winter. We analyzed the relationships between spider distribution and multiple cave features, describing both the abiotic and the biotic environment. Using visual encounter surveys, the detection probability of this species was high, indicating that this technique provides reliable information on spider distribution. In Mediterranean caves, spider presence was more likely in cold and wet caves with abundant dipterans. In Pre‐alpine caves, spider presence was more likely in deep caves with abundant dipterans. Dipteran abundance was the variable best explaining spider distribution when pooling all sampled caves. This study shows that adults of <jats:italic>M. menardi</jats:italic> do not occur randomly among caves, but select caves with specific features. Prey availability and abiotic features are major determinants of habitat suitability for cave spiders. The strong relationship between spider distribution and prey availability suggests that the distribution of these spiders might be an indicator of the resources available in the twilight zones of caves.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of government incentives tied to market prices as means of boosting corporate social responsibility (CSR) has expanded notably in recent decades. Enhanced business tax deductions for charitable donations and credits for conservation easements are notable cases. While providing incentives for socially desirable behavior to achieve legislative goals has intuitive appeal, the broader economic consequences are not always fully understood. In this study, we examine such wider consequences for supply chains when subsidies for CSR are offered. One effect we identify is that since incentives are typically tied to market value, firms have not only an added incentive to achieve societal objectives (say by donating inventory) but also an incentive to raise output (retail) market prices. A second consequence is that since firms forgo potential revenues by engaging in socially desired behavior, they become increasingly sensitive to supplier pricing; in an uncoordinated supply chain this leads to input (wholesale) price concessions. Among other things, the results underscore that incentives put in place to meet broader societal objectives also have notable ramifications for suppliers, retailers, and consumers in primary markets. </jats:p>",

Acid dissociation showed higher mean recovery efficiency and precision than heat dissociation for Giardia spp. cysts and Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts, but there were not significant statistic differences for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts. Mean recovery efficiency for both protozoa were in accordance with the acceptance criteria of Method 1623 by acid and heat dissociation. The bead–cyst/bead–oocysts dissociation procedure is fundamental for better results whereas a significant loss of organisms occurs in this step.</jats:p>",

The groundwater pollution risk is commonly evaluated by overlaying the results of groundwater vulnerability and pollution sources, but this method is inapplicable for contaminated sites. Considering the current supervision demands of groundwater pollution in China, this paper suggests a risk evaluation method for contaminated sites. The present and forecasted groundwater pollutant concentrations and the variation trend of groundwater quality were used to get the risk classes of groundwater pollution. Chromium is one of the most common groundwater contaminants found at industrially contaminated sites. A chromium residue disposal site in Baotou, China was selected as the study area. The groundwater flow model and solute transport model were constructed by MODFLOW and MT3DMS. Based on the simulation results of the numerical model, the groundwater pollution risk of the contaminated site was divided into four classes, and the regulation measures of groundwater pollution were suggested. This study could provide guidance for the environmental supervision and management of contaminated sites.</jats:p>",

The proposed IPBC method is based on energy shaping and damping injection idea which is performed for regulating the energy flow of inverter to a desired level and assure global asymptotic stability, respectively. It is shown that the control of output voltage can be accomplished indirectly provided that the inductor current tracks its reference. Since the estimated parameters do not match with the actual parameters in practice, a perfect tracking without any output voltage error is not possible. To reduce the influence of parameter mismatch on the output voltage, an outer voltage loop is added into the feedback path of conventional passivity‐based control (PBC) method. The robustness of both PBC methods has been investigated and analytical expressions in terms of estimated and actual parameters are derived for the output voltage. The effectiveness of the IPBC method in terms of both robustness and harmonic distortion is verified by the simulations and experiments under resistive and diode rectifier loads. The results demonstrate that the IPBC method not only leads to good quality output voltage with a reasonably low harmonic distortion, but also offers a global asymptotic stable operation with a strong robustness to wide range of parameter mismatch.</jats:p>",

The lack of necessary mineral elements in soil can affect oilseed rape plant physiological functions, photosynthesis and plant productivity. Oilseed rape plants have high requirements for nitrogen and as oil crop – for sulphur. The aim of the investigation was to explain changes of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters in spring oilseed rape leaves and yield changes under nitrogen and sulphur supply. During laboratory experiments changes of chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters and during field experiments changes of yield parameters under different nitrogen and sulphur supply were observed. Laboratory and field experiments showed that sulphur fertilizer rate 18 kg ha-1 is the most effective sulphur dose for spring oilseed rape, when nitrogen 55 kg ha-1 is added, because its presence has positive effect on photosynthetic reactions. There was found out in laboratory experiments that chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters Fv/Fm and PI can be used to describe sulphur and nitrogen mineral element supply efficacy on spring oilseed rape. There was observed in the field experiment that oilseed rape yield increases significantly (from +0.34 t ha-1 to +0.64 t ha-1) under optimal (S18N55) nutrient supply, but lack of sulphur leads to significant yield losses. To avoid excessive fertilizer usage, its negative impact on plant physiology and yield losses, we consider that sulphur: nitrogen = 1:3 as additional fertilizer is optimal for spring oilseed rape plants.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditional barriers to entry in the electricity supply marketplace are crumbling due to recent federal legislation and new technology. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)'s Order 745 prioritizes the use of demand response via a uniform pricing mechanism. Through it, demand response is able to provide the same benefit as traditional electricity generation - at a reduced cost - and improve service, reliability, and market development. Consequently, the increased use of demand response reduces prices for regional grid operators, as well as commercial, institutional, and residential consumers. This Note discusses the legal, economic, and policy reasons for upholding Order 745 in the face of transformative change in the electricity supply market and evaluates the history of smart grid legislation leading up to the issuance of Order 745 in 2011. Next, it analyzes how energy intelligence hardware and software allow new entrants into the wholesale electricity supply market in hopes of capitalizing on inefficiencies in regional power distribution and the revolutionary opportunities for residential consumers through new technologies. Most importantly, this Note argues for a reversal of the D.C. Circuit’s decision to vacate Order 745 in the case EPSA v. FERC, decided in May 2014. Such a reversal is necessary because Order 745 falls within FERC’s authority under the Federal Power Act and the loss of a uniform pricing mechanism for demand response resources sold at capacity auctions will harm electricity markets.</jats:p>"

The study has been carried out to assess the present conditions of the water supply and sanitation of the Karail slum of Dhaka city. The research work was carried out by using Participatory Rural Appraisal tools including Focus Group Discussion, Key Informant Interview and Household Survey. Poor physical environment with non-existent solid waste disposal system is very common phenomenon in Surveyed slum. Most of the people of the slum live under unhygienic environment. However, the level of hygiene knowledge and practice has been found to be significantly low among the Karail slum dwellers. The study in Karail area of Dhaka city has found that the sanitary and water supply conditions are improving very slowly.

Compared to individual unit processes, the combined UV/O3 tests produced excess hydroxyl radicals (HO•) and yielded synergistic inactivation of E. coli in the initial phase of reaction. The presence of O3 during UV exposure caused the destruction of cell structure, and then repressed bacteria regrowth after treatment. Moreover, the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) showed that the improved generation of intermediate HO• via ozone photolysis accelerated the decomposition of bacterial cell surfaces, which was further confirmed by the leakage of intracellular potassium ions (K+). The results suggested that the synergistic bactericidal effect of combined UV/O3 owed mainly to the enhanced destruction of bacterial cell structure.</jats:p>",

Priorities for protective measures and continuity of operations planning must consider the economic impact of such disruptions across a variety of scenarios. This article introduces new performance metrics to characterize resiliency in interdependency modeling and also integrates scenario‐based methods to measure economic sensitivity to sudden‐onset disruptions.

The process was conducted by adding magnetic powder (MP) for enhancing coagulation. By contrasting the water quality parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV254 and turbidity of permeates of MECMF and coagulation/flocculation membrane filtration (CFMF), results showed that the removal efficiency in the MECMF process was higher than those in the CFMF process. According to normalized flux and resistance analysis, membrane flux declined relatively slow and irreversible fouling resistance was lesser in the MECMF process. By analyzing the three-dimensional fluorescence of permeates and raw water, it was clearly shown that the permeate quality of the MECMF process was superior to that of the CFMF process apparently, which highlighted the removal of protein-like substances was more effectively in MECMF. Furthermore, the addition of MP could provide Lorentz and magnetic dipole forces between colloidal matters during coagulation, leading to the increase of collision frequency and efficiency and the formation of large size flocs with high fractal dimension. Large and high fractal dimension flocs could form a porous cake layer, which could increase water permeability. On the basic of the above findings, it was suggested that magnetic-enhanced coagulation that promoted flocs to develop could regulate cake layer structure and mitigate membrane fouling to some extent.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Droughts will likely become more frequent, greater in magnitude and longer in duration in the future due to climate change. Already in the present climate, a variety of drought events may occur with different exceedance frequencies. These frequencies are becoming more uncertain due to climate change. Many methods in support of drought risk management focus on providing insight into changing drought frequencies, and use water supply reliability as a key decision criterion. In contrast, robustness analysis focuses on providing insight into the full range of drought events and their impact on a system's functionality. This method has been developed for flood risk systems, but applications on drought risk systems are lacking. This paper aims to develop robustness analysis for drought risk systems, and illustrates the approach through a case study with a water supply reservoir and its users. We explore drought characterization and the assessment of a system's ability to deal with drought events, by quantifying the severity and socio-economic impact of a variety of drought events, both frequent and rare ones. Furthermore, we show the effect of three common drought management strategies (increasing supply, reducing demand and implementing hedging rules) on the robustness of the coupled water supply and socio-economic system. The case is inspired by Oologah Lake, a multipurpose reservoir in Oklahoma, United States. Results demonstrate that although demand reduction and supply increase may have a comparable effect on the supply reliability, demand reduction may be preferred from a robustness perspective. To prepare drought management plans for dealing with current and future droughts, it is thus recommended to test how alternative drought strategies contribute to a system's robustness rather than relying solely on water reliability as the decision criterion.\n                    </jats:p>"

The study examines the operation of the area-franchise strategy as it concerns meeting up the accelerating energy sufficiency demand of the economy while ensuring timely extermination of gas flares; and determines the economics of the supply of dry gas to the power sector from Associated Gas (AG) and/or Non-associated Gas (NAG) wells at the regulated gas price. The work establishes the threshold feed gas volume and cost ratios for the Central Processing Facilities (CPF) and the Mini Processing Facilities (MPFs) that will enable the production of sufficient dry gas at good return on investment (ROI) under a given regulated gas price. Sample field data is used to assess the proposed strategy. It is intended that this work would guide the Government in the formulation of policies that would engender sustainable and implementable regulations on gas distribution and pricing.</jats:p>",

The multiplier operates with low and high supply voltage (V<jats:sub> DDL </jats:sub>, V<jats:sub> DDH </jats:sub>) and at its end stage, the proposed low-power SSLC is utilized to prevent static power dissipation at the next stage working with V<jats:sub> DDH </jats:sub> and to enhance the output driving capability. In the proposed SSLC, dynamically-controlled source-body voltage, reduced drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect and diode-connected transistor with body-biasing have been utilized properly in order to reduce the power consumption significantly without considerable speed degradation. The results of the simulations conducted using Cadence with standard 90-nm CMOS technology demonstrate the superiority of the proposed multiplier utilizing the proposed LC in terms of static and total power consumptions as well as power-delay product (PDP) as compared to the multipliers utilizing the previous level converters (LCs) and the single supply multiplier. It is worth mentioning that the static power, total power and PDP of the proposed low-power multiplier are on average 75%, 73% and 16%, respectively lower than the single-supply multiplier. </jats:p>",

We study analytically the supply chain with symmetric retailers and find that the supplier prefers to have as many retailers as possible in the market, even if the retailers' equilibrium retail price is lower than that of the supplier, and even if the number of retailers and their cost or market advantage prevent sales through the direct channel. We find that the two‐channel supply chain may be subject to inefficiencies not present in the single‐channel supply chain. We show that several contracts known to coordinate a single‐channel supply chain do not coordinate the two‐channel supply chain; thus we propose a linear quantity discount contract and demonstrate its ability to perfectly coordinate the two‐channel supply chain with symmetric retailers. We provide some analytical results for the supply chain with asymmetric retailers and propose an efficient solution approach for finding the equilibrium. We find numerically that the supplier still benefits from having more retailers in the market and that linear quantity discount contracts can mitigate supply chain inefficiency, though they no longer achieve perfect coordination. </jats:p>",

Complex decision making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations' agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and competitors' strategies. We propose a two‐layered machine learning approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first layer estimates prevailing economic conditions—economic regimes—identifying and predicting current and future market conditions. In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to estimate price distributions in real time using available information. The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management. When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of our system significantly improves compared to using only economic regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though the prices and sales volume do not change significantly. Instead, tactical pricing results in a more efficient sales strategy by reducing both finished goods and components inventory costs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are concerns that deadwood supply (both snags and downed wood) may become a limiting resource for biodiversity conservation as the bio-economy develops. Despite this concern, it remains difficult to monitor all elements of biodiversity to ensure that forest management activities are not reducing deadwood below minimum thresholds. As a dynamic resource, deadwood quantity and quality does change throughout forest succession. Simulation modelling represents one approach to integrating this variability and supporting the refinement of forest management guidelines. In this paper, we review important considerations for developing deadwood models that address biodiversity concerns. These include defining initial conditions, estimating deadwood inputs over time, identifying parameters necessary to represent biodiversity, identifying data available to parameterize, calibrate and validate models, and identifying requirements for model validation and documentation. In addition, we consider how deadwood characteristics such as form, size, state of decay, tree species, cause of mortality and position can be treated in models to represent the full range of biodiversity requirements. Lastly, we review examples of stand-alone and study-specific deadwood modelling approaches to provide a road map for development of a robust, temporally dynamic deadwood model that addresses biodiversity and sustainability issues related to biomass harvest for bioenergy. </jats:p>",

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the irrigation of roses of the Ambiance variety with the effluent from an anaerobic reactor and an intermittent sand filter (nitrified effluent). The trial lasted for 152 days. The dose of nitrogen applied via effluent was 91% of the crop requirement; of phosphorus, 3.5% (very low); and of potassium, 23%. There was no difference among treatments for the evaluated variables: diameter and length of stem, diameter and length of bud, and fresh weight of flower buds. The production of floral stems was higher in treatments with effluents without conventional fertilization. It is concluded that the irrigation with a treated effluent is an alternative for the fertilization of ambiance roses.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current methodological approach for developing sustainable biofuel processes and supply chains is flawed. Life cycle principles are often retrospectively incorporated in the design phase resulting in incremental environmental improvement rather than selection of fuel pathways that minimize environmental impacts across the life cycle. Further, designing sustainable biofuel supply chains requires joint consideration of economic, environmental, and social factors that span multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, traditional life cycle assessment (LCA) ignores economic aspects and the role of ecological goods and services in supply chains, and hence is limited in its ability for guiding decision-making among alternatives—often resulting in sub-optimal solutions. Simultaneously incorporating economic and environment objectives in the design and optimization of emerging biofuel supply chains requires a radical new paradigm. This work discusses key research opportunities and challenges in the design of emerging biofuel supply chains  and provides a high-level overview of the current “state of the art” in environmental sustainability assessment of biofuel production. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis of over 20,000 biofuel research articles from 2000-to-present is performed to identify active topical areas of research in the biofuel literature, quantify the relative strength of connections between various biofuels research domains, and determine any potential research gaps.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently, environmental management offers firms a source of competitive advantage in the marketplace. The development of environmental innovations is critical to the success of today's firms. Drawing on the Schumpeterian perspective of competition, this research examines how the perception of rival firms' green success influences a firm to pursue and produce environmental innovation through its green supply chain integration activities. Using survey data from 230 firms, a conceptual model is developed and tested using structural equation modeling. We find that the firms in our sample do perceive pressure from their competitors' success in environmental management activities, and thus take supply chain action to pursue integration activities. By differentiating incremental and radical environmental innovation, this study also reveals the role of three dimensions of green supply chain integration (internal, supplier, and customer integration of green product development) on incremental and radical environmental innovation separately. Specifically, findings suggest that green supply chain integration has a positive impact on developing incremental environmental innovation, while only customer integration has a significant positive impact on developing radical environmental innovation.</jats:p>",

Even when individuals have access to relevant information, order variation tends to increase when moving up the supply chain, a phenomenon known as the bullwhip effect. While prior research has investigated several structural/environmental factors which can mitigate the bullwhip effect, the underlying behavioral factors contributing to it are an open question. Using a production and distribution decision‐making simulation representing a four‐stage serial supply chain, we find that the cognitive profile of decision makers contributes to the bullwhip effect. We found that the specific decision tendency to underweight the supply line is linked to an individual's level of cognitive reflection. Furthermore, performance differs for entire supply chains and for specific echelons, and holds under standard mitigation efforts. The findings have implications for supply chain design, education, and industry. </jats:p>",

Polyaluminum chloride (PAC) modified clay is an efficient flocculating agent in HAB control; however its effectiveness in black bloom management is still largely unknown. In the present study, PAC-modified clay was used to flocculate a black bloom under simulated flows. The deposition and resuspension of the black matter/clay flocs and the impact of the spreading of quartz sand to the flocs were quantitatively studied. The results showed that a dosage of 1.8 g/L PAC-modified clay (0.8 g/L PAC and 1 g/L diatomite) could reduce turbidity by more than 90% in 1 h. The resuspension of flocs could be generated by a threshold bed shear stress of 0.045 N/m2. The addition of quartz sand inhibited the resuspension of flocs. We suggest that quartz sand can be used to effectively inhibit floc resuspension caused by waves and flow currents as the subsequent treatment of black bloom flocculation in Lake Taihu.</jats:p>",

The region accounts for 23% of the surface area and 18% of the country's population, but holds 88% of its oil. A water shortage of 430 Mm3/year for 2010 is estimated for this region where irrigation accounts for 81% of the total water demand. Dhi Qar is the largest agricultural producer and water consumer while Al Basrah and Al Muthanna have the largest water shortages among the four provinces. The interrelationship of energy–water production and utilization is discussed and the annual water balance for irrigation, industrial, domestic and livestock usage in the different provinces determined. On this basis recommendations are made for treating and utilizing the steadily increasing amounts of water produced from the oilfields to supplement the other sustainable water resources in that region.</jats:p>",

Starved lubrication performance of a cycloid gear drive is studied using a numerical finte line starved-elastohydrodynamic lubrication model. The parameter of the inlet oil film thickness is chosen to represent the starved status. Effects of the inlet film thickness on the centralfilm thickness, the friction coefficient and the frictional power loss are investigated. In addition, effects of different shape of inlet oil-supply layer in the same starved degree on lubrication performance are studied. Under the same inlet oil supply volume, the convex type profile would present a better oil film within the nominal contact zone compared with other four different shapes of the inlet film supply.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on the hydrochemical relations observed between the water at the entrance of the reservoir and a point located further away, specifically at the dam. The main aim is to analyze the water parameters in both monitored points, in order to evaluate possible attenuation processes and to propose a spatial evolution model of the pollutants' load by using cross-correlation functions. Concentrations of metals and sulfates put in evidence their contamination by acid mine drainage, with greater pollution load at the entrance of the reservoir than in the dam, due to the reduction of the same in the course between the two points. This attenuation results from the precipitation of iron oxyhydroxysulfates produced by the increase in the pH as well as by dilution and sorption phenomena. The cross-correlation functions show the close relationship between the two sampling points with a transit time of contaminants less than 1 week (t = 0) for most cases, due to the small distance between the two points (about 300 meters).</jats:p>",

While the manner in which consumers shop is changing rapidly, our understanding of how changing consumer behaviors affect retail supply chain management is lacking. In particular, our understanding of how consumers react to stockouts in an online shopping environment remains unclear. Making the challenge even more difficult is the fact that price promotions are heavily used to attract consumers in an online retail environment where consumer switching costs are low. This research develops a theoretical framework, based on expectation‐disconfirmation theory, to explain the effect of price promotions on consumer expectations of product availability and their reactions to stockouts in an online retail environment. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that consumers are actually less dissatisfied with a stockout of a price promoted item than a nonprice promoted product and are less likely to switch to another retailer's website. These findings may suggest that price promotions actually create a type of switching cost in the online retail environment, leading to interesting implications for researchers and supply chain managers.</jats:p>",

The difference between traffic demand–supply and boundary fluxes actually reflects the congestion level of freeway travel. This study investigates simultaneous traffic density and boundary flux estimation with data extracted from on‐road detectors. The existing studies for traffic estimation mainly focus on the traffic parameters (density, velocity etc.) of mainline traffic and ignore flux fluctuations at boundary sections of the freeway. The authors propose a stochastic hybrid traffic flow model by extending the cell transmission model with Markovian multi‐mode switching. A novel interacting multiple model filtering for simultaneous input and state estimation is developed for discrete‐time Markovian switching systems with unknown input. A freeway segment of Interstate 80 East (I‐80E) in Berkeley, Northern California, is chosen to investigate the performance of the developed approach. Traffic data is obtained from the performance measurement system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Trends in the locations and technologies of UK electricity generation plant suggest that demand for cooling water abstractions from rivers will decrease in the coming decades, unless there is widespread uptake of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). CCS may prove to be essential if the UK is to achieve its carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emission targets. ‘Decarbonisation’ strategies that rely on CCS are therefore potentially at risk of not having sufficient cooling water in periods of low river flows. In this paper, regional freshwater demands for cooling water are assessed against regional freshwater availability at low flows in a scenario of medium climate change. In the strategy with high CCS, demands for water greatly exceed current and future availability in the north-west (NW) England, Humber, East (E) Midlands and Thames regions. These risks can be mitigated by increasing the penetration of hybrid cooling systems or shifting generating capacity to estuaries or the coast. The former could reduce national water use by up to 35%, whereas applying the latter in the NW England, Humber and E Midlands regions offers nationwide reductions from 30 to 50%. </jats:p>",

In particular, excessive dependence on water resources outside the country may put the supply chain at unanticipated risk of water shortage. This article presents a practical approach to screening potential environmental hotspots of different impact categories that occur in the supply chain using environmental input-output analysis. First, the amounts of domestic and foreign potential impacts of global warming, terrestrial acidification, and water resource consumption, induced through supply chains were calculated for 403 sectors of Japanese products. Thereafter, with a focus on potential impacts induced through the import of raw materials, a framework for screening foreign potential hotspots was presented. The results showed that the sectoral potential impacts of water resource consumption had high rates of foreign impacts at deeper tiers of the supply chains for some sectors, which indicated that there exist hidden water hotspots outside the country. In the case study of fiber yarns, impacts on water resource consumption induced as a result of the import of crops, as well as that induced in silviculture as a result of the import of wood chips, were found to be the foreign  potential hotspots.</jats:p>"

To develop a metabolic switch to implement a desirable transition from cell growth to product fermentation, a thiamine auxotroph B0013‐080A was constructed in a highly efficient <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐lactate producer <jats:italic>E. coli</jats:italic> strain B0013‐070. This was achieved by inactivation of <jats:italic>thiE</jats:italic>, a gene encoding a thiamine phosphate synthase for biosynthesis of thiamine monophosphate. The resultant mutant B0013‐080A failed to grow on the medium in the absence of thiamine yet growth was restored when exogenous thiamine was provided. A linear relationship between cell mass formation and amount of thiamine supplemented was mathematically determined in a shake flask experiment and confirmed in a 7‐L bioreactor system. This calculation revealed that ∼95–96 thiamine molecules per cell were required to satisfy cell growth. This relationship was employed to develop a novel fermentation process for <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐lactate production by using thiamine as a limiting condition. A <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐lactate productivity of 4.11 g · L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> · h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> from glycerol under microaerobic condition and 3.66 g · L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> · h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> from glucose under anaerobic condition was achieved which is 19.1% and 10.2% higher respectively than the parental strain. These results revealed a convenient and reliable method to control cell growth and improve <jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐lactate fermentation. This control strategy could be applied to other biotechnological processes that require optimal allocation of carbon between cell growth and product formation. Biotechnol.

However, the mechanisms by which dissolved inorganic nutrients, and especially nitrogen forms (ammonium versus nitrate) can disturb the association between corals and their symbiotic algae are subject to controversial debate. Here, we investigated the coral response to varying N : P ratios, with nitrate or ammonium as a nitrogen source. We showed significant differences in the carbon acquisition by the symbionts and its allocation within the symbiosis according to nutrient abundance, type and stoichiometry. In particular, under low phosphate concentration (0.05 µM), a 3 µM nitrate enrichment induced a significant decrease in carbon fixation rate and low values of carbon translocation, compared with control conditions (N : P = 0.5 : 0.05), while these processes were significantly enhanced when nitrate was replaced by ammonium. A combined enrichment in ammonium and phosphorus (N : P = 3 : 1) induced a shift in nutrient allocation to the symbionts, at the detriment of the host. Altogether, these results shed light into the effect of nutrient enrichment on reef corals. More broadly, they improve our understanding of the consequences of nutrient loading on reef ecosystems, which is urgently required to refine risk management strategies.</jats:p>",

In 2008, sap flow was measured in all four treatments but not simultaneously. Therefore, data were correlated with potential evaporation and the slopes were used to determine treatment effects.

Unique identification provides the foundation of these benefits with a name service enabling efficient storage and retrieval of the data associated with each identifier. In this work, we present iotNS, a simple, efficient enterprise-oriented name service designed for agricultural products. The iotNS provides five times faster response than the standard GS1 ONS system. The iotNS has been deployed across five cities to enable the efficient storage and retrieval of information about agricultural products as they are tracked from the farm to the market. The deployment has shown that the visibility provided by iotNS is a mechanism that fosters cooperation and supply chain improvements among the enterprises using the iotNS. </jats:p>",

Thus, in 40 healthy young (22 ± 2 yr) and old (74 ± 8 yr) activity-matched subjects, we assessed the impact of age on: 1) the relative contribution of the three major pathways of ATP synthesis (oxidative ATP synthesis, glycolysis, and the creatine kinase reaction) and 2) the ATP cost of contraction during high-intensity exercise. Specifically, during supramaximal plantar flexion (120% of maximal aerobic power), to stress the functional limits of the skeletal muscle energy systems, we used<jats:sup>31</jats:sup>P-labeled magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess metabolism. Although glycolytic activation was delayed in the old, ATP synthesis from the main energy pathways was not significantly different between groups. Similarly, the inferred peak rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis was not significantly different between the young (25 ± 8 mM/min) and old (24 ± 6 mM/min). In contrast, the ATP cost of contraction was significantly elevated in the old compared with the young (5.1 ± 2.0 and 3.7 ± 1.7 mM·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·W<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Overall, these findings suggest that, when young and old subjects are activity matched, there is no evidence of age-related mitochondrial and glycolytic dysfunction. However, this study does confirm an abnormal elevation in exercise-induced skeletal muscle metabolic demand in the old that may contribute to the decline in exercise capacity with advancing age.</jats:p>",
