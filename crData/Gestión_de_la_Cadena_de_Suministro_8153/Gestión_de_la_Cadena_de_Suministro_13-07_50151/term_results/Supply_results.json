      "abstract": "<jats:p>Does the outsourcing of manufacturing trigger a cascade of follow‐on outsourcing, wherein related procurement activities are subsequently entrusted to one's outsourcing partner? We explored this question in a survey of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content>‐based electronics original equipment manufacturers (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OEM</jats:styled-content>s) who have outsourced production to a contract manufacturer (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CM</jats:styled-content>). Transaction‐cost economics and the resource‐based view were used as theoretical lenses to assess six potential drivers of this decision, utilizing direct and indirect‐effects structural models across five phases of procurement activity. Results suggest that some sets of conditions appear to lend themselves to a “wholesale” outsourcing approach, wherein the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CM</jats:styled-content> is entrusted to both manufacture a product and engage in various procurement activities. Other conditions foster a more “retail” approach to procurement outsourcing, with limited or no follow‐on outsourcing of procurement activities. In general, firms seem more comfortable outsourcing tactical procurement activities, entrusting strategic activities to <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CM</jats:styled-content>s only when the product is highly commoditized or when the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CM</jats:styled-content> controls access to international resources the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">OEM</jats:styled-content> is unable to leverage on its own. Overall, the relationship between manufacturing and procurement outsourcing is complex and contingent on a variety of factors.</jats:p>",

Management would certainly find it useful to have available a model which could identify the optimal re-action, or pro-action, from among all those which are possible. This paper will: (1) describe how such a model can be constructed in practice, and (2) how the model can be solved for the optimal management pro-actions, and reactions. The model describes all supply network interactions at any moment in time, and it describes all time dependent supply network interactions dynamically. The model serves as management’s optimal real-time decision support/information system. It will dynamically calculate the optimal operations policy for the entire supply network. The model is also capable of identifying: the optimal design of a supply network, the optimal capacities of a network, and the optimal network facility locations. It also solves some well known problems such as what is the optimal pure “demand – pull” policy in a network?</p>",

In this study, the circumstances that affect a firm's intention to adopt cloud computing technologies in support of its supply chain operations are investigated by considering tenets of classical diffusion theory as framed within the context of the information processing view. We posit that various aspects of an organization and its respective environment represent both information processing requirements and capacity, which influence the firm's desire to adopt certain information technology innovations. We conducted an empirical study using a survey method and regression analysis to examine our theoretical model. The results suggest that business process complexity, entrepreneurial culture and the degree to which existing information systems embody compatibility and application functionality significantly affect a firm's propensity to adopt cloud computing technologies. The findings support our theoretical development and suggest complementarities between innovation diffusion theory and the information processing view. We encourage other scholars to refine our model in future supply chain innovation diffusion research. The findings of this study might also be used by industry professionals to aid in making more informed adoption decisions in regard to cloud computing technologies in support of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

With this in perspective, it is expedient to explicitly model the SC network to synchronize activities across the cooperating partners. This research is concerned with the performance behaviour of two different SC network structures given different design and control parameters adopted by the partnering echelons within the assumed SC configurations. Accordingly, the authors developed discrete event simulation models of two hypothetical supply chain structures and exploit the Taguchi experimental design procedure as a vehicle for conducting the simulation experiments and analyzing its outcome. The results highlight the relative effects of the assumed design and controlling factors on system-wide SC performance and identify appropriate combinations of these factors for optimal performance concerned. For the average inventory level performance measure, key results reveal that sharing of demand information between partnering echelons should not automatically be taken for granted as a direction for performance enhancement.</p>",

Next, the article deals with two fundamental strategies a supply chain designer can use to mitigate the effects of disruptive risks: (a) containment, i.e., containing the risk, and (b) tailoring reserves like capacity and inventory. Finally, the article discusses how a company can respond to disruptions. These response considerations need to be taken into the supply chain configuration as well.</p>",

While relationships with a power balance between partners do exist, relationships typically occur in the context of power asymmetry. This study examines how perceptions of power use and prevailing relationship quality in dyadic relationships characterized by substantial power asymmetry affect behavioral and operational outcomes. Hierarchical regression is used to analyze data from a dyadic survey of relationships of a brand‐name buying organization and its suppliers. Results indicate that power use affects partner behavior and operational performance, but the nature of the relationship dictates which power sources are most appropriate. In addition, the mediation effect of power imbalance shows that both relational and transactional factors can play an important role in supply chain exchanges.</jats:p>",

The literature suggests that external integration with customers and suppliers is associated with increased improvement and innovation capabilities of the focal firm. However, the way product clockspeed affects these relationships has seldom been subjected to empirical investigation. This study investigates whether product clockspeed moderates the relationship between external integration and improvement and innovation capabilities of manufacturing plants. Analysis of survey data collected from 238 manufacturing plants indicates a positive moderation effect of product clockspeed on the relationship between customer integration and plant improvement and innovation capabilities. However, product clockspeed does not have a significant moderation effect on the relationship between supplier integration and either of the two plant capabilities. This study provides theoretical and managerial insights into aligning external integration with plant capabilities under the contingency of product clockspeed.</jats:p>",

However, the whole industrial chain is still rough, necessary to improve in science and technology, and also its products have low added-values. In this paper, relevant suggestions are proposed for the improvement of the supply chain of coal chemical enterprises in Hebei province, and an introduction is made from three aspects (raw material purchase, product manufacturing, and logistics).</jats:p>"

The water supply and drainage engineering of municipal works is one of the most important components of the infrastructures in urban areas. Besides, the water supply and drainage design of municipal works is a very important link. Whether the water supply and drainage engineering of municipal works can be done well is of important significance and role in the construction of a good urban living environment. In the 21st century, it is necessary for urban construction to seek a sustainable development way, and promote the idea of energy conservation. This proposes higher requirement on the municipal water supply and drainage design. However, at present, there are still a lot of problems in the municipal water supply and drainage design.

It is based on combined use of three new diesel aggregates and a field of photovoltaic panels. Paper further outlines the methodology for selection and sizing up of power generating sources and other equipment. The primary goal for the new system was the reduction of diesel fuel and operational costs. Finally, cost-benefit analysis results of the proposed hybrid system are presented as well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A supply stream is a continuous version of a supply chain. It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We assume stationary parameters and aim to minimize the long-run average total cost. We show that a stationary continuous-stage echelon base-stock policy is optimal. That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times. This linkage leads to some interesting and useful results. Specifically, we obtain a partial differential equation that characterizes the optimal cost function, and we find a closed-form expression for the optimal echelon base-stock levels in a certain special case, the first in the inventory literature. These expressions demonstrate that the well-known square-root law for safety stock does not apply in this context. </jats:p>",

This paper recognizes that maximizing the final output does not necessarily guarantee an efficient system and the notion of port efficiency and service effectiveness needs to be considered from the perspectives of both the provider and the consumer of the port service. The paper proposes a network-DEA model to evaluate the performances of 30 seaports worldwide. The concurrent consideration of efficiency scores from the network-DEA model and the traditional DEA-CCR model will offer valuable insights to port operators on how to improve port performances as part of a seaborne cargo supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Recent disruptions in global supply chains have led to increased interest in supply chain risk management investigation. On the other hand, increased environmental regulation has urged firms to compulsorily have their routine operations environmental friendly. Last few years, researchers have investigated these two streams as distinct but have mentioned them to be related in the long run. The current study attempts to bridge this gap of allied literature by conceptually arguing that it to arrive at sustainability in supply chain operations, firms must co-integrate their supply chain risk management and green practices in supply chain. While risk management broadly aims to reduce the exposure to a risky situation coupled with minimizing the negative impact of disruption of firm performance; green practices aims to make operational, tactical and strategic operations of the firm environment friendly. Based on sufficient theoretical tenets from related literature, the study attempts to develop a theoretical model linking supply chain risk management, green supply chain practices and sustainable supply chain. In doing so, the study provides an indicative list of various risk classifications and proposed risk mitigating strategies till date. Finally, the study indicates managerial implications and suggests further research opportunities.</p>",

Acting as trade facilitators, seaports are important players in the system. The study of the role of ports in supply chain management has recently drawn increasing attention from researchers and industry professionals alike. However, prior works mainly gathered the views from ports and terminals. To the authors’ knowledge, no attempt by previous empirical studies has been made to cover the perspective from shippers and logistics providers, who are obviously taking a serious role in the process of global freight movements as major stakeholders. It becomes thus imperative to assess a port’s supply chain orientation and performance from the perspective of the port users in the supply chain. Studying ports in the network context would be even more beneficial to capture the complexity needed to understand port performance and its interaction with various stakeholders. Drawing reference from multi-disciplinary fields, this paper aims to fill in the gap by developing a so-called unified framework for analysing port’s integration in global freight supply chains including shipping line networks, hinterland and intermodal transport network, and even urban network. The framework embraces a wider group of stakeholders involved, for example, terminal operators, port authorities, shippers, shipping companies, inland transport providers, freight forwarders/logistics service providers, cities and other ports in the networks. A port that is a key node in these networks simultaneously would be able to create and sustain value for port stakeholders. Port authorities and operators can refer to the framework as their network performance indicators so as to obtain a better understanding of the various considerations in a port’s network performance and to assist in positioning the port within the complex dynamics in the context of global freight supply chains. Finally, the framework developed in the paper can serve as a guide to empirical examinations of an emerging theme - a network-oriented performance by seaports along global freight supply chains - leading to various possible channels in future research.</jats:p>",

It briefly examines the growth in the number of municipalities and town engineers in the country in this period and investigates the background and training of these engineers; why municipalities decided to appoint an engineer; and what kind of appointment processes were followed. Finally the relations between engineers and town councils and the prevailing circumstances at the end of the engineers’ tenures is studied. The article also presents ten specific cases which have reference to the development of water supply. It emerges that most early town engineers received training via apprenticeship for the positions they held, and that there was added pressure from elected councillors in municipalities who were prone to monitor assiduously how officials were spending public money. It is also clear that engineers who did not have earlier municipal experience were bound to have problems in their interaction with town councillors.Keywords: Municipal history, civil engineering, water supply, sanitation, Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State, TransvaalDisciplines: History, Engineering, Public Management</jats:p>"

The authors examine abnormal stock returns to investments in IT-enabled SCM systems announced by 346 firms from 2001 to 2004, and find significant, positive abnormal returns for two, three, and five day periods surrounding the event date. Further, the authors employ organizational integration perspective to test if market value impacts differ based on the functional scope, physical scope and the industry context of the SCM systems adopted by the firms. Using a multiple regression analysis, the authors find the abnormal returns to be greater for firms investing in SCM systems with greater functional scope and physical scope. The authors find marginal evidence for the effect of industry context and no impact of firm size on the market value generated from investments in SCM systems.</p>",

Based on the pre-defined partnering attributes, the SQA model next identifies a select group of high quality suppliers that can be converted into partners. The outcome of the SQA model is then integrated into the SSCM model for ensuring input quality while providing several options for overall business gains of the supply chain members, which include suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers.

      "abstract": "<p>Sustainability in supply chain operations fundamentally relies on environmental standards, the traditional driver of investment in pollution control and a major factor in facilities site selection. While environmental standardization has traditionally focused on activities in nations and in some multinational regions, in the future a more international perspective is needed. Environmental standards spur investment in technologies enabling sustainable supply chain networks. The complex institutional framework of environmental standardization is a widely misunderstood socio-technical, political process. Experience with the development of legal constraints on standardization in the U.S. has produced problems in areas like intellectual property (IP), antitrust and public participation. Standardization venues often host collaborative development of innovation by uniquely fusing technology design and public policy development. Various constituencies are typically engaged: environmentalists; technologists; legislatures at national, regional or provincial levels; regulators at various levels of government; standards-setting organizations; upstream suppliers; downstream users; the connecting supply chains; and society’s varied range of affected communities. This article reviews the role of standardization activities in setting environmental constraints, in the development of green technologies and in establishing metrics for environmental metrology, certification and monitoring. Implications from U.S. experience in managing environmental standardization are examined here to guide participation in international standardization activities. The risks of misunderstanding standardization are so significant that their disregard imperils competitiveness.</p>",

Although many operational risk-management tools exist, these tools and methods have not been synthesized into a comprehensive management system. This article evaluates risk-assessment methodologies and operational approaches to manage risk in global supply chains, and proposes a closed-loop risk-management system with inputs, outputs, and feedback. A focal OEM company's global supply chain is used to analyze the feasibility of proposed risk assessment and an operational business model. A tool for determining supply chain root causes (supply chain failure modes and effects analysis—FMEA), and a tool for supply chain risk assessment (global supply chain risk-management scorecard) are presented. Results of completed supply chain FMEAs and global supply chain risk-management scorecards are reported. Supply chains need scalable risk-management tools to ensure supply continuity during major disruptions while balancing efficiency considerations during normal operations. The proposed management system includes scalable strategic and tactical tools to identify risks, determine root causes, assess change-management capabilities, monitor performance, and evaluate execution of the system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>An overview of research activity in the area of powering base station sites by means of renewable energy sources is given. It is shown that mobile network operators express significant interest for powering remote base stations using renewable energy sources. This is because a significant percentage of remote base station sites on the global level are still diesel powered due to lack of connections to the electricity grid. Besides huge expenses that mobile operators pay for diesel fuel and its transport to base station sites, it is pointed out that such base station sites represent major pollutants due to enormous green-house gas emissions. Since base stations are major consumers of cellular networks energy with significant contribution to operational expenditures, powering base stations sites using the energy of wind, sun, fuel cells or a combination gain mobile operators’ attention. It is shown that powering base station sites with such renewable energy sources can significantly reduce energy costs and improve the energy efficiency of the base station sites in rural areas. In addition, technical descriptions of the different power supply systems based on renewable sources with corresponding energy controllers for scheduling the flow of energy to power base station sites are discussed. According to the presented, hybrid systems which combine different renewable energy sources outperform those with only one energy source, and depend on the configuration of base stations installed on a particular site, such systems can offer autonomous functionality throughout the year.</p>",

Chemical reduction of iron in continental margin sediments provides a substantial dissolved flux to the oceans, which is isotopically lighter than the crust, and so may be distinguished in seawater from other sources, such as wind-blown dust. However, heavy iron isotopes measured in seawater have recently led to the proposition of another source of dissolved iron from ‘non-reductive’ dissolution of continental margins. Here we present the first pore water iron isotope data from a passive-tectonic and semi-arid ocean margin (South Africa), which reveals a smaller and isotopically heavier flux of dissolved iron to seawater than active-tectonic and dysoxic continental margins. These data provide <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> evidence of non-reductive iron dissolution from a continental margin, and further show that geological and hydro-climatic factors may affect the amount and isotopic composition of iron entering the ocean.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The replenishment of consumed oxygen in the open ocean oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off northwest Africa is accomplished by oxygen transport across and along density surfaces, i.e. diapycnal and isopycnal oxygen supply. Here the diapycnal oxygen supply is investigated using a large observational set of oxygen profiles and diapycnal mixing data from years 2008 to 2010. Diapycnal mixing is inferred from different sources: (i) a large-scale tracer release experiment, (ii) microstructure profiles, and (iii) shipboard acoustic current measurements plus density profiles. From these measurements, the average diapycnal diffusivity in the studied depth interval from 150 to 500 m is estimated to be 1 × 10−5 m2 s−1, with lower and upper 95% confidence limits of 0.8 × 10−5 m2 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−5 m2 s−1. Diapycnal diffusivity in this depth range is predominantly caused by turbulence, and shows no significant vertical gradient. Diapycnal mixing is found to contribute substantially to the oxygen supply of the OMZ. Within the OMZ core, 1.5 μmol kg−1 yr−1 of oxygen is supplied via diapycnal mixing, contributing about one-third of the total demand. This oxygen which is supplied via diapycnal mixing originates from oxygen that has been laterally supplied within the upper Central Water layer above the OMZ, and within the Antarctic Intermediate Water layer below the OMZ. Due to the existence of a separate shallow oxygen minimum at about 100 m depth throughout most of the study area, there is no net vertical oxygen flux from the surface layer into the Central Water layer. Thus all oxygen supply of the OMZ is associated with remote pathways.\n                    </jats:p>"

This research investigated the  frequency  and correlates of  conflicts  in  identified conflict centers on  projects  procured with either  the traditional method or integrated methods. Conflicts were measured in terms of their frequencies  of  occurrence.  Five  internal  conflict  centers  on  construction  projects  were identified  and  used.  Questionnaires  were  administered  through  purposive  and  snowballing techniques on 274 projects located in twelve states and Abuja in Nigeria. 96 usable responses were   obtained.   The   collected   data   were   subjected   to   both   descriptive   and inferential statistical analyses. The most critical area of conflict was around resources for  project execution on projects executed  with the integrated  procurement  method,  while  the  most critical area of conflicts on projects executed with the traditional method was conflict arising from administrative procedures. There were significant correlations between overall satisfaction with project procurement and the frequency of conflicts.  However,  the  results  of the  analyses  do  not  suggest  that  any  significant  correlations  exist  between  the  method  used for  the  procurement  of  the  projects  and  the  frequency  of  conflicts  on  the  projects.  The  study recommends that the central place of the person, the psychological make-up and personality of  team  members,  instead  of  structure,  may  be  variables  to  watch  out  for  with  respect to frequency of conflicts, handling of conflicts and overall satisfaction with project procurement. It is recommended that similar analyses can be done on the basis of intensity or seriousness of conflicts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The steam supply piping connected to the high pressure (HP) turbine of APR1400 (Korea’s advanced power plant 1400 MW-class) is a typical example of multi-supported piping system, and it is routed from the Containment building to the Turbine building via the Main Steam Isolation Valve House in the Auxiliary building. In the seismic analysis of this piping system, using the Enveloped Response Spectrum (ERS) method, a commonly used methodology for seismic analysis of nuclear power plant piping in industry circles, generates overly conservative analysis results. Therefore, Time History Method (THM) which applies excitation characteristic of each support attached to individual building was used to eliminate unnecessary conservatism. However, it was noticed that the Time History Method requires considerable amount of labor and time in generating combined time history equivalent to the spectrum applied for each support although it is regarded as the most exact and realistic method for seismic analysis. The nuclear industry has been making lots of efforts in finding out the mathematic logicality and practical applicability to resolve this issue. This paper deals with parametric research on combination effects of responses between support groups, damping effects, and modal combination method with close modes in applying the Independent Support Motion (ISM) method to the analysis model of the steam supply piping connected to the high pressure turbine of APR1400. Quantitative assessment and comparison with the analysis results of the ERS method and THM were also carried out. As a result, it is shown that the analysis results of the ISM method together with the SRSS combination between support groups, 4% damping with ±15% spectrum peak broadening and grouping of modal combination are remarkably similar to those of THM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Created as a market-based instrument to deter tropical deforestation, the certification program of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has experienced tremendous growth over the past two decades. We argue that using a comprehensive conceptual framework is needed to assess the successes and limitations of FSC certification. We introduce a supply chain strategy framework to address three questions: (a) What are the requisite supply chain conditions for certification programs to be successful? (b) How well does the tropical timber sector meet these conditions? (c) What actions could make FSC certification efforts more effective? We conclude that some conditions necessary for a successful supply chain strategy are not found in the tropical timber industry. As a result, FSC certification faces severe limitations as a governance tool for tropical forest conservation. We suggest that a collaborative approach to creating markets for certified timber will improve FSC certificate program effectiveness. </jats:p>",

The water supply results from SRM were run through a Southern Idaho reservoir operation and water rights allocation model (MODSIM). The 2030-Dry and 2080-Dry scenarios produce supply deficits relative to the current climate of 5.4%, and 1.9%, respectively, for which the corresponding irrigation water delivery reductions were 1.7% and 2.7%. In contrast, the 2030-Wet, 2030-Mid, 2080-Wet, and 2080-Mid climate change scenarios increased water supply by 13.4%, 0.5%, 19.5%, and 5%, respectively, for which water deliveries increased by 0.41%, 0.04%, 0.34% and 0.14%, respectively. Idaho's irrigation delivery and storage system can ameliorate the risk of dry climate change, but is incapable of storing and delivering the increased water supplied by the wet climate change scenarios. This is an opportunity worth exploring.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>There is ample anecdotal evidence suggesting that firms can experience serious losses from social, ecological or ethical problems that exist in their supply chains. So far, however, research on supply chain risk management has largely neglected these sustainability issues. Most importantly, little is known about how sustainability issues manifest themselves as risks and how they create losses for focal firms. Without an in‐depth understanding of this materialization process, conceptualizations of sustainability risks will remain vague and effective management frameworks cannot be developed. We address this important research gap by means of a transdisciplinary approach and provide a concise description of how sustainability issues in supply chains materialize as risks for focal firms. Building on this mechanism and drawing on stakeholder theory, we develop a conceptualization of sustainability risks which lays the basis for future investigations in this respective field. In addition, we devise a viable management concept for sustainability‐related supply chain risks. The proposed concept can help firms to mitigate sustainability issues in global supply chains, thus making them less vulnerable to losses resulting from these risks. Its application will also foster sustainability standards within supply chains. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

In spite of data limitations, one recent paper suggests that Australian sugar consumption has decreased over the same time period that obesity has increased, a so called ‘Australian Paradox’. Given the significant public health focus on nutrition, we aimed to estimate Australian sugar supply and consumption over recent decades, to determine whether these data could be used to make any conclusions about sugar’s role in obesity.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Foods high in sugar were identified.

However, available Import data showed large increases in the volume and value of imported sweetened products between 1988 and 2010 to over 30 grams of sugar per person per day. Value estimates of local production of sweetened products also show substantial increases in this period.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The Australian Paradox assertion is based on incomplete data, as it excludes sugar contained in imported processed foods, which have increased markedly. A major Australian public health target is to improve the quality of the food supply, and actions have been set in terms of achieving broader environmental changes. However, evaluation of progress is hampered by lack of high quality data relating to supply and consumption. We recommend the regular collection of comprehensive food supply statistics, which include both local production and imports. This would provide an inexpensive addition to survey data and could assist in monitoring sugar consumption trends in food supply. Such information would also help inform public health policy.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

Over the past 5 years a survey has been conducted with 800 large European companies, of which half are in the manufacturing sector and half in the service sector. The hypotheses within the survey are related to strategies for developing an environmental supply chain. They were derived from a literature review and were tested by means of a chi‐square test. The survey questionnaire enabled the respondents to give some viewpoints about the hypotheses. In this way, strategies for developing the supply chain such as ISO 14001, the Eco‐Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), auditing, waste management systems, reverse logistics, environmental indicators, remanufacturing and reuse have been investigated. Results show interesting and unexpected differences between manufacturing and service sectors that can lead to further research, practical implications and even suggestions for the surveyed companies. For instance, the viewpoints of manufacturing and service industries differ over ISO 14001 and EMAS implementation in the supply chain. In addition, service industries approach the implementation of auditing, reverse logistics, reuse and remanufacturing in a way different from that of manufacturing. Other strategies are considered essential by both sectors. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

Enterprise systems provide firms with platforms for electronically integrating their supplier and demand chain activities. Spill‐over benefits refer to the impacts that occur when IT investments in one organizational domain benefit performance in a different value chain side of the firm. Supply‐side electronic integration (SEI) refers to the use of electronic means to integrate the exchange of information and transactions with suppliers through enterprise systems. In our research, we examine whether SEI generates spill‐over effects on customer service performance, over and beyond firms’ direct investments in customer‐side digitization. We also examine whether structural attributes of the firm (e.g., vertical integration, diversification, and centralization) moderate the effects of supply‐side electronic integration on customer service performance. Our analysis of a secondary dataset of InformationWeek 500 firms shows that SEI helps firms realize cost‐savings in their customer service performance, especially if they are less vertically integrated. In addition, SEI investments help diversified and centralized firms achieve cross‐selling with their customers. We also find that SEI is more likely to help decentralized and diversified firms achieve customization in their customer service activities. These results suggest that SEI helps firms achieve twin goals in customer service: cost reduction and revenue expansion. Overall, our research reveals how supply‐side electronic integration could generate benefits in customer service performance in firms.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This paper investigates the memory effect of a commonly used comparator when its power supply is scaled down to near transistor threshold voltage levels. It also studies when such memory effects are most likely to occur during the conversion sequences of successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs. Subsequently an improved comparator design is presented to overcome the memory effect with near-threshold voltage power supply. The impacts of the proposed design modification on comparator speed, offset voltage and power consumptions are discussed. Based on a 0.13 μm CMOS technology and with a 0.5 V power supply, the proposed comparator is compared with the original comparator in terms of memory effect, speed, power consumption and input offset voltage. The integral and differential nonlinearity (INL and DNL) of 10-bit SAR ADCs with using the proposed and original comparators are also compared. </jats:p>",

The three policy interventions are the supply stimulus that occurred in 2009 with funding to construct almost 20 000 new social housing dwellings by 2012, the push to diversify social housing supply through the transfer of public housing stock to community not‐for‐profit housing providers, and the physical renewal of public housing estates to reduce concentrations of social deprivation. Its aims are threefold: to understand how the supply and geography of social housing dwellings has changed over the past decade; to relate these changes to the objectives of social housing policy in the time period; and to identify issues for the future of social housing in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">A</jats:styled-content>ustralia emerging from identified disparities between policy rhetoric and supply reality.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study describes a prediction method of a supply flow rate of axial cooling fans mounted in high-density packaging electronic equipment. The performance of an air-cooling fan is defined by its P – Q (pressure difference – flow rate) curve. Generally the operating point of a fan, which is the operating pressure and the flow rate in equipment, is the point of intersection of a P – Q curve and a flow resistance curve. Recently, some researchers reported that catalogue P – Q curves have not necessarily been able to predict a correct supply flow rate in thermal design of high-density packaging equipment. Our study aims to improve prediction accuracy of the supply flow rate. In this report, a relationship between the P – Q curve and a pressure drop characteristic in a fan-mounted enclosure was investigated. A test enclosure which includes an obstruction was mounted in front of a test fan and the supply flow rate of the fan was measured while changing the obstruction. Additionally the flow resistance curves in the test enclosure were measured and the relationship among the supply flow rate, the P – Q curve and the flow resistance curve was investigated. It is found that the correct supply flow rate can be obtained by using the flow resistance from the enclosure inlet through the fan outlet and the revised P – Q curve which is made compensation for the pressure drop at the inlet and the outlet of the fan.</jats:p>",

A survey was carried out involving 16 water supply systems and 160 households within the Achefer area, in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. The results show that household contributions to water supply system management are positively and significantly affected by user participation during the project design and implementation, by advocacy provided by the project and by greater household income. Thus, for drinking water systems in rural areas to be sustainable, these factors should be included when planning water supply projects.</jats:p>",

We consider a pharmaceutical firm that is engaged in determining the optimal pharmaceutical flows associated with its supply chain network activities in the form of manufacturing and distribution. In addition to multimarket demand satisfaction, the pharmaceutical firm seeks to minimize its total cost, with the associated function also capturing the firm's weighted disrepute cost caused by possible quality issues associated with the contractors. Simultaneously, the contractors, who compete with one another noncooperatively in prices in the manner of Bertrand, and in quality, seek to secure manufacturing and distribution of the pharmaceutical product from the pharmaceutical firm. This game theory model allows for the determination of the optimal pharmaceutical product flows associated with the supply chain in‐house and outsourcing network activities and provides the pharmaceutical firm with its optimal make‐or‐buy decisions and the optimal contractor selections. We state the governing equilibrium conditions and derive the equivalent variational inequality formulation. We then propose dynamic adjustment processes for the evolution of the product flows, the quality levels, and the prices, along with stability analysis results. The algorithm yields a discretization of the continuous‐time adjustment processes. We present convergence results and compute solutions to numerical examples to illustrate the generality and applicability of the framework.</jats:p>",

We, in turn, apply real options theory, internationalization theory, organizational economics, resource dependence theory, social network theory, and institutional theory. We also examine the implications for global supply chain management of juxtaposing the insights provided by multiple theories.

In this study, we propose a research model based on a relational view, delineating the factors that influence hospital supply chain performance: trust, knowledge exchange, IT integration between the hospital and its suppliers, and hospital–supplier integration. Testing results of the research model based on data from a sample of 117 supply chain executives from U.S. hospitals show positive direct effects: (1) from trust and from IT integration to knowledge exchange respectively; (2) from knowledge exchange and from IT integration to hospital–supplier integration respectively; and (3) from hospital–supplier integration to hospital supply chain performance. The results also show the following indirect effects: (1) the influences of knowledge exchange and IT integration on hospital supply chain performance are partially and fully mediated by hospital–supplier integration, respectively and (2) the influences of trust and IT integration on hospital–supplier integration are fully and partially mediated by knowledge exchange, respectively. In addition, the results show the following moderating effects: (1) hospital system membership moderates the relationships between IT integration and knowledge exchange and between trust and knowledge exchange; (2) hospital environmental uncertainty moderates the relationship between trust and knowledge exchange; and (3) trust moderates the relationship between knowledge exchange and hospital–supplier integration. Implications of the study findings and directions for future research are discussed.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

There has been limited research that focuses on micro‐level outcomes related to employees who actually execute SCM processes in organizations. These employee‐level outcomes are important because successful implementation of SCM systems and processes hinges on SCM employees’ support and commitment. I develop and test a model positing that SCM employees’ perceptions of changes in their work process characteristics, i.e., <jats:italic>process complexity</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>process rigidity</jats:italic>, following a new SCM system implementation will influence their job outcomes, i.e., <jats:italic>job performance</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>job satisfaction</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>job anxiety</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>job security</jats:italic>, and their perceptions of process outcomes, i.e., <jats:italic>process performance</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>relationship quality</jats:italic>. The model incorporates a holistic appraisal of the extent of change—<jats:italic>change radicalness</jats:italic>—as a mechanism between work process characteristics and outcomes. The model is supported in three studies conducted in the context of three different SCM system implementations (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 278, 282, and 304, respectively). In particular, I found that individuals perceived a significant change in their work process characteristics following an SCM system implementation, and changes in work process characteristics had a significant impact on job and process outcomes. These findings contribute to the information systems and operations management literatures and their intersections by offering insights on challenges related to IT‐enabled SCM innovation implementation in organizations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In a reprocessing facility, power supply system (PSS) is important for operation-stability and safety-guarantee of the whole facility. Therefore, the reliability of the PSS deserves in-depth investigation and analysis.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Fault tree (FT) methodology is the most accustomed methodology for system-reliability analysis and it has been standardized and applied widely. GO methodology is another effective methodology for system-reliability analysis but it has not been applied widely.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this work, GO methodology was applied to analyze the reliability of the PSS in a typical reprocessing facility. First, for modeling expediently, based on the fact that tie breakers are set in the system, tie breaker operator was defined by myself. Then, GO methodology modeling and quantitative analysis were performed, minimal cut sets (MCSs) and average unavailability of the system were obtained. Finally, parallel analysis between GO methodology and fault tree methodology was also performed. The results from the two methodologies are completely coincident.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results of this work show the following two points:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>1.

For reliability analysis of the PSS of the reprocessing facility, parallel with fault tree methodology, GO methodology has two distinct advantages: Its modeling is much easier and its chart is much more succinct.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, taking into account the position of EU importing companies is fundamental, in fact, the more attractive the GSP to economic operators the more they will utilize it to their advantage but also to the benefit of developing countries. The article comments the changes of both the EU GSP regulation and the applicable origin rules, and concludes that the GSP remains fundamental for the sourcing especially from Asian countries.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Drawing upon a database of over 300 enterprises operating within the eight defined green sectors, this paper assesses the determinants and drawbacks of innovation. In particular, by using an econometrical approach, we tested the following propositions: (1) small dimension of enterprises is not an obstacle to their innovation capabilities; (2) the adoption of an internationalisation strategy is an opportunity and a stimulus to innovation for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SME</jats:styled-content>s; (3) cooperation with research centres, financial partners, trade association and public entities can help <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SME</jats:styled-content>s to overcome difficulties and help them to develop and offer innovative products and services, so to be competitive at an international level. The econometric analysis shows a positive impact of the variables ‘dimension’ and ‘level of internationalisation’ on innovation capabilities. In addition, cooperation with research centres and access to capital market are positively related with effective innovations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We have developed the food processing device which uses underwater shock waves generated by gap discharging and electrical sparking. This method is dangerous due to the fact that it requires a very high voltage. Thus, we have focused on evaporation of aluminum wires occurred by the instantaneous high current and low voltage from a charged capacitor. When instantaneous high current flows through the aluminum wire is anchored between electrodes, a shock wave is generated by the evaporation of the aluminum wire. In this research, we have developed a power supply module for the food processing device using high pressure of shock wave due to evaporation of aluminum wire by instantaneous discharge of high current. In the present stage, the evaporation of aluminum wire can generate 70% of pressure compared to the gap discharge, and as for the electric power, it reached 22.5% of the gap discharge. It has been understood that the number of the aluminum wires are important to obtain a high pressure, when the charged capacitor discharged the charge. We found that evaporation of aluminum wire can generate high pressure with low voltage, which is more effective than the gap discharging in terms of safety.</jats:p>"

As a result, they have improved their ability to coordinate and synchronize shared business processes by using more complete, accurate, and timely information. These electronic linkages are based on open‐standard interorganizational information systems (OSIOS), which are fundamentally different from traditional electronic data interchanges. OSIOS capture not only the technical specifications for data interchange but also the sequential steps for the execution of shared business processes. Because OSIOS are still at an early diffusion stage, it remains unclear why firms would assimilate such an innovation and whether assimilation provides firms any benefits. In this research, we develop a framework grounded on the economics of standards, institutional theory, and strategic interorganizational information systems literatures to investigate the drivers and outcomes of OSIOS assimilation in a focused context. In order to test our hypotheses based on this framework, we used data from a high‐technology supply chain and employed econometrics techniques. We found that both competition asymmetry across supply chain echelons and OSIOS assimilation within supply chain echelons predict individual firms’ OSIOS assimilation. The results also suggest that firms’ supply chain dominance is both a driver and an outcome of OSIOS assimilation, highlighting a mutually reinforcing process. In addition, our study reveals boundary conditions of the hypothesized relationships. The use of multiple theoretical perspectives, a unique dataset, and innovative statistical techniques to investigate OSIOS assimilation in high‐technology supply chains contributes to the body of knowledge in both the supply chain management and management of information systems disciplines.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The sows were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatments: 5.5 (LLys, Control), 7.4 (MLys) and 8.7 (HLys) g Lys kg-1 diet. Feed allowance was 2.30-2.33 kg d-1. Close to farrowing a conventional lactation diet was used. Dietary Lys did not affect body-weight (BW) gain in late gestation of second-parity sows. However, in third-parity sows, a strong tendency was observed for BW gain to increase during late pregnancy with dietary Lys levels higher than 5.5 g kg-1 (p=0.061). Body-weight losses during lactation were never influenced by Lys supply. A strong tendency (p=0.064) for a lower ratio between piglets born alive and total piglets born was observed in second-parity sows fed the Control gestation diet. Litters and piglets from sows on this diet had the lowest weight at birth (p0.05). In conclusion, under moderate energy supply, adequate reserves for subsequent lactation can be achieved in second- and third-parity IB sows with a daily provision of at least 17.2 g lysine over the last third of pregnancy, what implies a substantial increase in protein supply respect to traditional practices.</jats:p>"

Using a simultaneous, structural model of labour supply and child care demand we predict the effects on the labour supply of partnered women, on demand for child care and on household finances for two‐parent households in Australia. Using estimated cost impacts of this new National Quality Framework from government and non‐government sources, we find modest effects on household behaviour. For a mid‐range cost scenario, we find that partnered women's labour force participation will decrease by just over one‐half of one percentage point, a change of less than 1 per cent. Working hours for partnered women decrease by 20 minutes or approximately 2 per cent. Household disposable income decreases by $12.50, a 0.6 per cent decrease. Given widespread agreement about the benefits of investing in children, these quantitatively small effects for two‐parent households strengthen the case for the National Quality Framework.</jats:p>",

We estimated nursing home admission appropriateness using propensity score analyses based on Michigan Medicaid Nursing Facility Level of Care Determinations ratings. </jats:p><jats:p> Results. From 1999 to 2007, the number of VHA inpatient psychiatric beds declined (43 894–40 928), the average inpatient length of stay decreased (33.1–19.0 days), and the prevalence of SMI in nursing homes rose (29.4%–43.8%). At site level, psychiatric inpatient bed availability was unrelated to SMI prevalence in nursing home admissions. However, nursing home residents with SMI were more likely to be inappropriately admitted than were residents without SMI (4.0% vs 3.2%). </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions. These results suggest the need for increased attention to the long-term care needs of individuals with SMI. Additional steps need to be taken to ensure that patients with SMI are offered appropriate alternatives to nursing home care and receive adequate screening before admission to nursing home treatment. </jats:p>",

In this study, the genes ZmCHC1 and ZmCHC2 encoding clathrin heavy chain in maize were cloned and characterized for the first time in monocots. ZmCHC1 encodes a 1693-amino acid-protein including 29 exons and 28 introns, and ZmCHC2 encodes a 1746-amino acid-protein including 28 exons and 27 introns. The high similarities of gene structure, protein sequences and 3D models among ZmCHC1, and Arabidopsis AtCHC1 and AtCHC2 suggest their similar functions in CME. ZmCHC1 gene is predominantly expressed in maize roots instead of ubiquitous expression of ZmCHC2. Consistent with a typical predicted salicylic acid (SA)-responsive element and four predicted ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in the promoter sequence of ZmCHC1, the expression of ZmCHC1 instead of ZmCHC2 in maize roots is significantly up-regulated by SA or ABA, suggesting that ZmCHC1 gene may be involved in the SA signaling pathway in maize defense responses. The expressions of ZmCHC1 and ZmCHC2 genes in maize are down-regulated by azide or cold treatment, further revealing the energy requirement of CME and suggesting that CME in plants is sensitive to low temperatures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Remote sensing techniques in Archaeology are increasingly essential components of the methodologies used in archaeological and architectural researches. They allow uncovering unique forgotten data which are unobtainable using traditional excavation techniques, mainly because their precise location is lost. These data are still important since they can help to prevent flood effects inside the ancient building cellars and basements, as it happened periodically in El Escorial. Wide ancient drainage galleries run more than one hundred feet downhill outside the building, ensuring that rainwater and springs were adequately drained. Nowadays their plans are lost, and the lack of documents related both to the ancient water supply and drainage systems become an impediment to solve the stains of damp on the stone masonry walls and vaults, and even other occasional flooding effects. In this case, nondestructive techniques were needed to find the ancient underground passages in order to preserve the integrity of the building and its current activities. At a first stage oblique aerial infrared images taken from a helium barrage balloon helped to find easily, quickly and cheaply the buried masonry structures. Secondly, radar pulses were particularly interesting to image the subsurface as they were valuable means of assessing the presence and amount of both soil water and buried structures. The combination of both techniques proved to be an accurate and low-cost way to find the ancient drainage systems. Finally, results were produced by means of open source software.\n                    </jats:p>"

However, because the food resource disappears in winter, we predicted that grebes moulting later in the season would put on more body mass prior to moult because of the increasing risk of an <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">A</jats:styled-content>rtemia</jats:italic> population crash before the moult period is completed. Body mass determinations of thousands of birds captured during 2000–2010 showed that grebes in active wing‐moult showed greater mass with date of capture. Early‐moulting grebes were significantly lighter at all stages than late‐moulting birds. Grebes captured with new feathers post‐moult were significantly lighter than those in moult. This is the first study to support the hypothesis that individual waterbirds adopt different strategies in body mass accumulation according to timing of moult: early‐season grebes were able to acquire an excess of energy over expenditure and accumulate fat stores while moulting. Delayed moulters acquired greater fat stores in advance of moult to contribute to energy expenditure for feather replacement and retained extra stores later, most likely as a bet hedge against the increasing probability of failing food supply and higher thermoregulatory demands late in the season. An alternative hypothesis, that mass change is affected by a trophically transmitted cestode using brine shrimps as an intermediate host and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">B</jats:styled-content>lack‐necked <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">G</jats:styled-content>rebes as final host, was not supported by the data.</jats:p>",

Anesthetized rats underwent cannulation of their right jugular vein (for anesthetic/nutrient/drug infusion) and right carotid artery (for continuous blood pressure measurement via pressure transducer). The left sciatic nerve was exposed and nerve blood velocity (NBV) was assessed from an arterial segment lying superficially along the sciatic nerve (Doppler ultrasound, 40 MHz). NBV and mean arterial pressure (MAP) values were collected, and an index of nerve vascular conductance (NVC) was established (NBV/MAP) at baseline and at 5, 10, 20, and 30 min (and 80 min for insulin) following 1) low glucose infusion, 1 g/kg (50% solution); 2) high glucose infusion, 3 g/kg; 3) high glucose infusion in the absence of a functioning pancreas; 4) euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp–insulin infusion (10 mU·kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; 0.4 IU/ml); 5) high glucose infusion + N<jats:sup>G</jats:sup>-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) infusion (30 mg/kg); and 6) l-NAME alone followed 20 min later by high glucose infusion. High glucose infusion increased NVC by ∼120% relative to baseline ( P &lt; 0.001), and this dilation was attenuated in rats without a functioning pancreas (i.e., without insulin secretion) ( P = 0.004) and following l-NAME infusion ( P = 0.011). Therefore, the vasodilation in rat sciatic nerve during glucose infusion was dependent upon the insulin response and acted through a nitric oxide synthase pathway. </jats:p>",

In particular, we calculated the power consumption values induced by the on‐resistances and short‐circuit current of the class‐D‐type driver‐stage. After analyzing the results, the interstage capacitor between the driver and the power stages was removed to improve the overall efficiency. By removing the interstage capacitor, the supply voltage for the driver stage can be decreased compared to a normal power amplifier. The power consumption at the on‐resistance of the driver stage can be reduced and the power consumption induced by the short‐circuit current can be reduced. Additionally, we measured the power consumption at the driver stages to verify the calculated results. In the experimental results, we noted improved efficiency of the proposed amplifier, while its output power was nearly identical to that of a normal amplifier. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
