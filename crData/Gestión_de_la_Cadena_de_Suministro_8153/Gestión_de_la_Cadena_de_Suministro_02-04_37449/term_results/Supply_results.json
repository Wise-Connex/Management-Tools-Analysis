Results from an initial survey indicated that although most countries do have drinking water quality guidelines, only a few are enforcing these guidelines. It was evident that most of these countries do not incorporate analytical variability in the application of analytical results for compliance studies. A clear link between the regulator, the producer and the analyst does not exist. An effective system that assesses compliance to drinking water specifications and at the same time ensures the consumer safe and healthy water, therefore, does not exist for most consumers. In an effort to provide guidance to members of IWA, the water supplier, the analyst and the regulator, workshops should be held during the next two conferences of IWA. The output of these workshops should be guiding documents and networking opportunities that will facilitate effective and efficient skills transfer for compliance monitoring of drinking water in all the countries of the world.</jats:p>",

We show in a continuous-time model with increasing returns to labor (IRL) that if the economy features multiple competitive equilibria, the optimal path of investment, employment and consumption cannot be constant, or even smoothly-varying. Any macroeconomic policies that shielded the economy from sunspot fluctuations would necessarily not be optimal. We then characterize the optimal allocation (the solution to the planner&amp;amp;#x27;s problem) in a discrete time version of the model. We find that the optimal investment, employment and consumption policies under increasing returns can feature (1) discontinuous jumps, (2) endogenous cycles (with time-varying cycle limits) and (3) stochastic controls (lotteries). Our discrete-time model is very close to that studied by Christiano and Harrison (1999); they, however find that fluctuations are not optimal. We show that this difference is driven by their assumption that production is linear in capital.</jats:p>"

Indeed, theoretically, the use of standard deviations should only be used with normally distributed data. It is shown in this paper that turbidity and particle counting data is not normally distributed and that values derived by means of percentile analysis are more sensitive than using the mean plus standard deviations. Percentile analysis is able to produce alarms for data that is clearly different from normal operation, enabling smaller deviations from the usual to be identified.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water treatment plants removing iron from groundwater are commonly expected to operate in oxidation-floc formation mode. However, there are indications that adsorptive iron removal plays a role as well. Adsorptive iron removal has several potential advantages over oxidation-floc formation iron removal. Therefore, the physical and surface chemical characteristics of coated sand from twelve different groundwater treatment plants in the Netherlands were analysed to assess their potential use in adsorptive iron removal. Specific surface areas, amounts of iron, manganese, calcium and TOC in the coatings and iron(II) adsorption capacities of the coated media were measured. Additionally, grain size distribution and density of the media were determined and X-ray diffractograms, scanning electron micrographs and EDAX spectra were prepared. Compared to new sand, coated sand had a very high porosity and a very large specific surface area. The surface extractable iron content of the coated sand increased with iron loading. The iron content of the coatings ranged from 27% to 45%. At pH 6.5, the iron(II) adsorption capacities of different coated sands were 10 to 55 times that of new sand. In general, iron(II) adsorption capacities of the coated sand from different plants increased with the increase in the time in use and the iron content of the coating. However, the average annual increase of iron content of the coatings and the iron adsorption capacity were different for the coated sands from different plants, probably due to the difference in water quality, process conditions applied and time in use. The grain size of the filter sand increased and their density decreased with the development of the coating. The decrease in density was a function of the increase in the effective grain size. EDAX analysis showed that iron and oxygen were the main elements in the coating followed by manganese, calcium, silicon and carbon. All the coatings analysed were X-ray amorphous or poorly crystalline. The measured high adsorption capacities of coated sand from wet filters and dry filters of full-scale groundwater treatment plants indicate that, in wet filters, adsorptive iron removal also plays a role. In dry filters, this mechanism should be dominant due to a very short pre-oxidation time. Process efficiencies of wet filters with iron oxide coated sand can be further improved by operating the filters predominantly in the adsorptive filtration mode.</jats:p>",

In the hybrid biofilm reactor, however, IPT was removed effectively by the GAC anode so that complete denitrification was achieved without accumulation of N2O. Simultaneous removal of nitrate and pesticide was evaluated by a mathematical model based on a simplified inhibition kinetics and Langmuir adsorption isotherm.

These flotation processes are governed by characteristics of the bubbles as well as the particles, and therefore it is necessary to investigate the size distribution of the bubbles that are generated. In this research, a new method has been developed to measure the bubble size, using commercially available batch-type and on-line particle counters. The results are compared with the traditional image analysis method. Although there are some discrepancies, the results show that an on-line particle counter can produce reasonably accurate size distributions conveniently and efficiently. The bubble size measurement technique developed in this study will assist understanding and improvement of the DAF and EF processes, from both theoretical and practical points of view.</jats:p>",

Arsenate(V)-ions were adsorbed on ferric hydroxides which were formed in-situ by corrosion of elemental iron in oxygenated water. Natural corrosion of fine iron wool was suitable to remove effectively high but realistic arsenic concentrations of 500 μg/L from drinking water. As the corrosion rate decreased significantly in time, two different methods to enhance the corrosion were tested and evaluated: galvanic corrosion using iron-copper contact elements and the application of an external voltage. The iron-copper contact elements showed promising results (a high and stable corrosion rate) but were bearing the risk of copper release when the contact broke down. The application of voltage led to an enhanced release of iron-ions but was coupled with a cathodic formation of hydrogen from water. The generation of hydrogen is a very undesirable effect for any practical application. Irrespective of the mode of corrosion, a post-treatment step (sand filtration) was required to remove the arsenic loaded rust particles from the effluent. In the final effluent, drinking water quality was reached by all the methods.</jats:p>",

The investigation has been carried out with a 17 W low pressure mercury lamp, at room temperature, with an initial MMTD-Me concentration of 1 mg/l and with a molar ratio H2O2/substrate of 100/1. The results show that: (i) the complete MMTD-Me removal is achieved within 60 and 20 minutes by UV and UV/H2O2 treatment respectively; (ii) the UV only irradiation does not cause any MMTD-Me mineralization; (iii) the UV/H2O2 treatment, after 4 hours, leads to a complete mineralization of MMTD-Me organic sulfur and to a partial mineralization of carbon and nitrogen (79 and 16% respectively). Degradation by-products identification, performed by HPLC-UV-MS, revealed that the UV only irradiation gives rise to the sequential transformation of MMTD-Me into two by-products one of which, the last one, accumulates in the solution. Conversely, the UV/H2O2 treatment leads to the formation of two intermediate by-products that undergo further degradation with the breakdown of the thiadiazole ring. These results confirm the effectiveness of UV based processes, alone or in combination with H2O2, in degrading pharmaceutical intermediates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, several oxyanions have emerged as drinking water micropollutants, including arsenate, selenate, bromate, and, most recently, perchlorate (ClO4-). Conventional water treatment processes typically are ineffective in removing these compounds, and advanced treatment processes are expensive. Biological reduction may provide a suitable treatment alternative, since these compounds can serve as electron acceptors. Other acceptors, such as nitrate (NO3-), must act as a primary electron acceptor. We tested our denitrifying, autotrophic, hydrogen-oxidizing hollow-fiber membrane for ClO4- reduction. The reactor is highly suited to drinking water treatment, as hydrogen (H2) is inexpensive, non-toxic, and does not leave residuals that can cause regrowth. When 1 to 2 mg/L ClO4- was supplied to reactor, which was at steady-state with 5 mgN/L NO3- but unacclimated to ClO4-, ClO4- removals increased from 40 to 99% over three weeks. Removals to 4 μg/L were also achieved in a natural groundwater having 6 to 100 μg/L ClO4-. Tests with variable NO3- and H2 showed that ClO4- reduction requires less than 30 μgN/L NO3- and at least 300-μg/L effluent H2. Therefore, partial denitrification is probably not consistent with excellent ClO4- removal. Mineral medium produced a gradual loss of ClO4--reducing bacteria, but they were re-enriched when tap water replaced minimal medium.</jats:p>",

Biofiltration was expected to reduce the membrane fouling by removal of turbidity and metal oxides. The hollow-fiber MF module with a nominal pore size of 0.1 μm and a surface area of 8m2 was submerged in a filtration tank and microfiltration was operated at a constant flux of 0.5 m/d. Biofiltration using polypropylene pellets was performed at a high filtration velocity of 320 m/d. Two experimental setups composed of MF and BF/MF, i.e. without and with biofilter pretreatment, were compared. Throughout the experimental period of 9 months, biofilter pretreatment was effective to reduce the membrane fouling, which was proved by the result of time variations of trans-membrane pressure and backwash conditions. The turbidity removal rate by biofiltration varied between 40% to 80% due to the periodic washing for biofilter contactor and raw water turbidity. In addition to turbidity, metals, especially Mn, Fe and Al were removed effectively with average removal rates of 89.2%, 67.8% and 64.9%, respectively. Further analysis of foulants on the used membranes revealed that turbidity and metal removal by biofiltration was the major effect of biofiltration pretreatment against microfiltration fouling.</jats:p>",

As a result of estimation of the proposed method, adoption of 215 and 220 nm for detection of nitrate and interfering substances resulted in decreasing standard error to about a half of that of a conventional spectrophotometric method. One of the reasons was thought that the coefficient of variation of relative absorbance of interfering substances (rs) at 215 nm was smaller and more stable than that at 275 nm, which was used in the conventional method. The other reason inferred was that most of the interfering substances absorbed UV light at wavelengths of 215 and 220 nm. Although rs has to be renewed when targeted water quality is under extreme conditions, the procedure of the proposed method is very simple, namely only measuring two UV absorbances of a filtrated sample, and more accurate than the conventional spectrophotometric method. Consequently, the proposed method is available for rapid determination of nitrate in natural waters.</jats:p>",

The eutrophic nature and changing raw water quality give rise to many operational difficulties and high treatment costs as well as problems with the final water quality. Optimisation of the coagulation and chlorination processes was seen as a cheaper solution to these problems than to install advanced processes such as ozonation and activated carbon adsorption that would add greatly to treatment costs. The laboratory studies indicated that through optimisation of coagulation-flocculation and by replacement of pre-chlorination by intermediate chlorination (after primary sedimentation) most of the treatment problems could be solved and final water of the required quality produced without a large increase in treatment costs.</jats:p>",

(2) Sufficient nitrification was observed when water temperature was high. Deterioration in nitrification efficiency during winter was reduced by the addition of phosphorus.

The mass transfers of particles are different according to size in polydisperse suspensions. The most particles, which deposit to membrane surface without clogging pore in microfiltration, are much larger than 0.1 μm. Among these particles, smaller particles are easier to deposit than larger particles because of shear-induced diffusion and particle deposition depends on the size distribution of small particles. Effective particle diameter is introduced as a representative particle size which can reflect the diffusivity of each particle according to size and it describes the tendency of particle deposition very well in polydisperse suspensions. The effect of effective particle diameter is larger than that of feed concentration. The most important factor affecting particle deposition of polydisperse suspensions is effective particle diameter.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) with high concentration of powdered activated carbon was investigated to enhance the oxidation of ammonia at a water temperature lower than 4°C. A semi-pilot scale submersed suction type MBR was operated with a hollow fiber membrane module having a nominal pore size of 0.1μm and an effective filtration area of 0.05 m2. A powder activated carbon (PAC) concentration of 40 g/L was maintained in the reactor and the PAC was not replaced during the experiment. A control reactor without PAC was also operated for comparison. Water temperature of both reactors was controlled at 25, 10, 4 and 2°C. At a water temperature of 4°C, the influent ammonia nitrogen of 10 mg/L was removed completely in the reactor with PAC. On the other hand, the effluent concentration of the control reactor was fluctuated in a range of 3-6 mg/L. In addition, nitrite nitrogen was detected in the control reactor up to a maximum concentration of 6 mg/L at the same temperature. Still high removal efficiency was obtained in the reactor with PAC even at 2°C, but almost no ammonia oxidation was observed in the control reactor. The average ammonia oxidation rate of the powdered activated carbon reactor was 1.3-3.2 mg/L.h, which is 4.5 times higher than that of the control (0.51-0.63 mg/L.h). Filtration resistance was 2.45 × 1012m-1 for the reactor with PAC, which is one order lower than that of the control reactor (1.64 × 1013m-1). The microbial cake layer on the membrane surface caused the larger filtration resistance for the control reactor. Only one chemical cleaning was conducted for the membrane in the PAC reactor at the flux of 0.4-0.7 m/d while 3 times cleaning was required for that of the control.</jats:p>",

The results show that Al-humic flocs formed at pH 5.0 appear more compact with higher fractal dimension while those formed at pH 7.0 are looser with lower fractal dimension. During growth, Al-humic flocs also undergo a decrease in their fractal dimension. The attainable removal of TOC is about 40-50% at both pH values, but the optimum Al dose at pH 7.0 is about 5 times of that at pH 5.0. Charge neutralization is believed to be the main mechanism of coagulation at pH 5.0 and sweep coagulation plays an important role at pH 7.0 as well as at pH 5.0 under an overdosing condition.</jats:p>",

This paper compares the financial and technological sustainability of a membrane based water treatment plant versus a conventional type plant at two small rural communities in South Africa, and brief observation is made as to the importance of socio-political sustainability. The membrane-based process is shown to provide consistently good water, whilst the conventional process only provides intermittently good water. The membrane-based plant was successfully operated for an extended period by a community member with no prior skills in water treatment, and showed superior technological sustainability. Using a Net Present Value based approach, financial comparison shows that contrary to conventional wisdom in South Africa, the membrane-based plant has superior financial sustainability. The principle advantage of the membrane based treatment process is that it provides consistently high quality drinking-water and it is not possible for the system to pass on partially treated water that fails bacteriological standards. This will ensure the socio-political sustainability of the membrane-based process. In comparison the regular failure of the conventional system is likely to lead to eventual rejection of the technology by the community.</jats:p>",

The utilization of wind power holds promise as a solution to this problem, as most of these remote islands are subject to constant trade winds. RO desalination of brackish groundwater, which is available in many of these islands, requires low feed water pressure that can be delivered by wind power at a moderate wind speed. Testing of a prototype wind-powered RO desalination system constructed on Coconut Island, a small island off the windward coast of Oahu, Hawaii, indicated that at an average wind speed of 8.5 m/s, a freshwater flow of over 4000 L/d can be produced.

The combined effect of aeration and rapid sand filtration, which are commonly applied in groundwater treatment, was studied in a pilot plant. Pesticide degradation was performed on laboratory scale. It was found that addition of 2 mg/L H2O2 prior to aeration improved the removal of iron without hindering the filtration processes of manganese removal and nitrification. Under these conditions, the laboratory-scale tests showed pesticide degradations of up to 80% (influent concentration 1.6-2.5 μg/L). Dosing 8.5 mg/L H2O2 all selected pesticides were converted more than 80%. However, this dose appeared to have an adverse effect on the removal of iron and manganese and the nitrification process. This is attributed to the presence of relatively high concentrations H2O2 in the water entering the rapid sand filter. By filtration AOC, formed during oxidation with the low H2O2 dose, was reduced from about 70 μg/L to about 15-20 μg Acetate-C/L. Bromate formation did not occur. Residual H2O2 varied from 0.1-0.2 mg/L (2 mg/L H2O2 dose) to 0.2-0.4 mg/L (8.5 mg/L H2O2 dose) which is higher than the proposed guideline of 0.019 mg/L.</jats:p>",

The MFA shows that energy use is the most significant environmental impact of the three studied drinking water systems, but there are no considerable differences in energy use comparing central physical-chemical treatment and local membrane filtration. According to the MRA, the conventional system might not reduce the microbial risks sufficiently, but such a reduction can not confidently be achieved in a one-step ultrafiltration system either, since membrane filter integrity can hardly be guaranteed over the service life of the equipment. A quite costly two-step membrane filtration system, where water for all household purposes passes microfiltration and further reverse osmosis for drinking and cooking, seems to fulfil this criterion. On the other hand, this system does not reduce the microbial risks from ingestion of water from showers compared with the one-step ultrafiltration alternative. In order to achieve drinking water systems with sufficient microbial barriers and with reasonable costs for operation, a promising solution seems to be a combination of one-step membrane filtration and other methods e.g. biological treatment.</jats:p>",

In the first barrier, that was operated under anaerobic conditions with sucrose and ethanol as auxiliary substrates, TCE was completely converted to lower chlorinated metabolites, predominantly cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE). The reductive dechlorination process was stable for about 300 d, although the concomitant sulphate-reducing and methanogenic processes varied considerably. In the second barrier, that was operated with addition of hydrogen peroxide and nitrate, dechlorination was limited by a lack of oxygen and restricted mainly to CB biodegradation. Additional aerobic batch tests revealed that the metabolites of anaerobic TCE dechlorination, i.e. cis-DCE and vinyl chloride, were oxidatively dechlorinated in the presence of suitable auxiliary substrates such as ethene, CB, benzene, or sucrose and ethanol. During periods of low biological activity, elimination of TCE and CB occurred by adsorption in the GAC barriers. The pre-sorbed pollutants were available for subsequent biodegradation resulting in a bioregeneration of the activated carbon barriers.</jats:p>",

The removal efficiency was analysed at Malmö wastewater treatment plant in Sweden. The pilot plant separated biological floc from a Kaldnes Moving Bio-Bed Reactor (MBBR). The efficiency of the separation was analysed by measurements of suspended solids in the influent and the effluent. Air content was measured inside the tank and in the re-cycle. The result showed that basically two flow structures existed; the stratified and the short-circuit flow structure. The stratified flow structure seemed correlated to efficient separation of particles while the short-circuit flow structure seemed to have a negative effect, especially when the flow structure was affected by varying the re-cycle rate, i.e. the air content. Conclusively, the flow structure seemed to be correlated to type of flow structure. However, studies with higher concentration of suspended solids for verification were suggested.</jats:p>",

Among the various reflections and initiatives aimed at finding such a new balance, we focused on the experience of a Quebec (Canada) hospital adopting a hybrid version of the stockless system, under which the distributor supplied high‐volume products for the patient care unit in case quantities, leaving the institution’s central stores to break down bulk purchases of low‐volume products into point‐of‐use format (eaches). The study reveals marginal benefits from the hybrid method for both the institution and the distributor. However, it also reveals the importance of the manufacturer’s role with respect to packing formats, and demonstrates that the rearrangement of storage areas can generate substantial savings, opening the way to means for improving the healthcare sector supply chain.</jats:p>",

This inductive case study of six customer cases of Nokia Networks, one of the leading providers of mobile telecommunication technology, led to propositions exploring that question. Good relationship between the customer and the supplier contributes to reliable information flows, and reliable demand information flows in turn contribute to high efficiency—these are well‐researched issues also in other industry environments. But in a fast‐growing systems business such as mobile telecommunications industry, the supplier needs to be able to adapt its offering to a wide variety of customer situations and needs. Understanding the customer’s situation and need together with the right offering contributes to good co‐operation in improving the joint demand chain, which further leads to superior demand chain efficiency and high customer satisfaction.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

PSI was found to be more effective in the coagulation and removal in comparison with PAC. The flocs formed by PSI could be settled more quickly than those by PAC and, therefore, the size of sedimentation facilities can be reduced by the introduction of PSI. PSI was able to produce filtered water with low turbidity and colour. The number of phytoplankton cells in the filtered water of PSI was smaller than that of PAC. Most of the residual flocs in the settled water were trapped in the coarse layer of anthracite, and this result suggested that a higher rate of filtration can be achieved with PSI by increasing particle size of the filter media.</jats:p>",

In a laboratory study using natural (tubewell) water, ferric chloride salt and alum were used, which are the most studied and widely used flocculents in water treatment due to their low price, comfortable availability and low risk usability. The solubility of arsenate(III) is much more than arsenite(V). Arsenate(III) was converted into arsenite(V) by proper oxidation using bleaching powder as an oxidizing agent before coagulation. The concentrations of ferric chloride salt and alum dose were varied from 10 mg/l to 200 mg/l, and pH was varied from 4 to 9. After intensive investigation, it was found that at pH 7 and for 100 mg/l to 125 mg/l dose of alum, the removal efficiency of arsenic and iron were around 82 to 86% and 92 to 95% respectively. Again, the optimum removal of arsenic and iron were around 90 to 93% and 97 to 100% respectively at pH 7 for 200 mg/l of ferric chloride salt. This research was carried out not only to observe the removal efficiency of arsenic, but also iron. Because most of the tubewells in Bangladesh, sometimes, contain higher amount of iron.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the performance and optimization of a hybrid sorption-membrane process using powdered activated carbon (PAC) and submerged-style membranes for odor control. Specifically, this study focused on the removal of 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) from a Lake Michigan source water and investigated the effects of PAC dose, dosing method, backwash interval, and aeration. Adsorption performance was predicted using a mathematical model, and tested using a pilot-scale, submerged membrane system. Modeling continuously dosed PAC performance agreed well with pilot results, but pulse dosed PAC performance was overestimated by the model. Non-ideal mixing effects were identified as important factors in explaining the pulse dosing results. Pilot results with aeration and pulse dosing were also overestimated by the model. It is hypothesized that aeration disturbs the PAC cake layer that forms on the membrane, and thus eliminates the beneficial effects that this cake layer can have on adsorption. Extending backwash intervals from 30 to 180 minutes with continuous dosing increased the percent removal of 2-MIB by up to 30% in both the model predictions and pilot results. This study highlights some important considerations in the design of full-scale systems and future mathematical models.</jats:p>",

The MBR culture was found to be dominated almost entirely by Sphingomonas, belonging to the a-4 subclass of the a-Proteobacteria.

It then describes the measures that have been taken that seek to reconcile these, including different forms of “user participation” and greater reliance on informal reselling of water to improve provision to low-income households. This demonstrates how most “participation” is about transferring costs from water companies to low-income households. It also highlights how relying on informal resellers may constrain the extension of better-quality services to low-income neighbourhoods and how community-based schemes fail to raise the capital needed to extend water mains to unserved peripheries. Whilst many participatory schemes can, under certain conditions, help towards the aim of ensuring wider access to water, they are in no way a miracle solution and there is a considerable risk of institutionalizing two-tier services which lock low-income groups into more inconvenient, poor-quality services. </jats:p>",

To achieve adjustable constant relative humidities in the air, the two-pressure principle was used. This method involved saturating the air at a higher pressure, and then passing the air through a pressure release valve to the lower working pressure to achieve the desired humidity, while controlling the temperature to the desired level. The absolute pressure when the saturation is achieved determines the humidity of the final air. Standard design procedures were followed to ensure the air approached saturation in the pressurized column and that the amount of water was sufficient to make sure the columns would not run out of water during an experiment. The problems encountered included a pressure fluctuation coming from the compressor through the pressure regulator, and a regular fluctuation in the temperature of the water, within a 90 min period, when the water temperature was used to control the air temperature exiting the column. These problems were overcome by using two-pressure regulators on the air supply and by controlling the temperature of the water rather than the air temperature. The result was a stable but adjustable temperature and relative humidity air supply.</jats:p>",

Filtrations were conducted with a cross-flow filtration unit and hydrodynamic operating conditions were controlled by a J0/k ratio (the ratio of initial permeate flux [J0] to a back diffusional mass transfer coefficient [k]). A four-parameter (the apparent mass transfer coefficient [ka], the solute concentration near the membrane surface [Cm], the solute permeability [Pm], and the reflection coefficient (σ) model based on concentration polarization and irreversible thermodynamics was used to manipulate experimental results quantitatively. With the values of the determined parameters, the transport characteristics of NOM due to different solution chemistries such as pH and ionic strength through UF/NF membrane pores were investigated. This model was also used to demonstrate the effects of NOM structure (hydrophobic/transphilic/hydrophilic) on transport through the membranes, with XAD-8/4 resins fractionation and isolation procedures. Four parameters estimated through the model were revealed to be relevant to elucidate the behaviors of NOM in membranes and corresponding transport-related results were in good agreement with the theoretical descriptions related to the interactions between NOM molecules and membrane surface/pores.</jats:p>",

We measured responses to supplemental feeding in a wide array of breeding parameters to gauge their relative sensitivity to food supply, and thus their potential as indicators of natural foraging conditions. Conventional measures of success (hatching, fledging and overall productivity) were more effective as indicators of food supply than behavioural attributes such as courtship feeding, chick provisioning rates and sibling aggression. However, behaviour such as nest relief during incubation and adult attendance with older chicks were also highly responsive to supplemental food and may be useful for monitoring environmental conditions in studies of shorter duration. On average, the chick‐rearing stage contained more sensitive indicators of food availability than prelaying or incubation stages. Overall, rates of hatching and fledging success, and the mean duration of incubation shifts were the most food‐sensitive parameters studied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organic products form a growing segment of the food market. Recent estimates speak about market shares between 1 to 4.25 per cent. In Belgium the share is only 1 per cent, but the market is growing exponentially. Organic farmers in Belgium often have to sell their products as conventional products because of non‐efficient marketing systems. Marketing problems are also mentioned as one of the main reasons by conventional farmers for not converting. Most conventional farmers are not only rather sceptical about the long‐term perspectives of getting a price premium for organic products, but consider the organisation of the supply chain as one of the main sources of uncertainty and therefore as a constraint for conversion. Therefore more efforts should be made to organise the supply chain for organic products. The problem seems to be that of the egg and the chicken: for a cost‐effective supply chain a condition is to have enough producers, while for a lot of producers a cost‐effective swupply chain seems to be a necessary condition to convert, mainly because of high transaction costs linked to non‐efficient marketing.</jats:p>",

Using data from surveys of day laborers in Tokyo and Los Angeles, we analyze the unique characteristics of these two markets, comparing and contrasting the workers, the demand for their employment, and the spatial dimensions of this industry. We find that day laborers in Los Angeles are predominantly young, recent immigrants undertaking varied jobs. In contrast, day laborers in Tokyo are aging and mostly native Japanese displaced from Japan’s slouching post-industrial economy. Demand for day labor is equally contrasting. In Los Angeles, employers are more diversified, associated with a network of industries, and a consumer base that is broad and elastic. On the other hand, employers in Tokyo are overwhelmingly in construction and day laborers only cater to sub-contractors or middlemen. We speculate on the future of day labor in both cities. </jats:p>",

Based on the extant literature, we frame structure in three dimensions—formalization, centralization, and complexity. As an underlying methodology, we first conduct the within‐case analysis and then expand the analysis to cross‐case context. The three structural dimensions affect one another progressively, and the cost consideration appears to be the overarching force that shapes the supply‐network structure.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Potentiometric titrations were carried out, first, to determine the acid-base properties of both polymers and, secondly, to determine the stability constants of the MA and MA2 complex species formed. Metal complexation was also studied using differential pulse polarography. The complexing capacity of each polyacid for the metal ions under study was determined at pH 6.0, 5.0 and 4.0 and the ionic strength was 0.1 or 1.0 mol l-1. The conditional stability constants were estimated assuming that only 1:1 complex species were formed. The results obtained by both methods agree and are complementary.

It is shown that an anticipated simultaneous increase in government expenditure in both member countries leads to a short-run fall in output and to temporary divergences in output developments. From the perspective of the country with the lower wage flexibility the output differential is positive in the short-run. In the course of the subsequent adjustment process the relative cyclical position is reversed. The difference between the two member country outputs changes its sign due to changes in the internal and external terms of trade. Similar results hold with a simultaneous reduction of labor extra-costs in both countries. Compared with a symmetric increase in government expenditure the development of the output differential is essentially opposite in sign. </jats:p>",

As shown by investigations on a large-scale installation at Lake Constance Water Supply, this procedure reliably reduces suspended solids by at least 2-3 powers of ten in long-term use. However, the high efficacy of Fe(III)-assisted filtration cannot be explained on the basis of known coagulation mechanisms (like adsorption-charge neutralization, co-precipitation). Instead, the essential step was found to be the conditioning of the filter medium by coating it with colloids containing Fe(OH)3, and this “Fe coating” process occurs only in the presence of alkaline earths (especially Ca2+). According to further experiments, the enhanced solid-liquid separation was ultimately traced to chemical interactions such as the formation of calcium-organic association structures between the iron hydroxides and other solids. For design of Fe(III)-assisted filtration steps, finally, a βCa/DOC ratio above 40 mg.mg-1 and pre-oxidation with ozone dosages not exceeding 2 mg O3/mg DOC was recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Observations of tailward cold O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> beams (COBs) in the distant lobe/mantle shed new light upon plasma supply mechanisms to the magnetotail since their location up to a tailward distance of 210 <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>E</jats:italic></jats:sub> is not explicable with a conventional view of magnetospheric dynamics. The COBs exist primarily in the mantlelike regions that correspond to the transport route of magnetic flux tubes reconnected at the dayside magnetopause, and thus it has been suggested that these high‐energy COBs in the distant lobe/mantle have originated from trapped O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions in the dayside magnetosphere. In order to examine the validity of this scenario the phase space density (PSD) of the COBs observed by Geotail is compared statistically with that of mirroring O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions around the cusp observed by FAST at low altitudes (400–4200 km) utilizing particle trajectory tracings in empirical magnetospheric models. The energy distribution of the averaged peak PSD of COBs is different at energies below and above ∼1 keV and thus suggests that more than one source contributes to the COBs. The mirroring O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> increases in quantity with increasing solar activity and suggest increment of trapped O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> ions in the dayside magnetosphere. A statistical comparison shows that the O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> PSD around the low‐altitude cusp is similar to that of COBs above ∼1 keV, while the COB PSD is typically higher than that of O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> at FAST at energies &lt;∼1 keV. These results suggest that the trapped O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in the dayside magnetosphere is a potential source of COBs at energies above 1 keV, while for COBs below 1 keV, polar O<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> outflows from the cusp/cleft regions are the most probable source, as suggested by a conventional view.</jats:p>",
