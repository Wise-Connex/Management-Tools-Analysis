      "abstract": "<p>Credit in medieval England was obtained in various ways, either through a deferred payment or through cash loans. All these transactions were efforts to maintain production and consumption at its previous level or for investment purposes. During this period, the majority of the transactions arose from the need to obtain goods or services or to discharge an obligation at a time when immediate full cash payments from that individual's own resources were impossible or inadvisable. In the medieval period, full payment in cash was impossible as societies during this period did not have regular monetary income. Thus, in such societies, debtors accrue their needs through credit and they were not obliged to make immediate cash payments from their own resources whenever they obtained goods or services. This chapter examines credit supply during this period with emphasis on the willingness of the creditors to lend or sell goods and services on credit. It examines the effects of dearth and high prices, coin shortage or money supply, and crisis mortality on the credit supply of medieval Europe.</p>",

Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology however enables various organizations along the supply chain to share information regarding specific products and easily remotely manage internal inventory levels. These applications are only a sample of what RFID is able to accomplish for the integrated supply chain, and this chapter seeks to explore those applications. </jats:p>"

Documented evidence shows that doctors are concentrated in cities and rural Australians have relatively poor access; and there is heavy reliance on the recruitment of foreign doctors. We suggest that besides training more local doctors, policy-making should include innovations to resolve the supply imbalance such as physician assistants and community pharmacy care in areas where access to general practitioners is often limited.\n</jats:p>"

These practices may be either distant or integrated with upstream or downstream partners. The other component of the study made it possible to identify four operational competencies â i.e. cost, delivery, logistic services, and design. It was observed that the group with the most highly integrated supply practices mastered an operational competency in logistic services.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The limited size of the sample and its regional character may limit the generalization of results.

Using the results of an empirical study, the paper provides a better understanding of the relationship between supply chain management practices and the development of operational competencies.

In addition, it includes the approaches of supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model, which was developed by the Supply Chain Council and is recognised as a diagnostic tool for SCM worldwide. This chapter also summarises the literature of performance control and risk issues in SCM and the SCOR Model and discusses a proposed framework for the future research. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Supply Chain Management (SCM) has proven to be an effective tool that aids companies in the development of competitive advantages. SCM Systems are relied on to manage warehouses, transportation, trade logistics and various other issues concerning the coordinated movement of products and services from suppliers to customers. Although in todayâs fast paced business environment, numerous supply chain solution tools are readily available to companies, choosing the right SCM software is not an easy task. The complexity of SCM systems creates a multifaceted issue when selecting the right software, particularly in light of the speed at which technology evolves. In this paper, we use the approach of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine which SCM software best meets the needs of a company. The AHP approach outlined in this paper can be easily transferred to the comparison of other SCM software packages.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This article develops a dynamic game model of a supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer to study the coordination mechanism and the effect of demand disruption on the coordination mechanism, where the market demand is sensitive to retail price and service. We assume that the supplier and the retailer only know the distribution of the disrupted amount after the demand disruption and they share the quantity deviation costs. We find that an all-unit wholesale quantity discount-subsidy mechanism can coordinate the supply chain. We give the coordination mechanism of the supply chain after the demand disruption and find that the demand disruption remarkably influences the price-service level decisions of the centralized supply chain and the coordination mechanism of the decentralized supply chain. In particular, the expected quantity differs from the planned quantity although the penalty costs prevent from this deviation.</p>",

Simulation and analysis have been performed using System Dynamics, non-linear dynamics and control theory. The findings suggest that destructive oscillations of inventory could be generated by internal decision making practices. A management microworld has been developed allowing managers to experiment with different decision policies and learn how the supply chain performs.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Application of supply chain management tools and techniques may not lead us very far in implementing them and yielding the benefits of relationship without understanding the partner's selection criterion. While there is plenty of published literature that explains or espouses benefits of partnering relationship there is a relative lack of empirical studies examining the partner selection practices in the context of different countries. The purpose of this paper is to understand the supply chain partner selection criterion of supply chain members of United Arab Emirates for successful collaboration, alignment and integration of the businesses. In order to study the partner selection criterion various perspectives of supply chain management practices and criterion of partner selection are grouped under five perspectives of partnership as characteristics, economics, dynamic capabilities, technology, and institutions and a survey instrument was developed to evaluate the criterion of the partner selection. The study results suggest that customer and suppliers do not appear willing to embrace the long-term relationship concept readily. The business environment such as market dynamics, globalization process and economy of the specific country or region has a bigger impact on partner selection process. The research results provide a rich basis for further theory development in the areas of supply chain practices in transition economic environment and the global supply chain management practices beyond the United Arab Emirates market. </jats:p>",

Increasing technical possibilities, new forms of outsourcing, the ongoing integration of business processes, the expansion of value chains, the emergence of new markets and new players; they affect the infrastructure and underlying ICT standards. Contrary to the inherent stability one might expect from standards, maintenance of and change in standards are rule rather than exception. The benefit of standards change is sometimes obvious. However, it can also pose severe problems (e.g. heavy switching costs and reduced market transparency). This chapter synthesizes research findings on standards change. A conceptual framework is developed to determine under which circumstances standards change is avoidable; if so, in what manner; and if not, which means exist to reduce the negative impact of change. While some change drivers are innovation- related, others stem from the standardization activity itself. They require distinct coping strategies: change control and quality control, respectively. Along these two lines, the chapter discusses strategies to cope with the impact of standards change.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With specific reference to information and communication technologies (ICT), this Chapter examines the structural relationship of various stakeholder groups to standardization, described both in terms of how different stakeholders demand and acquire standards and in terms of their corresponding motivations and/or capabilities to influence the standardization process. To this end, the Chapter will explore these dynamics in the context of âbusiness modelsâ, an emerging framework in the innovation context that describes commercial and organisational topologies for the supply and demand of goods and services from the perspective of how value is created and exchanged. Given the increasing synergy between many ICT standards and specific product and service environments, it will be shown how the business model is also potentially a useful device for understanding evolution in the supply and demand dynamics of standardization.</jats:p>"

The chapter is based primarily on FAOSTAT, i.e. the statistical database of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2008), which provides country-/global-level estimates of crop production, area harvested, yield, exports, imports and consumption since 1961. However, it provides no hint of the situation at the sub-national, district and importantly household level.</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We develop and test a theory of the supply side of third party conflict management. Building on an existing formal model of mediation (Kydd 2003), we consider several factors that increase the pool of potential neutral mediators and the frequency of mediatorsâ efforts to manage interstate conflicts. First, we argue that democratic mediators face greater audience costs for deception in the conflict management process because the media in democratic states is more likely to uncover attempts by democratic mediators to provide false information. Second, we argue that information in the global mediation marketplace becomes more accurate as the international system becomes more democratic because there is a wider network of vigilant free presses, which increases the costs of deception for potential mediators. Third, as disputantsâ ties to international organizations increase, this also raises the costs that mediators incur for dishonesty in the conflict management process because these institutions provide more frequent and accurate information about the disputantsâ capabilities and resolve. Empirical analyses of data on contentious issues (1816-2001) provide support for our theory, with third party conflict management occurring more frequently if a potential mediator is a democracy, and as the average global democracy level and the number of shared IO memberships between disputants rises. We also find that powerful states serve as mediators more often, and that trade ties, alliances, issue salience, and distance influence third party decisions to mediate.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every finished product has gone through a series of transformations. The process begins when manufacturers purchase the raw materials that will be transformed into the components of the product. The parts are then supplied to a manufacturer, who assembles them into the finished product and ships the completed item to the consumer. The transformation process includes numerous activities (Levary, 2000). Among them are â¢ Designing the product â¢ Designing the manufacturing process â¢ Determining which component parts should be produced in house and which should be purchased from suppliers â¢ Forecasting customer demand â¢ Contracting with external suppliers for raw materials or component parts â¢ Purchasing raw materials or component parts from suppliers â¢ Establishing distribution channels for raw materials and component parts from suppliers to manufacturer â¢ Establishing of distribution channels to the suppliers of raw materials and component parts â¢ Establishing distribution channels from the manufacturer to the wholesalers and from wholesalers to the final customers â¢ Manufacturing the component parts â¢ Transporting the component parts to the manufacturer of the final product â¢ Manufacturing and assembling the final product â¢ Transporting the final product to the wholesalers, retailers, and final customer Each individual activity generates various data items that must be stored, analyzed, protected, and transmitted to various units along a supply chain. A supply chain can be defined as a series of activities that are involved in the transformation of raw materials into a final product, which a customer then purchases (Levary, 2000). The flow of materials, component parts, and products is moving downstream (i.e., from the initial supply sources to the end customers). The flow of information regarding the demand for the product and orders to suppliers is moving upstream, while the flow of information regarding product availability, shipment schedules, and invoices is moving downstream. For each organization in the supply chain, its customer is the subsequent organization in the supply chain, and its subcontractor is the prior organization in the chain. </jats:p>"

The information systems needed to monitor all of these activities are a critical part of the mix.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The key part of dynamic supply chain management is negotiating with suppliers and with buyers. Designing efficient business processes throughout the supply chain, and controlling their speed, timing, and interaction with one another, is decisive factors in a competitive and dynamic environment. Coordination is essential for successful supply chain management. Therefore, in this chapter, a novel Negotiation-to-Coordinate (N2C) mechanism is proposed to explore the interactive nature of the buyersupplier relationships for dynamic environments. The proposed N2C mechanism uses prioritized fuzzy constraints to represent trade-offs among the different probable values associated with the negotiation issues and to signify how agents should make concessions. Supervisor agent in the N2C mechanism takes into account the conflicts of interest of buyerâs agent and supplierâs agent and the proposal and plan generated by supervisor agents helps in resolving the true and potential conflicts of interests for buyerâs agent and supplierâs agent. The proposed computational framework based on fuzzy constraints is suited for capturing the dynamics by modeling trade-offs between different attributes of a product leading to a fair and equitable deal for both suppliers and buyers. The proposed approach models the intricacies in the face of the imprecise, uncertain and conflicting nature of objectives. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an illustrative example. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Integrated Supply Chain Management (ISCM) involves the linking of suppliers and customers with the internal business processes of an organization. ISCM solutions allow organizations to automate workflows concerning the execution and analysis of planning, sourcing, making, delivering, returns handling, and maintenance, to name but a few. Many of todayâs ISCM systems use primarily Web technology as the supporting infrastructure. Undoubtedly, the electronic (Internet-based) ISCM systems deliver the enterprises with a competitive advantage by opening up opportunities to streamline processes, reduce costs, increase customer patronage, and enable thorough planning abilities. However, there has been significant customer backlash concerning the inability of software vendors to deliver easy integration and promised functionality. Although various researchers have suggested strategies to overcome some of the failures in operating ISCM systems, there appears to be a lacunae in terms of architectural investigations in the analysis stage. The methodology proposed in this chapter seeks to resolve these gaps and provides a fundamental framework for analyzing ISCM systems. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter introduces a game-theoretic approach to supply chain risk management. The focus of this study lies on the risk of a single supply chain member defecting from common supply chain agreements, thereby jeopardizing the overall supply chain performance. The chapter goes on to introduce a manual supply chain game, by which dynamic supply chain mechanisms can be simulated and further analyzed using a game-theoretic model. With the help of the game-theoretic model, externalities are identified that negatively impact supply chain efficiency. The conclusion drawn from this chapter is that incentives are necessary to overcome these externalities in order to align supply chain objectives. The authors show that the game-theoretic model, in connection with the supply chain game presented, provides an informative basis for the future development of incentives by which supply chains can be aligned in order to reduce supply chain risks. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RFID (radio frequency identification) technology can be expressed in the most universal manner as wireless identi- fication technology, which does not need the line-of-sight to be read or written. It offers enhancement of identification technologies like barcode technology. Optical barcode technology was developed in 1948 by Silver and Woodland at Drexel Institute of Technology and first commercially used in 1966 (Adams, 2002). Barcode technology stores data in the widths and spacings of printed parallel lines, or in patterns of dots, concentric circles, and hidden within images. The most extended is UPC code which was invented in 1973 and since then became everyday part of our life. Other commonly used types of barcodes are Code 128, Code 93 (Groover, 1980) and DataMatrix 2D barcode. At this time, mostly the barcodes are keeping inventory and shipments moving. RFID and barcode technology complement each other because both of them are beneficial in different situations and can be used together in many applications. RFID technology has several advantages for managing and collecting objectâs data or tracking it as it moves through the supply chain (SC). Two of them are related to the increased abilities of security and reliability of the identification systems. These two properties of identification technologies are equally important for their use in supply chain management (SCM). The purpose of this chapter is to highlight selected areas of this technology that may be critical specific aspects of further RFID development and applications. We have also discussed about differences between RFID and barcode technologies especially in terms of their use in SCM and concluded this article with expectations of further development of this still progressive technology. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>The promotion of electric energy production from solid biomass by the  Austrian government has lead to a boom in the construction of new  combined heat and power plants. The current total demand for wood chips  in the research area for energy purposes is 70 400 m of  loose volume chips per year. The expected increase in demand due to  these new plants is more than 4 times greater than current demand: up to  302 700 m of loose volume per year. Even if the energy wood  feedstock potential is satisfactory, the design of the supply chain is  still unresolved. The aim of this study is to give decision-makers a  base for further development. To accomplish this, we designed and tested  four different supply scenarios: one for 9 plants and one for 16  plants. The scenarios were developed using a combination of geographic  information systems (GIS) and linear programming methods. The results  indicate that direct transport of solid fuel wood as round wood and  chipping at the plant is the cheapest supply system with a resulting  cost of 5.6Ã¢ÂÂ6.6 EUR/m loose. Using harvesting residues can  only be recommended for large plants because of poor fuel quality. In  this case, residues would be chipped at or near the landing, piled and  transported via self-loading trucks at a cost between 8.4 and 9.1 EUR/m loose. In order to meet increasing demand and to ensure a continuous  supply, especially during the winter and spring seasons it is necessary  to optimize the supply chain by including storage terminals. However,  using terminals and increased demand both lead to higher logistical  costs. For example, if the total volume is handled via terminals, the  average supply costs including storage will increase by 26%. Higher  demand increases the costs by 24%.<ja:sup>3</ja:sup><ja:sup>3</ja:sup><ja:sup>3</ja:sup><ja:sup>3</ja:sup></ja:p>"

It discusses various constraints of present-day supply chain systems resulting from their roots being in logistics management and suggests an alternative next-level paradigm of a customer-centric matrix model. This chapter further demonstrates how this model would add value to the customer by taking the example of a healthcare information management system. The chapter also delves into the limitations of and anticipated issues and challenges in implementing the suggested model. Finally, the chapter hints at some broad directions for future research and action in the field. Emergent behavior is what happens when an interconnected system of relatively simple elements begins to self-organize to form a more intelligent and more adaptive higher-level system (Johnson, 2001). </jats:p>"

Intangibles are defined as factors that have an impact on the selection of an appropriate supplier but are not easily quantified to be included in the financial evaluation. These intangibles are classified as the benefits and risks of using a supplier to perform the outsourcing function. A decision maker has certain expectations regarding these intangibles and a loss occurs when a supplier's performance does not meet the decision maker's expectations. The Taguchi loss function has been selected as a means of measuring the loss. The decision maker defines the target value and the specification limits for each benefit and risk category. The weighted loss scores are calculated where the weights are the importance ratings assigned to benefit/risk categories by the decision maker. Based on this analysis each supplier will receive a weighted loss score for all the pertinent benefit categories and one weighted loss score for all the risk categories. To achieve a single measure, the aforementioned weighted loss scores are combined to determine a single aggregate loss score for each supplier, which is then used to rank them. The supplier who receives the highest ranking (minimum loss score) will be selected to perform the outsourcing function.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The procedure proposed here can help companies to identify the best supplier to perform an outsourcing function.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper presents a phased decision model that begins with economic evaluation and then uses Taguchi functions to measure the impact of intangibles.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

From this definition, a supply chain includes three sub-systems: procurement, production, and distribution. The overall performance of a supply-chain is influenced significantly by the decisions taken in its production-distribution plan. A production-distribution plan excludes the procurement activities and integrates the decisions in production, transport and warehousing as well as inventory management. Hence, one key issue in the performance evaluation of a supply network is the modeling and optimization of production-distribution plan considering its actual complexity. This paper develops a mixed integer formulation for a two-echelon supply network that expands the previously reported production-distribution models through the integration of Aggregate Production Plan and Distribution Plan as well as considering the real-world variables and constraints. A Genetic Algorithm is designed for the optimization of the developed model. The methodology will be then implemented to solve a real-life problem incorporating multiple time periods, multiple products, multiple manufacturing plants, multiple warehouses and multiple end-users. To demonstrate the capability of the approach, the validation and performance evaluation of this model will be finally studied for the presented case study.</jats:p>",

This method uses only a subset of the scenarios, randomly sampled according to the distribution over scenarios, to represent the full scenario space. An important theoretical justification for this method is that as the number of scenarios sampled increases, the solution to the approximate problem converges to an optimal solution in the expected sense. The computational results are presented for two cases. First target level is chosen as a decision variable and then order size is chosen as a decision variable of the problem. The target level strategy is based on making inventory for each echelon; in its turn order strategy is based on determination of optimal order quantity, which is independent from scenarios. However target level strategy provides high service at low cost, but it offers less reality under uncertain demand than order strategy. Practical experiments on finding the optimal SAA parameters are presented in the paper and as well as the analysis of their impact on solution quality.</jats:p>",

In particular, the application of mobile technology in Supply Chain Management has drawn widespread attention from researchers and practitioners who endorse adaptive and agile supply chain processes. This chapter discusses the applications of mobile technologies in various areas of supply chain management and the potential benefits of those technologies along the dimensions of reduced replenishment time and transactions and billing cycles. Among other discussions, the role of mobile procurement, inventory management, product identification, package tracking, sales force, and field service automation technologies is highlighted. To substantiate the basis for adopting mobile technologies for supply chain management, different market drivers for mobile applications are exemplified and applied to the three macro-level processes of supplier relationship management, internal supply chain management, and customer relationship management; a resulting typology of mobile supply chain management applications is presented. </jats:p>"

We present a case on a leading Chinese manufacturer of industrial valves named Valvex that successfully integrated the ERP systems from Entreplan and the SCM system from Excelvision. The project improved the operations at Valvex and resulted in many benefits. This chapter describes the implementation of the e-SCM system at Valvex and its integration with the existing ERP system. The process of implementation and integration was marked by many challenges, and some of them were unique to a Chinese manufacturing organization. Using several smart strategies the project team was able to overcome these challenges and complete the project successfully. Several lessons can be learned from the experience of Valvex which may be useful for organizations that plan to undertake similar projects.</jats:p>"

SCM Systems are relied on to manage warehouses, transportation, trade logistics and various other issues concerning the coordinated movement of products and services from suppliers to customers. Although in todayâs fast paced business environment, numerous supply chain solution tools are readily available to companies, choosing the right SCM software is not an easy task. The complexity of SCM systems creates a multifaceted issue when selecting the right software, particularly in light of the speed at which technology evolves. In this paper, we use the approach of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine which SCM software best meets the needs of a company. The AHP approach outlined in this paper can be easily transferred to the comparison of other SCM software packages.</jats:p>"

From the perspective of the timber industry sector, this study is important because supply chain efficiency is a key component in an organisationâs strategy to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Strong improvement in supply chain performance is possible with improved B2B communication, which is used both for building trust and providing real-time marketing data. Traditional methods such as electronic data interchange (EDI), which are used to facilitate B2B communication, have a number of disadvantages such as high implementation and running costs and a rigid and inflexible messaging standard. Information and communications technologies (ICT) have supported the emergence of Web-based EDI which maintains the advantages of the traditional paradigm while negating the disadvantages. This has been further extended by the advent of the Semantic Web which rests on the fundamental idea that Web resources should be annotated with semantic markup that captures information about their meaning and facilitates meaningful machine-to-machine communication.</jats:p>"

Regulatory authorities are demanding stricter customer compliance, and customers are demanding real-time data for better decision making. At the same time, customer demand is becoming more erratic thus the need for enhanced supply chain coordination with an objective to enhance overall customer value. Radio Frequency Identification RFID, an enabler of supply chain visibility, has the potential to provide customers with large amounts of information at any point in the movement of goods through the supply chain. This technology complements the barcode technology. However, with the acceptance of RFID technology, several managerial and technical issues arise. The focus of this chapter is to thus discuss the relevance of RFID technology for enabling supply chain visibility and adoption related issues. introduCtion </jats:p>"

Online sales are a more efficient approach to the traditional catalog order method where dentists place orders with a salesperson, call in, or fax their orders. Online, as well as traditional marketing techniques have been incorporated into a marketing campaign to promote online sales. The process and challenges of marketing this Web site with a tight budget are discussed. Results of the first two years of marketing efforts are reported.</p>",

Therefore, we introduced a Petri Net-based formalism, and a reachability analysis-based algorithm that finds the optimum demand supply network for a user-specified product structure. The method has been implemented and is currently in production use inside all Nokia business groups. It is used in demand supply planning of both network elements and handsets. An example of the methodâs application to a concrete Nokia product is included. </jats:p>"

Although autonomous intelligent agents, or electronic robots (e-bots), can be used to inform this endeavor, the article advocates the development of e-sensors, i.e., software based units with capabilities beyond intelligent agentâs functionality. E-sensors are hardware-software capable of perceiving, reacting and learning from its interactive experience through the supply chain, rather than just searching for data and information through the network and reacting to it. E-sensors can help avoid the âbullwhipâ effect. The article briefly reviews the related intelligent agent and supply chain literature and the technological gap between fields. It articulates a demand-driven, sense-and-response system for sustaining e-collaboration and e-business operations as well as monitoring products and processes. As a proof of concept, this research aimed a test solution at a single supply chain partner within one stage of the process. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Internet has reached a stage of maturity where its innovative adoption and implementation can be a source of competitive advantage. Supply chains are one of the areas that has reportedly benefited greatly, achieving optimisation through low cost, high efficiency use of the Internet, almost seamlessly linking global supply chains into e-supply networks. This field is still in its academic and practical infancy, and there is a need for more empirical research to build a robust theoretical foundation, which advances our knowledge and understanding. Here, the main aims and objectives are to highlight the importance of information flows in e-supply chains/networks, and the need for their standardisation to facilitate integration, legality, security, and efficiency of operations. This chapter contributes to the field by recommending a three-stage framework enabling this process through the development of standardised Internet technology platforms (e-platforms), integration requirements and classification of information flows.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The researches of the anti-collision characters of a semi-submersible column and its capability of surviving in severe sea state after collision accident are completed in the paper. Three collision cases are designed. A 5000 ton vessel hits the semi-submersible column in transversal, longitudinal and oblique direction. Numerical simulation technique is used to do the analysis, and anti-collision characters of the semi-submersible column are summarized by the curves of collision force vs. penetration, the energy absorption proportion and structural damages. It can be pointed out that the column show a distinctive character when the contact surface is large at the beginning of the collision. There is no rupture of outer shell, which means the column can sustain such kind of collision. Taking advantage of the direct calculation method with finite element models, the global strength of the semi-submersible is verified to assess the influence of structure damage by the collision on the semiâs survival capability in severe sea state. The structure damage caused by the collision is taken into consideration in the FE models. The code SESAM is used to do the calculation through the design wave method. Several assumptions are made to realize the comparison between collision cases. It is found that the collision influence is restricted within the scope of structural components around the collision zone. The collision damage caused by the hitting of 5000 ton vessel will not bring a serious threat to the global strength capability of the semi-submersible.</jats:p>",

Although factors affecting business performance in manufacturing firms have been explored in the past, focuses are on financial performance and measurement, neglecting intangible and nonfinancial factors in the decision-making planning process. This study presents development of an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model. This model aids in allocating outsourcing and supply-chain resources pertinent to strategic planning by providing a satisfying solution. The model was developed based on the data obtained from a business firm producing intelligent home system devices. This developed model will reinforce a firmâs ongoing outsourcing strategies to meet defined requirements while positioning the supply-chain system to respond to a new growth and innovation. </jats:p>"

RFID for the supply chain (RFID/SC) has attracted global attention and the adoption pace is quickening. It has characteristics resembling that of a disruptive technology. To better understand RFID/SC, we use Christensenâs principles of disruptive technology and the motivation/ability framework to illustrate the uniqueness of RFID/SC. The principles provide valuable information for managers steering their RFID projects toward success. We provide cases studies as vignettes to support the applications of the theories. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to equip managers with the knowledge of disruptive technology in the context of RFID/SC, (2) to highlight the need to assess an organizationâs motivation and ability for adopting RFID/SC, and (3) to propose further research areas in RFID/SC in the IS field.</p>",

Hiring and retaining the next generation is now a top issue for the industry. Energy supply and demand is one of the critical issues facing this generation. While alternative energies and conservation may mitigate some of the supply and demand challenges, petroleum will play a major role in powering societies for the foreseeable future. To meet this challenge takes people. And not just any people. It takes talented, highly educated, and motivated engineers and scientists to find, develop, and produce hydrocarbons.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Recognizing this people challenge, the SPE Talent Council was formed in 2007 to provide a forum in which industry, academia, and nongovernmental organizations could collaborate on initiatives to increase the quantity and enhance the quality of talent available to our industry. This involves increasing the number of students interested in the energy industry, enhancing the quality of educational programs worldwide, and encouraging graduates to pursue a career in the oil and gas industry.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>To better understand what factors are important in the attraction and retention of young people, the SPE Talent Council had SPE Market Research conduct a survey of SPE members below the age of 35, who are not currently students. Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to 8,833 members in February and March 2008 and 1,711 (19.3%) responded. The distribution of the respondentsâ regions of origin is shown in Fig. 1.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>More than half of the respondents hold a minimum four-year university degree (52%), while another 40% hold master's degrees, and 7% have a doctorate. The most common university discipline is petroleum engineering at 46%, followed by mechanical engineering and chemistry/chemical engineering at 15% each. This discipline distribution is not surprising since those polled are all members of SPE. The next most common discipline for those who replied is geology at 5%. A multitude of disciplines make up the remaining 19%. Men are the overwhelming majority at 79% of the total.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increase of aero engines performance through the improvement of aerodynamic efficiency of main annulus flow is becoming more and more difficult to achieve. However there are still some devices that could be improved to enhance global engine efficiency. Particularly, investigations on the internal air cooling systems, may lead to a reduction of cooling air with a direct benefit to the overall performance. At the same time, further investigations on heat transfer mechanisms within turbine cavities may help to optimize cooling air flows saving engine life duration. This paper presents a CFD study aimed at the characterization of the effects of different geometries for cooling air supply within turbine cavities on wall thermal effectiveness and sealing mass flow rate. Several sealing air supply geometries were considered in order to point out the role of cooling air injection position, swirl number and jet penetration on the cavities sealing performance. The study was set up on a two-stage axial turbine rig developed in a research programme on internal air systems funded by EU (Main Annulus Gas Path Interactions - MAGPI). Steady state calculations were performed using two different computational domains: the first consists in a sector model of the whole turbine including the second stator well, while the second is a cut-down model of the stator well. Thanks to the simplified geometry of the test rig with respect to actual engines, the study has pointed out clear design suggestions regarding the effects of geometry modification of cooling air supply system.</jats:p>",

These SCM systems exist within the overall EA of the business. SCM systems are further influenced by the increasing modern- day need for information and communications technologies (ICTs) within a business, to bring together all of its disparate applications. The resultant enterprise application integration (EAI) also stands to benefit immensely from the incorporation of mobile technologies within it. Traditionally, supply chain management systems have involved management of the flows of material, information, and finances in a complex web of networks that include suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and customers. Thus, these traditional supply chain management systems have a great need for integration under the umbrella of EAI. Mobile technologies can provide time and location independence to these EAIs in terms of information in the supply chain systems, creating the possibility of multiple business processes that traverse diverse geographical regions. This chapter, based on the research conducted by the authors at the University of Western Sydney, discusses the opportunities that arise in supply chain management systems due to the time and location independence offered by mobility, and the resultant advantages and limitations of such integration to the business. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A district energy supply system for Almono, Pittsburgh has been studied by the Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics, Carnegie Mellon University. Almono is a mixed residential/commercial redevelopment proposed for a 178 acre brown field site on the banks of the Monongahela River in Pittsburgh, PA. The district energy supply system would provide electric power, cooling, and heating for the occupants and the buildings of the site and for possible additional energy based developments. The various energy requirements of Almonoâs proposed residential and commercial buildings for power, cooling, heating, and hot water have been estimated first based on Energy Information Administration data (1993), and then again on the advanced building code of the International Energy Conservation Code 2006 (IECC 2006). A comparison of these estimates highlights the importance of building envelopes on the energy requirements of the Almono development. The daily and seasonal load profiles for power, cooling, and heating that challenge efficient and economic operation of district energy supply have been developed. Various prime mover technologies for combined cooling/heating/power, CCHP, systems have been considered: gas turbine, internal combustion engine, and steam turbine. These technologies affect the choice of fuel, and the fractions of power and heat provided. The paper estimates loads of the Almono site based on the operation and performance of both conventional and advanced residential and commercial office buildings, suggests additional energy loads that would provide for improved technical and economic performance of system, and considers the selection of a fuel and the use of solar energy as the energy sources. It presents preliminary overall flow diagrams for various district energy supplies that include various possible fuel and solar energy inputs, and use of the river as a heat source/sink. It also comments on operation of the district energy supply to meet the hourly and seasonal energy loads of the Almono site.</jats:p>",

The authors also sought to differentiate pediatric from nonpediatric neurosurgical practitioners and compare the demographic and practice characteristics of these 2 groups. The term âpediatric practitionerâ will be used in this study to describe a practitioner whose practice is &gt; 75% pediatric patients in accordance with the American Board of Pediatric Neurological Surgery (ABPNS) requirements for board certification in pediatric neurosurgery.

A 30-question survey was then administered to all identified practitioners, and responses were collected for 6 months. Primary analysis of pediatric versus nonpediatric practitioners was performed. Subgroup analyses of the characteristics of the pediatric practitioners were also performed to identify the effects of practitioner age, sex, and practice setting on survey responses.</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A total of 342 practitioners received the survey, and 267 responded (78.1% response rate); 158 pediatric practitioners and 92 nonpediatric practitioners were identified. Seventeen respondents were excluded from analysis. Pediatric practitioners were more likely to be women, ABPNS certified, have completed a pediatric fellowship, do fewer operative cases per year, have a more frequent call schedule, practice in a freestanding children's hospital, be in academic practice, and in need of recruiting additional faculty. Pediatric practitioners spent fewer hours per week in patient care, and were less likely to have a productivity-based salary or salary incentive based on relative value unitâproduction. Among pediatric practitioners, American Board of Neurological Surgery and ABPNS certification rates differed significantly among age groups, with older age groups being more likely to be certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgery and ABPNS. The rate of pediatric fellowship completion was significantly higher in the younger age groups. Anticipating retirement by age 65 was significantly more likely in the younger age groups, and hours spent per week spent in teaching and administrative duties were lower in the younger age groups. There were 27 female and 131 male pediatric practitioners. The women were more likely to have completed a pediatric fellowship and performed fewer operative cases per year than the men. Nonacademic pediatric practitioners were more likely to have a relative value unitâbased salary incentive, be reimbursed for call coverage, and spend more hours per week in patient care than academic pediatric practitioners. Academic pediatric practitioners spent more hours per week in clinical research.</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The authors estimate that there are fewer than 200 pediatric neurosurgeons currently practicing in the United States. Current practice patterns unique to pediatrics may have important implications in recruiting and retaining the next generation of pediatric neurosurgeons.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Control samples were obtained at autopsy. The muscles were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and morphometry. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; The patientsâ palate muscles had a lower capillary density (PP 443 vs. 711 capillaries/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p &lt; 0.001, and UV 452 vs. 624 capillaries/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, p = 0.009), a lower number of capillaries related to an individual muscle fiber (PP 1.3 vs. 2.7, p = 0.003, and UV 1.0 vs. 1.9, p = 0.03) and a lower number of capillaries related to the fiber size (PP 0.9 vs. 2.1, p = 0.001, and UV 0.6 vs. 1.9, p = 0.002). &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Our results indicate that reduced capillary supply of palate muscles plays a pathophysiological role in long-term snorers and OSA. The cause of the low capillary supply is unclear, but neuromuscular injury due to repeated vibratory and stretch trauma of the soft palate during snoring is a plausible mechanism.</jats:p>"

While the line separating prostitution and sex trafficking is difficult to establish, there is ample evidence that both coâexist in the region. Understanding this phenomenon requires an exploration of both the demand and supply sides as well as their interaction. Such an exploration, it is hoped, will contribute to the positive development of policy and practice.</jats:p>",

Recent state and federal mandates require varying levels of ethanol in reformulated gasoline (RFG) and, consequently, new complexities are being introduced into what has to this point been a streamlined petroleum supply chain. As managers and researchers work to respond effectively in this fast evolving situation, this explorative study employs a grounded theory approach (GTA) methodology and identifies five strategic priorities associated with achieving large-scale use of ethanol in RFG as a renewable energy source. The insights presented here regarding ethanol and its infusion into the petroleum supply chain provide a necessary first step in setting strategic priorities in this arena.</jats:p>",

Owing to market liberalization and globalization, one of the most challenging issues along agriâfood chains in China is becoming the issue of how to link these smallâscale farmers into the modern chains. Consequently, it is essential for both policy makers and private sectors to understand the governance structure in agriâfood supply chains.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managing supply chains in todayâs complex, dynamic, and uncertain environment is one of the key challenges affecting the success of the businesses. One of the crucial determinants of effective supply chain management is the ability to recognize customer demand patterns and react accordingly to the changes in face of intense competition. Thus the ability to adequately predict demand by the participants in a supply chain is vital to the survival of businesses. Demand prediction is aggravated by the fact that communication patterns between participants that emerge in a supply chain tend to distort the original consumerâs demand and create high levels of noise. Distortion and noise negatively impact forecast quality of the participants. This work investigates the applicability of machine learning (ML) techniques and compares their performances with the more traditional methods in order to improve demand forecast accuracy in supply chains. To this end we used two data sets from particular companies (chocolate manufacturer and toner cartridge manufacturer), as well as data from the Statistics Canada manufacturing survey. A representative set of traditional and ML-based forecasting techniques have been applied to the demand data and the accuracy of the methods was compared. As a group, Machine Learning techniques outperformed traditional techniques in terms of overall average, but not in terms of overall ranking. We also found that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on multiple demand series produced the most accurate forecasts. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Institute for Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering at the Graz University of Technology is investigating thermal soil properties within a temperature range concerning e.g. the efficiency of remote heat supply pipes. Until now heat loss from the pipe is minimized by enlarging the polyurethane (PU) - insulation thickness around the pipe. An innovative method to minimize it could be the usage of thermally insulating bedding material. Conventional bedding sands cover all necessary soil mechanical properties, but have a high thermal conductivity of &amp;lambda; =1,5 - 1,7 W/(m K). A newly found bedding material &amp;ldquo;Thermosand&amp;rdquo; shows excellent thermal insulating properties of only &amp;lambda;=0,18 W/(m K) (dry) up to 0,88 W/(m K) (wet). To investigate the influence of varying moisture content on thermal conductivity a large scale model test was established, which provides a basis for developing numerical models regarding unsaturated soil mechanics with heat propagation, including the drying out of the soil during heat input. To interpret all measurements correctly, the thermal conductivity &amp;lambda; of the bedding materials is determined at different dry densities and water contents. The paper introduces a very sophisticated procedure for measuring the thermal conductivity &amp;lambda; with a new half space linear probe method. These tests were carried out in cooperation with the Chair of Geophysics, University of Leoben, Austria. With this system one can easily carry out repeated measurements under identical conditions and enlarge the accurateness and reliability of the results.</jats:p>"

I argue that countries provide civil nuclear assistance for three strategic reasons: to strengthen their allies and alliances, to strengthen their relationship with enemies of enemies, and to strengthen existing democracies and bilateral relationships with these countries (if the supplier is also a democracy). I test these arguments using statistical analysis and a new data set on more than 2,000 bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation agreements signed between 1950 and 2000. The findings offer robust empirical support for my argument and very little support for the competing explanation rooted in norms and nonproliferation. This article enhances scholarly understanding of how and why nuclear weapons spread and encourages further research on the supply side of nuclear proliferation. It also has broad implications for the literatures on norms and international cooperation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite growing public interest in organic foods, they still represent only a niche market. Identified hindrances to the growth of this market have shifted the research focus to the supply chains as a whole and the information or knowledge flow along them. This study examined knowledge sharing along two Finnish organic food supply chains from farmers at the one end to consumers at the other. The findings revealed that only a small portion of the knowledge needed by the actors along the chain was shared. The unshared knowledge and its partly embedded nature suggest a need for more interaction and open communication among the actors in order to change current practice and the culture within the chain. Horizontal collaboration among actors specialized in organic production might improve knowledge sharing with consumers and help to develop the currently scattered and controversial knowledge base on the potential added value of organic products. The paper emphasises the importance of a whole chain approach and gives suggestions for further research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a new concept for supporting electronic collaboration, operations, and relationships among trading partners in the value chain without hindering human autonomy. Although autonomous intelligent-agents, or electronic robots (e-bots), can be used to inform this endeavor, the paper advocates the development of e-sensors, i.e., software based units with capabilities beyond intelligent-agentâs functionality. E-sensors are hardware-software capable of perceiving, reacting and learning from its interactive experience thorough the supply chain, rather than just searching for data and information through the network and reacting to it. E-sensors can help avoid the âbullwhipâ effect. The paper briefly reviews the related intelligent-agent and supply-chain literature and the technological gap between fields. It articulates a demand-driven, sense-and-response system for sustaining e-collaboration and ebusiness operations as well as monitoring products and processes. As a proof of concept, this research aimed a test solution at a single supply-chain partner within one stage of the process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. This paper reports on the qualitative and quantitative screening of groundwater sources for integration into the public water supply system of the Algarve, Portugal. The results are employed in a decision support system currently under development for an integrated water resources management scheme in the region. Such a scheme is crucial for several reasons, including the extreme seasonal and annual variations in rainfall, the effect of climate change on more frequent and long-lasting droughts, the continuously increasing water demand and the high risk of a single-source water supply policy. The latter was revealed during the severe drought of 2004 and 2005, when surface reservoirs were depleted and the regional water demand could not be met, despite the drilling of emergency wells.  For screening and selection, quantitative criteria are based on aquifer properties and well yields, whereas qualitative criteria are defined by water quality indices. These reflect the well's degree of violation of drinking water standards for different sets of variables, including toxicity parameters, nitrate and chloride, iron and manganese and microbiological parameters. Results indicate the current availability of at least 1100 l sâ1 of high quality groundwater (55% of the regional demand), requiring only disinfection (900 l sâ1) or basic treatment, prior to human consumption. These groundwater withdrawals are sustainable when compared to mean annual recharge, considering that at least 40% is preserved for ecological demands. A more accurate and comprehensive analysis of sustainability is performed with the help of steady-state and transient groundwater flow simulations, which account for aquifer geometry, boundary conditions, recharge and discharge rates, pumping activity and seasonality. They permit an advanced analysis of present and future scenarios and show that increasing water demands and decreasing rainfall will make the water supply system extremely vulnerable, with a high risk of groundwater salinization and ecosystem degradation.\n                        </jats:p>"

After the review of studies in the field, the results of 3 empirical studies are presented. While the supply-side aspect of municipal e-government has been investigated within several studies, the view of external (citizens) and internal (municipal officials) users of municipal e-government have been rather neglected in the past, and the same is true for effects measured in this field. This chapter fills these gaps. The results revealed that municipal Web supply is poor, which is reflected in citizensâ satisfaction as well. Surprisingly, municipal officials are not well aware of possibilities e-government offers to them and to their customers. In addition, they believe that positive effects brought about the introduction of e-government are not significant, while among negative effects larger range of tasks, heavier workload, and increased complexity of tasks are stressed. At the end of the chapter key findings are summarized.</jats:p>"

A supply chain integrated life cycle assessment was carried out on fodder barley, hard cheese, oat flakes, potato flour, cream cheese potato gratin, beer, honey-marinated/sliced broiler fillet and greenhouse cucumber. Methodological improvements in assessing environmental impacts of food products were evaluated in relation to ISO14040 and 14044 standards. Methods improved, especially regarding quality of cultivation data and previously reported data from the literature, impact assessment and calculations for assessment of leaching from agriculture. As a generic conclusion on the share of contributions of the various phases of production chains to environmental impact: agriculture was the most important phase, especially in terms of eutrophication potential. Work in food LCA methodology has provided a sound base for future development in assessing environmental impacts of food products. In the future providing more and more environmental information on products for customers and consumers is setting new challenges for research.;</jats:p>"

There is a need for cost-effective and sustainable design and management of such data centers. From this perspective, evolutionary changes in the regulatory and operational climate of traditional electrical and energy utilities has created new opportunities for development of data centers with low TCO and environmental footprint. These opportunities primarily exist on developing unique supply-side architectures for delivery of power, water and other resources to service data centers. Concurrent emergence of smaller heat and power generating systems also provides novel options to create solutions that improve the reliability and scalability of supply-side infrastructures in data centers. In this paper we investigate the impact of combined heat and power generation in operation of data centers in reducing TCO and environmental footprint and improving operational reliability. Usage of natural resources like water, fuel is minimized to create a low footprint IT infrastructure. Through use of mix of on-site power generation technologies alongside energy and water storage we create a power, cooling and water microgrid for the data center. Such microgrids are a promising way to capture the significant potential of smaller distributed energy resources to meet growing demands for low footprint IT infrastructures.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, many optimization models of supplier selection assume that the average prices of related expenditures are constant. This is far beyond the real situation. In fact, suppliers usually offer quantity discounts to encourage the buyers to order more. To select the best suppliers in volume discount environments in the presence of both cardinal and ordinal data, this paper proposes an innovative approach. A numerical example demonstrates the application of the proposed method.</p>",

Supply chain integration can potentially add value to the stakeholders along product development and manufacturing life cycle as well as the customers in terms of cost, time, service level, quality, and risk. In the manufacturing industry, there are many attempts to develop methodologies, standards, and technologies to integrate various applications for product design and manufacturing. However, studies on integrating and aligning product design and manufacturing with other operations in supply chains are relatively lacking. In an integrated supply chain, information, applications, and services are shared and become available among supply chain members within and across organizational boundaries. Existing technologies and tools such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) infrastructures and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems do not provide a flexible and reusable solution to information sharing and application integration. This paper presents a prototype service oriented web-based system, SC Collaborator (Supply Chain Collaborator), which leverages web services, web portal, and open source technologies to provide a flexible, customizable, and economical tool for supply chain integration. The prototype system implements a service oriented portal-based framework and allows service orchestration according to processes. This paper presents the service oriented portal-based framework, the system architecture of SC Collaborator, and the schematic representation and implementation of process models with the system. The paper also illustrates the use of the SC Collaborator system to facilitate cross-functional, cross-departmental, and cross-organizational collaborations using a bus manufacturing scenario.</jats:p>",

P-deficient soil zone. In a split-root system, transferring from 200/200âÂµM P (high/high) to high/nil P or nil/nil P for 7 days was associated with 18â30% increase in the ratio of root-to-total 13C, whereas 8â12% more 13C was retained in the shoot of plants grown under continuous high/high P. Although the C signal between the shoot and roots weakened at day 12, it closely correlated with root P acquisition at both days. In a non-split-root system, plants supplied with 200âÎ¼m P (high) for 7 and 12 days had a lower ratio of root-to-total 13C than plants with continuous 20âÎ¼m P (low). Preferential C allocation and increased P acquisition occurred before any measurable growth difference. Shoot P status had a greater influence than soil P supply on plant C allocation, and rapid C signalling between the shoot and roots might serve as an important component of plant response to heterogeneous P conditions.\n</jats:p>"

This article statistically examines a case of substantive policy advocacy in Great Britain: the issues of wait times and health rationing by the National Health Service (NHS), salient throughout the Blair years. An increase in constituent need for care implies an increase in demand for parliamentary representation, yet representation will not necessarily be supplied, because legislators juggle conflicting interests. We measure representative action using parliamentary questions from 1997â2005. Party and parliamentary status and a set of indicators of the health of British citizens provide measures of political supply and constituent demand. Employing count-regression techniques, we find increased parliamentary questions as the proportion of individuals with some high health risks rises, but opposite results for other health risks. Evidence of political supply is much more consistent, suggesting that political careerism goes a long way towards explaining whether MPs table any questions at all in this policy area.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, product design emphasizes the engineering efficiency of a product. Both supply chain management and product design have been drawing attention from numerous researchers. However, there has been only limited research on the integration of product design and supply chain. Despite this fact, there is significant potential for synergy in the integration of engineering and supply chain management, as well as managerial concepts into product design. In the paper, we present a methodology to form this synergistic connection. The methodology presented first generates functional requirements of a product. A design repository is then utilized to synthesize potential components of all sub-functions, providing multiple options for the potential conceptual designs. These concepts are screened by using a Design for Assembly (DfA) index and then a Design for Supply Chain (DfSC) index to select the best concept. An example from the bicycle industry is presented to demonstrate the benefit of supply chain considerations at the conceptual design phase.</jats:p>",

To address this aim, thecaâgranulosa (somatic) proliferation indexes (PIs), proportion of proliferating endothelial cells (PE), vascular area (VA) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression were simultaneously recorded on single healthy preantral follicles, classified into six different stages on the basis of the diameter and the granulosa layers. An autonomous blood vessel network starts to appear only in class 3. Vascular remodelling requires VEGFA expression, and<jats:italic>VEGFA</jats:italic>mRNA and VA significantly increase between class 3 and classes 4 and 5 and, further, in class 6. In addition, a positive correlation exists between these parameters in classes 3â5. Despite variation in angiogenesis results from classes 3 to 5, the statistical analysis reveals that the vascular parameters are positively and strictly correlated with somatic PIs. Conversely, class 6, also characterized by higher values of somatic PIs, displays a stable proportion of PEs (â40%) without showing any correlation among the different parameters analysed. To identify follicular subpopulations within different classes, a multivariate hierarchical cluster analysis was performed. This analysis reveals that the majority of classes 3 and 4 are quiescent follicles or structures that grow very slowly. Class 5 represents a transitory category, where half of the follicles maintain a low activity and the remaining express significantly higher levels of granulosa PI and VA. The follicles with this high activity are probably able to reach class 6 becoming dominant structures where somatic and vascular parameters are constantly on high levels and the VA remains the unique differentiating element.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the ICT branch has experienced new internationalization impulses through the improvement of offshore practices. Particularly the development of modularization and standardization of some production processes have crucially contributed to enabling offshoring in globalized areas of ICT. Competencies as well as innovation sources have increasingly fragmented; resting upon cooperation and trust principles. Quality standards play a crucial role to satisfy and optimize these coordination and regulation needs so to warrant quality outcomes. In this chapter, I will give an overview of the development of quality standards related to offshore projects, focusing particularly on recent practices in Europe. To illustrate the importance of quality standards and quality management for ICT off- and nearshore projects, and moreover for the internationalization of the ICT branch, I present some preliminary results of my work in progress. From the perspective of project managers in large ICT firms, quality standards play a very important role as the internal controlling instrument of working and communication processes; as well as an external mechanism beyond the ICT network in order to get market advantages.</jats:p>"

Several aspects of green supply chain management, such as the point of time of implementation, the driving forces, the relevance of intended goals and their particular realization and the adoption of ecoâprograms with suppliers and customers as well as internal and external barriers are analyzed. Furthermore, the link to different performance criteria is tested by inductive statistics in order to show the potential of green supply chain management for competitiveness. For this study, managers from the automotive supply industry in Germany were asked about their estimations in this regard. The main conclusion is that managers express the need for green supply chain management on the one hand but also see corresponding problems in terms of required resources on the other hand. Furthermore, the analyses show that green supply chain management leads to higher performance in terms of several performance criteria.

Parameters related to undesirable increasing of nitrites and nitrates concentrations have been measured considering these samples: pH, conductivity, concentration of total iron, manganese, ammonium, nitrates and nitrites. Results showed that groundwater from well field were extremely susceptible to favor bacterial growth in the pipelines. The occurrence of nitrites and nitrates in drinking water samples correlated positively with the lengths of old iron pipelines and negatively with the content of newly laid pipelines. The obtained results also showed that the potential nitrates increasing induced by the distribution of treated water could be reduced if: nitrates levels were below detection limits at the outlet of the water treatment plant; biological ammonium removal treatment implementation should reduce the levels of the nitrates and nitrites of the treated supplied water. Although the nitrates concentration increase in drinking water distribution systems, the issues with nitrites accumulation are rare in Lithuania. However, such processes still need to be proved in more extensive investigation, but these research results could be applied as a basic scenario.</jats:p>",

If effective, these strategies will\nfirst impact on the intern workforce. We studied\nthe source of interns in Queensland.\nMethods: Analysis of number, source and location\nof interns by Rural, Remote and Metropolitan\nArea (RRMA) classification (an index of remoteness)\nfrom university and health department\nrecords (2003?2008). Odds ratios compared the\nlikelihood of intern supply from Queensland universities\nand rural clinical schools.\nResults: Most interns in Queensland graduated\nfrom Queensland universities in 2007 (287 [72%])\nand 2008 (344 [84%]). Proportions increased\nacross all three RRMA groups from: 82% to 93%\nin RRMA1; 56% to 68% in RRMA2 and 67% to\n79% in RRMA3. The University of Queensland\n(UQ) provides most interns in all RRMA locations\nincluding RRMA3, and this increased from 2007\n(n = 33 [35%]) to 2008 (n = 57 [58%]). Interns from\ninterstate decreased from 61 (15%) in 2007 to 40\n(10%) in 2008. Interns from overseas fell from 53\n(13%) in 2007 to 27 (7%) in 2008. Rural clinical\nschools compared with traditional urban-based\nschools were more likely to supply interns to\nRRMA3 than RRMA1 hospitals in 2007 (OR, 8.8;\n95% CI, 4.6?16.7; P&lt; 0.0001) and 2008 (OR, 6.5;\n95% CI, 3.5?12.2; P&lt; 0.0001).\nConclusions: Queensland is close to self-sufficiency\nin intern supply and will achieve this in the\nnext few years. Rural clinical schools are playing\nan important role in producing interns for RRMA3\nhospitals. Due to its large cohort, UQ remains the\nmajor provider across all RRMA groups. </jats:p>"

The UKs capacity to import, transport and store gas and liquid natural gas (LNG) has to be improved, requiring greater investment in new gas supply infrastructure. Construction of appropriately sited onshore underground gas storage (UGS) facilities is needed. However, local groups oppose most proposed UGS sites on the grounds of safety, citing the dangers of gas migration and rare fatal events, mostly in America.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            This paper summarizes 228 reported events of widely varying cause, nature and severity at underground fuel storage (UFS) facilities; the majority at USA SPR facilities. Since UGS was first undertaken in 1915, reports of 13 fatalities, around 72 injured and the evacuation of at least 6700 people are found at UFS sites. Some communities have experienced multiple evacuations. In the context of the danger posed to the general public, three of those killed were staff at two UFS facilities. UGS (including LPG) has led to 10 civilian deaths, 25 injured and\n            <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic>\n            1250 evacuated.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In other areas of the energy supply chain, casualties are orders of magnitude greater, with at least 1525 dead, 6826 injured and the evacuation of over 7000 at incidents involving above ground fuel storage tanks since 1951. When considering UK UGS applications, the risk of UGS and wider UFS experiences should be put into context. Worldwide, over 90 years experience in UGS now exists, with around 630 facilities of different types currently operational. Technologies used are often those of, or derived from, a well-regulated oil and gas exploration industry. In contrast to public perception, industry and academia recognize that UGS has an excellent health, safety and environmental record. Although it should not be claimed that gas will never be found outside the intended well or storage facility area, UFS casualty figures appear to corroborate claims by supporters of the technologies that salt caverns provide one of the safest answers to the problem of storing large amounts of hydrocarbons and that even in urban areas underground gas storage, oil and gas production can be conducted safely if proper procedures are followed. If gas is found outside the intended system, then after recognition of the problem, mitigation and safe operating procedures can and have been developed.</jats:p>",

The emergence of private and voluntary food standards have opened a fast growing market for the provision of independent third-party certification services for a range of credence attributes from origin, through food quality and safety to social and environmental attributes. This study argues that the quality of certification may be affected by the number of heterogeneous standards a certifier is accredited to verify. Moreover, results suggest that the quality of more complex and costly testing protocols and standards resulting in overall higher certification cost may be better served by smaller certification bodies that on average exert higher effort levels. This finding seems of particular relevance to food chain management given the growing proliferation of highly specialized private standards and contractual arrangements in international food supply. </jats:p>",

Rapid global growth as well as the building of indigenous capabilities through investments, alliances, innovations, human capital development and learning characterize these industries. This article outlines some of the recent developments in the automobile component manufacturing industry in India and China as illustrations of this trend. The auto-component sectors in China and India show the emergence of a large number of dynamic local and global players with breathtaking competitive agility. This dynamism is a stark contrast to the picture of a moribund industry during the protective and regulatory regime only a decade and half ago. The auto-component manufacturing sector has successfully shifted away from the era of âcontractâ and âcatalogueâ mindset to ânetworkâ and âinnovationâ mindset and could be a good model for others to follow. </jats:p><jats:p> As China and India adopt very different âstrategic intentâ in developing their auto industries, similarity in their emphasis on acquiring competitive agility through trust and learning provides unmistakable evidence of convergence. This article argues that the strategies underpinning the success have been built more upon the strategic thinking in soft areas of supply chain relationships. The roles of transnational assemblers and component suppliers as well as indigenous manufacturers and component suppliers have been redefined in a way very different from the standardized and typical strategies of multi-domestic âlocalizationâ and âglocalizationâ. </jats:p>",

This has been so because of the popularly held misconception that water is a social commodity, which should be provided free of charge by government. With the now common resort to external loans to fund water project, the issue of project evaluation has become a precondition by foreign creditors such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank. This paper examines the necessity for evaluating externally funded water supply projects in Nigeria using the National Water Rehabilitation Project (NWRP) in some States as a case study. It examines some popular methods used in evaluating projects, noting that these methods are not suitable for water projects because SWAs in Nigeria have no investment options than in water supply for now. The paper suggests the adoption of the \"priority index\" approach. </jats:p>",

We find large cash transfers to the elderly lead to increased employment among prime-aged adults, which occurs primarily through labor migration. The pension's impact is attributable to the increase in household resources it represents, which can be used to stake migrants until they become self-sufficient, and to the presence of pensioners who can care for small children, which allows prime-aged adults to look for work elsewhere.

Responses from 437 accounting majorsâ found that personal attitudes linked to âintrinsic interestâ and âextrinsic interestâ was influential in choice of major. âReference groupsâ were an important social influence for international students. The findings have implications for government policy and the accounting profession in terms of attracting students and particularly international students, who are sufficiently interested in accounting as a career choice to address the skill shortage in Australia.</jats:p>",

We use the fine structure of the 2000 Act to develop a new measure of exposure to the earnings test that varies across calendar years both by month and year of birth. We find that much, if not all, of the labor-supply response occurred for sub-groups of men who, either because of high mortality risk, high rates of pure time preference, or liquidity constraints, may have found the actuarial adjustment built into the earnings test relatively disadvantageous, particularly the lesser educated.</jats:p>",

One key reason is that agricultural chains are subjected to the considerable managerial, social and biophysical complexity, which often leads to the inappropriate use of different methods. We capture supply chain complexity by formulating a matrix of biophysical by management factors. This is used to comprehend supply chain complexity and show how participants in agricultural chains can implement adaptation strategies that add value to their industry. Through various case studies we illustrate how adaptation strategies adopted by chain participants relate to different quadrants of the complexity matrix. An analysis of the literature based on this matrix also shows the suitability of different types of technical methods when used within adaptation strategies of each matrix quadrant. The complexity matrix aids the identification of the right strategies to use for the right problem through engagement with the right people.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An extensive experimental campaign was performed on a diesel common rail research engine, converted to operate in dual-fuel mode, in order to investigate the effects of in-cylinder bulk flow and methane supply strategies on combustion and emissions. Three different bulk flow structures of the charge were induced inside the cylinder by activating/deactivating the two different inlet valves of the engine (i.e. swirl and tumble). Methane was injected into the inlet manifold at different pressure levels, varying the injector position. In order to obtain a stratified-like air-methane mixture, the injector was mounted very close to the inlet valve, while, to obtain a homogeneous-like one, methane was injected more upstream. By combining the two different positions of the injector and the three bulk flow structures, seven different engine inlet setups were tested, at different values of engine speed and load. Moreover, the effects of various pilot injection parameters, such as injection advance, diesel fuel quantity and rail pressure, were investigated. From in-cylinder pressure and heat release curves some output parameters, representative for combustion development, were calculated while emissions concentrations in the exhaust gases were measured. Main and interaction effects on dual-fuel combustion and exhaust emissions of all the operating parameters described above were studied by means of DOE technique, in order to perform a synthetic and complete analysis of the combustion behavior. The obtained results showed that the charge bulk motion produced by the swirl inlet valve is able to induce a more rapid and complete combustion of the air-methane mixture inside the cylinder. At low engine loads, this results in a contemporary reduction of unburned hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides content at the exhaust, especially injecting the methane at high pressure and in stratified-like configuration. Furthermore, the analysis of the exhaust pollutant concentrations revealed that complex interactions effects between some unexpected operating parameters exist, such as between pilot injection pressure and engine inlet configuration. Generally, it was demonstrated that the stratified-like configuration of methane injection is an effective method to reduce unburned hydrocarbon emissions at the engine exhaust.</jats:p>",

However, it is not known if the preceding cover crop species, the amount of straw on the soil surface, or the N supplied to the cover crop will affect peanut grown in a NT system. An experiment was conducted on a Typic Haplorthox in Botucatu, SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil, during two agricultural years, to evaluate the cover crop dry matter (DM) and nutrient accumulation as affected by N fertilization and peanut nutrition and yield when grown in succession, under a NT system. Treatments included three cover crops {palisadegrass [<jats:italic>Brachiaria brizantha</jats:italic> (Hochst. ex A. Rich) Stapf], pearl millet [<jats:italic>Pennisetum glaucum</jats:italic> (L.) R.

Pearl millet showed lower nutrient concentrations in aboveground biomass compared with palisadegrass and guineagrass, but accumulated the largest quantities of DM (14.8 Mg ha<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup>) and macronutrients. Nitrogen application increased N and P concentration in all cover crops, as well as the accumulation of N, Ca, and Mg in pearl millet. Nitrogenâfertilized pearl millet resulted in higher P, Ca, Mg, and S concentrations in peanut leaves grown after. Previous cover crops, even with large straw mulch production (6.0â14.8 Mg ha<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup> of DM), did not influence peanut pod yield (mean 2.3 Mg ha<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup>) in the NT system, nor did N fertilization of the cover crop.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chains are increasingly asked by consumers, policy makers, and other stakeholders to deliver product attributes that range far beyond the experience and search attributes of classical consumer demand. One name given these attributes is credence attributes (e.g. place-of-origin, organic, locally-grown). Sustainability as an attribute is an interesting emerging case. Sustainability is an example of a 'wicked problem': complex, ill-defined, messy and unsolvable in any traditional sense. Sustainability's lack of tractability raises the interesting question as to how a supply chain or network produces a thing that is beyond conventional notions of definition and structure. The paper develops a general framework for linking supply chain performance to types of knowledge and supply chain governance. The framework draws from knowledge management theory, the resource based theory of the firm, and transactions cost economics. Various types of knowledge are argued to have different levels of strategic value â explicit knowledge has limited strategic value, tacit knowledge has moderate strategic value, and new knowledge has high strategic value. Managing wicked problems requires a type of supply chain governance that creates new knowledge in the context of a broad stakeholder network. This type of governance is called transformational and is contrasted with exchange governance and learning governance. Once developed, the framework is applied to the wicked problem of sustainability, including a case study on one empirical structure being used to manage it. For supply chains and networks, future economic value is likely to demand delivery of more and more complex attributes that will take businesses increasingly into the realm of wicked problems.</jats:p>",

In addition, it also announces the wholesale price. In response, the retailer chooses its optimal advertising and pricing policies. We model this supply chain problem as a stochastic Stackelberg differential game whose dynamics follows Sethi's stochastic salesâadvertising model. We obtain the condition when offering coâop advertising is optimal for the manufacturer.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The implementation of radio frequency identification (RFID) for product identification and electronic product code (EPC) for information sharing has the potential to generate a wide amount of data, and to make those data real-time available between supply chain players. However, data need to be interpreted to derive value-added information, which could generate economic benefits from the introduction of RFID technology. This paper aims at addressing the issue of how to exploit EPC data generated by RFID technology to provide value-added information, which could be usefully exploited to optimise supply chain processes. To achieve such aim, a panel of experts, composed of information technology, logistics and supply chain managers of major manufacturers and distributors of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), has been involved in the definition of relevant value-added information to be derived from RFID reads. On the basis of the suggestions from the panel members, appropriate business intelligence modules (BIMs) were designed and developed. All BIMs are compliant with EPC standards, and could be in-field implemented to manage logistics processes through RFID technology. The whole work has been carried out inside the RFID Logistics Pilot project, an Italian pilot study aiming at exploiting RFID technology and innovative EPC Network tools, to enable track and trace and product flow plain visibility in the FMCG supply chain. </jats:p>",

Five-year-old âGalaâ/âM.26â trees grown in sand culture and trained in tall spindle received a total of 3.3, 10.0, 20.0, or 40.0 g actual N through fertigation using Hoagland's solution from bloom to 3 weeks before harvest. The crop load of these trees was adjusted to 6.5 fruit/cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> trunk cross-sectional area by hand thinning when the diameter of the largest fruit was 10 mm. As N supply increased, total shoot leaf area in the canopy increased, whereas total spur leaf area remained unchanged. Both single leaf and whole canopy net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation rates increased with increasing N supply. The net dry matter gain of the whole tree from budbreak to fruit harvest increased â74% from the lowest N supply to the highest N supply, but the proportion of net dry matter gain partitioned to fruit (harvest index) decreased from 83% to 70%. Both leaf area to fruit ratio and average final fruit size increased with increasing N supply, and a linear relationship was found between leaf area to fruit ratio and final fruit size. The number of cells per fruit increased with increasing N supply, whereas average cell size remained unchanged. As N supply increased, fruit soluble solids concentration increased, whereas fruit firmness decreased slightly. These results indicate that 1) apple trees grown under low N supply are source-limited; and 2) within the range of N supply used, increasing N supply improves leaf N status, leaf and whole tree photosynthetic capacity, and leaf area to fruit ratio, leading to more cells per fruit, larger fruit, and higher soluble solids.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Monitoring of environmental conditions of products in Supply Chains is commonly demanded by users in distribution and manufacturing processes. This information is also required by customers and authorities at final stages. Sometimes is difficult to collect this information, but especially when products are mixed within the same pallet. The process of mixing products in pallets is called &amp;ldquo;picking&amp;rdquo; and is a usual practice when customers require small quantities of each item. The number of resources used and the amount of mistakes involving this process suppose and important drawback for distribution companies. To tackle this lack of competiveness created, this work proposes a three-levels based RFID System. This system tries to improve the process of identification and monitoring of condition of products by means of passive and active tags, and the necessary RFID readers. The three different RFID components are connected to three different levels which Supply Chain has been divided in. RFID readers are actually in the third level, the highest one, are wirelessly connected using ZigBee networks. GPRS modules are also used here to provided real-time global localization of products (RTLS) in the moment of being accessed by readers.</jats:p>"

Both issues require powerful and holistic IT solutions in order to achieve knowledge transfer, process alignment and transparent information flows across the supply chain. In recent years, new Inter-Organizational Information Systems (IOS) were developed for the red meat industry. However, the acceptance of IOS at the farm level is still relatively low. Since there is hardly any relevant literature on IOS in the meat sector, this study contributes to the general research on IOS, the status quo of data flows in the pork supply chain as well as a systematization and evaluation of the most relevant existing internet based IOS. Furthermore, special needs for IOS on the spot market which is the dominating organizational form in the German pork sector are defined and contrasted against the current supply of systems. It was found that none of the existing IT solutions adequately meet the requirements which are important in complex spot market relationships. Consequently, we recommend a higher consideration of supply chain organization in IOS research and development.</jats:p>",

In the past few years, major initiatives from companies such as Wal-Mart, Metro, and Marks &amp; Spencer have provided much-needed insight into the potential uses of RFID, thus providing the impetus for other companies to investigate RFID. Consequently, reports of âpilotâ projects by many different companies are on the increase. However, the development of an RFID project is a complex task, requiring the involvement of many different parties with a variety of skill sets. Successfully managing such complex projects requires a clear definition of steps and activities. Unfortunately, this issue is only partially embraced in literature. Thus the purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology to help companies in developing and managing an RFID project. The framework provided in this paper is grounded on available literature and from the authorsâ personal experiences in managing several projects through their RFID laboratories. </jats:p>",

The model posits a broad range of stakeholders actively engaged in development action: each stakeholder is different, with its own interests, missions, procedures, and ways of deploying power in development action. Recognising the multiplicity of subjects of development is especially crucial for improving bottom-up practice. Connections and interactions among stakeholders are inherently problematic, and must be negotiated to accomplish development work, as tensions in the dynamic among stakeholders may operate to restrict the success of these âbottom-upâ development projects.</jats:p>",

Using survey and archival data from 489 firms, we found that performance is influenced by how well knowledge development capacity and intellectual capital efforts complement alternative chain strategies.

At each of seven key developmental stages throughout one annual growth cycle, four trees were excavated and destructively sampled for complete nutrient analysis. Nutrient concentrations in leaves and fruit fell within the recommended optimal range, and the fruit yield was 18.8 kg/tree (equivalent to 52.45 tÂ·ha<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup>) with an average fruit weight of 181 g. The net accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S from budbreak to fruit harvest was 19.8, 3.3, 36.0, 14.2, 4.4, and 1.6 g/tree, respectively, and that for B, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe was 93.6, 60.9, 46.5, 184.8, and 148.7 mg/tree, respectively. Nutrient accumulation by new growth (fruit plus shoots and leaves) accounted for over 90% of the net gain for N, P, K, Mg, S, and B in the whole tree and a large proportion of the net gain for Ca, Zn, Mn, and Fe (from 58.1% for Zn to 87.2% of Fe) from budbreak to fruit harvest. Differential nutrient accumulation patterns were found in shoots and leaves and fruit. The most rapid accumulation of all nutrients in shoots and leaves took place during active shoot growth from bloom to the end of shoot growth. The accumulation pattern of most nutrients corresponded well with the accumulation of dry matter, with continued accumulation observed only in total Ca and Mn in shoots and leaves after the end of shoot growth. Nutrient accumulation in fruit largely followed its dry matter accumulation, and a large proportion of the nutrient accumulation (from 58.1% for Zn to 77.4% of K) occurred from the end of shoot growth to fruit harvest. At harvest, fruit contained more P, K, B, and Fe, whereas shoots and leaves had more N, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, and Mn. Most of the N demand by new growth at bloom was provided by tree reserve N. Remobilization of N from perennial parts of the tree was found to support rapid fruit expansion from the end of shoot growth to fruit harvest. The most rapid uptake from current season's N supply occurred from bloom to the end of shoot growth, corresponding to the highest tree N demand. At harvest, 62.4% of the total N in new growth was in shoots and leaves, with the balance in fruit. Reserve N and current season's N uptake each contributed about 50% to the total N in the whole tree at harvest.</jats:p>",

However, the extent of the downstream ecological impacts of those dams is rarely assessed. The longitudinal effects of a large reservoir on the substrate, water quality and riffle macroinvertebrate communities were examined between 0.5 and 18.3 km downstream of Tallowa Dam. The number of taxa and the Australian River Assessment Scheme observed v. expected score generally increased with increasing distance from the dam, average clast size decreased with increasing distance and water quality showed distinct longitudinal patterns. Classification of the macroinvertebrate assemblages identified two groups, one from riffles ~4 km downstream of the dam and one further downstream, suggesting the main impact occurs close to the dam. The difference between the two groups of riffles resulted mainly from the following macroinvertebrates, Edmundsiops (Baetidae), Hemigomphus (Gomphidae), Illiesoperla (Gripopterygidae), Physa (Physidae), Nannoplebia (Libellulidae) and Austrolimnius larvae (Elmidae), occurring less frequently in the near-dam riffles. Water quality was probably the main cause of the altered macroinvertebrate assemblage structure, not altered hydrology, a result attributable to the small operational capacity of Tallowa Dam relative to the annual inflow volumes.\n</jats:p>"

The outcome of paternity in certain situations is only controlled directly by male sperm stock. This was tested experimentally in the parasitoid wasp <jats:italic>Anisopteromalus calandrae</jats:italic> (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), in which sperm stocks are small (several hundred) and the fertilizing efficiency of stored sperm is high (the ratio of sperm stored/fertilized eggs is about 0.75). Sperm in seminal vesicles and paternity of males of different status (virgin young, virgin old, or young previously mated) were measured after female single and double mating. The amount of sperm in the seminal vesicle differed according to male status (increasing from previously mated males to old males), but there was no difference in sperm stored by females after a single mating. In double mating experiments with two males of different status, paternity increased linearly with the relative amount of sperm in seminal vesicles. Paternity distribution conforms to âa fair raffleâ of sperm from both donors following complete mixing of sperm prior to fertilization. Thus, in a female multiple mating context, male fitness depends principally on their sperm stock, which in turn depends on life history parameters, such as age and previous mating.</jats:p>",

On the supply side, the addition of a new standard has enriched choices available on the 3G mobile telecommunications market; however, on the demand side, the government had to force operators to adopt this standard due to their lack of interest in the new standard. Building on insights gained from Northâs theory on the transaction costs of politics, the authors explain this standardization process as a result of interaction between the political market and the economic market which has ultimately been driven by ideology shifts that took place on multiple levels of Chinaâs society in recent years. They contribute to the standardization literature by demonstrating how Northâs theory can be used for integrating political and economic aspects in the analysis of standardization processes.</jats:p>"

Although studies on PT vascular anatomy have focused on the risk to tendon pedicles from surgical approaches and knee pathophysiology, the significance of its blood supply to grafting has not been adequately explored previously. This investigation explores both the intrinsic and extrinsic arterial anatomy of the PT, as relevant to the PT graft. Ten fresh cadaveric lower limbs underwent angiographic injection of the common femoral artery with radioâopaque lead oxide. Each tendon was carefully dissected, underwent plain radiography and subsequently schematically reconstructed. The PT demonstrated a wellâdeveloped and consistent vascularity from three main sources: anteroâproximally, mainly by the inferiorâlateral genicular artery; anteroâdistally via a chokeâanastomotic arch between the anterior tibial recurrent and inferior medial genicular arteries; and posteriorly via the retroâpatellar anastomotic arch in Hoffa's fat pad. Two patterns of pedicles formed this arch: inferiorâlateral and descending genicular arteries (TypeâI); superiorâlateral, inferiorâlateral, and superiorâmedial genicular arteries (TypeâII). Both types supplied the posterior PT, with the majority of vessels descending to its middleâthird. The middleâthird PT has a richer intrinsic vascularity, which may enhance its ingrowth as a graft, and supports its conventional use in cruciate ligament reconstruction. The pedicles supplying the PT are endangered during procedures where Hoffa's fat pad is removed including certain techniques of PT harvest and total knee arthroplasty. Clin. Anat. 22:371â376, 2009.

Since one or a number of functions is carried by the coordination of separate ECUs, it is important to standardize automotive LAN protocols to ensure reliable interoperability. In parallel with standardization, conformance test specifications for the protocols have played an increasingly important role in securing the interoperability of the complex LAN bus system. The present chapter, whose purpose is to examine the international collaborative framework which has been established between European and Japanese consortia since 2006 for the standardization of the automotive LAN protocol known as âFlexRayâ, will focus on the contribution of the Japanese standard consortium to the drafting of the original conformance test specifications. The FlexRay protocol is expected to become the de facto standard in the automotive high-speed safety protocol market.</jats:p>"

Changes in sugar concentration were reproduced by the sum of sugar import (S), sugar metabolism (M) and water budget (W). S and W were derived from model inputs of fresh and dry mass, and M was simulated with a relative metabolism rate describing the depletion of hexose. The relative metabolism rate was associated with the relative growth rate of dry mass with a coefficient (k) that was constant for a given cultivar under various growth conditions (temperature, water supply, and sourceâsink ratio) but varied with genotype. The k value was ~20% higher for cv. Merlot than for cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, indicating more imported sugars would be depleted by Merlot than Cabernet Sauvignon. The model correctly simulated the negative effect of lowered leaf-to-fruitâ ratio and the positive effect of water shortage on sugar concentration. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the present model was weakly sensitive to k because of sugar accumulation being predominantly controlled by S, with M relatively small (~20%) with respect to the increment of sugar concentration. Model simulation indicated that the decreasing leaf-to-fruit ratio reduced S more than M and W, causing a net decrease in sugar concentration. In contrast, the water shortage decreased S less than M and W, resulting in a net increase in sugar concentration.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Authorities have promoted a specific and innovative framework for the use of electronic signatures, allowing the free flow of electronic signature-related products and services cross borders, and ensuring a basic legal recognition of such facilities. The core aim was to promote the emergence of the internal market for certification products, mainly intending to satisfy various requirements for the proper use and immediate âadoptionâ of electronic signature applications related to e-government and personal e-banking services. Thus, a number of technical, procedural, and quality standards for electronic signature products and solutions have been developed, all conforming to the requirements imposed by the EU regulation and the relevant market needs. In the present work, we examine the role of standardization activities for the promotion of several needs of an âopenâ European market based on the effective usage of e-signatures, and being able to affect a great variety of technological, business- commercial, regulatory, and other issues. In any case, the transposition of legal requirements into technical specifications (or business practices) needs to be harmonized at a European member-statesâ level in order to enable adequate interoperability of the final solutions proposed. Appropriate technical standards for the sector can help to establish a presumption of conformity that the electronic signature products following or implementing them comply with all the legal requirements imposed, in the background of the actual European policies. Thus we discuss recent European and/or national initiatives to fulfil such a fundamental option. The European Electronic Signature Standardization Initiative (EESSI) has been set up under the auspices of the European Commission for the carrying out of a work program aiming at the development of standards (be it technical specifications or policy practices) that would facilitate the implementation of the basic legal instrument (the âElectronic Signatures Directiveâ). Two major streams of possible standards-setting work have been determined, covering: (i) Qualitative and procedural standards for the provision of certification services and (ii) technical standards for product interoperability. We identify (and evaluate at a primary level) the basic components/modules of EESSIâs specific results, already developed and offered in the market either as technical regulations and/or as recognized standards, with respect to essential requirements imposed by the European regulation. We also discuss relevant âfeedbackâ already gained from various market areas and we focus on challenges for further implementation, progress, adoption, and development, especially in the framework for the promotion of converged broadband (Internet-based) communications facilities. It is important for the market that expected standardization work takes into account new technological developments as, in the future, users will move their e-signature key from device-to-device in a connected world. The added value of standards in the e-signatures sector, for both end users and assessing parties (judge, arbitrator, conformity assessment body, etc.) is of extreme importance for the future of the European electronic communications market.</jats:p>"

The technological advantages of these materials over traditional ones are due to their unique microstructure and molecular properties. Smart materials such as shape memory alloys (SMA), has been used in such diverse areas of engineering science, nowadays. In this paper, we present a numerical investigation of the dynamics interaction of a nonideal structure (NIS). We analyze the phenomenon of the passage through resonance region in the steady state processes. We remarked that this kind of problem can lead to the so-called Sommerfeld effect: steady state frequencies of the DC motor will usually increase as more power (voltage) is given to it in a step-by-step fashion. When a resonance condition with the structure it is reached, the better part of this energy it is consumed to generate large amplitude vibrations of the foundation without sensible change of the motor frequency as before. The results obtained by using numerical simulations are discussed in details.</jats:p>",

A fashion supply chain, composed of a distribution centre (DC) and a retail store (RS), is examined. A questionnaire survey and several site visits were performed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data related to current (AS IS) supply chain processes of each player investigated. Starting from data collected, re-engineered (TO BE) procedures were designed, hypothesising the implementation of RFID technology. Grounding on the gap between AS IS and TO BE scenarios, a detailed investment evaluation was performed in order to assess the profitability of RFID and EPC implementation in the fashion supply chain, both for each player and for different supply chain configurations. Results show that RFID and EPC implementation is profitable under several scenarios examined, and that the profitability of the RFID investment is affected by three main factors, namely: (i) the AS IS processes of DC and RSs; (ii) the supply chain structure, and in particular the number of RSs composing the supply chain and (iii) the turnover increase at RSs, generated by RFID implementation. Outcomes of this study provide useful guidelines for the implementation of RFID and EPC in the fashion industry supply chain. </jats:p>",

They also modulate pituitary angiogenesis and induce tumor formation. Pituitary grafts, due to the loss of hypothalamic dopamine, also show lactotroph hyperplasia. We investigated the role of estrogen on rat pituitary autograft vascularization by light and transmission electron microscopy, and assessed prolactin (PRL) blood levels, microvessel density (MVD) and cell proliferation using the BrdU labeling index. All adenohypophysial cell types were identified by immunohistochemistry (streptavidinâbiotinâperoxidase complex method). The proangiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its receptor Flkâ1, and hypoxia inducible factorâ1Î± (HIFâ1Î±) were similarly demonstrated. The prevalence of lactotrophs, as well as more intense staining for VEGF, Flkâ1 and HIFâ1Î±, was noted in those grafts exposed to estrogen, mainly in the area surrounding the central necrotic core. Immunostaining showed Flkâ1 expression increased in endothelial cells of the estrogenâexposed grafts as compared with those unexposed. In contrast to the grafts not exposed to estrogen, in the estrogenâexposed grafts, only fenestrated endothelium could be demonstrated, suggesting that estrogen induces fenestration of newly formed capillaries. There was an increase in blood PRL levels in the estrogenâtreated groups as compared with controls. Both MVD and BrdU labeling indices were higher in grafts exposed to estrogen, especially after 4 weeks. Our results suggest that estrogen administration not only enhances the expression of proangiogenic factors in the pituitary grafts but also induces their expression at earlier stages, leading to rapid neoformation of purely fenestrated capillaries.</jats:p>",

In this work, we found that low Pi treatment caused significant reduction of root flavonoid (e.g. quercetin, kaempferol and their derivatives) levels in both Columbia (Col-0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Further investigations revealed that the dysfunction of PHR1, PHO1, PHO2 and NPC4 did not affect the decrease of root flavonoid level by low Pi treatment. In contrast, pldÎ¶2, a knockout mutant of the Arabidopsis phospholipase DÎ¶2, exhibited defects in the reduction of root flavonoid level and lateral root (LR) emergence under low Pi conditions. When grown under low Pi supply, the transport of auxin from the shoot apex into the root, expression of the auxin responsive DR5::GUS marker and induction of the auxin responsive genes were all significantly less efficient in pldÎ¶2 than in wild-type (WT) control. This is the first report on the reduction of root flavonoid level and its likely contribution to increased LR emergence in Arabidopsis under Pi deficiency conditions, which may facilitate the adaptation of plants to the growth environments with poor Pi availability.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The rationale of product families for mass customization has attracted much attention from both academia and industry alike. While the product family strategy facilitates product differentiation and customization, it inevitably leads to a high variety issue in the downstream fulfillment process. In particular, when assembly-to-order and outsourcing become common practices, the supply chain decisions are deemed to be very complicated in order to accommodate the diverse product and process variants associated with product families. With focus on variety management, this paper proposes a virtual supply chain (VSC) configuration concept. The general gist is to manage various supply chain variants under a generic umbrella. It emphasizes the conceptualization and modeling of VSC to enhance the power of variety handling, with respect to supply chains, as well as products and processes. A domain-based reference model is employed to identify and coordinate the decision factors of supply chains. These decision factors are used to model the VSC based on formal semantics and object-oriented modeling techniques. The management of supply chain variety is formulated as the VSC configuration problem, and is coped with variety handlers and their states. A case study of electrical motor global supply chains is reported. It is demonstrated that the generic characteristics of VSC excel in coordinating the decisions regarding product, process and supply chains towards mass customization.</jats:p>",

This descriptive study used a multi-disciplinary approach that bridged anthropology and entomology. A multiple case study design was adopted to include research in six study areas, defined as blocks. The water supply is irregular in households from both under-privileged and privileged areas, however, clear differences exist. In the more privileged blocks, several homes are not connected to the public water system, but have a well and pump system and therefore irregularity of supply does not affect them. In households from under-privileged blocks, where the water supply is irregular, the frequent use of water containers such as water tanks, cisterns, barrels and pots, creates environmental conditions with a greater number of breeding areas. In under-privileged homes, there are more possible breeding areas and environmental conditions that may improve the chances of Aedes aegypti survival.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper presents possible solutions to small farmers in the agricultural sector in a small island setting grappling with challenges of enhancing their local industry and import substitution through a supply-demand chain framework. In 2005, Hawaiian farms produced approximately 363,200 kg of avocados. However, Hawaiian demand for these fruits required an additional 908,000 kg of avocados that were supplied through imports. At the same time, it is worth noting; almost 49% of locally produced avocados did not reach the market. These facts clearly suggest inefficiencies in the local avocado supply chain. Review of the literature on supply chain management suggests a sustainable avocado industry requires an integrated supply and demand chain management system. Hence, a modified conceptual model of supply-chain management called the Supply Demand Integrated Management (SDIM) model is proposed in this paper. Traditional supply chains contain three functional components: supply coordination, physical production and logistic management. In the new model, we propose adding R4D (Research for Development), a public good provided by the government to agricultural industries as an integral part of the supply-demand chain system. It articulates the significance of research and supply chain partnerships between small growers, industry groups, and public agencies. A well-integrated demand/supply chain in the avocado industry allows sharing of vital market information which can contribute to long-term strategic decisions that help local avocado growers increase their competitiveness against foreign imports. It also provides metrics in terms of consumer satisfaction, profitability, competitiveness, self-sufficiency, import substitution and sustainability. The SDIM model as applied to the avocado industry suggests two hypotheses relevant to the current situation. The hypotheses are: (1) There is a lack of coordination between what the farmers are growing and the chefs' (a high-end customer/buyer) preferences; (2) Forming an avocado farmer cooperative will enhance the profitability of local farmers. Survey data was collected from Hawaiian chefs and avocado farmers. Data was analysed using a Duncan multi-range test and a mathematical model, respectively, to test the hypotheses. The test revealed a lack of coordination between what the farmers are growing and buyer preferences. The results from the mathematical model suggested that formation of an avocado marketing cooperative would enhance the profitability of local farmers. Thus, the SDIM framework expands existing body of knowledge about supply chain management and provides useful information to local avocado growers that can help strengthen their supply and demand chain management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As part of disaster mitigation and evacuation planning, planners must be able to develop effective tactical and operational strategies to manage traffic and transportation needs during an evacuation. One aspect of evacuation planning is the estimation of how many people must be evacuated to provide strategies that are responsive to the number and location of these people. When such estimates are available, it may be possible to implement tactical and operational strategies that closely match the likely demand on the road network during the evacuation. With short notice for an evacuation, people may need to be evacuated directly from current locations. In addition, for some disasters, the spatial extent of the evacuated area may change over time. This problem may be exacerbated by congestion around the evacuated area. An estimation process is proposed for a short-notice evacuation. The method uses on-hand data typically generated through existing travel demand models at many metropolitan planning organizations. It estimates demand using convenient models for trip generation, trip distribution, and travel time generation for these trips, considering a staged evacuation. These demand estimates feed a dynamic simulation model, DynusT, that is used to model the supply characteristics of the roadway network during the evacuation. Such models can be applied using a case study based on a short-notice flooding scenario for Phoenix, Arizona. </jats:p>",

Firstly, we report the rationale for having models and standards of processes in SE, SwE and IS. Secondly, we review their main characteristics. Thirdly, based on the identified aims and principles, we report and posit the concepts of process, system and service as conceptual building blocks for describing such models and standards.

The concept is evaluated in a pilot project within the beverage industry. In supply chains, partial information sharing can be achieved based on RFID tags. In the pilot study, the tags are used to identify returnable transport items (RTI), because identification at item level would be too costly. The proposed integration of a billing system shall enable a compensation of benefits throughout the supply chain. In a first step, the billing model of the RTI pool operator is based on the proposed infrastructure. This approach is generic enough, though, to be adapted to many other scenarios and industries. A detailed description of RTI is given within the first paragraph. In the second paragraph, the technical applicability of ultra-high frequency (UHF) within the beverage supply chain is evaluated, and the modelling of the beverage supply chain is described. After logistical evaluation in Section 3, the fourth section describes the integration of a billing model. The pilot project carried out by the Bremen Research Cluster for Dynamics in Logistics was started in April 2008 to validate the proposed model in a real scenario within the beverage industry. </jats:p>",

In the intact brain, these properties may be strongly influenced by ongoing network activity. Although physiologically realistic patterns of network activity have been successfully induced in brain slices maintained in interfaceâtype recording chambers, they have been harder to obtain in submergedâtype chambers, which offer significant experimental advantages, including fast exchange of pharmacological agents, visually guided patchâclamp recordings, and imaging techniques. Here, we investigated conditions for the emergence of network oscillations in submerged slices prepared from the hippocampus of rats and mice. We found that the local oxygen level is critical for generation and propagation of both spontaneously occurring sharp waveâripple oscillations and cholinergically induced fast oscillations. We suggest three ways to improve the oxygen supply to slices under submerged conditions: (i) optimizing chamber design for laminar flow of superfusion fluid; (ii) increasing the flow rate of superfusion fluid; and (iii) superfusing both surfaces of the slice. These improvements to the recording conditions enable detailed studies of neurons under more realistic conditions of network activity, which are essential for a better understanding of neuronal network operation.</jats:p>",

Technical issues and challenges in designing RFID read points for singulation and localisation of the RF interrogation zone are studied. Results from UHF Gen 2 tag evaluation based on readability, tag sensitivity and tag backscatter link frequency error are presented. Further, we also discuss how Gen 2 reader communication parameter settings can be optimised to maximise performance in multi-tag environments. This research helped Intel enhance RFID system performance in its supply chain resulting in improved inventory visibility.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The benefits of using passive radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to improve supply chain productivity have been proved several times in recent years, throughout the world. The paper industry has not been able to fully exploit these benefits, because of the challenging characteristics of the paper reel itself and the lack of a suitable tag antenna. Now the tag antenna has been developed, and this paper studies the means of using this technology in paper mill and sea port environments. These environments cover a major part of the typical supply chain of paper reels. Pilot tests presented in this paper were performed in realistic industrial circumstances to achieve realistic results. Results proved that paper reels can be reliably identified by passive RFID technology in a real environment. These results bring the large-scale exploitation of RFID in the paper industry one major step closer. </jats:p>",

Eight barrows (mean BW 35.9âÂ±â0.9âkg), fitted with simple Tâcannulas at the terminal ileum, were either fed a lowâP cornâsoybean mealâbased control diet or 75% of the control diet supplemented with 25% cellulose, starch or pectin according to a 4âÃâ3 Latin Square design. Both pectin and cellulose caused higher faecal than ileal P recoveries. Ileal volatile fatty acids (VFA) levels were more pronounced for the starch (pâ&lt;â0.05) rather than the cellulose and pectin treatments, whereas pectin resulted in a higher faecal VFA concentration in comparison to starch and cellulose (pâ&lt;â0.05). The differences in faecal VFA concentrations corresponded to the pH values obtained in faeces. The N content of MBM was higher (pâ&lt;â0.05) when cellulose was supplemented. Pectin caused a decrease in the P content of the MBM compared to the control (pâ&lt;â0.05). As a result, the N:P ratio was significantly higher for the pectin (N:Pâ=â4.33) than for the control treatment (N:Pâ=â2.63), while the Ca:P ratio remained constant for all treatments, suggesting changes in the accumulation of N, P and Ca in MBM, probably due to changes in the species composition and activity of the microflora.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many European countries such as the Netherlands, France and Germany there is high division of labour in the red meat sector. In response to emerging demands for the meat industry, such as seamless traceability, increased food safety and animal welfare, the need for coordination across the stages is increasing. However, a trend towards vertical integration cannot be observed. Especially in price-competitive markets in which the production requirements are less specific, the spot market still seems to be advantageous in efficiency and costs. Largely unnoticed in research and practice, recent developments in the German meat market indicate an institutional change, allowing the maintenance of spot market structures by assigning various coordination tasks to an independent third party â the QS QualitÃ¤t und Sicherheit GmbH. This association was originally founded in 2001 by shareholders from the whole of the agribusiness sector to develop a certification scheme. QS has since become the leading certification standard for the German meat industry. Based on coordination theory and empirical findings, a case study of QS GmbH was carried out. Various non-traditional certification activities that are more properly classified as functions of supply chain coordination were identified. In general, the development of QS can be considered as an institutional innovation in supply chain coordination. It demonstrates an alternative means for spot market oriented meat supply chains to deal with increasing uncertainties in the market.</jats:p>",

Our model suggests Ontario could experience the highest, most immediate losses (78% of the potential losses across eastern Canada), with Quebec sustaining most of the rest of the losses over the next 20 years. Potential losses of $86 to $254 million per year are simulated after 20Â years. The net present value of total harvest losses after 28Â years of outbreak ranges between $0.7 to $2.1 billion. Adaptation policies decrease short-term losses by 46%â55% and delay larger harvest failures by 9â11Â years. Without harvest adaptation, failures to maintain annual allowable cut levels may occur once the total area infested exceeds 15 Ã 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> ha. While better understanding and representing S. noctilio behaviour will involve a significant effort, there is a strong demand by policy makers for this kind of information. </jats:p>",

Glucose absorption comprises active absorption via SGLT1 and facilitated absorption via GLUT2 in the apical membrane. Trafficking of apical GLUT2 is rapidly upâregulated by glucose and artificial sweeteners, which act through T1R2 + T1R3/Î±âgustducin to activate PLC Î²2 and PKC Î²II. We therefore investigated whether nonâsugar nutrients are regulated by taste receptors using perfused rat jejunum<jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. Under different conditions, we observed a Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>âdependent reciprocal relationship between the H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>/oligopeptide transporter PepT1 and apical GLUT2, reflecting the fact that trafficking of PepT1 and GLUT2 to the apical membrane is inhibited and activated by PKC Î²II, respectively. Addition of<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>âglutamate or sucralose to a perfusate containing low glucose (20 m<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>) each activated PKC Î²II and decreased apical PepT1 levels and absorption of the hydrolysisâresistant dipeptide<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>âPhe(Î¨S)â<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>âAla (1 m<jats:sc>m)</jats:sc>, while increasing apical GLUT2 and glucose absorption within minutes. Switching perfusion from mannitol to glucose (75 m<jats:sc>m</jats:sc>) exerted similar effects.<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>âGlutamate induced rapid GPCR internalization of T1R1, T1R3 and transducin, whereas sucralose internalized T1R2, T1R3 and Î±âgustducin. We conclude that<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>âglutamate acts via amino acid and glucose via sweet taste receptors to coordinate regulation of PepT1 and apical GLUT2 reciprocally through a common enterocytic pool of PKC Î²II. These data suggest the existence of a wider Ca<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>and taste receptorâcoordinated transport network incorporating other nutrients and/or other stimuli capable of activating PKC Î²II and additional transporters, such as the aspartate/glutamate transporter, EAAC1, whose level was doubled by<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>âglutamate. The network may control energy supply.</jats:p>",

Along a 570Â km northâsouth transect from the Yukon River to the North Slope of Alaska, the <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N content was strongly reduced in ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal plants including Betula , Salix , Picea mariana (P. Mill.) B.S.P., Picea glauca Moench (Voss), and ericaceous plants. Compared with the <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N content of soil, the foliage of nonmycorrhizal plants ( Carex and Eriophorum ) was unchanged, whereas content of the ectomycorrhizal fungi was very much higher (e.g., Boletaceae, Leccinum and Cortinarius ). It is hypothesized that similar processes operate in tundra and boreal forest, both nitrogen-limited ecosystems: (i) mycorrhizal fungi break down soil polymers and take up amino acids or other nitrogen compounds; (ii) mycorrhizal fungi fractionate against <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N during production of transfer compounds; (iii) host plants are accordingly depleted in <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N; and (iv) mycorrhizal fungi are enriched in <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N. Increased N availability for plant roots or decreased light availability to understory plants may have decreased N allocation to mycorrhizal partners and increased Î´<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N by 3â°â4â° for southern populations of Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. and Salix. Fungal biomass, measured as ergosterol, correlated strongly with soil organic matter and attained amounts similar to those in temperate forest soils. </jats:p>",
