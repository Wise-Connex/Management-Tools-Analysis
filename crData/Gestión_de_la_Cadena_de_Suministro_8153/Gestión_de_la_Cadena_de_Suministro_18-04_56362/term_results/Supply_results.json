      "abstract": "<jats:p>Numerous studies have stressed the critical nature of aligning a product's attributes to its supply chain design (i.e., supply chain fit). Fisher (1997) developed the concept of supply chain fit, stating that enterprises must evaluate the nature of their products' demand before constructing a supply chain. I extend Fisher's (1997) paradigm by providing a more thorough understanding of when firms should invest in supply chain fit. I argue that assuming that perfect supply chain fit always results in enhanced financial performance is oversimplistic, as the benefits of perfect supply chain fit may be outweighed by the resources expended to attain it. To conduct this research, I will use archival and survey data to examine the moderating effects of six dimensions of environmental uncertainty on the relationship between supply chain fit and financial performance (e.g., munificence, market dynamism, technological dynamism, technical complexity, product diversity, and geographic dispersion).</jats:p>"

The objective of this article is to contribute to the development of SCM theory by examining the potential effects of Big Data Analytics on information utilization in a business and supply chain setting. Because it is critical for supply chain firms to have access to current, accurate, and useful data, the exploratory research will shed light on the opportunities and problems associated with the implementation of Big Data Analytics in SCM. While management is increasingly focusing on Big Data Analytics, actual research on the subject is still sparse. Due of the scarcity of relevant content at the nexus of Big Data Analytics and Supply Chain Management, the authors employ the Delphi research technique. The given Delphi survey findings complement to existing knowledge by identifying 43 opportunities and problems associated with the emergence of Big Data Analytics from a corporate and supply chain perspective. These structures provide the research community with a starting point for tailoring future research at the nexus of Big Data Analytics and SCM. The research contributes to the current body of knowledge by examining possibilities and challenges at the corporate and supply chain level with a particular emphasis on the consequences imposed by Big Data Analytics.</jats:p>"

This study aims to analyze carbon emission data generated at Bansin WTP following the PAS 2050 guidelines. The boundary of inventory and assessment includes water intake, purification, and distribution stages. In addition, pumping efficiency, power consumption per pump lift and specific energy consumption were used to estimate the potential of energy reduction in pumping for Bansin and Baoshan WTPs. The results have revealed that the carbon footprint of Bansin WTP is 0.39 kg CO2e/m3 in 2011. There is 95% of carbon emissions generated by pumping from the intake and distribution stages, and the use of pumping is responsible for 65% of total carbon emissions in the clarification stage. The power consumption per pump lift can be calculated to evaluate the difference between rated power and operational power. This relationship can provide information indicating to operators when to replace or maintain poorly-functioning pumps. The data on pump lift, flow rate and power can also be calculated to determine the relationship between pumping efficiency (%) and specific energy consumption (kW/Q), and then used to identify the optimum condition of pump combinations for a given production of water supply.</jats:p>",

Dalam aktivitas bisnisnya, aliran supply chain memiliki peran yang sangat penting, mulai dari pasokan bahan baku dari supplier sampai produk jadi ke konsumen. Oleh karena itu dilakukan suatu analisis untuk mengukur dan menilai sejauh mana kinerja supply chain perusahaan telah tercapai. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui hasil kinerja supply chain sehingga dapat memberikan usulan perbaikan bagi indikator kinerja perusahaan yang masih jauh di bawah target. Pengukuran kinerja supply chain ini didasarkan pada lima proses inti pada metode SCOR. Kemudian dilakukan pembobotan menggunakan pairwise comparison untuk masing-masing proses inti, atribut kinerja dan KPI-nya serta scoring system dengan menggunakan OMAX dan analisis dengan Traffic Light System. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kinerja supply chain perusahaan paling rendah berada pada bulan Agustus 2016 dengan nilai 3.698. Dari 17 KPI yang valid, terdapat 2 KPI kategori hijau, 7 KPI kategori kuning dan 8 KPI dengan kategori merah. Berdasarkan hasil tersebut, maka diberikan usulan perbaikan untuk 8 KPI dengan kategori merah yang diharapkan dapat meningkatkan kinerja supply chain perusahaan. Sebagai contoh usulan untuk KPI RRL 1.3 (jumlah keluhan mengenai produk dari konsumen), yaitu membuat lembar keluhan yang berisikan tanggal, nama konsumen serta jenis keluhan dari konsumen.

Therefore, urea melting-time predictions under various environmental conditions are very important. Transient numerical analysis was performed to predict the melting time. The urea supply line was composed of a double tube structure. Two copper wires were installed around the inner tube for the heater role. The urea melting time was calculated using ANSYS transient thermal v.15. The supply voltage, ambient temperature, and heat transfer coefficient on the external surface of supply line were changed to evaluate the effects of supply power and environmental conditions. The urea melted in less than 600 s in all cases. The urea melting time was influenced by the ambient temperature rather than the speed of the vehicle.</jats:p>"

Literature suggests that only the actual personal relationship can differentiate suppliers within supply chains. Literature further encourages more insight into the conceptualization of personal interaction and trust within supply chains. This paper reports on research that tested the importance of trust and its directional linear relationship with personal interaction. Personal interaction revealed a significant correlation with trust, indicating that actions of the Tier 2 supplier during the sourcing process can substantially influence trust with the Tier 1 buyer. It is accordingly crucial for automotive component suppliers to invest in strategies to increase their personal interaction with their buyers in order to promote trust and in turn to promote perceived customer value and customer retention.</p>",

The research conclusions are as follows: The effect of backup supplier is reduced with the increases of reliability coefficient; The value of information is more sensitive to reliability coefficient but less sensitive to potential market capacity; The earlier the information is available, the higher the profit of vendor is; The value of information is lower when reliability coefficient is close to 0 or 1, while information value is significant when reliability coefficient is 0.5; predetermined amount of backup supplier has nothing to do with the cost of strategic supplier, and predetermined amount of strategic supplier is also no connection with backup supplier's predetermined cost and execution cost.</p>",

Based on the deep analysis of supply chain operation reference (SCOR) model, which is widely used in various fields of industry, this article puts forward the preliminary index system of supply chain risk of EPC project by analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The risk index system of waste incineration project including 5 first-level risk indicators and 27 second-level risk indicators has been established and determined. The multi-level grey model is used to evaluate the risk index, calculate the grey evaluation coefficient and the grey evaluation weight vector as well as the weight matrix, draw the specific risk evaluation value of the project, and sort the first level index. Finally, an EPC example of a waste incineration in Hubei Province is used to verify the feasibility and reliability of the method.</p>",

The supply chain configurations differ by whether they include selected flexibility levers: multi-feedstock biorefineries; advanced biomass logistics; and the ability to adjust ethanol content of low-ethanol fuel blends, from E10 to E15 or E05. The simulated scenarios explore market responses to supply shocks including substitution between gasoline and ethanol, substitution between different sources of ethanol supply, biorefinery capacity additions or idling, and price adjustments. Welfare effects for the various market participants represented in BioTrans are summarized into a net shock cost measure. As oil accounts for a larger fraction of fuel by volume, its supply shocks are costlier than biomass supply shocks. Corn availability and the high cost of adding biorefinery capacity limit increases in ethanol use during gasoline price spikes. During shocks that imply sudden decreases in the price of gasoline, the renewable fuel standard (RFS) biofuel blending mandate limits the extent to which flexibility can be exercised to reduce ethanol use. The selected flexibility levers are most useful in response to cellulosic biomass supply shocks. </jats:p>",

These entities constitute the basis for the development of the national and global economies. In a contemporary complex and competitive business environment, the adaptation of appropriate strategies is a particularly important effort to furthering the development of companies from the SMEs sector. In this context, the application of the concept of sustainable supply chain management (SCM) in the operation strategy of SMEs seems to be a very important function. This supply chain also covers all three aspects of sustainable development: business, environmental, and social. The purpose of this article is to present the current state of the research in sustainable development in relation to managing the supply chain of SMEs, as well as the empirical findings in this area. The results found that all of the sustainability areas were very important in the supply chain management practices of the studied SMEs, despite the imbalance described in the literature. The study also presents the most important elements in the particular sustainability areas of SCM and SMEs.</jats:p>"

A hyperplane is used to divide the whole area in such a way that objects of different affiliation are separated from one another. The number of support vectors determines the complexity of the relations between dependent and independent variables. The calculations were performed using Statistical 12.0. Operational data for one selected zone of the water supply system for the period 2008–2014 were used for forecasting. The whole data set (in which data on distribution pipes were distinguished from those on house connections) for the years 2008–2014 was randomly divided into two subsets: a training subset – 75% (5 years) and a testing subset – 25% (2 years). Dependent variables (λr for the distribution pipes and λp for the house connections) were forecast using independent variables (the total length – Lr and Lp and number of failures – Nr and Np of the distribution pipes and the house connections, respectively). Four kinds of kernel functions (linear, polynomial, sigmoidal and radial basis functions) were applied. The SVM model based on the linear kernel function was found to be optimal for predicting the failure rate of each kind of water conduit. This model's maximum relative error of predicting failure rates λr and λp during the testing stage amounted to about 4% and 14%, respectively. The average experimental failure rates in the whole analysed period amounted to 0.18, 0.44, 0.17 and 0.24 fail./(km·year) for the distribution pipes, the house connections and the distribution pipes made of respectively PVC and cast iron.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Assessing the economic supply of biomass in a geospatial context while accounting for risk from natural disasters was studied. Risk levels were estimated from a component of factors which included: population density, road density, federal ownership, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions, and Presidential Disaster Declarations. The Presidential Disaster Declarations included risks due to: coastal storm, drought, fire, flood, freezing, hurricane, mud land slide, severe ices, severe storms, snow, tornado, and tropical storm. Presidential Disaster Declarations included summaries based on a short-term time period from 2000-2011, and on a long-term time period from 1964-2011. Risk categories were developed as a function of the number of disaster declarations, agricultural-to-forest land ratio, average road density, and average population density. A significant contribution of the research was the allocation of spatially explicit data using GIS technology at the 5-digit zip code tabulation area. The average area for 5-digit ZCTAs in the Eastern U.S. study region was approximately 169 kilometers2. Long-term risk (1964-2011) from disaster declarations had a greater impact on the economic availability of biomass supply relative to short-term declarations (2000-2011). The greatest risk to biomass supply came from population density relative to the other risk factors studies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Of the 25,044 total ZCTAs, 12,256 ZCTAs were in locations that did not include population density &amp;ge; 150/km2, road density &amp;ge; 14 km/km2, federal ownership, and US Environmental Protection Agency Level III ecoregions. Of the remaining 12,256 ZCTAs, 26.8% were considered to be moderate-to-high risk based on short-term declarations (2000-2011) and 29.4% were considered to be moderate-to-high risk based on long-term declarations (1964-2011). Lower risk locations for procuring biomass supply for both short-term and long-term declarations, across all risk factors, were in southern Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas.</jats:p>"

The idea of digital management of supply chains will be crucial in the future. Digitalization has affected every facet of businesses, including operating styles and supply chains. Today's enterprises can change their supply chain structures from a hybrid of printed and IT-supported procedures to more adaptable, open, quick-moving, and participatory digital models thanks to Technology like RFID, GPS, and sensors. Different from hybrid supply chain approaches, which have led to rigid organizational structures, unavailability of data, and fragmented connections with partners, digital supply chains enable the automation of business operations and the digital management of firm assets. In the future supply chain networks, threat management will require an electronic supply chain risk monitoring system. Digitalizing the entire supply chain will make a considerable quantity of current information available, enabling speedier detection and response to any issues.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Defence is the largest item of physical expenditure in the Union budget presented by the Government of India every year. A substantial portion of the budget is allocated for equipping the army, a task which is performed by a very complex and extended supply chain. Therefore, it is essential that the performance of the military’s supply chain is measured and monitored, so that the nation derives value from the expenditure made on the supply chain. Moreover, the effectiveness of the supply chain provides the defence forces competitive advantage, and thus its performance has a direct bearing on the country’s security. The wars in future are more likely to be a competition between the rival supply chains.\nDevelopment of a suitable framework for measuring the performance of any extended supply chain is a challenging task. The challenge arises from the very design and nature of the supply chain construct. The entities which constitute the supply chain invariably have varied goals and objectives, and therefore more than often, they indulge in adversarial practices and operate in an environment of mutual distrust. The paper dwells upon the conceptual development of an ideal performance measurement framework for the military supply chain. It compares the military and commercial supply chains, and discusses some of the principal performance measurement frameworks, like the Balanced scorecard, Supply Chain Operations Reference model amongst others used by the commercial supply chains. It also discusses the endeavours made towards supply chain performance evaluation by some of the modern militaries to include that of the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. It also briefly covers the Indian approach to evaluation of supply chain performance. The paper brings out the relevance of the subject, challenges there in, and its importance to the country’s armed forces.</jats:p>"

Elimination rates in NSP are well defined for Escherichia coli, enterococci and Pseudomonas but a lack of knowledge exists regarding elimination rates in NSP concerning the parasitic protozoans Giardia and Cryptosporidium. First studies indicate that in-situ zooplankton filtration proved to reduce these protozoans efficiently: the in-situ elimination of Cryptosporidium is dependent on the population of zooplankton. In the 50% percentile the elimination rate is four times faster than in the chlorinated pool. The ex-situ elimination of Cryptosporidium in an NSP is approximately 10% faster than in a chlorinated pool. In ex-situ treatment of NSP the elimination rate reached 2 log-steps versus 1 log-step in chlorinated pools. For the further development of NSP for the best possible hygiene and health status some elementary questions, stated in this paper, will have to be solved in the next years or decades. This work describes the in-situ (water treatment inside the pool) and ex-situ water treatment (water treatment via external water treatment plants) of NSP, and the influence of zooplankton in existing NSP on the elimination rate of Cryptosporidium and Giardia.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the development of digital platforms and software programs has made it possible to track and monitor shipments in real-time, improving visibility and transparency throughout the whole supply chain. As a result, there is a lower chance of mistakes and delays occurring, and businesses are better able to make data-driven decisions and react rapidly to shifting market demands. Additionally, technology has aided in the development of novel business models, such as e-commerce, which have completely altered the conventional supply chain and logistics industry. Companies now need to accommodate smaller, more frequent orders and offer quicker delivery dates due to the increase of internet purchasing. This prompted the creation of fresh strategies and the innovation of delivery drones and autonomous vehicles. In conclusion, technology has transformed logistics and supply chain management, creating new chances for businesses to enhance customer experience, improve operations, and gain a competitive edge.</jats:p>"

I specifically draw on fundamental concepts from sociological agency theory and resource dependency theory to develop a middle-range theory that generates previously untested hypotheses about carriers' longitudinal safety performance for these classes of safety behaviors following the CSA program's inception. The hypotheses are investigated by fitting a series of multivariate latent curve models to four years of panel data for 484 big for-hire vehicle carriers operating in the United States. The empirical findings confirm the theoretical expectations and persist during robustness testing. These findings have significant consequences for academics, motor carrier executives, purchasers of motor carrier transportation services, and policymakers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Attention to energy efficiency is recently experiencing substantial growth. To overcome the several barriers currently existing that represent an obstacle to the successful implementation of the wide set of energy efficiency measures available, the cooperation among members of a supply chain offers a huge potential. In supply chains, in addition to the traditional coordination of the operations, the members may also share financial resources or act jointly on the capital market. This study presents a two-stage supply chain model considering the opportunity to invest in new energy efficient technologies which are affected by learning effects: the member of the supply chain with better energy performance and/or better financial conditions may find it more profitable to invest in the development of the energy efficiency of its partner. The objective of the model is to determine the optimal investment for each supply chain member so as to maximize the Net Present Value of the supply chain. The impacts of the proposed joint decision-making are investigated through some numerical analysis and managerial insights are proposed: the joint decision-making process on the financial flows for the energy efficiency investments results are especially advantageous (up to a 20% increase of the supply chain Net Present Value) when members have different access to capital, which could be the result of different economic conditions in companies’ countries, as well as different credit policies or different credit ratings.</jats:p>"

To understand the customer preferences of durable-goods consumers, we use the Perval scale that is highly studied in the literature as a basis for many sectors except white goods. Another goal of this study is to generate a survey to measure the perceived value of white goods’ customers, eventually to be named as WhitePerval. The outline of this survey generation process begins with examining the literature of Perceived Value, Consumption Values and Perval scale and continues with the adoptation process of Perval over white goods customers. Qualitative research design is used to clarify our research construct. For that purpose, content analysis and a survey design on the construct, validity and reliability analysis are also studied for WhitePerval. The adopted WhitePerval scale can be extended to cover perceived value measurement for all types of home appliance products and may also be an input for other models in other countries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rare metals (RMs) are becoming increasingly important in high-tech industries associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as the electric vehicle (EV) and 3D printer industries. As the growth of these industries accelerates in the near future, manufacturers will also face greater RM supply risks. For this reason, many countries are putting considerable effort into securing the RM supply. For example, countries including Japan, Korea, and the USA have adopted two major policies: the stockpile system and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Therefore, it is necessary for the manufacturers with RMs to establish a suitable supply chain plan that reflects this situation. In this study, the RM classification matrix is created based on the stockpile and recycling level in Korea. Accordingly, three different types of supply chain are designed in order to develop the closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) planning model of RM, and the CLSC planning models of RM are validated through experimental analysis. The results show that the stockpiling and the EPR recycling obligation increase the amount of recycled flow and reduce the total cost of the part manufacturing, which means that these two factors are significant for obtaining sustainability of the RMs’ CLSC. In addition, the government needs to set an appropriate sharing cost for promoting the manufacturer’s recycling. Also, from the manufacturer’s perspective, it is better to increase the return rate by making a contract with the collectors to guarantee the collection of used products.</jats:p>"

A number of literatures reveal the research of supply chain management developmenth that has implemented RFID technology. Generally, the method is implemented by combining and informing the journal about cost-benefit analysis model in a company that applies RFID tag technology integratedly from production line, delivery up to management of retailer part. Currently, all links from the entire supply chain need to integrate those different parts and have better controls to get better returns. This integration must offer the ability for the company to have a thorough and transparent insight into its supply chain activities. Intelligent supply chains that are primarily supported by RFID technology can meet these integration needs. By using RFID, a company can benefit from several advantages. One of them is cost reduction and time efficiency. This paper attempts to recommend a model to estimate the benefits of implementing RFID in companies that have an integrated supply chain process. The proposed model is used to find out the value of depreciation and RFID price tag that can provide maximum benefit from RFID implementation. Examples of case studies provide a better understanding of calculation model &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This paper analyses the relationship between pressure and consumption in a water distribution network equipped with remote water meter reading. Based on end use breakdowns, the paper estimates the percentage of pressure-dependent consumption.

This paper explores the interactions between multiple stakeholders of an IBWT green supply chain through the game-theoretic and coordination research approaches considering the government’s subsidy to the WGL improvement under the SWM. The study and its findings complement the IBWT literature in the area of the green supply chain and social welfare maximization modeling. The analytical modeling results with and without considering the SWM are compared. A numerical analysis for a hypothetical IBWT green supply chain is conducted to draw strategic insights from this study. The research results indicate that (1) If the SWM is not considered, coordination strategy could effectively improve the operations performances of the IBWT supply chain and its members, the consumers’ surplus, and the social welfare when compared with the equilibrium strategy; (2) If the SWM is considered, the IBWT green supply chain and its members have a strong intention to adopt the equilibrium strategy to gain more profits, while the government has a strong intention to encourage the IBWT green supply chain and its members to adopt the coordination strategy to maximize social welfare with a smaller public subsidy; (3) The government’s subsidy policy should be designed and provided to encourage the IBWT green supply chain and its members to improve WGL and pursue the SWM, and a subsidy threshold policy can be designed to maximize social welfare with a lower subsidy budget: only when the IBWT green supply chain and its members adopt the coordination strategy can they get a subsidy from the government.</jats:p>"

This processing plant produces a concentrate of copper and cobalt, and it also generates a large amount of effluents equivalent to 2,500 m3/h. The complex nature of these effluent has become a threat to human lives, vegetation, as well as to freshwater resources in the surrounding areas. During this investigation, it was found that NCK effluents have high turbidity and high levels of sulphates compared with EPA standards. These sulphates originate from acid mine water used as one of the components for the flotation process. Also, high chlorides compared with EPA standards and hardness levels due to high concentrations of calcium and magnesium were recorded. Furthermore, the effluents contain heavy metals such as zinc, copper, cobalt, lead, ion, cadmium, and arsenic. Water used during flotation and downstream processes to produce copper and cobalt concentrates was a mixture of raw water from Kamalenge pond and acid mine water from Kipushi mine in a volume ratio of 70/30 respectively. However, it was found that the mine water is the major contributor to the effluent contamination.</jats:p>",

This article analyses some of the main studies dealing with inter-organizational control in the context of supply chain. We present literature review on this type of control, its typology and its approaches and theories. Thanks to its marine biological heritage, Morocco is a world exporter of sea products. The fish preserve sector occupies an important place in the Moroccan economy with a large turnover. This paper presents an exploratory study of this sector where we try to explain the functioning within the canneries of the Souss Massa region in terms of logistic management, the management control function, the management of transport and costs and finally the performance management methods. Based on 12 interviews with managers of canneries in the region, the results of this exploratory study will form the basis on which we will base our main study.</jats:p>"

China has realized that natural gas, as a low-carbon energy source, fits with the nation’s energy demand and will play a critical role in the energy transition, but the actual industry development is slower than expected. By analyzing the major gas corporations around the world, the paper finds that the key factors of the sector are supply and price of the energy resource. A comprehensive analysis on domestic and foreign imported gas reveals a trend of oversupply in China in the future. Given the critical import dependence, China has introduced a series of gas price reforms since 2013, which have led to negative impacts on important gas consumption sectors including power generation. With the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) model, we find that under the prevailing gas supply structure and price level, the economy of utility gas power generation will remain unprofitable, while combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) is only commercially feasible in coastal developed regions. If continuing, such a trend will not only bring forth disastrous consequences to gas power industry, but also damage the upstream gas industry, more importantly, impede the energy transition. We conclude the paper with policy implications on pricing mechanism reform, developing domestic unconventional gas and the R&amp;D of gas turbine.</jats:p>"

The optimal design parameters of the stilling basin are investigated to minimize the length of the hydraulic jump and ratio of the sequent depths of the jump while the relative amount of energy loss is maximized. In order to model the relationship between design variables of the bed, the experimental results are converted to a data-driven simulation model on the basis of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network. Then, the validated MLP model is used in a genetic algorithm optimization model in order to determine the optimum characteristics of the bed under the hydraulic jump considering the interaction between the bed design variables and the hydraulic parameters of the flow. Results indicate that the optimum values of bed slope and the diameter of the corrugated roughness (2r) can be considered as −0.02 and 20 millimetres, respectively.</jats:p>",

Rainwater harvesting involves the collection of water from roofs during rainfall events, while greywater recycling is the reuse of water from hand basins and showers for use in toilets and urinals. The feasibility of these systems was investigated via three areas of focus: drivers and barriers; system operation; savings to the water network. Initial results show volumetric wastewater tariffs are primary drivers for water efficiency and conservation. However, a lack of consistent regulation, perceived risks of water quality issues and loss of space for storage are perceived as barriers. Case-study buildings showed that, in locations where both water and wastewater are charged volumetrically, the relative benefit–cost comparisons were judged as acceptable by building management. Where only water is charged volumetrically (with wastewater based on annual rating valuations), this was less favourable. Water quality tests showed only minimal imperfections. Concerns appear to be largely an issue of perceived risk rather than actual risk. Together with site visits, the water quality testing has contextualised valuable feasibility, design and operational opportunities. The savings to the water networks, however, appear to be minimal.</jats:p>",

The RFs are formulated as hierarchy structures and Fuzzy AHPs as a Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) tool applied to judge the viable candidates. Based on a fuzzy AHP approach, a revised risk matrix with a continuous scale is proposed to assess the RFs' classes.

Each firm decides whether to outsource the retail or manufacture to the exclusive third-party enterprise and thus forms a decentralized supply chain structure. On the premise that third-party enterprises have no advantage on sales and manufacture cost, the revenue-sharing contract is introduced between the manufacturer and retailer, and the influence of decentralized structure on the game equilibrium structure and supply chain profit is analyzed based on Hotelling model. The results show that, when compared with centralized structure, decentralized supply chain has the structural advantage to improving not only its supply chain profits but also the competing chain. This interesting insight is counterintuitive to the common “double marginalization” effect and explains the outsourcing strategy from the perspective of supply chain competition. In addition, we find the dominant strategy in the evolutionary game is that both two chains are decentralized or integrated.</jats:p>"

The main objective of the present study is to investigate the possibility of LNG supply for sustainable electricity production in insular small-scale electricity systems. A novel multicriteria evaluation model has been developed, based on the methods of Additive Value Model, PROMETHEE and Simos approach. A set of coherent criteria has been selected, that fits perfectly with the demands of this type of problem. The proposed methodology has been implemented in four Greek islands (as they are the most indicative examples and with future perspectives to use natural gas for electricity production) and in one power plant in the mainland (as another typical example of small-scale electricity production). The evaluation process included four supply alternatives that cover the annual fuel demands of the examined regions. The obtaining ranking showed that the development of a network supplying individual small-scale terminals in a roundtrip is preferable, compared to the separate supply of each terminal.</jats:p>"

Negative labor supply effects can severely reduce the comparative cost advantage of informal over formal care arrangements. When designing long‐term care (LTC) policies, it is crucial to understand the effects not only on health outcomes but also on labor supply behavior of informal caregivers. We evaluate labor supply reactions to the introduction of the German long‐term care insurance in 1995 using a difference‐in‐differences approach. The long‐term care insurance changes the caregivers' trade‐off between labor supply and care provision. The aim of the reform was to strengthen informal care arrangements. We find a strong negative labor supply effect for men but not for women. We argue that the LTC benefits increased incentives for older men to leave the labor market. The results reveal a trade‐off for policy makers that is important for future reforms—in particular for countries that mainly base their LTC system on informal care.</jats:p>",

Phosphorus, potassium and iron contents were also lower in intercrop wheat while increased in sugar beet. The same effect of intercropping on biomass and nutrients uptake was observed in the short term hydroponic experiment. Interestingly, three root parameters including length, soluble carbohydrates and activity of secretory acid phosphatase that are characteristics for phosphorus-deficient plants were enhanced in both species by intercropping irrespective the phosphorus supply level. These data suggested an interspecific interaction beyond the different nutrient acquisition capacity in the intercrop pots.</jats:p>"

This study aimed at evaluating changes in the risk of the occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms and advancing the understanding of how N and P affect the growth of cyanobacteria in a eutrophic lake, Lake Vombsj&amp;ouml;n, in southern Sweden. Statistical analysis was used to demonstrate the pattern of cyanobacterial blooms, that the highest content present in September and the later that algal blooms occur, the more likely it is a cyanobacterial bloom as cyanobacteria became dominating in October and November (90%). Two hypothesises tested in Lake Vombsj&amp;ouml;n confirmed namely that a high total phosphorus (TP) level correlates with an abundance of cyanobacteria and that low N:P ratio (total nitrogen/total phosphorus &amp;lt; 20) favours the growth of cyanobacteria. To control the growth of cyanobacteria in Lake Vombsj&amp;ouml;n, the TP level should be kept below 20 &amp;micro;g/L and the N:P ratio be maintained at a level of over 20. The two species Planktothrix agardhii, and Pseudanabaena spp. should be carefully monitored especially in late autumn. Future work should consider any high degree of leakage from the sediment of the dissolved phosphorus available there.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last few decades, many studies have identified an increasing number of natural hazards associated with extreme precipitation and drought events in Europe. During the 20th century, the climate in Central Europe and the Mediterranean region was characterised by an overall temperature increase, and the beginning of the 21st century has been marked by severe and prolonged drought events. The aim of this study is to analyse variations in the moisture supply during the 2003 drought episode that affected large portions of Europe. In order to better characterise the evolution of the episodes across the continent, separate analyses were performed for two spatial domains: Central Europe and the Mediterranean region. These regions were defined according to the 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report. For both regions, this drought episode was most severe from 1980 to 2015, according to the one-month Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-1) analysis, which was conducted using monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from the Climate Research Unit. Analyses of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, pressure velocity at 500 hPa, and vertically integrated moisture flux were conducted to characterise the anomalous patterns over the regions during the event. A Lagrangian approach was then applied in order to investigate possible continental-scale changes in the moisture supply over the Central European and Mediterranean regions during 2003. This approach is based on the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model, integrated with data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF): the ECMWF Re-Analysis ERA-Interim. The results indicate that anomalous subsidence, increased evapotranspiration, and reduced precipitation predominated over both regions during the episode. The most intense reduction in the moisture supply over Central Europe was registered for the Mediterranean Sea (MDS) and the Central European region, while for the Mediterranean region, most intense reduction in the moisture supply was observed in the MDS and—in minor-scale—Gibraltar regions.</jats:p>"

This article first studies the asymmetry among the retailers in terms of the different characteristics of the cost, price, quantity. This article finds that a supplier's profits increase when the number of retailers are high enough in the retail market, even though the retail price of the retailers is lower than that of the supplier, or the wholesale price is cut down when there are many retailers competing in the retail market. On the other hand, under certain conditions, the efficiency of supply chain goes to 1. In this article, the authors show that some traditional contracts that can perfectly coordinate the single-channel supply chain, while failing to coordinate the dual-channel supply chain. Therefore, this article puts forth a linear quantity discount contract and first proves it can be applicable to the dual-channel supply chain with asymmetric retailers under a certain special condition where the lead retailer exits the retail market. The authors examine contracts which can reduce the loss of the efficiency, though they cannot completely coordinate a dual-channel supply chain.</jats:p>",

To respond to these challenges, automotive supply chain incorporates flexibility in the order‐fulfillment process through vehicle trades. This study focuses on a new category of vehicle trades where dealers trade vehicles that are still under production (<jats:italic>order‐trades</jats:italic>) and in the delivery phase of the order‐fulfillment process (<jats:italic>distribution‐trades</jats:italic>). Using empirical data in an experimental design setting, order‐ and distribution‐trades are shown to improve flexibility in order fulfillment, with no additional costs for the manufacturer. Different managerial levers such as trade fees and trade caps are evaluated to develop insights for managing vehicle trades. The results show that the involvement of the manufacturer in planning order‐ and distribution‐trades helps in lowering inventory, reducing lost sales, and improving logistics costs for the entire supply chain.</jats:p>",

This paper deals with channel coordination and decision-making in a CSR supply chain that is comprised of a dominant retailer and n homogeneous suppliers. The Stackelberg game is employed to analyze the optimal decision-making of this supply chain under either decentralized or centralized decision-making processes. After that, the thought and method of super conflict equilibrium are used to design the coordination decision-making mechanism of this supply chain based on the cost sharing of CSR to solve channel conflict and to optimize the decision. The results show that the proposed mechanism based on the cost sharing of CSR is better than those with only either the retailer or the suppliers being CSR; and it can well describe the relationship between the retailer and the suppliers, and increase the eagerness of the retailer and suppliers to carry out their CSR under various circumstances without having the profits adversely affected. As a matter of fact, this mechanism maximizes the profits of the entire supply chain system and also enhances the competitiveness of the chain.</jats:p>"

In this study, the inhibitory effect of aqueous extracts of Ranunculus aquatilis and Nasturtium officinale on Microcystis aeruginosa growth was assessed via six treatments (0%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1% extracts). Chlorophyll a and carotenoid content were analyzed and changes in cell and colonial morphology of M. aeruginosa cultures were observed. Also, to reveal potential allelochemical compounds, total phenols (TPs), total flavonoids (TFs), and tannins (TTs) were analyzed in both extracts. The obtained results showed that M. aeruginosa growth was significantly inhibited by R. aquatilis and N. officinale aqueous extracts in a concentration-dependent way. After 8 days of treatment, the highest inhibition rates reached 100% and 75.74% respectively. The Chlorophyll a and carotenoid concentrations were decreased compared to the control group. Colonial and cell and colonial morphology changes were observed under the treatment group with 1% of aqueous extract accompanied by sedimentation of the cyanobacterial cells. This study shows that M. aeruginosa growth inhibition was induced by the total polyphenol, flavonoids and tannins. It was concluded that theses macrophytes may control M. aeruginosa and may be useful to control harmful blooms in lake-reservoirs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reduced oil supply flow rates in fluid film bearings can cause cavitation, or lack of a fully developed hydrodynamic film layer, at the leading edge of the bearing pads. Reduced oil flow has the well-documented effects of higher bearing operating temperatures and decreased power losses and is commonly referred to as starvation. This study looks at the effects of oil supply flow rate on steady-state bearing performance and provides increased experimental data for comparison to computational predictions. Tests are conducted on a five-pad tilting-pad bearing positioned in a vintage, flooded housing with oil supply nozzles. Pad temperatures, sump temperature, journal operating position, and motor input power are measured at various operating speeds ranging from 2000 to 12,000 rpm and various oil supply flow rates. Predicted results are obtained from bearing modeling software based on thermoelastohydrodynamic (TEHD) lubrication theory. A starved flow model was previously developed as an improvement over the original flooded flow model to more accurately capture bearing behavior under reduced flow conditions. Experimental results are compared to both flow models. The starved bearing model predicts significantly higher journal operating positions than the flooded model and shows good correlation with the experimental data. Predicted pressure profiles from the starved bearing model show cavitation of the upper unloaded pads that increase in severity with increasing speed and decreasing oil supply flow rate. The progressive unloading of these top pads explains the rise in shaft centerline position and helps further validate the starvation model.</jats:p>",

The two-stage least squares (2SLS) results reveal that own price elasticity of demand (PED) is price elastic, and the cross-price elasticity (XED)with sawtimber approaches unit elasticity. On the supply side, CNS is price inelastic in supply (PES), but more responsive to own price changesthan sawtimber quantity supplied. Further, severance tax increases are found to decrease the supply of CNS, indicating that suppliers are responsive to severance tax incidence. As the first empirical estimation of CNS, the findings should be of interest to those involved in the analysis of Southeastern stumpage markets.</jats:p>"

One of the main problems of using biomass products for renewable energy production is the fact that several constraints should be imposed for both the management of forests and land. There are different aspects of optimal management of biomass products that guarantees the sustainability of the ecological systems. In this article, an analysis of the management for forest and agricultural products from energy crops is presented, demonstrating latest trends in biomass products as primal resource for renewable energy.

The unit is cooled by ram air and hence, exposed to the extreme external thermal environment that changes typically from +55°C to -40°C, from ground to cruising altitude within a few minutes. Hence the design should meet the thermal requirements of the electronics inside the packaging adequately, for both the positive and negative extremities of the temperature, so that device limiting temperatures are not exceeded. At the same time, it must accommodate the necessary circuitry. Details of the thermal and mechanical design and performance of the MOPS unit at various altitudes, hot spot location, flow requirements and optimal heat sink design are presented in this paper.</jats:p>"

Three game theoretic models of a supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer are built to investigate a manufacturer and retailer’s pricing and investment decision for products with different initial carbon footprints considering consumer environmental awareness. Through a systematic comparison and numerical analysis, the results show that a carbon labelling scheme can significantly reduce the overall carbon emission supply chain and have an initially negative impact on the manufacturer and retailer’s profits.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a closed-loop supply chain for electronic products, the manufacturer’s priority is to enhance the residual value of the collected end-of-use product and decide whether to outsource this business to a retailer, a third-party service, or retain it exclusively. In this paper, we constructed three models to study the decision mechanism in a closed-loop supply chain, with different players selected to collect the used product. By comparing the three models, we characterized the conditions under which the manufacturer will benefit most, and we then aimed to determine the best choice for the manufacturer. Our findings show that, when the retailer and the third-party service provider provide equal performance in collecting the used product, the manufacturer will give priority to the third-party service provider if they choose to outsource this business. If the reverse flows managed by the retailer result in a higher payoff for the manufacturer, then the manufacturer will choose to outsource this business to the retailer who will also benefit.</jats:p>"

States have their own mechanism of drinking water supply through urban and rural local bodies. Drinking water supply itself is a multidimensional phenomenon of sources, quality, accessibility, sufficiency, etc. This study combines various aspects of drinking water supply at the district level, by assigning weights through analytic hierarchy process, to result in a drinking water supply index. The spatial pattern of drinking water supply index is not in favor of the areas having abundant natural water endowment. Areas which are low in the natural endowment of water are better in drinking water supply, while areas which have abundant natural water are not able to manage the available water and are low on the drinking water supply index. Among various socio-economic-political factors, water governance is most important in the wake of water supply being the function of urban and rural local bodies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last decade, researchers and practitioners became more interested in the domain of vulnerability analysis. It is considered as a key element in defining and managing supply chain risks. The great complexity of a global supply chain and of its environment, coupled with managerial trends, makes such a chain more vulnerable to disruptive events. A clear understanding of the possible consequences generated of this combination is a fundamental step to build an effective risk management plan and strategies. However, more studies are needed in order to develop the understanding of supply chain vulnerability. This article provides an explorative framework in order to analyze and quantify vulnerability within supply chains. Based on the existent literature, this article explores the factors that affect the level of Supply Chain Vulnerability (SCV). Four key components of SCV are identified (i.e. Exposure, Sensitivity, Susceptibility and Preparedness level). Based on these four categories of SCV, a conceptual model is developed. Such a model enables the definition of clear metrics and can further be used by researchers and practitioners to build consistent quantification methodologies.</jats:p>",

This paper resolves the above issues, through analyzing and predetermining it in a Multiple Supply Voltage (MSV) design during the floorplanning stage. Simulations were carried out in Cadence digital Encounter system with 180nm technology for the circuit net list of 8 point FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and FIR filter. Results show that floorplanning scheme is powerful in reducing 100% of voltage drop and 50% of EM risk in the chip as compared to previous works.  </jats:p>"

Several data sources were used relating weather effects to pipe failure: pipe failure data, regional weather data from different weather stations in the Netherlands, soil settlement data obtained from satellites and (modelled) pressure data. For asbestos-cement (AC) and cast iron (CI) pipes, temperature was an important factor. CI pipes showed increased pipe failures at low temperatures, which confirms results from previous studies, whereas AC pipes showed increased pipe failures at high temperatures. Pipe failure rates were higher for pipes that on average received higher internal pressures. This study also showed that wind resulted in additional pipe failures caused by uprooting of trees during a severe storm. With respect to drought, in some regions in the Netherlands, increased pipe failures during periods of drought were found. A small influence of soil settlement on pipe failure was found using remote-sensing techniques for a small area (5 × 10 km) in the Netherlands.</jats:p>",

In order to guarantee sustainable land management, it is of great relevance to gain spatial information on this ecosystem service. Unsustainable land management with regard to nutrient regulation may, for example, result in eutrophication which has been identified as a major threat for the environmental state of our water bodies. In the first step of research, the potential supplies and demands of/for nutrient regulation were assessed and mapped at two different spatial scales: The German federal state of Schleswig-Holstein (regional scale) and the Bornhöved Lakes District (local scale). The assessment was undertaken for nitrogen, as an exemplary nutrient. Subsequently, potential supply and demand, combined with the nitrate leaching potential and the groundwater nitrate concentration, were incorporated into a correlation analysis. The data was statistically analysed with varying pre-processing and spatial resolutions. The statistical analysis reveals that large scale data with low resolution leads to more uncertain results. Decreasing the spatial scale and increasing the resolution of the data through a spatially more explicit assessment, leads to more explicit results. It is striking that the study reveals a spatial mismatch between the potential supply and demand for the ecosystem service nutrient regulation, which denotes unsustainable land management in the study areas.</jats:p>"

However, the nature of offshore operations causes GT to operate at 30% efficiency, which is low when compared with overall normal average efficiency of 55% for combined cycle gas power plants. This increases fuel consumption and the emission of air pollutants, among other disadvantages. The issue can be ameliorated by integrating the system to the onshore grid and to a wind energy system, supplemented with an energy storage component. This research developed a new methodology to evaluate the integration of offshore oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico to a hybrid electrical system of wind energy, battery components and interconnection to onshore electrical grid to improve its performance. The objectives included improving overall electric generation efficiency, decreasing both fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions and potentially increasing income by selling surplus energy from renewable sources. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Big Data analyses were applied to data generated by the NOAA's WaveWatch III to calculate offshore wind energy for assessment for use on more than 4,000 offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico from data provided by the USGS CMGP, while simultaneously evaluating interconnection feasibility with the onshore grid. The results for the distance analysis were favorable, considering the criteria expressed by previous research. Wind energy assessment revealed a seasonal behavior, with each month showing distinctive power outputs. High power levels were obtained from November to April while overall low power levels were observed from June to August. However most of the 4,000 platforms produced wind power levels above the commercial threshold and an important percentage of the locations produced power levels above capacity factor thresholds that made them exceptionally productive. Overall results indicated that all the locations were within accepted feasible distance from the coast and most of them had acceptable wind energy levels. The proposed GIS methodology can be applied for individual projects, with specific spatial and time resolution. The results of these studies can assist stakeholders on decision making processes of offshore projects.</jats:p>",

The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with seven treatments combinations replicated two time. The treatments were - T1-organic ( 100% R.D.F.) ,T2-Inorganic nutrient supply system.(Rhizobium + PSB + Azotobactor + FYM ), T3—Integrated  nutrient supply system.( 50% R.D.F. +50% FYM + Rhizobium PSB + Azotobactor  ), T4- maximum yield nutrient supply system. T5- biodyamics or Ecofriendly nutrient supply system.. T6- natural (No fertilizer) ,T7-fallow . The fertilizer were applied as a basal dose as per the treatments. The observation on growth i.e. height of plant and number of functional leaves and yield were recorded by using five randomly selected plants of soybean,pigeon pea and sorghum in each treatment plot. The selected plants were labelled and all subsequent biometric observations were recorded on labelled plants during the course of investigation.The judicious use of biofertilizers like rhizobium, azotobactor ,phosohate solubilizing  bacteria with organic manures helped in building up of soil microflora .It also help to augment the availabity of nutrient that could be easily assimilated by plants. The results revealed that the Maximum Yield nutrient supply system ( MYNSS  ) is significantly superior to other system and it was at par with integrated nutrient supply system.</jats:p>"

This article offers an empirically grounded response to these calls from a critical realist stance in the context of global food supply chains. We examine how an imaginary for sustainable farming structured around an instrumental construction of empowerment limits what is viewed as permissible, desirable, and possible in global food supply chains. We adopt a multimodal critical discourse analysis to examine the sustainable farming imaginary for smallholder farmers constructed by one large organization, Unilever, in a series of videos produced and disseminated on YouTube. We expose the underlying mechanisms of power and marginalization at work within the sustainability imaginary and show how ‘empowerment’ has the potential to create new dependencies for these farmers. We recontextualize the representations to show that while the imaginary may be commercially feasible, it is less achievable in terms of empowering smallholder farmers. </jats:p>",

To secure long-term business in distant markets, small- and medium-sized (SME) seafood exporters have shifted the focus from transactional approaches to relationships and networking as a means of improving export performance.

The investigated pipes included GSP (Galvanized Steel Pipe), CIP (Cast Iron Pipe), STSP (Stainless Steel Pipe), and PVCP (Polyvinyl Chloride Pipe). Assessment of corrosion impact on the different materials of pipes was conducted by analyzing the corrosion accelerators and inhibitors related to the characteristics of reclaimed water. Reclaimed water with higher ionic content showed a faster corrosion rate than tap water because corrosion accelerators have more of an effect on pipe corrosion than do corrosion inhibitors. In terms of pipe materials, the corrosion rate was fastest in CIP, followed by GSP, and STSP; PVCP exhibited no electrochemical corrosion.</jats:p>"

The module includes an electromagnetic vibration energy harvester based on micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology and a processing circuit. The vibration energy harvester presented in this paper is fabricated by an integrated microfabrication process and consists of four similar and relatively independent beam vibration elements. The main functions of the processing circuit are to convert the output of the harvester from unstable alternating current (AC) to stable direct current (DC), charge the super capacitor, and ensure the stable output of the super capacitor. The preliminary test results of the harvester chip show that the chip can output discontinuous pulse voltage, and the range of the voltage value is from tens to hundreds of millivolts in the vibration frequency range of 10–90 Hz. The maximum value that can be reached is 563 mV (at the vibration frequency of 18 Hz). The results of the test show that the harvester can output a relatively high voltage, which can meet the general electric power demand of a WSN sensor node.</jats:p>"

It is, thus, relevant to increase the concentration of anthocyanins by agricultural practices. We tested whether the combination of reduced nitrogen (N) supply and extended harvesting periods maximized the anthocyanin concentration of purple carrot roots, ideally without reducing their yield. The carrot variety ‘Deep Purple’ was grown with total N supplies of 220 kg N ha−1 (controls) and 73 kg N ha−1 (reduced N), respectively. Upon harvests in September, October and November, root yield and quality were assessed. Concentrations of chlorophylls (leaves) and anthocyanins (roots and leaves) were determined by spectroscopic and chemical analyses, and carbon and N content were quantified. Reduced N supply neither affected leaf or root biomass nor their chemical composition. Later harvests did not impact the yield of roots, but increased their diameter by 8.5–20%. Additionally, the anthocyanin concentrations of the roots increased by 40–50% in the controls, but not in N-limited plants, at late harvests. Consequently, extending the harvesting period might increase the anthocyanin concentration in roots of ‘Deep Purple’. Moreover, N supply might be reduced for this carrot variety without negative effects on root yield.</jats:p>"

The primary origin of these particles in most networks has not been examined. Controlled sediment resuspension (flushing) events were performed at 10 sites in a drinking water distribution system and repeated six months later to observe redeposition. Different patterns of sediment deposition observed are suspected to be related to particle origin. A large proportion of pipe sediment resuspended during the first flushing event was composed of iron, most likely arising from corrosion of distribution system infrastructure. This sediment appears to play a role in sheltering microbial cells from secondary disinfection. In this study, a source of particles was identified that may provide an alternate explanation for the presence of iron deposits in systems not dominated by iron pipework.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> How should decentralized supply chains set the profit sharing terms using minimal information on demand and selling price? We develop a distributionally robust Stackelberg game model to address this question. Our framework uses only the first and second moments of the price and demand attributes, and thus can be implemented using only a parsimonious set of parameters. More specifically, we derive the relationships among the optimal wholesale price set by the supplier, the order decision of the retailer, and the corresponding profit shares of each supply chain partner, based on the information available. Interestingly, in the distributionally robust setting, the correlation between demand and selling price has no bearing on the order decision of the retailer. This allows us to simplify the solution structure of the profit sharing agreement problem dramatically. Moreover, the result can be used to recover the optimal selling price when the mean demand is a linear function of the selling price (cf.

This paper presents a hydrological balance assessment of catchments in Western Bohemia for present and future conditions together with possible directions for climate change adaptation at the local scale. Assessment of climate change impacts on hydrological balance components using an ensemble of regional climate models revealed an increase in air temperature for all months during the year leading to an increase in evaporation. Along with changes in precipitation distribution during the year (increasing winter precipitation and decreasing summer precipitation), groundwater recharge and groundwater storage in general both decrease. Adaptation measures such as water transfers and the construction of water reservoirs are assessed with respect to the goal of increasing water availability in the Western Bohemia region during dry periods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The successful implementation of an integrated supply chain strategy enhances total control over the operations and thus enhances speed and flexibility. The objective of this study is two-fold: first to identify the constituents that mold the fast fashion retailing business model, and second to discuss how global leader of fast fashion retailing Inditex-Zara’s product offering is strongly supported by integration of various supply chain operations. The findings suggest that vertical integration through ownership of various operational stages including product design and development, production operation, logistics and distribution channel; appropriate sourcing strategy to meet product needs; application of process/product modularity practices in product design, material procurement and manufacturing to ensure manufacturing flexibility; flexible logistics capability; and all of these seamlessly integrated and coordinated by a centralized IT infrastructure can significantly raise overall supply chain flexibility and responsiveness. Inditex-Zara’s super-responsive supply chain reduces ‘bullwhip effect’, order-to-delivery lead time to stores, ensures lean inventory and high level of responsiveness to adapt and deliver products to stores with latest fashion trends and customer feedbacks at a rapid speed. Thus Inditex-Zara is able to successfully counter the negative effects of short product life cycles, high product variety, demand uncertainty and thus able to closely match product supply to the stores with market demand. This contributes to lower inventory backlogs; avoid mark-down losses and/or inventory stock out.</jats:p>"

Because sediment supply varies by orders of magnitude across North America, the intensity of bedload transport varies by over an order of magnitude. Climate also varies widely across the continent, yielding a range of flood timing, duration, and intermittency. Together, the differences in sediment supply and hydroclimate result in diverse regimes of bed surface stability. To quantitatively characterize this regional variation, we calculate multidecadal time series of estimated bed surface mobility for 29 rivers using sediment transport equations. We use these data to compare predicted bed mobility between rivers and regions. There are statistically significant regional differences in the (a) exceedance probability of bed‐mobilizing flows (<jats:italic>W</jats:italic>* &gt; 0.002), (b) maximum bed mobility, and (c) number of discrete bed‐mobilizing events in a year.</jats:p>",

Supply chain coordination among partners, which is the core part of supply chain management, can be more practical and effective through sharing real-time product data along the supply chain tracked by RFID technology. This paper focused on the study of the supply chain collaborative forecasting process by sharing RFID real-time data. The collaborative forecasting process among supply chain partners based on the sharing RFID product data is discussed for product demand decision in the paper at first. Then, a Stein-rule combination-forecasting model is proposed to integrate the forecasting knowledge and coordinate forecasting process between the retailers and manufactures shared the RFID data in the supply chain. Moreover, in order to enhance collaborative forecasting precision an error correction combination-forecasting model is discussed. Finally, the outcomes of mathematics simulation verify that the forecast combinations with Stein-rule estimation rules and error correction algorithms are effective to improve forecast precision and coordinate RFID-based supply chain. </jats:p>",

Based on the timing characteristics and seasonal division of electric/thermal/cold load fluctuations, the improved fuzzy C means (FCM) algorithm combined with the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is applied to build different multi-scenarios in various functional districts, and a more representative ‘typical maximum load value’ is obtained. The architectural characteristics and the different energy utilization habits are combed on the weight of the electric/thermal/cold load for each functional district. By taking the minimum improved integrated load moment of the system and the minimum partition inner interval ratio as the objective functions, the location optimization model of an integrated energy supply centre in a typical new district is established, and the improved adaptive evolutionary immune algorithm is applied to the nested model. Finally, a typical new district in Northern China is taking as an example to verify the correctness and feasibility of the planning method proposed in this paper.</jats:p>"

In the system, customers are able to upload a product design file, an optimal supply chain design and operations plan are then determined based on the available resources in the network of smart factories. The concept of smart supply chains is discussed and six types of flexibilities are identified, namely: design flexibility, product flexibility, process flexibility, supply chain flexibility, collaboration flexibility, and strategic flexibility. Focusing on supply chain flexibility, a general planning framework and various optimization models for dynamic supply chain design and operations plan are proposed. Further, numerical experiments are conducted to analyze fixed, production, and transportation costs for various scenarios. The results demonstrate the extent of the dynamic supply chain design and operations problem, and the large variation in transportation cost.</jats:p>"

This research proposes to view cash as a commodity used by humanitarian actors in emergency operations and therefore aims to explore how CBRs impact on humanitarian logistics and ultimately, affect beneficiaries.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The methodological approach of grounded theory was chosen for this inquiry because it allowed the researchers to generate a general explanation for the process of CBRs in emergency situations based on the views of participants interviewed. Interviews were conducted with senior managers, supply chain managements and logistics officers from international humanitarian organisations (HOs), United Nations agencies and commercial organisations involved in humanitarian operations. Examples of topics covered during the field work included, procedures and policy; knowledge and information management; systems and technology; actors and agents.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The impact of CBRs on humanitarian operations can though not be understated. They alter supply chain design, the very role of beneficiaries as well as HOs, and change the strategy of aid delivery from push to pull. Perhaps, the most important factor is the elimination of many logistical activities that needed to be performed by HOs. Delivering cash diminishes the needs for lengthy procurement and assessment processes, pre-positioning, transportation and distribution. This bears the potential of significant reductions in costs for delivering humanitarian aid at the same time as it is an important move from aid to trade.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The challenge for humanitarian agencies in the coming years is to overcome their fears surrounding CBRs, and to implement cash programmes where they are judged to be the most appropriate response. This will require not only a change in donor policies, but also a fundamental change in the skill set of humanitarian logisticians, who are used to identifying needs and providing commodities and thus to maintaining control over the provision of assistance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The contribution of this research is twofold: this is the first examination of cash-based interventions in humanitarian operations through the prism of supply chain management. Second, the research is field based and grounded in empirical observations thus adding to the literature and offering insights to practice.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

However, gas turbines operate very inefficiently under the variable offshore conditions, increasing fuel costs and air pollutant emissions. This paper focused on investigating the feasibility of implementing a hybrid electricity supply system for offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, both for the United States and Mexico Exclusive Economic Zones. Geographic Information Systems methodologies were used to analyze the data from various sources. Three different scenarios were studied, including wind power only, wave power only, and wind and wave power combined. The results showed that all the offshore locations were within accepted feasible distance to the coast for connecting to the onshore grid. Most of the locations had acceptable power levels of either wind or wave energy while the combination of both resources can improve the overall energy harvesting efficiency and reduce the variability in a significant number of locations. The proposed methodology can be applied for specific locations with finer spatial and time resolution, which will allow stakeholders to improve the decision making process, generate important savings on the normal operation, reduce pollution, and potentially increase income by selling surplus energy from renewable sources.</jats:p>"

When applied to U.S. data, the estimates from the best performing VAR models indicate, on average, that credit supply shocks that raise spreads by 10 basis points reduce GDP growth and inflation by 1% after one year. These shocks were important during the Great Recession, accounting for about half the decline in GDP growth.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to introduce a geospatial analytical framework for identifying sub-state priority areas to target federal allocation of MAT training and resources.  Methods: We used a geospatial analytical framework, which integrated multiple substance use measures and layers of geographic information. Measures included estimates of illicit drug dependence and unmet treatment need from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), opioid-related admissions from the Treatment Episode Data Set: Admissions (TEDs-A), and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) waiver practitioner data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Analyses included standard deviation outlier mapping, local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), and map overlays.  Results: We identified twenty-nine opioid dependence priority areas, eleven unmet treatment need priority areas, and seven low MAT capacity priority areas, located across the US, including southeastern Ohio, western Indiana, the District of Columbia, New England, and northern and southern California.  Conclusions: This study identified several areas across the US that have unmet need for MAT. Targeting these areas will allow for the most effective deployment of cost-effective MAT resources to aid the greatest number of patients with opioid use disorders.</jats:p>"

Hal tersebut disebabkan karena dalam manual assembly membutuhkan operator yang mempunyai soft skill di bidangnya. Untuk itu penelitian ini membahas mengenai proses manual assembly dalam industri manufaktur. Salah satu bentuk kesalahan yang sering terjadi dalam proses manual assembly adalah penggunaan perkakas yang kurang tertata dalam area assembly sehingga sering terjadi insiden kehilangan peralatan kecil seperti kunci pas, kunci ring, obeng dll. Tooling supply merupakan salah satu metode yang dikembangkan oleh PT.

Effective management of dog populations requires reliable information on their diet, feeding behavior, and social ecology. Free-ranging dogs are reliant on humans, but anthropogenic food subsidies, particularly human faeces (i.e., coprophagy) have not previously been fully quantified. In this study we assess the contributions of different food types to the diet, and their influences on the social behaviour of free-ranging dogs in communal lands of rural Zimbabwe, with a focus on coprophagy. Free-ranging dog diets, body condition, and sociology were studied amongst 72 dogs over 18 months using scat analysis and direct observations. Human faeces constituted the fourth most common item in scats (56% occurrence) and contributed 21% by mass to the observed diet. Human faeces represented a valuable resource because relative to other food items it was consistently available, and of higher nutritional value than ‘sadza’ (maize porridge, the human staple and primary human-derived food), yielding 18.7% crude protein and 18.7 KJ/kg gross energy, compared to 8.3% and 18.5 KJ/kg for sadza, respectively. Human faeces had protein and energy values equivalent to mammal remains, another important food item. Dog condition was generally good, with 64% of adult females and 74% of adult males in the highest two body condition scores (on a five point scale), suggesting a plentiful and high quality food supply. Dogs largely fed alone, perhaps as a consequence of the small, inert, and spatially dispersed items that comprise their diet, and its abundance. We discuss the relationships between sanitation, human development, the supply of human faeces, female dog fertility, and population control.</jats:p>"

The inhalation and ingestion doses for well water varied from 0.022 ± 0.0025 to 0.41 ± 0.0054 mSv y−1 and 0.18± 0.021 to 3.38 ± 0.045 mSv y−1, respectively. 33.33% of spring and 7.32% of well water samples were found with values above the recommendation levels of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (∼11.1 Bq L−1). As a single measurement cannot serve as a best estimate of the unsampled areas in the region, Kriging interpolation method, a geo-statistical method, was used to get an estimate of spatial distribution of water borne radon in the area of study. Kriging mapping shows that higher radon concentrations are found in areas with lithology consisting of sandstones, siltstones, shales and claystones.</jats:p>",

As CSCs currently also serve members using cannabis for medical purposes, this article aims to detail the particular features of Belgian CSCs as suppliers of cannabis for medical use, and how those are perceived by CSC members. In this article, we draw on data gathered through interviews with the managing staff ( n = 21) of seven currently active Belgian CSCs. In addition, we conducted interviews ( n = 21) and an online survey ( n = 80) with members of Belgian CSCs using cannabis for medical reasons. We present Belgian CSCs’ practices building on an adapted version of the health services analytical framework proposed by Belle-Isle et al. This article thus provides a first overview of the features of Belgian CSCs as suppliers of cannabis for medical use as well as members’ perceptions. Structural differences emerged as to how the Belgian CSCs have accommodated medical members’ needs (in mixed CSCs where no formal distinction is made between recreational and medical members, in a separate CSC subunit or in a CSC admitting medical members only). Candidate medical members must fulfill specific criteria, particularly when applying for the medical units. The CSCs have adopted two different types of distribution methods, and the cannabis supplied is produced organically—systematic quality control is, however, lacking. We noted some flexibility in relation to frequency and quantity distributed to medical members. Affordability was positively appreciated by CSC members. Collaboration between CSCs and the health sector remains challenging. Some degree of diversity in practices among CSCs remains, as well as common issues which continue to affect the model in Belgium and are important in understanding the role and potential of CSCs as providers of cannabis for medical use. </jats:p>",

Due to excessive availability UPS are more popular than generators. Although, UPS satisfy the need of consumers during power outage hour but due to efficiency constrains these UPS put extra burden on grid. This study estimates the power loss that occurs in consequence of using inefficient UPS. It has been found that about 3.75% of total power provided by the utility is lost during charging and discharging. The research also provides suggestions to eradicate the efficiency losses which occurred as a result of using UPS.</jats:p>"

It depends on climatic factors and the influence of these factors on each other makes evapotranspiration estimation difficult. This study attempts to explore the possibility of predicting this important component using three different heuristic methods: support vector machine (SVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and gene expression programming (GEP). In this regard, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Penman-Monteith equation, the monthly potential evapotranspiration in four synoptic stations (Zahedan, Zabol, Iranshahr, and Chabahar) was calculated using monthly weather data. The weather data were then used as inputs to the SVM, ANFIS and GEP models to estimate potential evapotranspiration. Five different input combinations were tried in the applications. The results of SVM, ANFIS and GEP models were compared based on the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error and root mean square error. Findings showed that the SVM model, whose inputs are average air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and sunny hours of the current and one previous month, performed better than the other models for the Zahedan, Zabol, Iranshahr, and Chabahar stations. Comparison of the three heuristic methods indicated that in all stations, the SVM, GEP and ANFIS models took first, second, and third place in estimation of the monthly potential evapotranspiration, respectively.</jats:p>",

The major focus therein is on the sensitivity of critical infrastructure technologies and their management\ncontingencies. However, strikingly little attention has been given to assessing and mitigating social vulnerabilities\ntowards the failure of critical infrastructure and to the development, design and implementation of minimum supply\nstandards in situations of major infrastructure failure. Addressing this gap and contributing to a more integrative\nperspective on critical infrastructure resilience is the objective of this paper. It asks which role social vulnerability\nassessments and minimum supply considerations can, should and do – or do not – play for the management and governance of\ncritical infrastructure failure. In its first part, the paper provides a structured review on achievements and remaining\ngaps in the management of critical infrastructure and the understanding of social vulnerabilities towards disaster-related\ninfrastructure failures. Special attention is given to the current state of minimum supply concepts with a regional focus\non policies in Germany and the EU. In its second part, the paper then responds to the identified gaps by developing\na heuristic model on the linkages of critical infrastructure management, social vulnerability and minimum supply. This\nframework helps to inform a vision of a future research agenda, which is presented in the paper's third part. Overall, the\nanalysis suggests that the assessment of socially differentiated vulnerabilities towards critical infrastructure failure\nneeds to be undertaken more stringently to inform the scientifically and politically difficult debate about minimum supply\nstandards and the shared responsibilities for securing them.\n                    </jats:p>"

Consumers, in turn, respond to the various producers' product outputs through the prices that they are willing to pay, given also the average quality associated with each producer or brand at the retail outlets. The quality of the fresh produce is captured through explicit formulae that incorporate time, temperature, and other link characteristics with links associated with processing, shipment, storage, etc. Capacities on links are also incorporated as well as upper bounds on the initial product quality of the firms at their production/harvesting sites. The governing concept of the competitive supply chain network model is that of Nash Equilibrium, for which alternative variational inequality formulations are derived, along with existence results. An algorithmic procedure, which can be interpreted as a discrete-time tatonnement process, is then described and applied to compute the equilibrium produce flow patterns and accompanying link Lagrange multipliers in a realistic case study, focusing on peaches, which includes disruptions.</jats:p>",

This is to identify the active factors that cause port congestion in African ports. The results provided some explanations on the consequences arising from these on notable African logistics and supply chain networks. The findings reveal that the bane of congestion in African ports emanates entirely from either planning, regulation, capacity, efficiency or a combination of these. The regression analysis with IBM SPSS v20 reveals that there is a significant relationship between cargo throughput and other port performance indicators in Nigeria for the study period (2005 - 2014). More so, the t-test reveals that there is a significant relationship between cargo throughput and berth occupancy rate which is significantly indicative of port congestion. This paper therefore recommends that African ports should enhance their regulatory mechanisms, and also improve capacity and efficiency level in order to shoulder the ever increasing challenges of port congestion in years ahead.</jats:p>"

Monitoring CDOM distribution and dynamics in small water is often limited by the coarse spatial resolution of traditional ocean color sensors. In this study, because of its high spatial resolution of 30 m, Landsat-8 data were used to assess seasonal variations of CDOM in the Saginaw River, by using an empirical statistic model. Pearson correlation analysis between CDOM variations and other environmental factors, such as temperature, discharge, and dissolved oxygen, shows that temperature was negatively correlated to CDOM variations and discharge played a positive role. We also calculated the monthly mean aCDOM(440) (the absorption coefficient of CDOM at 440 nm) for the Saginaw River between April and November from 2013 to 2016. This study demonstrates a good example for future applications in small waters: observing CDOM variations and other relevant environmental factors change by using Landsat remote sensing, so that we can know more about water quality and ecosystem health of small waters as well as the climate change impact on regional watersheds.</jats:p>",

Based on a sample of 20 Australian and German garment firms, the authors find that firms with low prior baseline standards revised their supply chain and sourcing policies and signed the Accord. Firms with medium and high baseline standards responded variously, from making no changes to revising their policies and signing the Accord. Firm response variation can be explained by stakeholder pressure occurring in different national industrial and institutional contexts following the Rana Plaza incident, which served as a focusing event. Results suggest the wider applicability of the focusing event framework for industrial relations scholarship and highlight some of the mechanisms driving changes in industrial relations institutions. </jats:p>",

Many firms have started to make sustainable investments, such as adopting the pollution-abatement technologies, to reduce carbon emissions. To investigate the impacts of the sustainable investment on firms’ profit and emission reduction, we consider supply chains with uncertain demand in different power structures. Specifically, we examine the sustainable investment problem in three supply chain power structures, i.e., manufacturer Stackelberg (MS) power structure, vertical Nash (VN) power structure and retailer Stackelberg (RS) power structure. We first derive the optimal decisions for both the retailer and manufacturer in each power structure. Then, by comparing the results in the three power structures, we find that the manufacturer gets benefits from making the sustainable investment, especially in unequal power structures. When the average market size is large (small) enough, both of the supply chain members obtain more profits in the MS (RS) power structure. From an environmental perspective, we find that the emission reduction is more significant in sequential games (i.e., MS and RS power structures) than that in a simultaneous game (i.e., VN power structure). In addition, we conduct some numerical studies and discuss more managerial insights in the paper.</jats:p>"

In this article, we investigate the impact of repeated OOS occurrences under different supply chain design scenarios, which mix the channel replenishment strategy with the inventory responsibility for in‐store shelf management on the retailer versus on the manufacturer. We frame our agent‐based simulation to examine the change in manufacturer's market share that results from OOS scenarios not only under different supply chain distribution scenarios (i.e., traditional versus direct store delivery or DSD), but also with different consumer preference characteristics (i.e., high and low brand loyalty) and varied levels of demand. The agent‐based simulation allows us to examine the impact of consumer learning under repeated OOS situations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the operational decisions and coordination of the supply chain in the presence of risk aversion, where the risk averse retailer’s performance is measured by a combination of the expected profit and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Such performance measure reflects the desire of the retailer to maximize the expected profit on one hand and to control the downside risk of the profit on the other hand. The impact of risk aversion on the supply chain’s decision and performance is also explored. To overcome the inefficiency due to the double marginalization and the aggravation resulting from risk aversion, we investigate the buy-back contract to coordinate the supply chain. Such contract can largely increase the supply chain’s profit, especially when the retailer is more risk averse. Lastly, we extend such risk measure to the widely-used business model nowadays — platform selling model, and explore the impact of the allocation rule on the manufacturer’s decision. </jats:p>",

The harmony search algorithm (HSA), which is a meta-heuristic optimization technique, was used for the optimization model. This method was applied to two water supply systems in South Korea and was verified through case studies using different numbers of re-chlorination points. The results show that the proposed model can be used as an efficient water quality analysis and decision making tool, which showed the optimal re-chlorination dose and little deviation in the spatial distribution.

Given the shipment date, size, origin, destination, and due dates of multiple shipments distributed over space and time, the problem requires determining when to consolidate some of these shipments into one shipment at an intermediate consolidation point so as to minimize shipping costs while satisfying the due date constraints. In this article, the authors develop a mixed-integer programming formulation for a multi-period freight consolidation problem that involves multiple products, suppliers, and potential consolidation points. Benders decomposition is then used to replace a large number of integer freight-consolidation variables by a small number of continuous variables that reduce the size of the problem without impacting optimality. The results show that Benders decomposition provides a significant scale-up in the performance of the solver. The authors demonstrate their approach using a large-scale case with more than 27.5 million variables and 9.2 million constraints.</p>",

The results suggest that S. salsa, as a pioneer species in coastal tidal flats, has a good ability to tolerate the combined stress of salt and eutrophication under hydroponic conditions, although different levels of salinity have different influence on biomass accumulation. Under optimum-growth saline conditions (274 mM NaCl), the removal efficiency of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) by S. salsa for hypereutrophic water reaches 73.23% and 72.21%, respectively. The removal efficiency under different levels of eutrophication in the water shows that TN and TP contents in eutrophic saline water are conducive to plant biomass accumulation; the removal efficiency decreases with increasing element concentration. An ecological floating island system suitable for planting S. salsa has been performed and a practical application of S. salsa to remediate eutrophic water resulting from large-scale mariculture carried out. The plant grew well and aquaculture water quality was significantly improved. Therefore, S. salsa could be applied to remediate hypereutrophic water with high salt content.</jats:p>",

To ensure public safety, water treatment plants must have the capability to remove cyanotoxins from water. Recently, however, there have been several instances when microcystins, a common group of cyanotoxins, have been detected in tap water. This research investigated if commercially available pitcher-style water purifiers were able to remove microcystins from water. Microcystins were extracted from two naturally occurring blooms in Lake Erie, diluted to initial concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 μg/L, and then subjected to three purifier types. Results showed that the purifier with the fastest percolation rate (126 seconds/L) and a filter cartridge comprised solely of coconut-based activated carbon removed 50% or less of the microcystins, while the purifier with the slowest percolation rate (374 seconds/L) and a blend of activated carbon decreased microcystins to below detectable levels (&amp;lt;0.10 μg/L) in all experiments. Thus, pitcher-style purifiers with slow percolation rates and composed of a blend of active carbon can provide an additional layer of protection against microcystins; however, it is recommended that consumers switch water sources when cyanotoxins are confirmed to be in tap water.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to introduce a geospatial analytical framework for identifying sub-state priority areas to target federal allocation of MAT training and resources.\n\nMethods: We used a geospatial analytical framework, which integrated multiple substance use measures and layers of geographic information. Measures included estimates of illicit drug dependence and unmet treatment need from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), opioid-related admissions from the Treatment Episode Data Set: Admissions (TEDs-A), and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) waiver practitioner data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Analyses included standard deviation outlier mapping, local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), and map overlays.\n\nResults: We identified twenty-nine opioid dependence priority areas, eleven unmet treatment need priority areas, and seven low MAT capacity priority areas, located across the US, including southeastern Ohio, western Indiana, the District of Columbia, New England, and northern and southern California.\n\nConclusions: This study identified several areas across the US that have unmet need for MAT. Targeting these areas will allow for the most effective deployment of cost-effective MAT resources to aid the greatest number of patients with opioid use disorders.</jats:p>"

With concerns over environmental issues, such towers are to be environmentally friendly. Conventionally, diesel generator supply power to towers in remote/rural areas, which leads to carbon emission. Also, the operation of diesel generator entails considerable operating cost (fuel and maintenance costs). Thus, a wind‐photovoltaic (PV) based DC microgrid is proposed for supplying power to telecommunication towers in remote/rural areas ensuring reliable, economical, and green power supply. Therefore, techno‐economic analysis is carried out here to determine the feasibility and cost of electricity (COE) per unit of the proposed DC microgrid. A non‐dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is implemented to solve the multi‐objective optimal sizing problem to achieve a trade‐off between the cost and the reliability. Hourly solar irradiation and wind speed data is used for long‐term analysis equivalent to the lifespan of the battery. Further, de‐rating factor and maximum power point tracking factor are considered while modelling the renewable resources. The loss of power supply probability, excess energy, and COE are calculated and different scenarios are studied to examine the techno‐economic feasibility of the proposed DC microgrid.</jats:p>",

To face this problem, National and European policies pushes towards the insertion of distributed energy systems within urban areas as a valid alternative to the traditional centralized energy supply. In this direction, the installation of distributed energy systems gives raise to consumers with production capabilities, by now called ‘prosumers’. They use the autonomously produced energy to satisfy their own energy requirements and distribute the eventual exceed to neighbours. Yet, the energy exchanges occurring among prosumers permit the modelling of a network where nodes are identified as the prosumers and the energy interactions as links. This paper deals with this issue and proposes a cost-based methodology to model the energy distribution network of prosumers within the urban territories by deepening their impact on the traditional supply. Results are discussed by comparing a theoretical energy distribution network to a real case study. </jats:p>",

The literature search was conducted among 6 databases (CINAHL, Medline, PsyncInfo, Scopus, Cochrane, and ProQuest) in between January 2000 to June 2016. Two reviewers independently assessed the articles for the following inclusion criteria: experimental or quasi‐experimental studies; healthy pregnant women participants intending to breastfeed or healthy breastfeeding women who gave birth to a term singleton and healthy baby; intervention administered could have been educational, support, psycho‐social, or breastfeeding self‐efficacy based, offered in prenatal or postnatal or both, in person, over the phone, or with the support of e‐technologies; breastfeeding self‐efficacy or perceived insufficient milk supply as outcomes. Seventeen studies were included in this review; 12 were randomized controlled trials. Most interventions were self‐efficacy based provided on 1‐to‐1 format. Meta‐analysis of RCTs revealed that interventions significantly improved breastfeeding self‐efficacy during the first 4 to 6 weeks (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI 0.11–0.69, <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.006). This further impact exclusive breastfeeding duration. Only 1 study reported data on perceived insufficient milk supply. Women who have made the choice to breastfeed should be offered breastfeeding self‐efficacy‐based interventions during the perinatal period.

Although recent progress in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) and embryonic stem (ES) cells has attracted attention owing to the potential applications of these cells as insulin‐releasing cells, concerns about the safety of implantation of these cells remain. The use of the BAP has the advantage of easy removal if insulin‐releasing cells derived from iPS/ES cells undesirably proliferate and form tumors in the BAP. Oxygen supply is a crucial issue for cell survival in BAPs as insufficient oxygen supply causes central necrosis of cell aggregates. In this study, we derived several simple equations considering oxygen supply in BAPs in order to provide insights into the rational design of three different types of BAPs (spherical microcapsules, cylindrical capsules, and planar capsules). The equations give (i) the thickness of a capsule membrane leading to no central necrosis of encapsulated cell aggregates as a function of the original size of the cell aggregate; (ii) the oxygen concentration profiles in BAPs; (iii) the effects of encapsulation of a cell aggregate on insulin release; (iv) the amount of encapsulated cells required to normalize blood glucose levels of a patient; and (v) the total volumes and sizes of BAPs. As an example, we used the equations in order to design three different types of BAPs for subcutaneous implantation.</jats:p>",

These events are mainly caused by seawater warming, but are exacerbated by the subsequent decrease in nutrient availability in surface waters. It has therefore been shown that nitrogen, phosphorus or iron limitation contribute to the underlying conditions by which thermal stress induces coral bleaching. Generally, information on the trophic ecology of trace elements (micronutrients) in corals, and on how they modulate the coral response to thermal stress is lacking. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that heterotrophic feeding (i.e. the capture of zooplankton prey by the coral host) and thermal stress induce significant changes in micro element concentrations and isotopic signatures of the scleractinian coral <jats:italic>Stylophora pistillata</jats:italic>. The results obtained first reveal that coral symbionts are the major sink for the heterotrophically acquired micronutrients and accumulate manganese, magnesium and iron from the food. These metals are involved in photosynthesis and antioxidant protection. In addition, we show that fed corals can maintain high micronutrient concentrations in the host tissue during thermal stress and do not bleach, whereas unfed corals experience a significant decrease in copper, zinc, boron, calcium and magnesium in the host tissue and bleach. In addition, the significant increase in δ<jats:sup>65</jats:sup>Cu and δ<jats:sup>66</jats:sup>Zn signature of symbionts and host tissue at high temperature suggests that these isotopic compositions are good proxy for stress in corals.

Reducing positive and negative pressures is essential to reducing this risk, improving operational efficiency, and avoiding system component fatigue. This study investigated the performance of a combination of dimensionless pump parameters and pipeline pressure in providing detailed information for designing protective equipment to mitigate water hammer effects, which are generated by sudden pump stoppage. The conditions of the method of characteristics were satisfied by conducting an overall transient flow analysis to estimate the potential of the increased pressure relevant to all types of operating schemes. Extreme pressure waves, produced by pump failure or rapid valve closure, can be prevented using efficient protective designs. The findings of this study can be instructive to alleviating the potential damage engendered by water hammer.</jats:p>",

This was tested in isoflurane anesthetized rats with middle cerebral artery blockade for 1 hr and reperfusion for 2 hr with or without PF‐4708671 (S6K1 inhibitor, 75 mg/kg, 15 min after blockade). Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>‐iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small vessel (20–60 μm diameter) arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. There were no significant hemodynamic or arterial blood gas differences between groups. The control ischemic‐reperfused cortex had a similar O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption to the contralateral cortex. However, microregional O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> supply/consumption balance was significantly reduced in the ischemic‐reperfused cortex with many areas of low O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation (48 of 80 veins with O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> saturation below 50%). PF‐4708671 did not significantly alter cerebral blood flow or O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption.

However, this was associated with a significantly reduced cortical infarct size after S6K1 inhibition (12.9 ± 0.8% control vs 6.6 ± 0.3% PF‐4708671).

In this respect, assessments of biomass availability, efficiency of forest management, forest operations, and economic feasibility are essential. This is certainly the case for Mexico, a country with an increasing energy demand and a considerable potential for sustainable forest utilization. Hence, this paper focuses on analyzing economic alternatives for the Mexican bioenergy supply based on the costs and revenues of utilizing woody biomass residues. With a regional spatial approach, harvesting and transportation costs of utilizing selected biomass residues were stochastically calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. A sensitivity analysis of percentage variation of the most probable estimate in relation to the parameters price and cost for one alternative using net future analysis was conducted. Based on the results for the northern region, a 10% reduction of the transportation cost would reduce overall supply cost, resulting in a total revenue of 13.69 USD/m3 and 0.75 USD/m3 for harvesting residues and non-extracted stand residues, respectively. For the central south region, it is estimated that a contribution of 16.53 USD/m3 from 2013 and a total revenue of 33.00 USD/m3 in 2030 from sawmill residues will improve the value chain. The given approach and outputs provide the basis for the decision-making process regarding forest utilization towards energy generation based on economic indicators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Douglas-fir forests of the coastal Pacific Northwest experience yearly summer droughts; however, the variation in shallow soil available water supply throughout the region is not well understood nor is the effect of future climate change. Soil moisture sensors were installed in 60 Douglas-fir plantation forests over 6 years. Stands were grouped by physiographic regions to describe differences in climate and available water supply. Monthly available water supply (MAWS) (0–50 cm) was calculated as the average daily available moisture content. MAWS was modeled using monthly climate variables, and the equation was then used to predict the change in MAWS due to mild, moderate, and severe climate change predictions. Regional monthly air temperature and precipitation were strongly predictive of MAWS. Mild to severe climate change are predicted to decrease yearly available water supply by 8% to 19%, while summer available water supply will decrease from 25% to 72%. The greatest decreases due to climate change will be found in the coastal regions of Washington and Oregon due to greater negative effects of temperature on available water supply. Climate change, especially the most severe predictions, was shown to have a sizeable effect on shallow soil available water supply in coastal Douglas-fir forests.</jats:p>",

Knockout of Lpl or its obligatory cofactor Apoc2 results in significantly reduced HSPC expansion during definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a number of foreign countries, vortex heat generators have become widespread in decentralized heat supply systems. For Belarus, vortex heat generators are quite new sources of heat supply. The article considers the possibility of using vortex heat generators for heat supply systems for residential, public and industrial buildings. Vortex heat generators are based on the principle of cavitation in a turbulent water flow. For many devices cavitation is not desirable, but in a vortex heat generator it is used as a favorable phenomenon. The authors carried out a series of full-scale experiments to determine the efficiency of the “VTG-2.2” vortex heat generator when different operating modes were applied. The performance of the vortex heat generator can be estimated by the energy conversion factor. Energy conversion factor is the ratio of the amount of thermal energy that a vortex heat generator generates to the amount of electrical energy consumed. Experiments conducted in a number of research organizations (including the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and MPEI) have demonstrated that energy conversion factor can exceed 1. The authors conducted experimental tests with the use of an experimental installation simulating a heat supply system. According to the obtained experimental data, the energy conversion coefficients for each mode were calculated. The constructed graphical dependencies clearly demonstrate that, with increasing rotational speed of the vortex heat generator, the efficiency of its use increases. The highest energy conversion factor value was 61.1 % with a rotation frequency of 40 Hz. It was also found that with increasing the rotational speed of the vortex heat generator, a significant increase in noise and vibration occurs.<jats:bold /></jats:p>"

Reducing food wastage is one way of addressing this challenge. The wastage of carrots, cabbage, beetroot, broccoli and lettuce, produced on the Steenkoppies Aquifer in Gauteng, South Africa, was estimated for each step along the supply chain from the farm to the consumer. Water footprints for these vegetables were used to determine the volume of water lost indirectly as a result of this wastage. Highest percentage wastage occurs at the packhouse level, which is consistent with published literature. Some crops like lettuce have higher average wastage percentages (38%) compared to other crops like broccoli (13%) and cabbage (14%), and wastage varied between seasons. Care should therefore be taken when applying general wastage values reported for vegetables. The classification of “waste” presented a challenge, because “wasted” vegetables are often used for other beneficial purposes, including livestock feed and composting. It was estimated that blue water lost on the Steenkoppies Aquifer due to vegetable crop wastage (4 Mm3 year−1) represented 25% of the estimated blue water volume that exceeded sustainable limits (17 Mm3 year−1).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water losses are responsible for increased energy consumption in water supply systems (WSS). The energy associated with water losses (EWL) is typically considered to be proportional to the water loss percentage obtained in water balances. However, this hypothesis is yet to be proved since flow does not vary linearly with headlosses in WSS. The aim of this paper is to validate the hypothesis, present real-life values for water-energy balance (WEB) components, and reference values for the key performance indicator that represents the ratio of total energy in excess (E3). This validation is achieved through the application of two approaches—top-down and bottom-up. The first approach requires minimum data, gives an overview of the main WEB components, and provides an effective diagnosis of energy inefficiencies through the calculation of E3 related to pumps, water losses, and networks. The second approach requires calibrated hydraulic models and provides a detailed assessment of the WEB components. Results allow the validation of the stated hypothesis as well as show that the most significant energy inefficiencies are associated with surplus energy, pumping, and water losses, each reaching up to 40% of total input energy. Less significant components are pipe friction and valve headlosses, each reaching up to 15% of total input energy.</jats:p>"

Justified by its impact on the bottom line, various measures were adopted for resolution and prevention. However, despite the abundance of literature on the topic, there continues to be a lack of evidence on which of the measures are the most prolific, that is, how the concern of interest is actually handled. Such evidence would highlight missed opportunities and set the stage for future research. Toward this goal, the authors conducted a mapping study analyzing 590 articles. The findings reveal that corporate social responsibility, sustainable reporting, and social life cycle assessment are the most used methods whereas systems thinking ranks far behind. This work is original in that it is the first of its kind to reveal such findings scientifically. Practical implications of this work include reducing the supply chain's social footprint, ameliorating stakeholder quality of living, and mitigating social risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>[ID] Di kabupaten Kepulauan Meranti khususnya Masyarakat Kecamatan Rangsang pada umumnya menggunakan air hujan dan air Sungai sebagai kebutuhan air bersih sehari-hari, jika pada musim kemarau masyarakat pada umumnya sulit mendapatkan air bersih. Dengan adanya Sarana penyediaan air bersih yang dibangun oleh pemerintahan Kabupaten Kepulauan Meranti yaitu Sarana Penyediaan Air Minum (SPAM) ini sangat membantu dalam memenuhi kebutuhan air bersih masyarakat. Dilihat secara warna, air bersih yang di produksi oleh SPAM Kecamatan Rangsang berwarna kecoklatan, dilihat dari segi warna hampir sama dengan air baku SPAM Kecamatan Rangsang tersebut. Pada SPAM Kecamatan Rangsang ini proses pengolahan air bersih menggunakan metode koagulasi, flokulasi, sedimentasi dan filtrasi. Peneliti mencoba meninjau apakah proses-proses pengolahannya telah sesuai dengan metode yang telah di terapkan, mengetahui kualitas air bersih yang dihasilkan serta mengetahui masalah-masalah yang terdapat pada SPAM Kecamatan Rangsang tersebut. Dari hasil penelitian yang dilakukan untuk pemprosesan air bersih adanya proses yang tidak dilakukan yaitu tidak dilakukan pembubuhan zat Koagulan,  hal tersebut dikarenakan zat-zat Koagulan yang ada di SPAM Kecamatan Rangsang tidak tersedia untuk saat ini. Untuk kualitas air bersih yang di produksi SPAM Kecamatan Rangsang tidak memenuhi standar kualitas air bersih berdasarkan peraturan menteri kesehatan nomor 416 tahun 1990 tentang “syarat-syarat dan pengawasan kualitas air” yaitu air bersih sesuai dengan hasil uji laboratorium dinas kesahatan kota pekanbaru pada tanggal 13 November 2017, serta terdapat beberapa alat yang tidak beroperasi, yaitu rusaknya 1 buah pompa Intake  dan 1 buah pompa distribusi&#x0D;\n[EN] In the Meranti Islands district, especially in the Subdistrict of Rangsang District, the people generally use rain water and river water as their daily clean water needs, if in the dry season the community in general is difficult to get clean water. With the availability of clean water facilities built by the government of the Meranti Islands Regency, the Drinking Water Supply Facility (SPAM) is very helpful in meeting the community's clean water needs. Viewed in color, the clean water produced by SPAM in the District of Rangsang is brownish in color, in terms of color it is almost the same as the SPAM raw water in the District of Rangsang. At SPAM in the District of Rangsang, the process of treating clean water uses the methods of coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and filtration. Researchers try to review whether the treatment processes are in accordance with the methods that have been applied, find out the quality of clean water produced and find out the problems found in the SPB Subdistrict. From the results of research conducted for the processing of clean water there is a process that is not done that is not done by adding coagulant substances, it is because the coagulant substances in SPAM Subdistrict, Rangsang District are not available at this time. For the quality of clean water produced by SPAM in the Subdistrict of Rangsang District, it does not meet clean water quality standards based on the Minister of Health Regulation number 416 of 1990 concerning \"requirements and quality control of water\", which is clean water in accordance with the results of laboratory tests on the city health office Pekanbaru on November 13 2017, and there are some tools that are not operating, namely the damage of 1 Intake pump and 1 distribution pump.</jats:p>"

The resulting table has been used to estimate output multipliers for 25 sectors, and these have been compared with multipliers from the last set of I-O officially estimated for the country in 2007–2008. A key difference between the two sets of tables is the inclusion of inputs in the public administration sector in the more recent one, as a result of which the Type-I multiplier of this sector is greater than one in the latter table compared to one in the former. For the same reason, the Type-II multipliers obtained from the 2013–2014 I-O table are broadly higher than those obtained from the 2007–2008 I-O table. Validation has also been done by comparing gross value added (GVA) as a basic price obtained from the national accounts data for 2013–2014 with the GVA arrived at from the constructed I-O table. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: C-67, E01 </jats:p>",

The mass of the solar cells for the appropriate coating area was calculated. Also, in order to reduce the mass of an unmanned aerial vehicle and, as a result, its energy consumption, a method of mathematical calculation to determine minimum and sufficient required battery capacity was developed, on the basis of the maximum amount of solar energy that can be converted within 24 hours. The results of flight tests were analyzed and the prospects for the use of photoelectric converters as components of solar cells of atmospheric pseudo satellites were specified.</jats:p>"

The aim was to analyze postnatal nutrient supply and growth patterns of preterm infants in response to a standardized feeding protocol during stay at neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>METHODS:</jats:title><jats:p> A prospective cohort study was conducted at NICU, Children Hospital Graz.

Moreover, fortification of enteral feeds was initiated later in EPI group ( p &lt; 0.001). As a consequence, cumulative supply of protein, fat and energy was significantly lower in EPI. However, both groups exceeded the European Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommended glucose intake in week 5. At discharge, we found significant differences in all growth parameters (weight Z scores: EPI = – 1.19 vs VPI = – 0.71, length Z scores: EPI = – 1.62 vs VPI = – 0.84; HC Z scores: EPI = – 1.19 vs VPI = – 0.46). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:title><jats:p> Provision of aggressive parenteral nutrition during first 3 weeks of life and earlier fortification should be ensured. The use of mother milk fortifier resulted in glucose intake above the ESPGHAN recommendations in later weeks – this needs to be evaluated in future studies. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

We posit that the auditor is more accommodating to clients who are jointly audited by the same office-level auditor because of the implicit threat of losing not just the supplier client but also the major customer client. The threat arises from the potential loss of synergies of a jointly planned audit engagement when significant purchases are made by the major customer. We find that income-increasing discretionary revenue is positively associated with the major customer’s percentage of purchases from the supplier when the same office-level auditor is engaged by the supplier and their major customer. We fail to find a statistically significant association when they engage a different office-level auditor or a different audit firm. Our findings provide evidence that office-level auditors tolerate greater aggressive revenue management when they have clients who are partners in the same supply chain and when greater audit synergies are at stake. In addition, our results are partly explained by supplier clients who have interlocking directors with major customers and significant influence. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, despite impressive achievements in forest restoration and conservation efforts, the enhancement of ecosystem services and forest area expansion through plantation development, China was not able to improve its domestic timber supply capacities according to its demands. Consequently, the continually growing wood processing industry is facing a severe demand-and-supply gap, causing high dependencies on timber imports. Outdated forest operations practices, dominated by manual labour, are not able to meet supply demands or to implement new silvicultural strategies for enhancing forest quality and productivity and are a widely unnoted disruption of a sustainable development. Therefore, this review presents the status quo of China’s forest operations sector, how it is shaped by forest policy reforms and recent socio-economic developments. In addition, suggestions are developed how the sector can progress through policy adaptations in order to develop sustainable timber supply capacities based on a domestic plantation sector.</jats:p>"

Indentifying the spatio-temporal patterns of ecosystem services supply and demand and the driving forces is of great significance to the regional ecological security and sustainable socio-economic development. Due to long term and high-intensity development, the ecological environment in central and southern Liaoning urban agglomerations has been greatly destroyed thereafter has restricted sustainable development in this region. Based on Landsat ETM and OLI images, land use of this urban agglomeration in 2005, 2010 and 2015 was extracted. The integrative index of multiple-ecosystem services (IMES) was used to quantify the supply (IMESs), demand (IMESd) and balance (IMESb) of multiple-ecosystem services, The spatial patterns of ecosystem services and its dynamics for the period of 2005–2015 were revealed. The multiple regression and stepwise regression analysis were used to explore relationships between ecosystem services and socioeconomic factors. The results showed that the IMESs of the region increased by 2.93 %, whereas IMESd dropped 38 %. The undersupplied area was reduced to 2. The IMESs and IMESb were mainly negatively correlated with gross domestic product (GDP), population density, foreign investment and industrial output, while GDP per capita and the number of teachers had significant positive impacts on ecosystem services supply. The positive correlation between IMESd and GDP, population density and foreign investment were found. The ecosystem services models were established. Supply and balance of multiple-ecosystem services were positively correlated with population density, but the demand was the opposite. The results can provide some reference value for the coordinately economic and ecological development in the study area.\n                    </jats:p>"

The objectives were to determine the impact of FPs, nurses, medical officers (MOs) and other specialists.Setting: The study sample included all five rural districts and eight urban subdistricts of the Western Cape Province.Methods: A secondary analysis was performed on routinely collected data from the Western Cape Department of Health from 01 March 2011 until 30 April 2014.Results: The FP supply did not significantly impact the indicators analysed. The supply of nurses and MOs had an impact on some of the indicators analysed.Conclusion: This study did not replicate the positive associations between an increase in FP supply and improved health indicators, as described previously for high-income country settings. The impact of FP supply on clinical processes, health system performance and outcome indicators in the Western Cape Province was not statistically significant. Future re-evaluation is recommended to allow for more time and an increase in FP supply.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Male C57BL/6J mice have a dietary arginine requirement for maximal growth during the post‐weaning period. This is due to a limited production of its precursor, citrulline, which results in a reduced endogenous arginine synthesis. Typically, arginine supplementation has been used to increase arginine availability and maximize growth. Alternatively, citrulline supplementation may increase endogenous arginine synthesis, and therefore arginine supply. A third option is to supplement with some downstream metabolites (e.g., creatine) of arginine thus reducing its demand and sparing arginine that can be used to support growth. Male C57BL/6J were weaned at 21 d of age, and after a 4 d acclimation period were fed the treatment diets until they reached 42 d of age. Diets with different arginine content (0, 2.5 and 8 g/kg; A0, A2.5 and A8, respectively), or arginine‐free diets supplemented with citrulline (2.5 g/kg; Cit2.5) or creatine (2.5 g/kg; Cre2.5) were fed for 17 d, during the linear growth phase. On d 42 after a 3 h fast, mice were infused with tracers to determine the kinetics of citrulline, arginine, phenylalanine and tyrosine. As expected, mice fed the A0 diet grew slower (0.23 g/d; P &lt; 0.001) and achieved a smaller final weight (18.7 g) than mice fed the A2.5 and A8 diets. The growth rate and final weight of the mice fed the Cit2.5 was not different than that from those fed the arginine supplemented diets (0.47 g/d and 22.6 g, respectively); however, mice fed the Cre2.5 diet grew at similar rate and achieved a similar final weight than mice fed the A0 diet (0.19 g/d and 18 g, respectively). Arginine flux was not different among the different treatments; however, citrulline flux was greater for mice fed the A0 and Cre2.5 diets than for mice fed the A2.5, A8 or Cit2.5 diet (125 vs 108 μmol*kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>*h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; P &lt;0.001). This resulted in a greater de novo arginine synthesis for mice fed the A0 and Cre2.5 diets than for mice on the A2.5, A8 or Cit2.5 treatments (82.7 vs 72 μmol*kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>*h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; P &lt; 0.001). Dietary treatments had no effect (P &gt; 0.21) on whole body protein metabolism as determined by phenylalanine‐tyrosine kinetics. Increasing arginine supply by supplementing with arginine or citrulline successfully increased growth rate and final body weight in mice. However, reducing arginine demand by supplementing with creatine did not improve growth rate. During fasting citrulline flux and de novo arginine synthesis increased in mice fed A0 and Cre2.5, suggesting a response to arginine deprivation. In conclusion, increasing the supply of arginine is effective way to restore growth, but reducing the demand was ineffectual.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Support or Funding Information</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>This work was supported by federal funds from the USDA/Agricultural Research Service under Cooperative Agreement no. 58‐6250‐6‐001 (to JCM), and the NIH (R01 GM108940 to JCM).</jats:p><jats:p>This abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

So, fuzzy mathematics and a mixed Copula function are used in this paper to determine existing water supply indexes. The joint probability distribution of runoff forecasting and water demand is simulated and it also makes a quantitative analysis of future flows. The information entropy principle is applied to determine early risk warning index and signals, and emergency water shortage measures are established for an inter‐basin water transfer‐supply operation. Then the early warning decision system of reservoir optimization water supply dispatching is built up. A practical example computation shows that the information of water supply and water shortage can be described effectively with such an early risk warning system regarding donor and recipient reservoirs. The early risk warning method is applied for the first time, which simultaneously takes into account water inflow, water utilization and water shortage regarding donor and recipient reservoirs.

The cultures were conducted in a stirred tank bioreactor by changing the stirrer speed. Several process variables, such as biomass concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, oxygen mass transfer rate and oxygen uptake rate, have been measured or calculated. Also cell viability was determined by viable colony counting in Petri dishes and culture samples were subjected into a transmission electron microscopy analysis, in order to describe the integrity of the individual cells. The experimental results show that the genetically modified organisms, the strains KTH2 and KTH2 (pESOX3), present a different growth under low agitation conditions, and low oxygen supply level, while the growth of the wild type strains, KT2440 and KT2442, followed the typical sigmoidal evolution that could be described by the logistic equation. The presence of outer membrane vesicles has been observed in the GMO strains. When the cultures were conducted at low stirrer speed, and so at low oxygen transfer rate, these vesicles were detected, indicating the bacterial response to oxidative stress, caused by the catalytic activity of the HpaC enzyme. For all of the strains tested, no hydrodynamic stress has been detected, even at very high agitation levels. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>Biotechnol.

A reduction in ambient temperature from 23 to 19 °C reduced light‐saturated photosynthesis by 25% but increased respiratory capacity by 30%. Changes in respiratory capacity were not reversed after temperatures were subsequently increased to 27 °C. Temperature sensitivity of respiration measured at prevalent ambient temperature varied little between temperature treatments but was significantly reduced from ~105 kJ mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when supply of N was weak, to ~70 kJ mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> when it was strong. Temperature sensitivity of respiration measured across a broader temperature range (20–40 °C) could be fully described by 2 exponent parameters of an Arrhenius‐type model (i.e., activation energy of respiration at low reference temperature and a parameter describing the temperature dependence of activation energy). These 2 parameters were strongly correlated, statistically explaining 74% of observed variation. Residual variation was linked to treatment‐induced changes in respiration at low reference temperature or respiratory capacity. Leaf contents of starch and soluble sugars suggest that respiratory capacity varies with source‐sink imbalances in carbohydrate utilization, which in combination with shifts in carbon‐flux mode, serve to maintain homeostasis of respiratory temperature sensitivity at prevalent growth temperature.</jats:p>",

Poor understanding of alternative sources can hamper plans for addressing water scarcity and supply resilience. The potential of three alternative supply systems in Lilongwe, Malawi and Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt are compared using a fast, data-light assessment approach. Lilongwe water supply is based on unsustainable use of source water, while Sharm depends primarily on desalination. Both locations experience shortages due to poor system performance and service inequity. Alternative supply systems are shown to potentially contribute to supply augmentation/diversification, improving service and system resilience. There are considerable seasonal variations to consider, especially regarding storage of water. Social preferences could limit the uptake/demand for alternative water. One important conclusion is the value in addressing public perceptions of alternative systems, and assessing water end use in order to site systems appropriately. Other issues surround financing, encouraging uptake and addressing institutional/governance aspects surrounding equitable distribution. A further consideration is whether demand reductions might yield shorter-term improvements in performance without the need to institute potentially expensive alternative water strategies. Reducing non-revenue water is a priority. Such measures should be undertaken with alternative supply enhancement to reduce inequity of supply, improve system performance and increase resilience to future changes.</jats:p>",

By performing an intertrochanteric varus osteotomy, cam‐type femoroacetabular impingement can be induced experimentally. In sheep, the aspherical portion is located superiorly—exactly matching the region where the superior retinacular vessels enter the femoral head–neck junction in human beings. In order to fully exploit the potential of this experimental FAI model, a safe osteochondroplasty of the superior asphericity would need to be done without the risk of avascular necrosis. The aim of this study was to describe the vascular anatomy of the femoral head in sheep from the aorta to the retinacular vessels in order to perform safe femoral osteochondroplasty of the superior femoral asphericity in sheep. Sixty‐two ovine hips were analyzed using CT angiography (30 hips), post mortem intravascular latex injection (6 hips), vascular corrosion casting (6 hips), and analysis of the distribution of vascular foramina around the femoral head–neck junction in macerated ovine femora (20 hips). The ovine femoral head receives its blood supply from anterior retinacular arteries from the lateral femoral circumflex artery, and from posterior retinacular arteries from the medial femoral circumflex artery. The superior aspherical portion is free of vessels. Detailed knowledge about vascular anatomy of sheep hips is of clinical significance since it allows to perform osteochondroplasty of the superior aspherical portion in the experimental ovine FAI model safely without the risk of osteonecrosis. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Given this background, a steady state model of DHS is first presented with hydraulic and thermal sub-models included. Structurally, the presented DHS model is composed of three major parts, i.e., the straight pipe, four kinds of local pipes, and the radiator. The impacts of pipeline parameters and the environment temperature on heat losses and pressure losses are then examined. The term “heat-power flow” is next defined, and the optimal heat-power flow (OHPF) model formulated as a quadratic planning problem, in which the objective is to minimize energy losses, including the heat losses and active power losses, and both the operational constraints of PDS and DHS are respected. The developed OHPF model is solved by the well-established IPOPT (Interior Point OPTimizer) commercial solver, which is based on the YALMIP/MATLAB toolbox.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The growth of global supply chains has allowed trading partners to experience synergistic, economic expansion and increase their competitive success. At the same time, reliance on global supply chains exposes its trading partners to unforeseen disruptions. While the economic benefits are tremendous, they are not without risk as global supply chains are by their very nature susceptible to a wide array of disruptions. Methods that mitigate the effect of disruption directly contribute to the competitive success of global supply chain networks. One approach for mitigating the effects of disruption is to increase resilience. Thus, this research focuses on understanding supply chain vulnerability and how to return the supply chain to its desirable performance level after a disruptive event by reconfiguring the supply chain network. This article frames this foundational work in the context of systems theory to add to the body of resilience research by providing a time-dependent definition of supply chain resilience. This article then provides a mathematical model, based on inventory theory that operationalizes that definition. The model is presented in the context of a multi-echelon, post-production support network of a sustainment-dominated system such as those found in the aerospace, defense, utilities, and construction industries. The model demonstrates the post-disruption resilience at each supply chain network node along with the investment necessary to restore the network. </jats:p>",

Samples were collected over period of eight months from May to the end of December 2015.\r\nFive stations were selected, Stations 1, 2 and 3 were located at Bestan Sowr drinking water project in Sharazur district, station 4 was located at Saray Subhan Agha drinking water project in Said sadiq district and station 5 was located at Khurmal drinking water project in Khurmal district within Halabja district.\r\nThe study involved an Isolation, purification and identification seven species of algae by using Chu-10 media and Bold Basal Medium (BBM), and evaluation of the effectiveness of plant extracts (as antialgal) on the growth of isolated algae by Agar-Well Diffusion Method.\r\nSeven strains of algae from studying stations were isolated, purified and identified after collection which were: Ulothrix zonata, Desmodesmus lunatus, Desmodesmus itascaensis, Chlorella vulgaris, Calothrix fusca, Chroococcus turgidus and Navicula riediana. These isolated algae included 2 species of blue-green algae, 4 species of green algae, and 1 species of diatoms.\r\nIn this study, the suggested plants extracts for use as inhibitors belong to different families of plant (5 plants) which were Hordeum vulgare (Barley straw), Peganum harmala, Artemisia annua, Thymus vulgaris and Nasturtium officinale (Watercress).\r\nOn the assessment of the effectiveness of crude plant extracts (as antialgal) on the growth of selected algae by Agar-Well Diffusion Method, the results showed that the greater inhibition zone diameter was obtained 62 mm against Calothrix fusca by using crude extracted from Peganum harmala in concentration 80 mg/ml, and less inhibition zone diameter was 7 mm against Ulothrix zonata by using crud extracted from Artemisia annua in concentration 30 mg/ml. Nasturtium officinale (Watercress) did not show any effective against any type of isolated algae in all concentrations. Generally inhibition zones diameters differed according to the algal types and types and concentration of plant’s extracts.</jats:p>"

To explain the differences, in this study, the inertia effect on the region of supply hole is considered in discussing the static characteristics of hydrostatic thrust bearing, and then new expressions of pressure, load capacity, and flow rate are given. For the continuous parallel bearing, the results of this study agree well with experiments, thus there is no need for the extra modified inertia theory. For the step bearing with a large inertia parameter (e.g., S = 2), the results of this study agree with experiments on the recess region, and are closer to the experimental results than those of old method on the region of bearing land. So when the inertia parameter S and the ratio of supply hole radius to bearing radius r<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>/ R are large enough, the inertia effect on the region of supply hole cannot be ignored in discussing the static characteristics of hydrostatic thrust bearing. </jats:p>",

We sought to infer how the interactions between distinct human populations shape the global population structure of Mtb on a regional scale. We applied the recently described timescaled haplotypic density (THD) technique on 638 minisatellite-based Mtb genotypes from French tuberculosis patients. THD with a long-term (200 y) timescale indicated that Mtb population in France had been mostly influenced by interactions with Eastern and Southern Europe and, to a lesser extent, Northern and Middle Africa, consistent with historical migrations favored by geographic proximity or commercial exchanges with former French colonies. Restricting the timescale to 20 y, THD identified a sustained influence of Northern Africa, but not Europe where tuberculosis incidence decreased sharply. Evolving interactions between human populations, thus, measurably influence the local population structure of Mtb. Relevant information on such interactions can be inferred using THD from Mtb genotypes.</jats:p>"

Previously, we reported that each of the 2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB proteins of Aichi virus (AiV), a picornavirus, forms a complex with the Golgi apparatus protein ACBD3 and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) at viral RNA replication sites (replication organelles [ROs]), enhancing PI4KB-dependent phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) production. Here, we demonstrate AiV hijacking of the cellular cholesterol transport system involving oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a PI4P-binding cholesterol transfer protein. AiV RNA replication was inhibited by silencing cellular proteins known to be components of this pathway, OSBP, the ER membrane proteins VAPA and VAPB (VAP-A/B), the PI4P-phosphatase SAC1, and PI-transfer protein β. OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1 were present at RNA replication sites. We also found various previously unknown interactions among the AiV proteins (2B, 2BC, 2C, 3A, and 3AB), ACBD3, OSBP, VAP-A/B, and SAC1, and the interactions were suggested to be involved in recruiting the component proteins to AiV ROs. Importantly, the OSBP-2B interaction enabled PI4P-independent recruitment of OSBP to AiV ROs, indicating preferential recruitment of OSBP among PI4P-binding proteins. Protein-protein interaction-based OSBP recruitment has not been reported for other picornaviruses. Cholesterol was accumulated at AiV ROs, and inhibition of OSBP-mediated cholesterol transfer impaired cholesterol accumulation and AiV RNA replication. Electron microscopy showed that AiV-induced vesicle-like structures were close to ER membranes. Altogether, we conclude that AiV directly recruits the cholesterol transport machinery through protein-protein interactions, resulting in formation of membrane contact sites between the ER and AiV ROs and cholesterol supply to the ROs.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>IMPORTANCE</jats:bold>\n            Positive-strand RNA viruses utilize host pathways to modulate the lipid composition of viral RNA replication sites for replication. Previously, we demonstrated that Aichi virus (AiV), a picornavirus, forms a complex comprising certain proteins of AiV, the Golgi apparatus protein ACBD3, and the lipid kinase PI4KB to synthesize PI4P lipid at the sites for AiV RNA replication. Here, we confirmed cholesterol accumulation at the AiV RNA replication sites, which are established by hijacking the host cholesterol transfer machinery mediated by a PI4P-binding cholesterol transfer protein, OSBP. We showed that the component proteins of the machinery, OSBP, VAP, SAC1, and PITPNB, are all essential host factors for AiV replication. Importantly, the machinery is directly recruited to the RNA replication sites through previously unknown interactions of VAP/OSBP/SAC1 with the AiV proteins and with ACBD3. Consequently, we propose a specific strategy employed by AiV to efficiently accumulate cholesterol at the RNA replication sites via protein-protein interactions.\n          </jats:p>",

In Indonesia, the research and industrialization on lithium-ion battery have been conducted to develop products such as for electric vehicles and street lighting. On the other hand, the relationship between suppliers, producers, distribution channels, and consumers has not been mapped. This mapping is intended to provide an overview of the strength of suppliers, involved manufacturers, and to determine the readiness of the value chain of lithium-ion battery to perform mass production. The approach in the mapping uses primary data and secondary data for the initial stage of inbound flows in supply chain of lithium-ion industry in Indonesia. Primary data are obtained from the questionnaires, which adopted from the value chain lithium-ion battery research in USA adjusted for Indonesian context. Meanwhile, the secondary data derived from literature reviews. The respondents in the study are 11 institutions consisting of manufacturers and R&amp;D of lithium-ion battery in Indonesia. The results obtained are supplier mapping that provides the flow of lithium-ion battery, cell, module, and pack as well as the producers and consumers. The results could also be utilized to identify the valuable metrics in the supply chain of lithium battery industry.</jats:p>",

Citrin deficiency causes neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis (NICCD) and adult–onset type II citrullinemia (CTLN2). Citrin deficiency is predicted to impair hepatic glycolysis and de novo lipogenesis, resulting in hepatic energy deficit. Secondary decrease in hepatic argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) expression has been considered a cause of hyperammonemia in CTLN2. We previously reported that medium–chain triglyceride (MCT) supplement therapy with a low–carbohydrate formula was effective in CTLN2 to prevent a relapse of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We present the therapy for six CTLN2 patients. All the patients’ general condition steadily improved and five patients with hyperammonemic encephalopathy recovered from unconsciousness in a few days. Before the treatment, plasma glutamine levels did not increase over the normal range and rather decreased to lower than the normal range in some patients. The treatment promptly decreased the blood ammonia level, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma citrulline levels and an increase in plasma glutamine levels. These findings indicated that hyperammonemia was not only caused by the impairment of ureagenesis at ASS1 step, but was also associated with an impairment of glutamine synthetase (GS) ammonia‐detoxification system in the hepatocytes. There was no decrease in the GS expressing hepatocytes. MCT supplement with a low–carbohydrate formula can supply the energy and/or substrates for ASS1 and GS, and enhance ammonia detoxification in hepatocytes. Histological improvement in the hepatic steatosis and ASS1‐expression was also observed in a patient after long‐term treatment.</jats:p>",
