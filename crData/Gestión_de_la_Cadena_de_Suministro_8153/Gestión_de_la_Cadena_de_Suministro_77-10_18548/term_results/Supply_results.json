At the state and national level, however, reliance on exogenous sources appears to be in favor. Both viewpoints, of course, recognize that water supply is one of the major critical factors in determining the capacity of a land area to support population. Three planning issues that bear on this endogenous‐exogenous source controversy are discussed: 1) deep aquifers which have recharge areas in other political jurisdictions and are therefore regulated by other bodies will not count as an endogenous source, reliance will be placed only on shallow water table aquifers which are recharged by local precipitation; 2) total development of the groundwater resources of a headwaters community could result in severe base flow diminishment, thereby supporting the notion that these communities have a regional responsibility to restrict their growth so as to preserve and protect the water supply for downstream users; and 3) yield decrementing estimates, i.e., how much recharge water is lost to runoff as a consequence of development, are needed in order to assess the magnitude of local water resources.</jats:p>",
