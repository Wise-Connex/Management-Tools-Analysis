      "abstract": "<jats:p>Spreadsheet software, notably Microsoft Excel, can be used very effectively for analyzing logistics and supply chain issues. Spreadsheets allow analysis from many different perspectives and can be modified and enhanced to reflect new situations and options. The methodology used for developing integrated spreadsheet models is similar to modeling with specialized software. The modeler develops a baseline model reflecting current operations, creates alternative scenarios and compares those scenarios to the baseline. Non‐quantifiable factors and soft costs are also considered to develop a complete analysis. Using integrated spreadsheets the modeler can analyze the impact of business decisions on any number of variables such as facility space, inventory, investment and productivity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Trust is a binding force in most buyer‐supplier transactions. It is critical when uncertainty and asymmetric product information are present in the transaction of a supply chain. One of the important characteristics in developing trust among trading partners of an e‐enabled supply chain is stage‐wise trust development among partners. In the present work, alternatives for trust development among buyer and supplier have been identified. In order to evaluate the alternatives to evolve trust in an e‐enabled supply chain, a framework involving analytic networked process is proposed. It helps in synthesizing various characteristics of trust in the e‐enabled supply chain. For the illustrative example, the result indicates superiority of a community responsibility system for building on‐line trust along the e‐enabled supply chain.</jats:p>",

The final purchaser decides whether each supply chain member adds value, and is thus willing to pay for the added benefit, or whether by‐passing a particular link in the supply chain makes economic sense. It is in this context that profit, based on value‐adding behaviors, provides the primary incentive and reward for supply chain members to organize. This article suggests that successful supply chains are those that are evolving into supply communities. This article presents a framework for more thoroughly understanding the motivation that members of the supply chain have for developing consistent business strategies, thereby enabling the supply community to compete effectively.</jats:p>",

This case study describes how a first‐tier supplier has applied “best practice” to design and implement a BPR programme. In total span the resulting change covers a baseline of traditional operations to the present status of agile response. Essentially the BPR programme has been conceived around the need for streamlined material flow through internal processes and both supplier and customer interfaces. The paper highlights the BPR stages necessary for enabling change, which is audited in terms of assessment of improved material flow. Finally, the “bottom‐line” impact of the BPR programme is documented, and demonstrates that substantial benefits have accrued.</jats:p>",

The research focuses on a telecommunications equipment manufacturer that has outsourced a range of activities to suppliers including assembly operations, manufacturing, logistics and design. This strategy has resulted in the company becoming a “systems integrator” in which it manages and co‐ordinates a network of best production and service providers. The implications of this strategy are drawn from an analysis of this company and three suppliers by analysing three outsourcing programmes over an 18‐month period. There is considerable focus on evaluating the capability of activities in the value chain in relation to potential suppliers. The findings in this research challenge the value of using the core competence concept as a basis for outsourcing. In fact, the findings show that analysis and management of the supply chain can have a greater impact on the outsourcing process than attempting to unravel the complexities and intricacies of the core competence approach.</jats:p>",

Assuming that the future stumpage price and the rate of return on the risky asset are independent and normally distributed, it is shown that the effect of risk-aversion on the optimal harvesting behavior depends on the sign of a marginal variance function. This shows the effect of a marginal increase in the harvest volume on the variance of the future wealth, evaluated at the optimal harvest-investment decision under risk-neutral preferences. If the marginal variance is negative, then risk-aversion increases harvest in the first-period. If it equals zero, then only high degrees of risk-aversion affect (increase) the harvest. Finally, if the marginal variance is greater than zero, then high degrees of risk-aversion increase the harvest, whereas low degrees of risk-aversion have the opposite effect. The result has implications for the analysis of the harvesting behavior of any renewable resources.</jats:p>",

This paper adopts the process viewpoint and examines the design and management issues associated with the global sourcing process based on a case study at a leading firm in the US aviation industry. The effectiveness of the company’s global sourcing process is evaluated, the design alternatives of the supply chain structure are compared, and the critical issues of efficient management of the process are summarized. Specifically, three logistics‐based criteria are developed to indicate the effectiveness of the transportation and distribution network. The paper also demonstrates that the process design can be assessed based on the dimensions of supply chain integration. Finally, a flow‐level matrix is developed to identify the critical issues of managing the global sourcing process.</jats:p>",

There is a long‐standing debate, however, about demand effects of wage variations. In this paper, we bring together these two arguments in a Kaldorian model with group‐specific saving rates and a production technology that allows for redistribution between workers and entrepreneurs following a wage hike. We thereby pinpoint the conditions under which (a) wage variations affect aggregate demand and (b) the positive demand effects of wage hikes may even overcompensate the negative supply effects on aggregate employment (‘purchasing power argument’). We conclude by noting that, whereas demand effects are very likely to occur, the conditions under which the purchasing power argument does indeed hold are very unrealistic.</jats:p>",

A useful approach for SC performance improvement may be pursued by resorting to advanced software tools able to analyze complex production scenarios, performing concurrent, synchronized and distributed simulations. Support to the logistics planning phase is offered by geographical information system technology, included in the simulation environment in order to manage related geographical data (i.e. warehouse location, choice of vehicle routeings, etc.). In the paper the main characteristics of the proposed hardware and software architecture have been illustrated, focusing attention on the logic phases for implementation by the transport federate. Furthermore, a preliminary functionality validation of the developed tool is presented with reference to simplified test cases.</jats:p>",

This article discusses the potential of utilising RFID technology for increasing efficiency in the supply chain of short shelf life products. The focus of this article is a RFID trial conducted at Sainsbury’s, which is discussed to study the potential benefits of RFID for short shelf‐life products retailers. Further this article analyses the potential impact of RFID for other supply chain participants.

Considering that cell and antigen uptake depend on the blood supply to lymphoid organs, the hypothesis was tested that feedback signals from activated immune cells control sympathetic vasomotor activity. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; We determined the blood flow in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) of Wistar Kyoto rats during immune stimulation with endotoxin (LPS; 10 µg/kg) and following disruption of the noradrenergic transmission. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Our data indicate that (a) the splenic noradrenaline content, which reflects the density of the sympathetic innervation, is 5 times higher in the spleen than in other peripheral organs and the spleen receives stronger tonic sympathetic input than mLN; (b) immune stimulation with LPS causes a 4-fold increase in the IL-1β production in the spleen, but only 2-fold in mLN; (c) IL-1β causes an inhibition of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tonus in the spleen, but has no significant effect on the noradrenergic vascular tonus in mLN, and (d) in mLN, the local hyperemia induced by LPS is attenuated by the degranulation of vesicular stores of histamine and serotonin, indicating that these monoamines participate in the vasodilator effect of LPS in mLN. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; The present experiments, taken together with our previous studies, indicate that the control of blood supply to the spleen and mLN involves different mechanisms. While blood perfusion in the spleen depends on the inhibition of the noradrenergic vasoconstriction by endogenously produced IL-1β, other vasoactive mediators such as serotonin and histamine play a role in the control of mLN perfusion.</jats:p>"

For a two-party supply chain, comprising a manufacturer and a supplier that both invest in capacity, we prove the existence of a class of coordinating price-only contracts that arbitrarily allocate the supply chain profit. Moreover, if the supplier's reservation profit is below a certain threshold, the manufacturer's optimal contract is a quantity-premium price-only schedule, that is, the average wholesale price per unit increases in the order size. We prove that the manufacturer prefers simple piecewise-linear quantity-premium contracts to linear contracts and show numerically that such contracts are highly efficient. We extend our results for piecewise-linear price schedules to N-supplier assembly systems. We also enrich the voluntary compliance regime of Cachon and Lariviere (2001). With this enrichment, we prove that share-the-pain contracts, such as firm commitment and options contracts, increase supplier capacity in the full information case, a result that contrasts with that of Cachon and Lariviere. Finally, we investigate when a manufacturer prefers single-breakpoint quantity premiums to firm commitments. </jats:p>",

The results are based on a sample of 519 glitches announcements made during 1989–2000. Shareholder wealth affects are estimated by computing the abnormal stock returns (actual returns adjusted for industry and market‐wide influences) around the date when information about glitches is publicly announced. Supply chain glitch announcements are associated with an abnormal decrease in shareholder value of 10.28%. Regression analysis is used to identify factors that influence the direction and magnitude of the change in the stock market’s reaction to glitches. We find that larger firms experience a less negative market reaction, and firms with higher growth prospects experience a more negative reaction. There is no difference between the stock market’s reaction to pre‐1995 and post‐1995 glitches, suggesting that the market has always viewed glitches unfavorably. Capital structure (debt–equity ratio) has little impact on the stock market’s reaction to glitches. We also provide descriptive results on how sources of responsibility and reasons for glitches affect shareholder wealth.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Four e‐business strategies are identified and their relationship with contingent factors and supply chain integration mechanisms is investigated. Results show a close link between the use of Internet tools and the level of integration with customers and suppliers, thus suggesting the need to define e‐business strategies in coherence with the use of traditional integration mechanisms.</jats:p>",

Although generally negligible, the acceleration term can become significant in SFD bearings when inertia effects in the damper lands are enhanced by the flow in a central circumferential oil supply groove. By using a bulk flow approximation in the oil supply groove an explicit expression is derived for the acceleration term. Experimental results confirm the significance of the oil supply groove geometry and appear to validate the bulk flow approximation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article addresses the transfer of new product technologies from outside the firm for integration into a new product system as part of a product development effort. Product technology transfer is a key activity in the complex process of new product development and is the fundamental link in the technology supply chain. Product technology transfer too often is dealt with in an ad‐hoc fashion. Purposeful management of the product technology transfer process leads to more effective transfers in terms of timeliness, cost, functional performance, and competence building. Better management of product technology transfer gives firms access to a greater variety of new technology options, improves a firm's ability to offer significantly differentiated products, deepens the firm's competitive competencies, and positively influences sustained product development success. The central objective of this article is to gain insight into product technology transfer so that companies can manage this process more successfully and so that researchers can investigate this critical activity further.</jats:p><jats:p>This article describes the technology supply chain as a unique form of a supply chain that poses a set of managerial challenges and requirements distinguishing it from the more traditional component supply chain. Because a single product technology transfer project is the fundamental piece in the technology supply chain, understanding this piece well is key to leveraging the extended technology supply chain and to improving overall product development performance. This article integrates literatures on new product development, supply chain management, and technology management and builds on organizational theory to present a conceptual model of determinants of product technology transfer success. The core proposition is that product technology transfer effectiveness is greatest when companies carefully match (or “fit”) the type of technology to be transferred (the “technology uncertainty”) with the type of relationship between the technology supplier and recipient (the “interorganizational interaction”).</jats:p><jats:p>A quite detailed framework characterizing technology uncertainty along the dimensions of technology novelty, complexity, and tacitness is presented to help in assessing the challenges associated with transferring a particular product technology. This article also considers detailed elements characterizing the interorganizational interactions between the technology source and recipient firms. This helps firms consider the appropriate means to facilitate the interfirm process of technology transfer. Overall, this article provides practical insight into characterizing technologies and into improving the product technology transfer process. This article also provides a strong theoretical foundation to aid future research on product technology transfer in the technology supply chain.</jats:p>",

The model includes the sulfate reducing zone (SRZ), which permits sulfate measurements to be used in conjunction with chloride data to better constrain the supply of methane at hydrate locations. The steady state model is applied at Ocean Drilling Program Site 997 to resolve the methane source at the Blake Ridge. Sulfate measurements rule out a shallow source of methane directly below the SRZ because the predicted sulfate concentration overestimates the measurements by a factor of 2 or more. Although a deep source of methane reproduces the main features of the sulfate and chloride data when the upward fluid velocity is 0.25 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, the deep source fails to reproduce the increased freshening observed between 200 and 450 m below seafloor. We find that an in situ methane source (located in the lower part of the hydrate stability zone) together with an incoming methane bearing fluid at 0.23 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> gives the best fit to both the sulfate and chloride data. In addition, the predicted sulfate profile indicates that anaerobic methane oxidation is the primary pathway of sulfate depletion at the Blake Ridge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Contemporary strategies in operations management suggest that successful firms align supply chain assets with product demand characteristics in order to exploit the profit potential of product lines fully. However, observation suggests that supply chain assets often are longer lived than product line decisions. This suggests that alignment between supply chain assets and demand characteristics is most likely to occur at the time of initial market entry. This article examines the association between product demand characteristics and the initial investment in a supply chain at the time of market entry. We characterize supply chains as responsive or efficient. A responsive supply chain is distinguished by short production lead‐times, low set‐up costs, and small batch sizes that allow the responsive firm to adapt quickly to market demand, but often at a higher unit cost. An efficient supply chain is distinguished by longer production lead‐times, high set‐up costs, and larger batch sizes that allow the efficient firm to produce at a low unit cost, but often at the expense of market responsiveness. We hypothesize that a firm's choice of responsive supply chain will be associated with lower industry growth rates, higher contribution margins, higher product variety, and higher demand or technological uncertainty. We further hypothesize that interactions among these variables either can reinforce or can temper the main effects. We report that lower industry growth rates are associated with responsive market entry, but this effect is offset if growth occurs during periods of high variety and high demand uncertainty. We report that higher contribution margins are associated with responsive market entry and that this effect is more pronounced when occurring with periods of high variety. Finally, we report that responsive market entry also is correlated positively with higher technological demand uncertainty. These results are found using data from the North American mountain bike industry.</jats:p>",

To examine the effects of an elevated nutrient supply on the C allocation patterns in forests, we determined whole‐ecosystem C budgets in unfertilized plots of<jats:italic>Eucalyptus saligna</jats:italic>and in adjacent plots receiving regular additions of 65 kg N ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, 31 kg P ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, 46 kg K ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, and macro‐ and micronutrients. We measured the absolute flux of C allocated to the components of GPP (ANPP, TBCA and APR), as well as the fraction of GPP allocated to these components.</jats:p><jats:p>Fertilization dramatically increased GPP. Averaged over 3 years, GPP in the fertilized plots was 34% higher than that in the unfertilized controls (3.95 vs. 2.95 kg C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Fertilization‐related increases in GPP were allocated entirely aboveground – ANPP was 85% higher and APR was 57% higher in the fertilized than in the control plots, while TBCA did not differ significantly between treatments. Carbon use efficiency (NPP/GPP) was slightly higher in the fertilized (0.53) compared with the control plots (0.51). Overall, fertilization increased ANPP and APR, and these increases were related to a greater GPP and an increase in the fraction of GPP allocated aboveground.</jats:p>",

This can further result in improper circuit operation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on ATE (automatic test equipment) that teaches neural networks (NN) to correctly classify a set of worst case input patterns with respect to the maximum instantaneous current. This can be thought of as a learning behavior of chip power consumption change due to different input patterns. Then a genetic algorithm (GA) was applied to further optimize this set of NN worst case patterns. A final set of worst case patterns were expected to detect a small critical sequence of high switching currents that was directly related to the worst case power supply noise. This novel diagnosis approach can efficiently identify the defective design or weakness due to PSN as well as locate the defect or weaknesses within the design.</jats:p>",

Disinfection byproduct precursor removal was a function of coagulant type, coagulant dose, and flocculation pH. Iron‐based coagulants were capable of 10% higher NPDOC removal than aluminum‐based coagulants. However, aluminum‐based coagulants generally provided higher color removal. Based on treatment performance, cost, and other factors, sulfate‐based coagulants—alum and ferric sulfate—were the overall coagulants of choice for this water. Additional testing with alum and ferric sulfate demonstrated the benefit of optimizing rapid and slow mix conditions, polymer selection, and solids addition for enhanced turbidity removal. The benefits of impounding raw river water in a surface water reservoir before treatment were also identified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Endothelial dysfunction is often associated with a relative substrate deficiency of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in spite of apparently high intracellular arginine concentrations. For a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, we aimed to characterize the intracellular arginine sources of eNOS. Our previous studies in human endothelial EA.hy926 cells suggested the existence of two arginine pools: pool I can be depleted by extracellular lysine, whereas pool II is not freely exchangeable with the extracellular space, but accessible to eNOS. In this study, we demonstrate that the eNOS accessible pool II is also present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but not in ECV bladder carcinoma cells transfected with an expression plasmid for eNOS. In the endothelial cells, one part of pool II (referred to as pool IIA) consisted of recycling of citrulline to arginine. This part could be depleted by neutral amino acids that match the substrate profile of system N transporter 1 (SN1), presumably by the removal of intracellular citrulline. SN1 was expressed in EA.hy926 cells and HUVECs as shown by real-time RT-PCR. The second part of pool II (referred to as pool IIB) could not be depleted by any of the cationic or neutral amino acids tested. Our data demonstrate that pool IIB is nourished by protein breakdown and thus represents a substrate pool likely to accumulate protein-derived endogenous inhibitors of eNOS. Preferential use of the arginine pool IIB under pathophysiological conditions might therefore explain the arginine paradox.</jats:p>",

Water quality varies from one aquifer to another and even within the same aquifer itself. Different ground water quality is obtained from wells and is mixed in a common reservoir prior to any consumption. This artificial mixing enables an increase in available ground water of a desired quality for agricultural or residential purposes. The question remains as to what proportions of water from different wells should be mixed together to achieve a desired water quality for this artificial mixture. Two sets of laboratory experiments were carried out, namely, the addition of saline water to a fixed volume of fresh water. After each addition, the mixture volume and the electric conductivity value of the artificially mixed water were recorded. The experiments were carried out under the same laboratory temperature of 20°C. A standard curve was developed first experimentally and then confirmed theoretically. This curve is useful in determining either the volume or discharge ratio from two wells to achieve a predetermined electrical conductivity value of the artificial mixture. The application of the curve is given for two wells within the Quaternary deposits in the western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</jats:p>",

Our <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> wave velocity model obtained from tomographic inversion of ∼70,000 crustal first arrival travel times suggests that the geometry of extrusive emplacement are significantly different beneath the overlapping spreading limbs. Extrusive volcanic rocks above the western melt sill are inferred to be thin (∼250 m). More extensive accumulation of extrusives is inferred to the west than to the east of the western melt sill. The extrusive layer inferred above the eastern melt sill thickens from ∼350 (at the neovolcanic axis) to 550 m (to the west of the melt sill). Volcanic construction is likely to be significant in the formation of ridge crest morphology at the OSC, particularly at the tip of the eastern limb. On the basis of our interpretation of the velocity model, we propose that enhanced magma supply at crustal levels at the OSC may provide an effective mechanism for the migration of ridge discontinuities. This “dynamic magma supply model” may explain the commonly observed nonsteady migration pattern of ridge discontinuities by attributing this to the temporal fluctuations in melt availability to the overlapping spreading limbs.</jats:p>",
