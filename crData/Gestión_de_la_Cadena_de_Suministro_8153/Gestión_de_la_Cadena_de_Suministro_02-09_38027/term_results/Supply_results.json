These requests would otherwise have been satisfied by either photocopying or scanning by the supplying library and sent either to the requesting library or directly to the end‐user. The service is not a separate ILL service; using the OpenURL standard it is designed to be integrated with and complement existing ILL services. The concept is being tested with ILLOS, Lancaster’s widely implemented inter‐library loan management system, working alongside Ingenta’s electronic full‐text document supply service. The second phase of the project will consider extending the service beyond ILLOS and Ingenta to other suppliers and other interlending document request management systems.</jats:p>",

This increases the importance of effective supplier selection and assessment. Sparse evidence exists regarding the impact of supplier selection and assessment on a buying firm's business performance. This research describes an empirical study of the importance of supplier selection and assessment criteria of American manufacturing companies for items to be used in products already in production. Moreover, it identifies relationships between criteria and a buying firm's business performance. Results indicate that soft, non‐quantifiable selection criteria, such as a supplier's strategic commitment to a buyer, have a greater impact on performance than hard, more quantifiable criteria such as supplier capability, yet are considered to be less important. Assessment of a supplier's willingness and ability to share information also has a significant impact on the buying firm's performance, yet is again considered to be relatively unimportant.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a fuzzy neural approach, which is characterized by its ability to suggest the appropriate adjustment of product quantity from various suppliers with different quality standards in a supply chain network, is presented. This approach is particularly useful in situations where multiple supply chain partners are involved to achieve the common objective of producing products to the best satisfaction of customer demands at the lowest possible cost. To validate the feasibility of this approach, a test has been conducted based on the proposed fuzzy neural approach with the objective of suggesting the appropriate selection of suppliers and the optimal quantity allocated to them to meet the required quality standards. This paper describes the methodology for the deployment of this proposed hybrid approach to enhance the machine intelligence of a supply chain network with the description of a case study to exemplify its underlying principles.</jats:p>",

WERF Project #99-WWF-7, Developing and Implementing a Performance Measurement System, is developing performance measurement systems by investigating a number of “best practices” in other industries and implementing selected practices at various water/wastewater utilities nationwide to determine how these practices can be adapted and applied. This joint WERF/AWWARF research project has been underway since mid-1999 to provide methods and tools that enable the utility to develop and implement a performance measurement system based on a demonstrated, proven approach.

The IWA Task Force recommendations provide overdue clarification and guidance on several issues that have caused persistent problems in quantifying Water Losses and comparing the effectiveness of their management.

To reach these objectives, a public or semi-public utility needs to invest in system maintenance and rehabilitation. For the system analyst it is difficult to give specific action threshold values for each indicator describing the network performance. Preferences differ and interdependencies between criteria do not allow, by conventional scoring models, determination of those projects which are the most efficient. Another method is presented for ranking rehabilitation projects according to multiple criteria with respect to efficiency.

Towns and municipalities in this case became shareholders of those companies. At the end of nineties, big international companies bought shares of both operational and ownership companies. Municipalities have to, by law, ensure the operation of public water pipelines. However, by the sale of shares they have lost a possibility to participate in decision making.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A question about future co-operation between towns and municipalities and ownership companies appears. An example of the North Moravian Water and Sewerage Works Company was used to describe a possible way of co-operation between a private company and the municipalities on whose territory the company operates. Contracts between the ownership company and particular municipalities were agreed. This solution turned out to be complicated, so the municipalities affiliated and established Water Management Association. The objective of the Association is to promote common interests of the municipalities in relation to the water company. A contract was agreed between the Water Management Association and the company about co-operation in the area of water tariff setting and public waterworks' development.</jats:p>",

The second part of the paper deals with the development of the stock of water mains and sewers from the past to the future. Future rehabilitation needs in terms of annual mileage of pipelines reaching the end of their service life are forecast with a cohort survival model. In the third part of the paper, some preliminary results are presented on the mass and energy flows of water mains and sewers.

Characterised by its integrated team approach, it allows the construction contractor to take a more central role in the design process than its traditional alternatives. Its global popularity and rate of adoption necessitate greater understanding by those involved, particularly client organisations whose primary business is not construction. This research is focused on understanding the team dynamics at the pre‐tender stage. Employing a grounded theory methodology and semi‐structured interviews, the central theme of “short‐circuiting” the tender development process by architects emerged. Four major themes responsible for short‐circuiting are: the quality and distribution of the “employer’s requirements”; architect’s unwillingness to realign their role with design and build; clarity of the contractor’s communication channels; and client’s misunderstanding of the time required to successfully procure buildings. The short‐circuiting manifests itself in a confusion of roles and responsibility of the parties involved, leading to client dissatisfaction in the finished construction product.</jats:p>",

Vertical information sharing has two effects: \"direct effect\" due to the changes in strategy by the parties involved in sharing the information and \"indirect effect\" (or \"leakage effect\") due to the changes in strategy by other competing firms (who may infer the information from the actions of the informed parties). Both changes would affect the profitability of the firms. We show that the leakage effect discourages the retailers from sharing their demand information with the manufacturer while encouraging them to share their cost information. On the other hand, the direct effect always discourages the retailers from sharing their information. When voluntary information sharing is not possible, we identify conditions under which information can be traded and show how price should be determined to facilitate such information exchange. We also examine the impact of vertical information sharing on the total supply chain profits and social benefits. </jats:p>",

Costs related to sewer replacement and remediation are quite high, but there is limited knowledge and documentation on the relationship between hydrogen sulphide levels and corrosion rates. This is necessary information in order to select the appropriate means of hydrogen sulphide control and to conduct cost-benefit evaluations. This pilot scale study shows that the concrete corrosion rate can be modeled by a Monod type function with Ks=2 ppm H2S in gas and a maximum concrete corrosion rate at 25°C of 16 mm/year. Complete hydrogen sulphide control with 0 ppm H2S in water and gas is required to prevent concrete corrosion. This can be achieved by controlled treatment with nitrate using the Nutriox® Concept where the nitrate dose is based on flow, temperature, sewer design, and sewage concentration. The local conditions will be important for the cost-benefit evaluations, but in general terms, one can say that the longer the hydraulic retention time is, the more cost effective will a controlled treatment with nitrate be for corrosion control.</jats:p>",

Coliforms have been seen in water within the Vivendi Water UK area during the summer months and their presence has previously been explained by localised pipe renovation. In this study, the influence that the algal bloom has on the presence of coliforms has been assessed. It has been shown that there is a strong link between the end of the algal bloom and coliforms being found in the distribution system. The algal bloom does not allow coliforms to pass through the treatment works. However, the high level of total organic carbon (TOC) in the treated water, made up of algal breakdown products, provides a good nutritional source for regrowth in the distribution system. Where there are high TOC levels, coliforms can grow even with high chlorine concentrations. However, where there is little TOC, then even a very low chlorine residual is adequate to prevent coliform growth.</jats:p>",

Economically aligned strategies of the network renewal do still not exist in many places. In the context of a federal research project at the ESWE Supply PLC in Wiesbaden, a software for economical rehabilitation planning as well as the appropriate database are created. From damage data and the use of economical algorithms this program sets up damage prognoses for individual line sections of the supply network. By inclusion costs of renewal and sanitation measures the expected costs in the future can be calculated on the basis of these damage prognoses. The line sections can be sorted according to different criteria in the program. Thereby, the network planner has the possibility to quickly and efficiently finding the exact line sections of the network which must be renewed or sanitized. In parallel to the software development, investigations into the causes of damage like aggressive soils or earth movements were executed. They supply further important information for the specification of the decisions of the network planner. This information was integrated into the resource information system and can be recalled for planning purposes. Thus the combination of an economical rehabilitation program and resource information system, provides an optimal package for decision making to aid the network planner.</jats:p>",

The Tolt and Cedar Treatment Plants, which provide drinking water for 1.3 million people, are being implemented using a design-build-operate (DBO) approach. This process has resulted in savings of 40% for the Tolt and 30% for the Cedar, relative to the estimated cost of implementing the projects using a conventional design-bid-build procurement with City operations for 25 years. In using the DBO approach, owners seek to optimize efficiency and the potential for innovation by conducting a competition to supply a bundled set of services including permitting, design, construction,and long-term operations. Benefits from this approach arise through design-build synergies, design-operate synergies, and through more focused competition than exists in the segmented design-bid-build model typically used. This paper will focus not only on the DBO approach and its resulting benefits, but perhaps more importantly on the critical issue of risk allocation. Finally, a discussion of our experience with these two premier projects will highlight the importance of a thoughtful procurement process and adherence to partnering approach to contract management in assuring the integrity of risk management principles.</jats:p>",

Therefore we have covered the entire length of newly laid pipes with polyethylene sleeves as an anti-corrosion measure. However, leakage incidents caused by external corrosion occurred occasionally along a total of 856 km of distribution pipes laid before this measure started. Such a problem of widespread maintenance of externally corroded distribution pipes was quite rare in Japan. We investigated the cause of external corrosion and corrosion situations and derived the formula to predict depth of external corrosion. Consequently, we established an effective renewal method by building an externally corroded pipe danger map to give renewal priority to externally corroded distribution pipes depending on leakage possibility.</jats:p>",

Several tests were conducted to estimate the meter's lifetime, but also fouling layers in the meter house and mechanism were examined. From the research it was concluded that meters based on a volumetric measurement were most accurate, and showed less susceptibility to fouling.

Outsourcing of NRW reduction activities is often the only feasible solution. The paper describes the concept of “performance target based non-revenue water reduction contracts” in general and provides detailed information on the world's largest NRW reduction contract - the Selangor NRW reduction project. The performance target of Phase 1 was to reduce NRW by 18,540 m3/day. The works were completed on time and the target has been over-achieved. Based on this success, Phase 2 of the project has commenced in April 2000 with the aim of reducing NRW across the entire state of Selangor, by 200,000 m3/day over a 9 year period. After the first 15 months of the project, all targets have been substantially over-achieved. The project cost is RM 398 M (equivalent to US$ 105 million) with a pay-back period of 6.7 years. The internal rate of return was calculated to be 33.2% based on the assumption that the value of water equals the average tariff of RM 1.27 (equivalent to US$ 0.33). It can be concluded that performance target based NRW reduction contracts are a feasible model for water utilities around the world.</jats:p>",

In this study, 29 wastewater treatment plants from eight countries were surveyed with the aim of developing some key performance indicators, which may be used for benchmarking purposes.

The study of ICA utilisation revealed that on average only 23% of all sensors are used for online control. For most parameters, ICA is not the single dominant factor determining performance, although it is the factor that has the highest potential to improve performance. Eighty percent of the participating plants had implemented new control during the last five years leading to improvements in nitrogen and phosphorous removal, energy efficiency and ease of operation. The survey has quantified how “non-standardised” wastewater treatment plant operational practice is. Some simple key performance indicators are derived that relate the level of removal of ammonium, total nitrogen, phosphorous and suspended solids to the resources needed for their removal, i.e. volume, energy, organic matter and precipitation chemicals. Several indicators are suggested for each substance.

Stainless steel (ss) and unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) coupons were conditioned with biofilm in each device for a period of 70 days. Biofilm removal techniques (sonication and stomaching) were evaluated and optimized for this study. A multiparametric quantification of biofilm biomass using total protein (NanoOrange™ protein determination) and carbohydrate (phenol-sulfuric assay) content, total number of bacterial cells (BacLight™ Live/Dead® Bacterial Viability Kit) and total number of heterotrophic bacteria (R2A plate counts) is proposed. The presence of biofilm-associated faecal indicator organisms (Enterococci, E. coli, somatic, F-RNA and B40-8 bacteriophages) was assayed for each biofilm homogenate. Variability both within and between biofilm devices was observed. Notwithstanding the shortcomings of the inherent heterogeneity observed with biofilm quantification, the relatively inexpensive biofilm devices were shown to yield reliable and comparable information on biofilm growth within an urban water distribution system. Furthermore, the multiparametric measurement of biofilm biomass was shown to provide a reliable and holistic quantification of distribution pipe biofilms.</jats:p>",

Bacterial regrowth deteriorates water quality (taste and odor), accelerates corrosion, and potentially increases the risk of microbial diseases. Therefore, this research was conducted to evaluate the impact of four different advanced water treatment processes, including biological treatments such as a rotating biofilm membrane reactor (RBMR) and a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter and ultrafiltration (UF), on reduction of nutrient levels and biofilm formation potentials of the treated water entering model distribution systems (annular reactors). Our results revealed that biological treatments significantly improved the “biostability” of water leaving from the treatment plant. On average, The RBMR and BAC filter reduced easily assimilable organic carbon (AOC) concentration by half when compared with conventional treatment (multi-media filtration; MF) and ultrafiltration (from 35-49 to 18-23 mg C L-1). Consequently, biofilm formation potential was reduced by a factor of 5 to 10 (from 3,200-5,100 to 490-710 pg ATP cm-2). With respect to “biostability” of water, ultrafiltration was less effective in reducing AOC concentrations. In addition, the impact of chlorine disinfection on biofilm accumulation and AOC levels in the distribution system were studied.</jats:p>",

Incorporated in our definition of UWS, is the condition that the functioning within the system is critical for sustainability as such and three sub-systems are distinguished: households, organisation and technical structure.

This paper empirically addressed these questions using data from a large single nation study, and found (1) a positive link between e‐integration and performance, and (2) that internal barriers impeded e‐integration more than either upstream supplier barriers or downstream customer barriers. Findings from this study contribute to our theoretical understanding of implementing change in contemporary supply chains, and have important implications for manufacturers interested in improving their supply chain's performance using the Internet.</jats:p>",

The water supply reservoirs are not using conventional reservoir operating rule curves. Instead, dynamic operating rules opportunistically supply surplus water for soft demands, and proactively adjust the water supply before a drought causes a water shortage. The conventional approach of forcing water levels to follow a set rule curve is replaced with notions of tradeoffs between long-term reliability and short-term supply opportunities. Operators can customise the dynamic rules based on their tolerance of shortages, and can choose to operate more aggressively during wet periods. In this way, the dynamic rules offer a flexible tool for making short-term decisions while managing medium and long-term performance goals. In the case of La Paz, it is possible to utilise the water sources more efficiently in the short-term without significantly reducing the long-term water supply reliability. The dynamic rules will reduce the severity of future water shortages (if they occur) by 60%, and provide opportunities to increase the firm water supply by up to 8% without affecting the long-term reliability.</jats:p>",

This phenomenon is of concern as the noble shift in the corrosion potential may lead to pitting corrosion. We have demonstrated, by growing pure cultures of manganese oxidizing bacteria (MOB) Leptothrix discophora SP-6 under well defined conditions, that microbial deposition of manganese oxides causes ennoblement of 316L stainless steel (SS). Exposing 316L corrosion coupons in lakes and streams supported this conclusion; the rate and extent of ennoblement were positively correlated with the rates of deposition and the amounts of biomineralized manganese oxides deposited on the surfaces of the SS corrosion coupons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the deposits from the ennobled coupons revealed a mixture of manganese oxides, as expected. Many natural waters can support growth of MOB. When manganese-oxidizing biofilms accumulate on surfaces of passive metals there is a potential for manganese redox cycling on the metal surface. This process is initiated by depositing minute amounts of manganese oxides on the metal surface. These microbially deposited manganese oxides are then reduced by the electrons derived from anodic dissolution of the metal; the metal is corroding and the manganese oxides are reduced to divalent manganese ions. However, since the manganese ions are liberated within the manganese-oxidizing biofilm, the manganese ions are immediately reoxidized, and the cycle continues.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the sensitivity of biofilm bacteria with previously established cuprosolvency activity, isolated from domestic copper plumbing pipes, to chlorine and copper and assessed their potential to adsorb aqueous copper. Bacterial suspensions were exposed to free chlorine residuals of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/L and viable bacteria enumerated at times 0, 1, 2, 5 and 10 minutes. Disinfection curves showed the isolated bacteria were more resistant to free chlorine in comparison to the indicator organism Escherichia coli. Disc diffusion assays demonstrated high resistance by all bacteria to copper, with a Corynebacteria sp. showing no growth inhibition at concentrations up to 4 gCu/L. The isolated bacteria showed the ability to bind aqueous copper ions from solution in adsorption experiments. Significantly higher adsorption of copper was shown by a species of Pseudomonas. The results of this research will provide a greater understanding of causes of biofilm accumulation and copper contamination of drinking water, aiding in health risk assessment and risk management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Growing population and increasing urbanization is resulting in shortages of water supply for communities even in water-rich areas of the world. An approach to addressing this problem has been the introduction of wastewater reclamation and reuse for nonpotable purposes through dual distribution systems in municipalities in the United States on a significant scale in the 1970s and more recently in Japan and Australia. Many hundreds of communities, some very small and others very large, have adopted dual systems to add to their water resources and to reduce the burden of water pollution. Two issues deserve attention. The first is that the provision of water supply and its regulation by government is generally entirely separated from the provision of sewerage and wastewater treatment, so that the management of a reclaimed water service requires new arrangements both on the part of communities and of the government agencies that are concerned with the oversight of water supply and pollution control. The second issue is that the availability of new technology for treating waters drawn from polluted sources has led to proposals for purposefully using reclaimed water for potable purposes. The integration of water supply and wastewater disposal functions in professional organizations, such as IWA, is a useful step towards integrating water management in practice.</jats:p>",

Reducing the amount of microbial available substrate may be an effective way to control bacterial aftergrowth. The purpose of the present study was to study the kinetics of substrate utilisation and bacterial growth at low nutrient conditions in a model distribution system. The model system consisted of two loops in series, where flow rate and retention time were controlled independently. Spiking the drinking water of the model system with two different environmentally realistic concentrations of carbon allowed for a close monitoring of the kinetics of substrate turnover (less than 10 μmg C/L 14C-benzoic acid was added). The mineralisation of benzoic acid was rapid and could be modelled by a no-growth Monod expression using a maximum degradation rate of 0.59 μmg C/L/h and a half-saturation constant of 2.6 μmg C/L. Only 2-4% of the carbon being degraded was incorporated into the biofilm. The results from our study suggest that the cell-specific respiration of biofilm was much higher than for suspended bacteria, and that the growth rate of the bulk phase bacteria was approximately 10 times higher than the biofilm bacteria.</jats:p>",

Solving these conflicts means a reorganisation of land use. A non-governmental committee has initiated a voluntary compromise program for the water-protection zone of the Donauried. On the basis of criteria assessing the significance of areas of land, a plan for the reorganisation of land use has been developed. Moreover, an action plan has been prepared; it includes steps for reducing nitrate, a program for reducing land-use intensity, a concept for re-wetting bog areas and an investigation into measures for optimising local water resources using a numerical groundwater model.

Although the decision to outsource can have both positive and adverse effects on key areas of the manufacturing supply chain, one positive effect is that the manufacturer’s supply chain agility is increased. Outsourcing has caused an increase in the amount of information that is shared between supply chain partners. As a result, a greater reliance on suppliers and alliance partners has become essential for company survival. We examine the ways in which contract manufacturing has increased the agility of the electronics manufacturing supply chain.</jats:p>",

Eolian erosion of the lake floors and lunette accretion occurred as groundwater levels declined in response to decreased groundwater recharge. The declining lake floor associated with eolian erosion allowed groundwater evaporative discharge to continue, thus maintaining a groundwater gradient toward the lake. This hydrologic condition was favorable for a relatively continuous spring discharge to the lake, independent of the elevation of the lake floor. To evaluate the postulated dynamic equilibrium critical to this conclusion, 17 optically stimulated ages were determined from a 17.7-m deep core of a lunette adjacent to Double Lakes, Texas (33°13′15″N, 101°54′08″W). The core yielded sediment accumulation dates of 11,500±1100, 6500±700, and 4900±500 yr B.P., corresponding broadly with periods of aridity known from other evidence. Based on analysis of this lunette, it is concluded that springs in Double Lakes basin probably existed throughout the Holocene with discharges similar to those observed historically. We assumed that similar dynamic equilibrium existed in the other large lake basins in the SHP and that these springs could have provided a continuous source of water for indigenous peoples during periods of prolonged aridity. The dynamic equilibrium that is proposed in this study is applicable not only to other arid and semiarid geographic areas with wind-erodible material but also over different geologic times.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, complex tasks in general have multiple criteria that may be conflicting and non-commensurable. This paper presents a two-stage brokering algorithm for optimal anytime service allocation based on multiple criteria. In the first stage, a hierarchical task network planner is used to identify the services required to solve a task. In the second stage, a genetic algorithm (GA) determines service providers based on multiple criteria to provide the services identified by the planner. We present our algorithm and results from various experiments conducted to analyze the effect of various parameters that influence the complexity of the problem. In general, the results show the GA finds optimal solutions much quicker than a standard search algorithm. The empirical results also indicate the performance of the algorithm is sub-linear or polynomial time for various parameters. The algorithm has the ability to deal with any number of criteria. By addressing this problem, we expand the range of problems being addressed to any that require simultaneous optimization of multiple criteria and/or planning. </jats:p>",

The first one is a free-running uncontrolled-driven Xe discharge lamp, where a positive high-voltage pulse obtained from the ignition coil is applied directly to an anode electrode of the Xe lamp. The second one refined is a synchronized-driven Xe discharge lamp, in which a capacitance C attached on the anode electrode of the lamp is charged up in a stepwise fashion to the breakdown voltage of the lamp and then an external control signal for triggering the lamp discharge is fed on a high-voltage semiconductor switch connected between the cathode electrode of the lamp and the ground. Unlike the conventional discharge lamp, no high-voltage dc power supply is required and, therefore, it is free from undesirable arc discharge problems. To increase the repetition frequency of the pulsed emission, two ignition coils whose operating phases are shifted by 180° with respect to each other are incorporated. When C=10 pF, the pulse width, peak power, and repetition frequency were 8.0 ns, 2.0 W, and 125 Hz, respectively, with a time jitter of 60 ns.</jats:p>",

Nitrate and phosphate were added to all enclosures (NP), while silicate was added to four of the enclosures (NPS). Each enclosure received the same total amount of nutrients, but the nutrients were supplied at four different intervals ranging from one single load to continuous additions. Spring bloom-like systems developed where nutrients were added in one or two pulses as they were characterised by high primary production, high suspended biomass of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and particulate organic carbon (POC) and high sedimentation rates. In contrast, the seawater enclosures receiving nutrients about every third day or in a continuous supply resembled regenerated systems with low concentrations of suspended Chl a and POC and with low and stable loss rates. Due to a typical autumn inoculum with dominance of dinoflagellates and flagellates, diatoms did not dominate the NPS enclosures. The only significant effect of the silicate addition was higher vertical flux of particulate organic nitrogen in the NPS enclosures, and higher microzooplankton biomass. The mesozooplankton did not show responses to the different frequencies of nutrient additions. However, accumulation of mesozooplankton biomass was higher in the NP-mesocosms, probably reflecting better feeding conditions. We conclude that the frequency of nutrient additions had a stronger influence on the development of the phytoplankton and vertical flux of carbon than the +/- silicate treatment in this experiment.</jats:p>"

The problem of price uncertainty created within these two environments is modelled as a stochastic repetitive‐sales problem, applicable to any probability distribution. The model identifies sufficient conditions for regenerative ordering cycles, which allows for the use of the renewal reward theorem. The end result is a two‐price purchasing policy, which may substantially ease implementation problems across a global corporation's purchasing managers world‐wide and across B2B markets.</jats:p>",

Ca2+ entry into the proximal endolymph was faster than into the distal fluid. Net Ca2+ movement across the saccular epithelium depended on the direction and intensity of the chemical gradient of calcium between the Ringer solution and the endolymph. Increasing the calcium concentration in the Ringer solution up to 4.4 mmol l-1 provoked an accumulation of Ca2+ in both proximal and distal endolymphs, and equilibrium was reached about 30 min after the beginning of perfusion. Perfusion with calcium-free Ringer partially emptied the proximal compartment of calcium, whereas the calcium levels in the distal endolymph did not vary during 70 min of perfusion. Verapamil (10-5 mol l-1) and cyanide (CN, 10-3 mol l-1) did not modify the accumulation of Ca2+ within the endolymph in the presence of a favourable calcium chemical gradient. Furthermore the relationship between Ca2+ net fluxes and the chemical calcium gradient across the saccular epithelium was linear, indicating a passive diffusional mechanism via a paracellular pathway. Similar relationships were found for Sr2+ fluxes across the saccular epithelium in the presence of positive chemical gradients (1, 2 and 4 mmol l-1 Sr2+). In vivo experiments in which trout were intraperitoneously injected with CaCl2 solution confirmed the tight relationship between the calcium levels in plasma and endolymph (both proximal and distal). Sampling proximal and distal endolymphs in trout and turbot saccules revealed a decreasing proximo—distal calcium gradient in endolymph of both fish species. The present results strongly suggest that the endolymph is supplied with Ca2+ and Sr2+via a paracellular pathway located in the proximal area of the saccular epithelium.</jats:p>",

Randstad shows a medium level density of the motorway network, with a relatively low capacity when related to the number of residents within the region. The high number of motorway exits, however, compensates for the limited regional road network. The rail network density in Randstad is also relatively limited. Road and rail networks are used intensively in Randstad, when compared to the other regions. The resulting quality of transportation networks is quite good, but the faster population growth, and the limited remaining capacity and lack of alternative routes questions the future adequacy of these networks.</jats:p>",

The gorge is typical of many steepland fluvial systems in the Mediterranean, with steep relief, coarse‐gravel sediments and high rates of sedimentation generated during intense winter storm events. Hillslope deposits and coarse‐gravel flood units within a 5 km section of the gorge have been mapped, dated (using lichenometry and dendrochronology), and their sedimentological characteristics recorded to establish a <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. 200‐year record of flood frequency/magnitude and hillslope/channel sediment supply variability. This record has been compared with instrumented and previously published records of climate change from Crete and the Mediterranean region and used to establish the major controls on flooding and sediment dynamics within the Aradena Gorge.</jats:p><jats:p>Rates of colluviation and sediment delivery to the channel appear to have been greater than the present sometime before <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. <jats:sc>AD</jats:sc> 1800 and may be related to cooler climates with a more seasonal precipitation regime during the Little Ice Age (<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>. <jats:sc>AD</jats:sc> 1450 to 1850). In gorge sections where the present rate of sediment supply from hillslope colluvium is very low, the channel has incised into older alluvial and colluvial deposits. Conversely, in the few sections where sediment supply is currently very high, the channel is aggrading with a braided pattern. Major rock‐fall deposits at certain locations in the gorge have restricted any major downstream sediment transfer.</jats:p><jats:p>Twelve periods of increased flooding during the last 150 years have been identified and these correlate quite well with negative or declining phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Analysis of daily precipitation data from Crete suggests negative phases of the winter NAO are characterized by an increase in the number of long‐duration, high‐intensity storms. These storms, particularly those with five‐day and greater duration, appear to be significant in triggering major floods in the Aradena Gorge. During the last 40 years the NAO index has been increasing and become locked into a positive phase. As a consequence of this, major flooding appears to have declined during the same period.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Oxygen supply and demand of individual cardiomyocytes during the development of myocardial hypertrophy is studied using calibrated histochemical methods. An oxygen diffusion model is used to calculate the critical extracellular oxygen tension (PO<jats:sub>2,crit</jats:sub>) required by cardiomyocytes to prevent hypoxia during hypertrophic growth, and determinants of PO<jats:sub>2,crit</jats:sub> are estimated using calibrated histochemical methods for succinate dehydrogenase activity, cardiomyocyte cross‐sectional area, and myoglobin concentration. The model calculation demonstrates that it is essential to calibrate the histochemical methods, so that absolute values for the relevant parameters are obtained. The succinate dehydrogenase activity, which is proportional to the maximum rate of oxygen consumption, and the myoglobin concentration hardly change while the cardiomyocytes grow. The cross‐sectional area of the cardiomyocytes, which increases up to threefold in the right ventricular wall due to pulmonary hypertension in monocrotaline‐treated rats, is the most important determinant of PO<jats:sub>2,crit</jats:sub> in this model of myocardial hypertrophy. The relationship between oxygen supply and demand at the level of the cardiomyocyte can be investigated using paired determinations of spatially integrated succinate dehydrogenase activity and capillary density. Hypoxia‐inducible factor 1α can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in cardiomyocytes with high PO<jats:sub>2,crit</jats:sub> and increased spatially integrated succinate dehydrogenase activity, indicating that limited oxygen supply affects gene expression in these cells. We conclude that a mismatch of oxygen supply and demand may develop during hypertrophic growth, which can play a role in the transition from myocardial hypertrophy to heart failure. Microsc. Res.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract</jats:bold> Long‐term exposure of plants to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> often leads to downward photosynthetic acclimation. Nitrogen (N) deficiency could potentially exacerbate this response by reducing growth rate and the sink for photosynthates, but this has not always been observed. Experimentally, the interpretation of N effects on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> responses can be confounded by increasing severity of tissue N deficiency over time when N supply is not adjusted as demand increases. In this study, N supply ranged from sub‐ to supra‐optimal (20–540 kgN ha<jats:sup>–l</jats:sup> equivalent), and relatively stable levels of tissue N concentration were obtained in all treatments by varying twice‐weekly application rates in proportion to plant growth. The effects of N on photosynthesis and growth of beans (<jats:italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</jats:italic> L.) raised at ambient (35 Pa) and three elevated (70, 105, 140 Pa) CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> partial pressures (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) were evaluated. Averaging across N treatments, leaf total non‐structural carbohydrates (TNC) were 2.5‐ to 3‐fold higher and leaf N concentrations were 31–35% lower at elevated compared to ambient <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Light‐saturated net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> assimilation rates measured at growth <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (<jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>satg</jats:sub>) were significantly higher (26–40% depending on N supply) in plants grown at elevated compared to ambient <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. When measured at a common <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> of 35 Pa, the <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>sat</jats:sub> of plants grown at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was 15–29% less than that of plants grown at 35 Pa, indicative of downward photosynthetic acclimation. The magnitude of downward photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was greater in plants grown at high (180 and 540 kgN ha<jats:sup>–l</jats:sup>) compared to low (20 and 60 kgN ha<jats:sup>–l</jats:sup>) N supply, and this was associated with a higher <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sub>sat</jats:sub> at growth <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, higher leaf area ratio (leaf area/total biomass), and higher TNC in leaves of high‐N plants. Our results indicate that the effect of N on acclimation to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> will depend on the balance between supply and demand for N during the growing period, and the effect this has on biomass allocation and source‐sink C balance at the whole‐plant level.</jats:p>",

Decreased productivity is expected under conditions of limited external N availability, due to the higher retention of N in senescent tissues. However, this has not been reported when plants are grown at limiting low external concentrations of N. In the present study a different approach was taken, based on the relative addition rate method for defining limiting N supply. Wild‐type and <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> genotypes of <jats:italic>Lolium perenne</jats:italic> L. were grown for 30 days in flowing solution culture and then supplied with NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> on an hourly basis over 35 days at relative addition rates (RARs) of 0.03, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, ranging from severe N limitation to optimal supply. Plants were steady‐state labelled with <jats:sup>15</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> prior to RAR treatments, then switched to <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>–</jats:sup> to allow measurement of the re‐distribution of N absorbed prior to RAR control. Following acclimation, relative growth rates (RGRs) approached the corresponding RAR, but were significantly lower for <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> than wild‐type at RARs of 0.03 and 0.06 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Tiller numbers were lower in <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> plants after 35 days at all RARs except 0.12 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. Concentrations of total N in senescent laminae of <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> plants exceeded those in wild‐type plants by a similar margin (4.8–6.8 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DW) irrespective of RAR. Maximum nitrogen productivity (P<jats:sub>n</jats:sub>) was 3.9 g DW g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (N<jats:sub>min</jats:sub> = 7.1 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DW) in wild‐type plants, and 5.1 g DW g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> N day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> (N<jats:sub>min</jats:sub> = 10.7 mg g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> DW) in <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> plants. The higher N productivity of <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> plants indicated these plants used a smaller pool of metabolically available N more efficiently in biosynthesis compared with wild‐type plants. The retention of N, absorbed prior to RAR treatments, in senescent laminae was significantly higher in <jats:italic>stay‐green</jats:italic> plants at RAR of 0.03 day<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> after day 21 (i.e. 20% versus 15% of the total N recovered).

Organic systems have the potential to supply adequate amounts of available N to meet crop demand through the incorporation of leys, N rich cash crop residues and uncomposted manures. However, this is seldom achieved because leys are only incorporated once every few years and organically produced crop residues and manures tend to have low N contents and slow mineralization rates. N availability could be improved by delaying ley incorporation until spring, applying uncomposted manures at the start of spring growth, transferring some manure applications from the ley phase to arable crops, preventing cover crops from reaching a wide C:N ratio and better matching crop type with the dynamics of N availability.</jats:p>",

When averaged over N treatments, early virus yellows infection reduced the sugar yields by 23%. Generally there was no significant interaction between N supply and virus infection. There was no evidence that the large N supply could reduce the yield effect of virus yellows infection, as had previously been thought. Crops infected from late July produced similar yields to uninoculated controls. The main effect of virus yellows was to reduce the efficiency of radiation conversion even when account was taken of the light intercepted by yellow foliage. Whilst the N2 treatment helped to maintain a green leaf cover throughout the season on virus yellows infected crops, it had no effect on virus replication. Beet processing quality was impaired by increasing the N supply and by virus infection, but again there were generally no significant interactions between infection and N rate.</jats:p>",
