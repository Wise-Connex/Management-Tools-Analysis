A quantitative approach was adopted for this study; a multi-item measurement scale was adapted from previous studies to collect primary data—the total number of 212 responses from supply chain professionals were collected. Descriptive analysis along with the correlation examination was utilized to test the hypothesis. It was observed that all the hypotheses (H1, H2, H3, and H4) were supported. Customer green purchasing, green customer cooperation, supplier quality integration, and customer quality integration were found significantly related to the environmental performance. So the study concluded that implementing green supply chain management practices in the firm is beneficial and it enhances the firm's environmental performance. This detailed research analysis will play an active role for the supply chain executives in taking effective decisions that will ultimately enhance environmental performance. This research study will facilitate the managers and all decision makers by providing directions and guidance for improving the level of performance of the environment.</jats:p>"

To this end, it has been expanded to include supply chain risk management in the existing supply chain competence perspective(three elements). In detail, the supply chain capability (agility and robustness) that can evaluate the level of supply chain risk management was proposed as a lagging factor of supply chain competence, and supply chain capability was proposed as a leading factor in supply chain performance and supply chain risk management performance. As a result of the analysis, supply chain competence had a significant positive effect on supply chain capability, and supply chain capability had a significant positive impact on supply chain performance as well as supply chain risk management performance. This study suggested the need to develop supply chain competence to manage supply chain risks. In addition, it is significant in that it confirmed that supply chain risk management can improve not only performance in crisis situations, but also overall performance of the supply chain.</jats:p>",

More explicitly, the main emphasize of this research was on IOS use and supply chain management capabilities, and supply chain performance. A quantitative approach was adopted for this study, and a multi-item measurement scale was adapted from previous studies; a structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data. Two hundred thirty-six responses were collected from supply chain employees in various textile sectors. Further, regression analysis was applied for hypothesis testing. The analysis of employees' responses collected from various firms reveals that the use of IOS increases the level of supply chain performance and directly enhances the capabilities of SCM. In addition, it was observed that the influence of SCM capabilities on supply chain performance was very insightful, influential, and even more significant than the impact of IOS use on SC performance. This research study can be helpful for supply chain managers and decision-makers. It gives them guidance for enhancing the supply chain resilience of an organization. It provides a framework containing Communication, Intelligence, Information exchange, Integration, Coordination, and Responsiveness to enhance supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Like other countries, Germany is now following suit and introducing a supply chain law. This type of law obliges companies to exercise due diligence towards suppliers. Compliance with human rights, environmental protection and social standards must be ensured not only for direct suppliers, but along the entire supply chain. This significantly increases the complexity of procurement and poses challenges for existing purchasing organisations. What is needed is an approach that enables the legal requirements to be met with manageable effort. This conceptual paper discusses approaches for companies to reduce the resulting effort from supply chain law initiative — especially in Germany — and even improve performance at the same time. Audits are shown to be a central means of meeting these legal obligations. This also includes so-called remote audits, which promise comparatively low-effort execution, especially in a global context. Based on the application of international standards, the paper complies with the due diligence obligations of the supply chain law. The result is an assessment of whether and to what extent remote audits are suitable for fulfilling the obligation, how they can be optimally organised in agile interaction with on-site audits and where the limits are. It is also evident that auditing of direct and indirect suppliers in the supply chain can be used to achieve performance improvements and cost reductions elsewhere. Finally, the paper summarises which accompanying measures help to further reduce the burden on companies.</jats:p>"

This chapter examines the digital transformation of supply chains and digitalization challenges in Japan. Many companies seem to realize the importance of digital transformation; however, on their way to digitalization companies face numerous challenges like a shortage of human and financial resources, a lack of awareness and understanding of digital transformation processes, etc. Moreover, Japanese culture does not easily fit digital transformation which also slows down the pace of transformation. As a result, the supply chain processes in the Japanese manufacturing companies remain old-fashioned, fragmented, siloed, with a lack of global vision and proper understanding of potential risks. To meet the needs of diverse customers, ensure global supply, and compete in uncertain environment, the SCM of Japanese companies has to be digitally upgraded and become more complex to achieve end-to-end supply chain optimization and an advanced decision-making. </jats:p>",

Excessive measurement variation in the supply chain can result in unfavourable business impacts including ‘hidden factory’ effects. This paper will address relevant considerations for how to characterise measurement variation in the supply chain through a Gage repeatability and reproducibility (R&amp;R) process, and the application of Industry 4.0, Quality 4.0, data sciences, Big Data and artificial intelligence (AI) and their implications within the realm of measurement systems analysis.</jats:p>"

The article may also be useful to employees who investigate accidents, people who are preparing to pass exams in labor protection and their further work. Human life and health are a very important factor in the production process. the employer is obliged to create working conditions at each workplace, in each structural unit in accordance with regulations, as well as to ensure compliance with the requirements of the legislation on workers' rights in accordance with applicable regulations. However, analyzing the current regulations, we can see that in different existing documents the issue is treated differently. Instead of supplementing documents with each other, specifying requirements, creating a holistic and unambiguous picture in general, there is inaccuracy, ambiguity of understanding, complexity and sometimes inability to meet existing requirements. This situation does not improve the situation as a whole The analysis shows some discrepancies between existing regulations, some of their mutual inaccuracy, which complicates the use of these documents in practice, in the operation of certain facilities, in writing instructions on labor protection, in investigating accidents at work, especially in high-risk work, including gas-hazardous.

The under voltage has severe impacts on the consumer loads working conditions causing overloads and high transmission losses. The under-voltage limit has been set for voltage below 0.9p.u. The measurement was conducted in the control room for the duration of one week for logging interval of 1-min using Fluke VR1710 that monitors single-phase voltage quality of power network. Long duration variations are considered to be present when the limits are exceeded for greater than 1-minute time lapse. In this paper, the lowest interruption duration recorded was 20 minutes while the number of under-voltages was 41 occurrences. A simple mathematical analysis of power flow deviation was determined for correlation with the frequency disturbances recorded by the equipment. Both measurements and simulation results show that frequency rapidly changes in the network. The lowest and highest frequency vary between (48.7665 Hz to 51.196 Hz) and (48.843 Hz to 51.263 Hz) respectively. Thus, voltage and frequency disturbance statistics vindicate the voltage variation in the site to be within the ±10% limits but the overall performance of frequency monitored in the site violated the operational limits of ±0.2 Hz (i.e. 49.8 Hz to 50.2 Hz) and ±0.5 Hz (i.e. 49.5 Hz to 50.5 Hz) for the statutory regulatory.

The culture method has some limitations in quickly detecting viable Legionella. Therefore, we optimized real-time PCR (qPCR) combined with propidium monoazide (PMA) to quantify viable Legionella in the supply process of tap water, considering factors such as PMA concentration, length of the target gene, and turbidity of water samples. Among 30, 50, 100, and 200 μM PMA concentration, 100 μM PMA had the greatest difference in copy number between PMA-treated live and dead cells while minimizing the cytotoxic effect on live cells. Among the various sizes of the target gene (108, 386, 456, and 654 bp), the primer in 386 bp size effectively excluded dead cells without loss of qPCR efficiency. As a result of applying the PMA-qPCR method to samples including river, purified water, and tap water, live and dead cells could be distinguished for samples with turbidity of less than 10 NTU. The optimized PMA-qPCR can be a useful method of rapidly detecting viable Legionella spp. in the process of supplying tap water, and contributing to tap water that is safe from pathogens.</jats:p>",

If this situation eventuates, lack of gas production will impact the competitiveness of WA’s energy-consuming industries. This paper demonstrates that the Perth Basin has the potential to meet this supply–demand gap and augment existing sources of gas over the next 20+ years. A subsurface-led assessment of the Perth Basin’s Reserves, Contingent Resources and Prospective Resources incorporating all recent exploration well results shows that the unrisked resource potential of the Perth Basin is 7052 bcfe (7.475 PJ) with production potential up to 1100 TJ/day. The basis for these estimates will be illustrated with examples, alongside a discussion of the variables that affect the resource assessment, the impact of capacity constraints on the timing of development of Perth Basin gas, and the dynamics of the WA gas market.

Using data from 191 listed manufacturing firms, it is shown that the dimensions of supply chain diversification and digital transformation do not have the necessary conditions to achieve high supply chain resilience, while the analysis of sufficient conditions shows that three paths can achieve high supply chain resilience—namely, those driven by digital transformation, supply chain diversification, and supplier centralization and customer base diversification.

The disruption brought by the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of responsiveness and agility in service chains in particular. The unprecedented nature of the pandemic, however, has made design of agile and responsive supply chains difficult, especially for services that draw on intangible, unique resources. In this paper, we develop relevant—and thus far largely absent—theory for the design of service supply chains through a model of service supply chain fit that will guide service firms to prepare better for COVID and future threats. Our model guides the identification of the right supply chain (responsive, efficient, or agile) for services based on their operant resources, which are the intangible resources that act on other resources. Using a qualitative study, we first draw on service-dominant logic and supply chain fit framework to develop the concept of service supply chain fit; that is, the strategic consistency between a service firm’s operant resources and its supply chain. We then validate our model using survey data. The results indicate that service supply chain acts as both moderator and mediator for the relationship between operant resources and firm performance. Our findings indicate that, unless managers view service supply chain fit strategically and invest in developing operant resources for the right supply chain, future COVID-like disruptions may continue to severely impact firm performance. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile, innovational significant and positively mediated the relationship between supply chain management five practices and organizational performance. The findings of this study will help managers of SMEs enhance their performance. The results showed that SCMP directly and significantly affected supply chain performance, and customer relationship management was insignificant with supply chain performance. Supplier and customer relationship management both have a significant impact on innovation. In addition, innovation is considered a significant positive predictor for supply chain performance with the intervening approach. But top management commitment proved insignificant for customer relationship management and supply chain performance. The study further concluded that supply chain management practices would not be productive for supply chain performance if the top management does not apply innovative technologies in the organizations.</jats:p>"

The garment industry is still dominated by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) among the textile products. Although these SMEs are considered one of the economic pillars in Indonesia, many challenges require strategical scale-up to improve their competitiveness. One of the aspects to be improved is supply chain performance, as the supply chain controls material, information, and financial flow from both supply and demand sides. This study seeks to measure and evaluate supply chain performance in the garment industry, focusing the case on small and medium-scale enterprises. The Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) is used for Key Performance Index (KPI) determinants. Performance measurement starts by determining the criteria based on the performance measurement literature and expert opinion. Then, the weight of each criterion on the performance score is determined using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Paired comparison questionnaires for the criteria weighting were distributed to experts, and the answers were analyzed. The final performance value is obtained by multiplying the weight with the normalized performance value using the Snorm-De Boer formula. This study obtained 23 indicators from five processes: plan, make, source, deliver, and return, with the final value of SCM performance classified as good. The result can evaluate the company's current condition and propose a strategy to improve its performance.</jats:p>"

Descriptive analysis, along with the correlation examination, was utilized to test the hypothesis. It was observed that hypotheses H1 and H2 were supported, whereas hypothesis H3 was rejected. The findings from the analysis identified that there is a significant relationship between lean manufacturing on the performance of the supply chain in the fertilizer industry. It is found that lean manufacturing can efficiently overcome supply chain challenges and improve efficiency, leading to improved overall performance. Further, the technology integration in SCM processes must be studied and analyzed. The businesses are recommended to develop further strategies to integrate technology into the SCM process and improve productivity and performance.</jats:p>"

The chapter aimed to determine the efficacy of supply chain collaboration on resilience in the industry. Scholars have constantly highlighted the need for supply chain collaboration by building supply chain resilience, necessitated against sporadic, disruptive, and unforeseen events in the business environment. The argument for businesses to desist from working in silos within their supply chain provokes this study. There seems to be a mismatch between the supply chain members in terms of integrating or collaborating efforts and their capabilities to be resilient when faced with disruptions. Organisations need to identify the variables that exist inside and outside of their environment to ensure alignment, collaboration, and integration. Centralisation of stocks, foreign exchange fluctuation, joint business plans, and longstanding collaboration with vendors could help promote supply chain resilience. </jats:p>",

These challenges have critically affected consumers purchasing power, cause increasing high cost of operations, dwindling revenue and consequently decline in operating performance of oil and gas companies, especially oil and gas marketing firms. This study investigated the effect of supply chain risk management strategy on business performance of oil and gas marketing companies in Lagos, Nigeria as moderated by firm size. The study adopted a survey research design. The study population study was 1,044 full-time employees of five selected oil and gas marketing companies in the downstream sector of petroleum industry in Nigeria where a sample size of 362 employees were selected. The study adopted purposive, stratified and proportionate sampling techniques. An adapted and validated questionnaire was used to collect primary data from the respondents. Data was analyzed using descriptive and hierarchical multiple regression technique. Findings indicate supply chain risk management strategy had significant effect on usiness performance of oil and gas marketing companies in Lagos, Nigeria. Finding further revealed that firm size significantly moderated the relationship between supply chain risk management strategy and business performance among oil and gas marketing companies in Lagos, Nigeria. The study recommended that management of oil and gas marketing companies need to employ strategic agility measures in order to thoroughly understand the Nigerian oil and gas business environment which is germane for oil and gas marketers so as to enable them build a framework that will enable them survive the changing environment and gain overall performance.

Formal supply systems are incapable of delivering the daily needs of consumers. Informal supply systems, though filling the demand-supply gap, are increasingly being associated with issues of long-term sustainability, higher consumer cost, and inequity. Emerging formal-informal dynamics in developing countries require a thorough understanding of complex interactions for policy direction, in order to best support the advancement of urban water sustainability. Accordingly, system archetypes offer a platform to explain the behaviors of complex systems. This paper reviews existing literature on formal-informal dynamics and identifies common system archetypes that define urban waterscapes in the developing world. In this way, Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) are used to present the relationships and identify common archetypes that define the complexity of urban water supply systems in Hyderabad, Pakistan. These archetypes include ‘fixes that fail’, ‘shifting the burden’, ‘limits to growth/success’ and ‘growth and underinvestment’. Further, leverage points for each archetype are identified and discussed for policy direction.</jats:p>"

In this context, the selection of suppliers, manufacturers and logistics companies that make up the chain and the relations between them are extremely important, and the quality of the companies that make up the chain must be high in order to create effective and efficient supply chains. In this study, the author aimed to conduct a research on the creation of an integrated supply chain with a collaborative approach. The framework of the study is limited to the producers, suppliers and logistics enterprises, which are the main actors in the agriculture-food value chain.\nMethodology- The author proposes an integrated methodology for collaborative work in the agri-food supply chain. Within the framework of the methodology created within the framework of the CPFR method, the chains that enable the stakeholders included in the system to deliver the product to the demand points at the most affordable cost were determined by the linear programming model. In the second stage, meeting the demands created with random numbers was simulated. Finally, the suitability of the model was tested with the data of a company.\nFindings- The findings show that the product moves less if the stakeholders in the chain are correctly matched within the framework of the collaborative approach. In addition, it has been seen that the needs of both demand points are met thanks to the correct match. In addition, a positive effect has been achieved in the use of the stakeholders' capacities.\nConclusion- This article is one of the first studies that looks at the agri-food supply chain in an integrated way and evaluates the processes within the framework of a collaborative approach. The study also contributes to improvement in the sector in terms of including the stakeholders involved in the collaborative process into the system according to the criteria determined.\n\nKeywords: OR in agriculture, agri-food, agri-food supply chain, holistic design, CPFR\nJEL Codes: M11, Q10, S19\n</jats:p>"

It seeks to understand how women are involved in community-based security groups by investigating and illustrating, among other things, their motivations and roles, the context, and the dynamics that underpin their participation in both the supply side and demand side of security provision. Based on extensive field research and an original dataset of interviews with a wide range of informal security actors, this research report offers two key findings to inform the work of policymakers and practitioners interested in security provision and peacebuilding.   First, while women continue to engage directly and indirectly with community-based armed and informal security groups with a wide range of motivations, their overall place in the landscape of these groups is in flux, and those who participate bear social costs for doing so. Second, women’s influence in shaping the trajectory of community-based armed and security proving groups extends not just to their roles as suppliers of security (or insecurity, in the case of some groups), but as demanders of security. These complex dynamics point to the fact that women’s roles as participants, organizers, and mobilizers/legitimizers in CBAGs in ostensibly post-conflict settings like Côte d’Ivoire are no less complex than in overt conflict settings.</jats:p>"

Organizations that embrace and prepare for change can survive and maintain a competitive position in the new global business environment. In contrast, the industrial businesses that do not implement the new rules will not survive long and will eventually be obsolete. Therefore, the concept of digitization and industrial revolution 4.0 in supply chain management was intended to be reviewed to determine its trending dimensions. This paper conducted a systematic review of 60 articles on the research topic by considering the publication during the period 2017 to 2021. The paper investigated the evolutionary changes in the supply chain's operational functions in the digital and industrial revolution 4.0 context. The main objective of reviewing articles was to identify the new trend on the search topic. Some trends identified in the current research include the use of blockchain in the supply chain and the nine elements of industry 4.0, the internet of things. The paper is equally significant for researchers and practitioners as it explains industry 4.0 and supply chain digitization trends. Future research can evaluate the mathematical, decision-making, and simulation techniques to support the research domain by increasing its applicability. This research allows us to consider the validation of the digital supply chain models and their components presented preliminary by experts that provide a headway toward emerging and new constructs in this domain.</jats:p>"

Hence, the issue of closed-loop supply chain and reverse logistics has emerged as a field of research in the new era. This issue has received much attention because it allows recyclable products to return to their original cycle. Therefore, this study primarily intends to present a mathematical model for designing a supply chain network for recycled products. The multi-stage and multi-period objective function of the closed-loop supply chain is presented to meet that aim. In this chain, dismantling, recycling, and disposal centers are considered. The objective function is to reduce the total cost of the closed-loop supply chain.

This paper investigates the effect factors in implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology by constructing a Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. To achieve the research objectives, this study used two approaches. First, a qualitative approach is used to build a research hypothesis framework. Second, the quantitative approach includes explanatory factor analysis, Pearson Correlation, and regression methods by utilizing survey data on 120 MSMEs in Da Nang. The results indicated that the complexity, compatibility, cost, and external pressure factors are not essential in AI implementation. Referring to those technical factors (relative advantages), organization factors (top management support, organization readiness), and environmental factors (government support) have a positive influence on the technology implementation of AI in supply chain management.</jats:p>",

This amplifies the conservatory cause and global warming by adding huge amounts of greenhouse gases to those already existing in the ambience. One of the strategies to reduce emissions and costs is to amend our firm to perform in an eco-friendly manner. The advent of various green solutions to be addressed in the supply chain (SC) is to blame for environmental issues and increased government pressure. In this article, the consequences of green technology and human error on the vendor-buyer complex SC system are examined using two carbon emission strategies: carbon taxes and limited total carbon emissions. It comprises the buyer inspecting each shipping lot for faulty items that may have come from the vendor's production process. The categorization of faulty and perfect items makes the inspection procedure difficult for the customer. To reduce overall cost, a mathematical model is designed in two alternative scenarios. This entails creating a complicated method to arrive at optimal answers that can be demonstrated both analytically and numerically. Sensitivity analysis is used to explore the implications of changing the core parameter values on the optimal solution. According to the findings, rising the carbon tax eases emissions, and the company has further alternatives to minimize carbon emissions generated by industries activity using green technology.</jats:p>"

In this paper, based on water quality and hydrological data from 2010 to 2020, considering 8 water quality parameters, CCME-WQI with time series analysis was used to explore the interannual and seasonal changes in water quality in the Weishui Reservoir. Furthermore, the main factors affecting water quality were discussed through correlation analysis. The ARIMA model is used to predict water quality in the future. The results show that the water quality was seriously polluted from 2012 to 2013. After 2018, the water quality gradually improved and stabilized. In addition, the water quality is affected by inflow, showing the characteristics of poor water quality in summer and winter. The key parameters affecting water quality are TN and TP, which are almost 2 times higher than the grade II standard of water quality standard. Through the ARIMA model, it is predicted that CCME-WQI is maintained at 80.46 indicating that the water quality will be stable in the future.</jats:p>",

Risk can be classified based on predicting the occurrence, or risk can be classified based on systematic or non-systematic. A pandemic like Covid-19 can be put into an unknown systematic risk, meaning that it is an unknown risk that will occur and affect all parts of the economy. One of the things affected is the agricultural sector. This study examines the impact of a pandemic on the supply chain in the agricultural sector, especially in the food commodity sector, where Indonesia still depends on international supply chains. The study method is a descriptive-analytic study using an agricultural supply chain framework. Each part of the supply chain is then analyzed to determine how the framework is generally implemented in Indonesia. The results of this comparison show what policies can be implemented in Indonesia to secure the supply chain for food commodities in Indonesia. This study indicates that the main problem in Indonesia is that there is no guaranteed harvest price for farmers. The consequence is low farmer welfare because farmers cannot produce efficiently.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are a promising electrochemical storage solution for power sector decarbonization, particularly emerging long-duration needs. While the battery architecture can host many different redox chemistries, the vanadium RFB (VRFB) represents the current state-of-the-art due to its favorable combination of performance and longevity. However, the relatively high and volatile price of vanadium has hindered VRFB financing and deployment opportunities. Here we evaluate the vanadium supply chain to understand how it enables or constrains VRFB advancement and assess opportunities for accelerated growth. We find that – while vanadium may not be scarce – its abundance is confounded by highly concentrated production coupled with the disperse nature of sources suitable for potential supply increase. These factors challenge rapid growth, limiting deployment rate and magnitude. We estimate gigawatt-hour deployment scales are feasible over the next decade, which would represent marked expansion of the RFB industry and drive down system costs substantially, though this would require growth rates above historical averages. Accordingly, we review opportunities to accelerate supply chain growth and economic strategies to stabilize the market. Finally, we posit terawatt-hour deployment scales will be challenged by vanadium market conditions and, even, resource availability, motivating the continued efforts developing next-generation RFB chemistries.</jats:p>"

Economists and international business scholars focus on the economic nature of this phenomenon and its complex international structure. International institutions (such as the WTO, OECD and others) direct their efforts to the regulation of the relations within the structure and to the measurement of the contribution of GSC to national economies and global trade. Human Rights activists, on the other hand, are tackling violations of human rights at the various stages of the supply chains. At present, politicians, regulators and a limited number of scholars are also trying to deal with the issue of human rights within GSC from a different angle – namely, the behaviour of business with regard to human rights issues in international business activities. The paper builds on the author’s previous research on global supply chains in their role as stakeholders within the corporate governance system. The author adheres to the view that the study of human rights issues in the context of GSCs demands an interdisciplinary research approach and utilizes an adequate conceptual framework that should be further developed. Theoretical observations are combined with a survey on the business attitude towards human rights.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Objective\n The dysregulation in heat balance, the main cause of exertional heat stroke, occurs not only in midsummer but also in the cold season. Possible causes of this are a reduction in convection and evaporation due to tailwinds and an acceleration of radiant heat inflow. Although the amount of radiant heat that reaches the surface can be estimated, the actual amount of heat flows into the body cannot be specified yet. This paper made an experimental attempt for this.\nMETHODS\n A device is made up of a temperature controllable heat sink and heat flow detector, which keeps the surface temperature constant and has a heat exchange coefficient comparable to that of the human body surface. The output of this device (total heat exchange) was divided into radiant heat exchange and other heat exchange using a standard radiant heat calibrator, Leslie Cube.\nRESULTS\n A phenomenon, in which a wet surface while the surface temperature was low absorbed larger heat than that of the dry surface, was found. And authors named this \"hidden heat inflow\". As a result of multiple regression analyses, both radiant heat exchange and other heat exchanges are closely related to the surface temperature, and the maximum difference in total heat exchange during the experiment reached 200 kcal/m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/h. It has been suggested that this phenomenon may also occur on the surface of human skin.\nDISCUSSION\n One of the causes of this “hidden heat inflow” is considered to be the decrease in evaporative cooling due to the decrease in surface temperature. However, this alone cannot explain all of the phenomena, so water vapor aggregation may also be involved. A \"hidden heat inflow\" as a sufficient heat source for exertional heat stroke or collapse during a marathon race on a cold day was evidenced experimentally.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is first to identify the levers, the key visible breakdowns in Covid 19 impacted supply chains. Then to identify the fulcra” that maybe “really important and relevant” to supply chain change. Resilience to pandemic breakdown in supply change are considered in five key areas. The resilience of supplier networks has been tested. Despite measured environmental benefits from reduced traffic delivery delays. Despite significant growth in the air cargo market delays are only just past their peak. The resilience of employment is being challenged as greater productivity, happier and health workers and lower emissions has demonstrated the importance of ‘the physical dimension’ of work and opportunities taken to switch occupations.The resilience of the component parts of products and services has become the new watchword as interruptions in the source and supply of critical components has promoted search for substitutes. Reshoring and reinvention identify how bringing back, with innovative technology, a skilled workforce, tax incentives, means improved innovation and product differentiation. The resilience of supply chains to adapt quickly is marked by the prominence of consulting firms who have advanced supply chain monitoring technology and weaponized the supply chain. The trend for economic spheres to develop to insulate companies from geopolitical concerns. There is an ongoing acceleration of slowbalization. The resilience of technology means reshoring of the apparel, food, and beverage industries, among others, is becoming cost-effective. Predictive control strategy, still in its infancy, with modelling and optimization is becoming the work horse for supply chain management. The paper concludes with an assessment of the levers and fulcra for supply change.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the relationship between supply chain risk management(structure, culture, cooperation), supply chain resilience(agility, robustness) and supply chain performance. For this purpose, a survey was conducted on 300 domestic manufacturing companies and data were collected from 101 companies. The collected data were analyzed using SmartPLS program. The research results are as follows. First, the risk management structure of supply chain risk management had a significant positive effect on agility and robustness, which are the supply chain resilience. Second, culture of supply chain risk management had a significant positive effect on agility, but it did not have a statistically significant effect on robustness. Third, supply chain cooperation did not have a statistically significant effect on agility and it had a significant positive effect on robustness. Fourth, agility and robustness, which are the components of supply chain resilience, have a significant positive effect on supply chain performance. The results of this study suggest an integrated model that can understand the relationship between the two concepts and supply chain performance at a time when it is important to strengthen the capacity of supply chain risk management and resilience, and can contribute academically and practically as data that can broaden the base of supply chain management theme and predict supply chain performance and change.</jats:p>",

It did so by organising its multiple factory networks to serve a common purpose: to enable intelligent operations through the best automation and digitalisation technologies possible. Deeply rooted in the lean principles, Siemens factories unite their experts in groups across business units while closely integrating IT. Each group is concerned with a I4R technology cluster, defining a ‘north star’ and embedding use cases, as well as implementation projects in their factory overarching approach. This paper describes how, in working closely with solution providers for the realisation of their use cases, those groups act as catalysts — not only for constituting the elements of the factories’ information technology/operations technology (IT/OT) architecture, but also as a ‘Customer Zero’ for new business models, such as a distributed ledge-based CO2 footprint evaluation system.</jats:p>"

Also, the relative criticality of nervousness factors was assessed using the Delphi based analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Furthermore it investigated the factors and response strategies to mitigate the nervousness sources. Finally, a list of measures is proposed to reduce the SCN and improve competitiveness, effectiveness, and responsiveness.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Managing procurement risk through a conventional adoption of the three lines of defence model does not work effectively. This is primarily because digitalisation is restricted to the first line only through spend management systems, while the second and third lines rely on people armed with checklists undertaking periodic sample-based audits. This allows sub-optimal purchases, non-compliance, process abuse and fraud to slip through undetected and cause irreversible damage. A novel way forward would be to digitalise spend monitoring and create a second line of defence against such issues. Digitalising spend monitoring would entail several actions for it to make a significant dent in reducing procurement risk. The paper discusses how, first, an enterprise needs to study its past behaviour and identify what is abnormal and worth monitoring. Second, the enterprise needs to build an ability to correlate information from both within and outside its boundary so as to take the right decisions. Third, the enterprise needs to digitise a catalogue of controls that can be configured to continuously monitor and flag live transactions based on past and current observations. Fourth, the enterprise needs to build an ability to get actionable recommendations on anomalous transactions and intercept them immediately. Finally, the enterprise needs to ensure that this spend monitoring setup is continuously learning from its users’ actions and tuning itself to improve its accuracy. Meeting all the above criteria will ensure that such a system has a good signal-to-noise ratio and appeals to several stakeholders simultaneously within an enterprise. Global business service (GBS) owners and operations managers could use it to screen transactions at various approval tollgates in the procure-to-pay process and reduce the risk of waste, non-compliance and process abuse. Sourcing directors and category managers could use it to tune sourcing strategies and monitor their effectiveness to reduce supplier and category risk. Risk and compliance officers could use it to continuously audit 100 per cent of transactions and reduce the risk of non-compliance or fraud.</jats:p>"

It is established that effective management of production processes and logistics of any enterprise is not possible without determining the relevant and structured information about the state of the elements of the supply chain and the processes that take place in it. It is researched and formulated that the generally accepted system of measuring the efficiency of the enterprise is a balanced system of key indicators of supply chain efficiency. But based on the analysis of different points of view of scientists, it is determined that to assess the effectiveness of supply chains of enterprises, the vast majority of scientists suggest using ten key indicators, namely: service quality, product quality, lead time (response rate), overall logistics costs, financial indicators ), value added, reliability, flexibility (maneuverability), power, assets. The differences between the SCOR model used at the three levels of metrics, which are designed to assess the effectiveness of decisions at the strategic level, have been studied and established. At the first level, there are indicators that characterize the general state of the supply chain – key performance indicators (KPI – Key Performance Indicator). At the second level – indicators that help diagnose level 1 indicators and identify deviations. The third level of indicators diagnoses the indicators of the 2nd level, respectively. In this case, all metrics must have a hierarchical structure. It is established that the main differences between the concepts of efficiency and effectiveness of supply chains are that efficiency is associated with minimizing all related resources and processes, while efficiency is aimed at achieving all goals, higher results, completed activities and customer satisfaction, focusing on the customer and the goal as much as possible, thus achieving supply chain optimization. Effectiveness is the highest attempt to reduce all resources by maximizing the use of all capacities, the response tries to be as flexible and customer-oriented as possible. A matrix of efficiency of supply chains is proposed, which takes into account the indicators of their efficiency. Efficiency and effectiveness can improve the productivity of the supply chain through enhanced collaboration with all relevant actors.</jats:p>"

For a company to be successful in the new millennium where a paradigm shift has taken place it becomes necessary that its supply chain strategy gets fit with its competitive strategy so as to strike an appropriate balance between the supply chain’s efficiency and responsiveness. One of the supply chain management’s drivers, to achieve this fit is known as “Pricing”. In the context of global supply chain management, Transfer Pricing, with its components such as Arm’s Length Pricing (ALP), Advance Pricing Agreement (APA), Safe Harbour Rules (SHRs), etc. play a very important role and, therefore, in this paper an attempt has been made to explain issues relating to transfer pricing vis-à-vis solution for the same, so that MNEs may operate and supply their tangibles and intangibles to their related companies globally without having any disputes / litigations with a the taxation authorities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"tr\">Purpose-  COVID-19 has been a devastating process. During this period, there was a significant increase in the money supply. So, in this process, is there a relationship between COVID-19 and the money supply? This study intends to investigate if COVID-19 and the money supply have both a short- and long-term relationship.\nMethodology-  Logarithmic conversions were used to examine the number of COVID-19 new cases obtained from the Association of Public Health Professionals (HASUDER) and the Turkey Republic Ministry of Health, as well as M2 weekly money supply data from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) Electronic Data Distribution System (EVDS). For stationarity tests, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips Perron (PP), and Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin (KPSS) unit root tests were used. Due to the different degrees of stationarity of the series, cointegration was not possible, so the long-term relationship was evaluated using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL). Short-term analyzes included the VAR Model and the Granger Causality Test. \nFindings-  COVID-19 and the money supply, according to the findings, are not cointegrated in the long term. It has been discovered that the series do not move together over the long run. But in the short term, COVID-19 is a Granger cause of the money supply. \nConclusion-  The increase in COVID-19 cases positively affects the money supply. An increase in the money supply also leads to inflation. Therefore, in order to cope with the inflationary process triggered by the pandemic, measures to prevent the increase in COVID-19 cases are important. These findings will be \"confirming\" in the design of policies in this process. This study is also a contribution to the literature due to the lack of studies investigating the response of the money supply to COVID-19.\n\nKeywords: Covid-19, money supply, ARDL bounds testing approach, VAR model, Granger Causality.\nJEL Codes: E51, E52, I15, I18, C22\n</jats:p>"

The dynamic behavior of supply chain is modelled by using the continuous Lorenz-like model with disturbances. The Lorenz model is known from physics in the study of dissipative hydrodynamical systems with excitation and represents a paradigmatic example of the deterministic system, which is able to exhibit chaotic motions. Very complex supply chain relationships are modelled due to the information flow distortion at the distributor, caused by disturbances, which appear at the retailer. By using the proposed nonlinear supply chain model, the steady state, the saturation and the chaotic state of the supply chain are analyzed,  respectively. The range of parameter values, which are characteristic for the appearance of such states are determined. In the paper, the meaning of the regular state in which the supply chain cannot keep due to the disturbances and the risk of the saturation state are explained. In the analysis of such states, the multistage homotopic perturbation method is used.  The gained results are checked analyticaly or by the help of standard numerical integration, such as the Runge-Kutta method.</jats:p>"

Imposing the EAT-Lancet diet provides changes in FLW magnitude, composition, and geographical location by 2030. By decreasing global food consumption FLW reduces along each stage of the FSC despite a shift to higher FLW foods. Shares of less-processed and plant-based FLW increase, improving reuse possibilities. While food trade decreases, high-income region (HIC) imports still generate substantial losses in low- and mid-income regions (LMIC) with limited scope for reuse. As import-embedded FLW is not captured in SDGs this eases HICs ability to meet SDG12.3, hampering LMICs. While the healthy diet generates less FLW, farm-level loss policies in LMIC need to be complemented by FLW reuse strategies to not let potential inputs for nutritious foods go to waste.</jats:p>"

With the increasing volume of China’s commodity trade year by year, China has become the largest global commodity consumption and import for many consecutive years. On August 29, 2011, Fujian Xiamen Xiangyu Co., Ltd. held a grand restructuring and listing ceremony in the Shanghai Stock Exchange, integrating the high-quality asset injection of its logistics and related industries. In recent years, Xiamen Xiangyu Group Co., Ltd. has been committed to supply chain management services, and entered the Fortune Global 500 list in 2018. Taking Xiamen Xiangyu Group Co., Ltd. as an example, this paper uses financial analysis and QR (quick response) methods to analyze the company’s main business-global commodity supply chain services. The regression analysis is used to predict the development of the Xiangyu Group case in the next three years and the results show that the bulk commodity supply chain chosen by Xiangyu, as its main business, has a broad market space and a huge market concentration and improvement potential. The continuous transformation and upgrading of the supply chain have brought benefits to the company and created a new service development model in Xiamen for better development prospects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As Europe strives for a decarbonization of electricity supply, many countries proclaim ambitious targets for capacity additions of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power. By increasing renewable capacities, countries seek to reduce their dependency on fossil fired electricity generation. For instance, Germany recently announced new capacity targets that mean a triplication of wind and PV power capacities while at the same time aiming for a full coal exit until 2030. However, the potential of renewable energies is not equally distributed over the European continent. Due to higher irradiance levels with decreasing latitude, PV power achieves higher full load hours and thus higher generation per installed capacity in southern Europe.&amp;amp;#160; Wind power reaches higher capacity factors close to shorelines, where near-surface wind speeds are higher.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In light of the unequal distribution of PV and wind power generation potentials, national capacity targets may not lead to optimal utilization of capacities, i.e. maximum renewable generation. We analyse the effects of such national capacity targets for the case of PV generation. To do so, we compare two scenarios: A scenario with PV generation capacity distributed over Europe according to national political targets and a scenario with a distribution of newly installed capacities chosen such that it optimizes the renewable power potentials. Next to PV generation potentials, our assessment considers the European power grid, because line capacities limit the transmission and hence the trading between different countries. Line limits can have a negative impact on the overall power generation since renewable generation has to be curtailed if power can neither be locally used nor transmitted to another region. &amp;amp;#160;We employ a linear optimization-based electricity market model with inter-European transmission constraints and hourly resolution weather data for 35 historic weather years (1982-2016). We analyse the scenarios if terms of differences in power generation and curtailment, greenhouse gas emissions, and system operational cost. We pay special attention to extreme weather situations and the effects of a sub-optimal PV power allocation on security of supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Methods The main regulatory framework governing the hospital pharmacies activities was carried out using the computer help system \"Con- sultant Plus\" and Internet search engines Google and Yandex. The first group (group No. 1) includes terms that affect the actual subject of the study – hospital pharmacy and synonyms. The second group of words used (group No. 2) is common terms of hospital pharmacy activities and drug supply in the health facilities. Results We developed classification of regulatory legal acts that regulate the work of hospital pharmacies by the method of regulation (regulating directly and indirectly) and by content (regulating general aspects and applied aspects of drug provision in the health facility. Regulations governing general aspects, the definition of the hospital pharmacy as a pharmacy organization, the classifi- cation of pharmacy organizations, the status of a hospital pharmacy, the list of goods provided by a hospital pharmacy, as well as pharmaceutical works performed. Legal acts regulating applied aspects include groups of documents regulating the main process- es (drug supply) and regulating the supporting processes (personnel policy, provision of material and technical resources). Conclusion We identified non-regulated stages of drug supply specific for health facilities. In connection with the abolition of Soviet period legal acts important issues, personal and material and technical resources, were excluded from the legal framework, which was not compensated by the emergence of relevant legal acts.

Big data is one of these concepts that has been considered by researchers in various fields of business in recent years. When looking at it from the outside, it is fair to assume that the more data a company or organization has, the better, because the company in question will have a larger amount of data for mining, and as a result their data will be more accurate. However, this is not always the case, because learning how to effectively manage Big Data has become a very challenging task for many businesses around the world. Working with big data involves collecting data from information sources, exploring and analyzing them, modeling them based on the desired features, and providing data security measures. For this reason, this paper examines the challenges of working with big data and the big data revolution in general and big data mining in the business supply chain as fundamental business processes.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Now, the issue of protecting the environment and reducing the use of fossil non-renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly important. For modern heating and air conditioning systems, it is imperative to reduce emissions of harmful substances, especially CO2. This can be realized by significantly reducing the use of fossil non-renewable fuels and reconstructing engineering systems to the current level of energy saving. The annual growth in demand for fossil fuels will be reduced through the optimization of substations and heat distribution devices, which is a necessary step for the development of the country's industry and economy. Therefore, today the main task is to increase the energy efficiency of the use of resources and increase the potential of alternative types of energy in combination with modern low-temperature energy-efficient heat distribution systems, one of which is radiant water panels. The article presents the results of improving the method of mounting beam-ceiling fixtures with respect to their orientation in space. The results of numerical calculations indicate the efficiency of mounting the equipment at an angle of 45 degrees, which increases the efficiency by 10% in relation to the 0° orientation. The results of calculations and measurements show that the use of radiant heating in a lateral or longitudinal direction at different angles allows to significantly reduce the cost of energy resources for heating at low temperatures and at the same time not to lose the speed of operation to changes in external temperature parameters. The most effective of the variants of the experiment turned out to be the variant of suspension at an angle of 45°, in which an increase in efficiency by 10% in terms of final temperatures was found, which in turn makes it possible to reduce the use of thermal energy and reduce the amount of necessary equipment in design calculations. At the same time, installation difficulties were not detected.</jats:p>"

In addition, reducing the human impact on the environment requires a shift from traditional energy to renewables, which have increased significantly during recent decades as sustainable energy sources. Hence, this study assesses renewable energy sources and their related production phases from a supply chain management perception, screening and reviewing the integration between the supply chain management within the area of energy production focusing on renewable energy resources. The study executes a systematic review of English literature published on international scientific databases, focusing on the previous decade 2010–2020, to congregate the recently updated knowledge related to such research area. Thus, this study provides an authentic review of the literature that points to the relationship between supply chain operations and the area of renewable energy manufacturing from another side. Several literature reviews have been available concentrating on particular areas of managing renewable energy supply chains; however, no review has highlighted the practices of supply chain processes in energy production, focusing on renewables. The searching process relies on the published works that focus on such an area to be analyzed and characterized based on different methodologies they propose; thus, prospective and future research interests are delineated.</jats:p>"

The natural resource-based view (NRBV) theory has been used to understand the phenomenon from a general perspective. Data was collected from 213 supply chain professionals through the purposive sampling technique. PLS-SEM approach has been used for data analysis using Smart PLS (version 3.2.9) and estimated measurement and structural model. Results showed that green warehousing, social values &amp; ethics, and supply chain risk significantly positively affect supply chain sustainability. However, logistics optimization has a positive but statistically insignificant effect on supply chain sustainability. Managers should foster good investor views about the green management system. Managers should also support the use of a green management system, which may boost financial and non-financial performance, making the firm more competitive and increasing corporate value in various ways. Managers could gain a more holistic view of supply chain risk by understanding mature and emerging themes in the field, as well as tools into the scope of supply chain risk, and the significant growth in sustainable supply chain management reflects the need for new business models that are particularly focused on social and environmental issues.</jats:p>"

Design/Methodology/Approach The measurement items were constructed based on previous studies, the confirmatory factor analysis was performed using the AMOS 18 to evaluate the reliability and validity and the fit of the measurement model. The results of this study are as follows. Findings First, it was found that the avoidance conflict response of leading and participating companies did not have a significant effect on social capital and supply chain integration. Second, it was found that the cooperative conflict response between leading companies and participating companies had a significant positive (+) effect on social capital and a significant positive (+) effect on supply chain integration. In addition, it was found that social capital had a significant positive (+) effect on supply chain integration in both leading and participating companies. Research Implications Avoiding avoidance conflict response and using cooperative conflict response can strengthen the competitiveness of the supply chain through the establishment of social capital such as mutual benefit, trust, and value sharing in a rapidly changing global logistics environment, and further increase the level of supply chain integration and performance.\r\n</jats:p>",

As a result, a factor that has a greater influence on the demand of electricity consumers has been identified. The ways of solving marketing research for the further successful functioning of the energy company in the interests of society and the social well-being of the population are proposed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose of the study</jats:bold>. The purpose of this paper is to study the state of the regional energy market on the basis of marketing research that characterizes the activities of an energy company; identification of indicators such as consumer dissatisfaction with energy products. The paper is based on a dynamic analysis of analytical and statistical information about ongoing processes in the energy sector. The task is to conduct marketing research of supply and demand in the regional energy market.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Materials and methods</jats:bold>. The information base of the study is analytical information and statistical data on indexes of supply and demand for energy products, including electricity. The methodological basis of the study is represented by statistical methods of information analysis: comparative analysis and analysis of time series.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>. Based on the results of an economic and statistical analysis of consumer demand indicators for the use of energy products, including electricity, factors influencing demand have been identified. Of the three selected factors, it is especially worth noting the demand of consumers using electricity, which are population density indexes, weather conditions and the number of rainfall days in a particular region, it is theoretically established that population density is a more influential index.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>. Energy is the main branch of the national economy of the country, which contributes to the development of the economy and the normal life of the population. Until now, the problem of providing the population and the national economy of the regions of the republic with energy goods and electricity makes us think about new ways to solve the problem. Since hydroelectric power generation in the country is the share of hydroelectric power plants, given the economic and social condition of the country in the power supply system, it will be appropriate to create a marketing system platform.</jats:p>"

Combined with numerical simulation, the factors affecting green innovation and green financing decisions are analyzed and strategic suggestions are put forward. The conclusions are as follows: (1) There is a unique evolutionary equilibrium strategy for dynamic behavioral decision-making between manufacturers and e-commerce platforms; (2) Green innovation and green financing are beneficial to both players of the game; (3) Whether the platform provides green financing services for manufacturers is affected by factors such as commissions, additional benefits brought by green innovation or green financing, and financing amounts. This paper enriches the research on green strategies for e-commerce supply chains, provides suggestions for green innovation and financing cooperation between e-commerce platforms and manufacturers, and further promotes the green development of the manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 has left some permanent effects on the Regional Agri-Supply Chain (RASC). It has single-handedly accelerated the RASC’s performance through the globalization of local products and increased e-agri-business, virtual retailing trends, and smart logistics and warehousing services. The post-COVID worldwide growing demand for regional agri-products has increased the competitiveness in logistics outsourcing. Motivated by these changing notions, this paper addresses two major questions—whether the competitiveness in logistics outsourcing allows the supply chain drivers (supplier, retailer, and 3PL) to form a sustainable B2B pricing supply chain model, and what will be 3PL firms’ strategic decisions to secure sustainable profit under this competitiveness? In the light of competitive literature, this paper proposes two decision-making approaches, optimistic and pessimistic, models them using the Stackelberg game theory, and solves them using the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The result shows that, even after competitiveness in logistics outsourcing, the supply chain drivers agree to form a contractual supply chain. However, the competitive strategy-making of 3PL firms is a little tricky. Each focal 3PL firm must have perfect information about the peer firm’s strategic movement to choose its preferable strategy. Further, they can preferably constrain their core competencies (service price and quality level) to assure a sustainable profit.</jats:p>"

However, a main challenge with wind power is the variability in power production due to weather variations. The water injection pumps are often major power consuming units. The water pumps were therefore identified as possible non-critical loads in an isolated power system with variable power supply. The power to a non-critical load can be varied and even stopped depending on the power supply. The objective of the present work was to study how variable water injection rates affects oil production.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Using simulated wind power curves, water injection profiles for a model oil field were constructed. Reservoir simulations show that the oil production is almost insensitive to variable injection rates if the injected volumes were the same. Lower injected rates and volumes resulted in lower oil production. This was most pronounced in the plateau phase of the production, but later the differences become gradually smaller. Thus, reducing the water injection volumes with 30 % decreased the total oil recovery by less than 5 % after 28 years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>If constant water injection rates are needed thermal power can supply wind power.

SC visibility factors need to be quantified because they provide clients with the data; they need to better estimate demand, ensuring they do not run out of anything during busy or lean periods. The study is based on an extensive literature review and responses from leading supply chain management consulting firms. To identify technology used in supply chain integration, one of the tools for SC visibility can cover all items and assets across extensive supply networks. Freight visibility is essential as shippers' interest in the safe and secure passage of products has proliferated. The population of this research is Employees who are working in the shipping industries and 3pl industries. The paper demonstrates the shipping line to find supply chain visibility. Interest in supply chain integration and analytic integration are primary factors because container logistics management provides direct support to vessel logistics.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The coronavirus pandemic has caused unprecedented supply chain disruptions globally, resulting in a heightened need for supply chain resilience. Particularly in the case of semiconductor chips, a commodity already in high demand, the existing challenges in supply chains have been aggravated by the pandemic. This global shortage is resulting in manufacturing disruptions across multiple sectors from automobiles to electronics. The global automobile industry alone is said to suffer a $210 billion loss in revenue from chip shortages. This highlights the cruciality of scientifically analyzing and building solutions that addresses the issue of resiliency of global semiconductor supply chains. While several news articles and white papers have reported this issue, there has been a lack of scientific literature on this topic. The objective of this paper is to identify the factors causing semiconductor shortage, analyze, and quantify their impact on the supply chain. This paper identifies 20 factors under 4 major categories from pre- and post-pandemic era, in the period ranging from 2018 to 2021, that have contributed to this disruption. The categories are: geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, logistics challenges and COVID-19 pandemic. The factors are ranked using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology. The scientific value of this study lies in its contribution of quantifying and ranking the impact of the individual factors leading to the recent disruption in semiconductor supply chains. The results of this study will provide supply chain managers with the analytical information necessary for enabling resilient semiconductor supply chains as they navigate through these current challenges.</jats:p>",

However, understanding these changes requires a more profound knowledge of the WSS. This study describes the urban water cycle within the WSS of Ljubljana, Slovenia, where different water parameters such as temperature, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, δ2H, δ18O, and δ13CDIC were monitored from September to November 2018. Altogether 108 samples were collected, including from the source (3) and at different levels of the WSS: wells (41), joint exits from water pumping stations (7), reservoirs (22), water treatment locations (2), drinking fountains (13), taps (19) and wastewater system (1). The data show that although the ranges of δ2H and δ18O values were small, each well is represented by a unique fingerprint when considering additional parameters. A statistically significant difference was observed between sampling months, and temperature and most parameters showed higher variability within the wells than across the WSS, suggesting a more unified WSS. Finally, based on δ13CDIC values, a distinction could be made between river/groundwater interactions within the WSS and between shallower and deeper wells and their distance from the river bank.</jats:p>"

Simulations of the estimated model show that housing demand drives short-run fluctuations in home sales and prices, while variation in supply plays only a limited role. We consider two implications of these results. First, we show that reduction of supply was a minor factor relative to increased demand in the tightening of housing markets during COVID-19. New for-sale listings would have had to expand 30 percent to keep the rate of price growth at pre-pandemic levels given the pandemic-era surge in demand. Second, we estimate that housing demand is very sensitive to changes in mortgage rates, even more so than comparable estimates for home sales. This suggests that policies that affect housing demand through mortgage rates can influence housing market dynamics.</jats:p>"

In particular, coal-using cities are facing the dual pressure of the ecological environment and resource depletion due to the concentration of population and resources, and environmental contradictions. Thus, exploring the relationship between the supply and demand of ecosystem services and their evolution help promote scientific ecological management. By using multi-source data from Huainan City in 2010 and 2020 and the ecosystem service supply and demand matrix and ArcGIS quantitative measurement of the supply, the demand and supply of ecosystem services in Huainan City were investigated. The result implies the following. (1) During 2010‒2020, the supply of ecosystem services in Huainan has decreased year by year. In terms of spatial distribution, the ecosystem service supply in Huainan City was high in the south and low in the north, and there is a significant regional differentiation, (2) Between 2010 and 2020, the demand for ecosystem services in Huainan City increased year by year, and its spatial distribution was similar to the distribution of ecosystem service supply. (3) Due to the decline in the supply of ecosystem services between 2010 and 2020, the demand for ecosystem services has increased, which leads to changes in the matching degree of supply and demand of ecosystem services in Huainan City.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: For many supply chains, deep-tier suppliers, due to their small size and lack of access to capital, are most vulnerable to disruptions. We study the use of advance payment (AP) as a financing instrument in a multitier supply chain to mitigate the supply disruption risk in a traditional system (with limited visibility) and a blockchain-enabled system (with perfect visibility). The main goal of this paper is to shed light on how blockchain adoption impacts agents’ operational and financial decisions as well as profit levels in a multitier supply chain. Academic/practical relevance: Traditionally, because of the limited visibility in the deep tiers, powerful downstream manufacturers’ financing schemes offered to their immediate upstream suppliers are not effective in instilling capital into the deep tiers. Advancements in blockchain technology improve the supply chain visibility and enable the manufacturer to better devise deep-tier financing to improve supply chain resilience. Methodology: We develop a three-tier supply chain model and take a game-theoretic approach to compare how blockchain-enabled deep-tier financing schemes affect a financially constrained supply chain’s optimal risk-mitigation and financial strategies. Results: We find that although improved visibility via blockchain adoption can help the manufacturer make informed supply chain financing decisions, whether it can benefit all supply chain members depends on the financing schemes in use. Blockchain-enabled delegate financing increases risk-mitigation investments and benefits all three tiers of the supply chain only when the tier 2 supplier is severely capital-constrained with the working capital below a threshold. Because delegate financing endows the intermediary tier 1 supplier with leverage over the manufacturer, the inefficiency inhibits an all-win outcome when the tier 2 supplier is not severely capital-constrained. Blockchain-enabled cross-tier direct financing exhibits a compelling performance as it always leads to win-win-win outcomes (and is thus ubiquitously implementable) regardless of the suppliers’ working capital profile. Managerial implications: Our insights help firms assess opportunities and challenges associated with enhancing supply chain visibility via blockchain adoption.</jats:p>"

Reverse logistics can simply define as the return, exchange, refurbishment, remarketing, and disposition of products. The implementation of reverse logistics practices into business became a competitive advantage and it became strategic goals for the organization’s economic benefits and somehow effects the environment legislation. Therefore, it is very important to understand how environmental performance can be improve through reverse logistics practices. The purpose and objective of this study is to understand the reverse logistics practices on environmental performance in view of comprehensive literature perspectives. To reach the objective, this study only explores secondary data which is review the literature as the research methodology.

However, investigations have found that the rural financial market still has problems in its service modes, organizational systems, product innovation, and risk evaluation, thus requiring urgent attention. Therefore, this study analyzes and expounds on these problems from the aforementioned four aspects and proposes the following solutions: encourage the creation of agricultural service institutions, establish and improve the rural financial organization system, vigorously develop new rustic financial products, and strengthen the risk supervision and management of financial markets. Only in this way can the agricultural supply-side structural reform and the innovative development of rural finance be realized.</jats:p>"

The immense volume of data that companies are producing and sourcing along the supply chain can now be analyzed in real time, enabling better decision-making processes. This paper will explore how the utilization of these technologies is revolutionizing supply chain management. Two specific areas, demand forecasting, and inventory management, will be explored in greater depth. The paper will then highlight the current trends and challenges of AI and ML in supply chain management and offer concluding remarks.\nSupply chain management is a complex system that connects multiple companies and encompasses the flow of goods, services, information, and finances. To cope with its complexity, more and more companies are turning to technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to gain a competitive edge. ML is a branch of AI that consists of systems and algorithms that can learn from data to improve decision-making. The number of companies that claim to be using ML has grown by more than 300% since 2015, with the overall AI market considered to be worth around $2 trillion. In the supply chain industry, companies are using ML to optimize delivery routes and times, predict delays and detect variances in quality at an early stage. The use of AI technologies can optimize and execute supply chain tasks promptly, making it more capable than traditional supply chain setups.</jats:p>"

Various products and services have emerged that rely on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to facilitate information flows between agro‐input providers, farmers, traders, and consumers. However, not all initiatives are equally effective and many struggle to reach scale. In this article, I review some of the earlier services that generally targeted farmers with price information to reduce search costs and increase their bargaining power vis‐a‐vis traders. I reflect on the reasons why these initiatives often led to disappointing results and provide examples of (complementary) interventions that look more promising. Furthermore, I highlight some of the dangers of relying too much on ICT‐mediated information, such as exclusionary networks, bias in crowdsourced data, and “fake news.” Finally, I explore why ICT applications that address information inefficiencies seem to be less successful than innovations that address other barriers to efficient and inclusive food supply chain development, such as risk or credit constraints.</jats:p>",

In the experiments performed for this purpose, as the parameters affecting the air demand ratio, the air inlet of each air vent was measured by opening air vents at regular intervals downstream for different conduit openings and different lengths of conduits for air-demand ratio depending on flow rates. In the study, it was observed that the air-demand ratios increased with the increase of the Froude number in all air vents. Although the Qa/Qw value was found to be 0.28 in.the 6 m conduits for the best air demand rate of 2.5% gate opening, the location of the air vent did not have a significant effect on the air-demand ratio. As a result, it has been understood that the suction downstream of the gated conduit flows does not show a local change. It is thought that the air sucked from the air vents is formed by the drag effect of the water.</jats:p>",

As demand for food continues to rise, it is becoming necessary to bring about a substantial increase in crop production. The best solution to water scarcity appears to be irrigation for crops that are particularly sensitive to drought. Today, many technical solutions are used to supply and distribute water to crops. The optimal solution is drip irrigation, which makes it possible to deliver water directly to the plant root system to save melting freshwater resources. In the article special attention was paid to methods of supplying electricity to power irrigation pumps. The analysis was made for areas with a significant distance between the agricultural land and the urbanised area (which has water and electricity). The authors have selected the parameters of an off-grid photovoltaic mini-hydropower plant with energy storage (with a power of 1.36 kW). An analysis was made of the profitability of such an investment and a comparison with other types of power supply. Based on the performed calculations, a prototype power supply system equipped with photovoltaic panels was made to show the real performance of the proposed system. The tests carried out showed that the irrigation pump will be powered most of the time with a voltage whose parameters will be very close to the nominal ones.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction of engineering structures when transferring the project to the area is impossible without geodetic work. The composition and sequence of engineering and geodetic works depend on the features of the design and construction of facilities and the type of structure. The purpose of the article is to consider geodetic works in the construction of engineering structures. The issues of performing engineering and geodetic works during the construction of structural elements of the bridge are considered. During the construction process, it is necessary to ensure full compliance with the design documentation and high accuracy of work performance. These requirements can be achieved by using high-precision geodetic works with constant monitoring of the installation work.\nAt all stages of the bridge construction, geodetic works accompany the transfer to the terrain of the bridge axis, the resistance axis, perform a detailed breakdown during the construction of resistances and the installation of purlins. Also, the construction of individual parts of the building is constantly monitored, the dimensions and shape of the mounting elements are checked.\nWhen building large structures, it is necessary to have information about the points of the geodetic base of the bridge crossing, an extract from the catalog of coordinates and elevations of the geodetic base. The breakdown is carried out by tying to the points of the geodetic reference network, which has coordinates in the absolute or conditional system.\nModern construction requires the use of new technologies and methods for performing geodetic work related to the introduction of electronic devices and programs for automated information processing into geodetic practice. Currently, a large number of geodetic instruments and new technologies in geodesy have been created, which differ from traditional ones.\nTo carry out survey work, geodetic instruments, such as electronic total station and levels, were used. The electronic total station measures distances, angles and processes data directly in the process of field work, has an internal memory where it can store all the data obtained as a result of measurements.\nThe digital level has a device for automatic registration of measurements along the rail and a processor for subsequent processing of all leveling results. During measurements, the device measures the distance to the rail and the elevation between points. This eliminates two main types of errors: observation errors when taking a reading and error in distance measurements.\nDuring the construction of supports, a temporary rapper is installed on each of them, which is tied to permanent rappers by leveling moves.\nThe removal of marks on the supports is carried out by methods of geometric or trigonometric leveling. The coordinates of the rappers were received and entered into the local plan. Marks for serifs of the device with a retroreflective effect were pasted on the bridge supports. The data of coordinates and heights were entered into the total station memory.\nGeodetic work carried out during the construction of the span structure ensures the accuracy of its assembly in accordance with the project. After the installation is completed, the assembly results and deviations from the project are monitored.\nThe construction of structural elements of engineering structures must comply with building codes and geometric parameters of the facility design.</jats:p>",

The main objective of this article is to present a developed tool capable of conducting the DPCap analysis for offshore supply vessels based on the DNVGL methodology. The article describes the background studies, methodology, and mechanism associated with the formulation and development of the tool. The optimization of the design variables for the station-keeping criteria targets the highest capability at the lowest possible energy expenditure. Finally, the results are presented in the form of standard capability polar plots to show the application of the computational assessment procedure.

Each of these operations benefits from a DP system’s ability to include precise position-keeping, freedom from the restrictions of mooring spread systems, the ability to move quickly from one site to another, and track-keeping capabilities (Elkafas et al. 2021; Mahfouz 2007).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This study considers blockchain adoption and information sharing in a low-carbon supply chain with a single manufacturer and a single retailer. The retailer has private information about value-added services and decides how to share it with the manufacturer. We examine six combined strategies comprised of blockchain scenarios and information sharing formats (no sharing, voluntary sharing, and mandatory sharing). The results indicate that supply chain members prefer blockchain technology under no sharing and voluntary sharing. Under mandatory sharing, supply chain members have incentives to participate in blockchain when the value-added service efficiency exceeds a threshold value. While the manufacturer prefers to obtain the value-added service information, the retailer decides to share information depending on the value-added service efficiency. Besides, supply chain members’ attitude toward the sharing contract also depends on the value-added service efficiency.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the asymmetric price transmission (APT) of global cocoa beans and cocoa pasta prices to farm prices. The cocoa pasta variable is a proxy for Indonesian processed cocoa industry products. We use monthly time series data from January 2007 to December 2020. The NARDL model was used to estimate the APT response behavior. The dummy variable (export cocoa bean tax) explains fluctuations in farm prices before and after the policy implementation. The results showed asymmetric cointegration between the global cocoa market and cocoa pasta prices moving towards farm cocoa prices in Indonesia. APT occurs in the short and long term with different significant levels for each variable. The increase (decrease) in the global market and cocoa pasta prices were transmitted asymmetrically in the short and long terms, except for the variable (PA-pos), which is not significant in the long term. We observe strong evidence of negative asymmetric price transmission. Negative price shocks (decreases) in global markets and cocoa pasta are more rapidly transmitted to farmer prices than positive price shocks. Adjustment prices occur in magnitude, speed, and sign. The high coefficient of negative asymmetric price transmission indicates the uncompetitive of Indonesia's supply-demand cocoa chain. At the same time, the cocoa bean export tax harms farm prices. The export tax policy has reduced farm prices by approximately 2.3%.</jats:p>",

The present study has been carried out using a semi-distributed model developed using HEC-HMS, an artificial neural network (ANN), and a hybrid model (HEC-HMS-ANN) for simulation of daily discharge in the Kallada River basin, Kerala, India. The HEC-HMS model did not perform well with the available dataset. So for simulating daily runoff, a hybrid model is developed by coupling HEC–HMS output with ANN. The model prediction accuracy is assessed using statistical metrics. Precipitation, lagged precipitation, and lagged discharge were used as input variables for the ANN model. The optimal number of lags was determined using partial autocorrelation. The hybrid model integrating the output from HEC-HMS into ANN shows better performance than the other models in simulating daily discharge and estimating the accuracy of yearly peak discharge. The accuracy evaluation of yearly peak discharge values demonstrates that simulation error is reduced by 66% and 26.5% in the hybrid model compared to the HEC-HMS and ANN models, respectively.</jats:p>",

Supplier or major customer breaches could result in a spillover effect on other targeted supply chain firms' behavior. While a cybersecurity breach does not directly impact these targeted firms, there could be negative financial consequences of being associated with the same supply chain. Based on transaction cost theory, targeted firms could react strategically through earnings to reduce increased supply chain transaction costs incurred in supply chain breaches and mitigate negative breach effects. We expect and find that targeted firms react strategically through real activities following a supply chain breach. Further, our results provide evidence that targeted firms respond to customer breaches to a greater degree than supplier breaches, reflecting significant customer transaction costs. Our study contributes to the understanding of the impact breaches can have on nonbreached firms' behavior.</jats:p>",

One of the ways to increase the efciency of its activities is modernization and innovative development, which should contribute to the energy security of heat supply. It is noted that the energy security of heat supply should be considered not only in the key of high-quality and uninterrupted supply of the resource, but also from the standpoint of minimizing the negative impact on the environment. The article emphasizes that the global fuel and energy complex is in transition to a new energy system, developing in three directions: decentralization, decarbonization and digitalization. Under these conditions, the heat supply industry in Russia will also undergo transformation, so it is advisable to talk about the processes of its development and modernization, taking into account the principles of balanced environmental development, energy and resource conservation, as well as rational complement of traditional and renewable energy. The purpose of the study is an attempt to form a number of special principles according to which the heat supply system of Russia should function and develop in the conditions of transition to a new energy system. To achieve this goal, the article proposes to solve the following tasks: to consider the current state of the heat supply industry and highlight the main trends in its development, to identify the essence of the new energy system and the conditions for its change, to defne the principles of environmental safety and environmental efciency of heat supply as special principles for the functioning and development of the heat supply system in the context of a change in the energy system.

Therefore, improving the accuracy of measuring the heat supplied to consumers is an urgent task. Instrumental metering of heat energy requires regular measurement of the temperature of the coolant in the pipelines of the heat supply system. There is an opinion that all the problems of measuring temperature when accounting for thermal energy have been solved. However, this is not the case. The analysis shows that the systematic component of the error in measuring the temperature and the temperature difference between the supply and return pipelines, especially in conditions of small values of the difference, makes a significant contribution to the instrumental error of accounting for thermal energy. The article discusses solutions to minimize these errors in temperature measurement, taking into account the consumption of thermal energy.

It is necessary to consider the effects of urban development on the environment in urban planning to achieve sustainable economic and industrial development. In this paper, an optimal planning structure has been developed to reduce the pollution load of Khorramabad River, Lorestan Province, Iran. The developed fuzzy trading-ratio system was programmed based on risk-based fuzzy analysis for nine dischargers of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) as a water quality index and optimized using a genetic algorithm. The calibrated and verified model was utilized to simulate the BOD5 concentration at checkpoints of the river using four data sets of water quality collected from 2018 to 2021 in August (2018, 2019 and 2020 for calibration and 2021 for verification). The results showed that BOD5 exchange in the downstream stations is in critical condition. Optimization to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment showed that the proposed model could be economically improved by about 11%. The feasible domain of risk changes was assessed at three levels of 30, 60 and 90%, with the maximum value of the objective function calculated for the alcohol factory and the minimum value obtained for the flour factory.</jats:p>",

Moreover, if its cost advantage is not extremely small, the innovator prefers fixed‐fee licensing and mixed licensing to revenue‐royalty licensing. This second result arises only because of our assumption that the cost functions are quadratic. We show that if the cost functions are linear and royalty payments are per unit of output, the innovator strictly prefers royalty licensing to fixed‐fee licensing. We also show that in our model, consumer surplus is remarkably higher under any type of licensing than under no licensing. However, revenue‐royalty licensing is slightly superior for consumers to the other two types of licensing and only so if the cost advantage of the innovator is sufficiently large.</jats:p>",

Low-cost efficient coolsupply chain is required for storage and transport of agricultural produce under controlled environment conditions from production site to end use. Due to lack of cost effective cool supply chain, post-harvest losses are high in horticultural produce particularly in fruits and vegetables. An evaporative cooling technology based low-temperature cool supply chain have been designed developed for fruits and vegetables. The EC cool chain includes; on-farm pre-cooling and storage, vehicle for transport of produce from farm to market, storage at wholesale level, retailer level and street vending cart. All the developed technologies were evaluated for their performance by loading fruits and vegetables. The cool supply chain maintained 10ºC to 13ºCtemperature lower than that of ambient with relative humidity above 80%.Vegetables remained fresh and turgid throughout the cool supply chain. The developed technology is eco-friendly, low cost, efficient and can be used as cool supply chain of horticultural produce. The developed system requires less investment and can be very useful to farmers, traders and vendors and can get more return (higher earning) by saving loss of horticultural produce particularly fruits and vegetables.</jats:p>",

Pharmacoeconomic assessment of the oral antiplatelet availability of various drug manufacturers and dosage forms based on the analysis of price characteristics. Materials and methods. The analysis included drugs from the group of platelet aggregation inhibitors (excluding heparin) (ATC code B01AC): clopidogrel, clopidogrel + acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), ASA and dipyridamole in various dosages and number of tablets per package. The cost values were estimated by the resources of large resources \"Apteka.ru\", \"009.rf\" with the average value calculations in the eight federal district’s capitals of the country. Results. The cost of drugs in the analyzed group varied depending on the drug manufacturer. The highest amount of the cost variation was in the ASA tablet form (100 mg) – 407.47%, followed by the tablet form of clopidogrel (75 mg) – 311.16%, ASA (50 mg) – 172.20%, dipyridamole (75 mg) – 117.36% and the lowest values for the tablet forms of dipyridamole (25 mg) – 68.19% and the combination of ASA with clopidogrel (100mg + 75mg) – 59.13%. The highest Ca.s values were in ticagrelor (90 mg) – 24.92% and prasugrel (10 mg) – 7.87%, the lowest in ASA (50 mg) – 0.1%. According to the linear index of distribution, the drugs ASA (100 mg) – 89%, clopidogrel (75 mg) – 70%, and less accessible ticagrelor (60 mg) – 18% and prasugrel (10 mg) – 14% had a higher physical availability. Conclusion. Based on the calculated values a high availability of such antiplatelet drugs as ASA (50 mg and 100 mg), clopidogrel (75 mg) was revealed. According to the results of the study, the antiplatelet drugs ticagrelor (60 mg and 90 mg) and prasugrel (10 mg) have the least level of availability.</jats:p>",

Although altimetric measurements, whether ground- or satellite-based, can reproduce LWS dynamics, they do not provide sufficient information on why LWS is changing. Neither the water balance method nor detailed hydrological modeling can capture exactly LWS change in most regulated lakes largely because of the scarcity of water output observations. Here, a simple water balance model, following Budyko’s supply–demand framework, was proposed to estimate LWS change in regulated lakes without the need for water output information. The elasticity of LWS was theoretically derived from the Budyko-based model to attribute LWS change to its main driving factors. The annual LWS observed during 1964–2019 under three different regulation plans in Lake Dianchi, which is a typical regulated lake located in southwest China, was used to calibrate and test the proposed model. Comparison between the estimated results and observed data indicated that the model accurately captured the variations of annual LWS in Lake Dianchi with a relative root mean square error of 4.08%, and mean absolute percentage error of 2.88%. The attribution results suggested that lake regulation strategies were the primary cause of LWS change in Lake Dianchi, while water transfer had a limited contribution. This study suggests that complex hydrological behavior in regulated lakes can be explored using Budyko's supply–demand framework with a low requirement for data. This can provide effective guidance to lake managers and policymakers for adaptive management of water resources in regulated lakes.</p>"

Moreover, despite the articles' stated objectives and future directions, just a few studies attempted to fill the gaps. The notion of the supply chain has grown in relevance in developing nations and industrialized countries, and its popularity and awareness have increased in recent years. It has been embraced in developing countries due to increased outsourcing and its applicability across various industries. There are certain advantages to using SCM, such as the fact that it may be used in practically any industry sector.

In this paper, we will present, in essence, some considerations regarding both the functional description of the correlation between digital marketing and digital SCM, even though various studies and publications have been carried out over the years, as well as considerations regarding the easy implementation of the two concepts. At the same time, we will highlight some statistical data, published by experts, regarding suppliers, distributors and customers, all in the context of digital business design.</jats:p>",

We believe that all the data needed to understand the resilience status of a supply chain and identify opportunities for improvement already exists within companies. Therefore, we provide an approach to guide decision makers in this regard. We propose to first perform a rough resilience analysis using a limited set of transactional data. This analysis is based on key resilience areas to identify vulnerable elements of the supply chain that should be further investigated in terms of specific entities, transport relations, and materials. Based on these elements, process mining becomes a promising approach to understand the underlying actions, problems, and possible bottlenecks and to reveal improvement strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Groundwater is one of the main sources of providing people with drinking water. However, during the period of operation of water wells, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of groundwater change significantly. These changes depend on many factors of natural and man-made origin, in particular, depletion of reserves, conditions of operation and construction of wells, anthropogenic impact on the environment and so on. To assess the water quality of the underground source intended for water supply of one of the facilities in Kyiv, a number of studies of the quality of water extracted from a well 67 m deep were compared. Experiments conducted after the well in 2010 and 2021 were compared. The analysis of the obtained results showed changes in the indicators of groundwater quality during the well operation, which relate to water turbidity, color, total hardness, dry residue, total iron and manganese content.&#x0D;\nIn the current operating conditions of the water intake, the groundwater raised to the surface does not meet the current regulatory quality requirements, and therefore it needs to be purified before it is delivered to consumers. For this case and the need to provide water to a small facility, it is recommended to use the technology of deironing water by biological oxidation. The use of a bioreactor with an insoluble carrier and a contact-clarifying filter with expanded polystyrene loading is proposed. The technology has shown high efficiency in both laboratory and production conditions for local water mains.</jats:p>"

Background: The unpredictable examples and complexity inserted in enormous data dimensions present a test for an orderly human master examination. Hence in an information-driven setting, soft computing (SC) has accomplished critical energy to investigate, mine, and concentrate confidential information data, or tackle complex improvement issues, finding some harmony between good productivity and maintainability of vegetable supply frameworks. Methods: This paper presents a new and diverse scientific classification of VSC issues from the SC methodology. It characterizes VSC issues and sorts them in light of how they be demonstrated according to the SC perspective. Moreover, we examine the SC methodologies commonly utilized in each phase of the VSC and their related classes of issues. Accordingly, there is an issue in distinguishing and characterizing VSC issues according to a more extensive point of view, enveloping the different SC strategies that can apply in various phases (from creation to retailing), and recognizing the issues that emerge in these phases according to the SC viewpoint. Results: We likewise acquaint some rules with the assistance of VSC analysts and specialists to settle on appropriate strategies while resolving specific issues they could experience. Even though a few latest examinations have arranged the SC writing in this field, they are situated towards a solitary group of SC strategies (a gathering of techniques that share standard qualities) and survey their application in VSC phases. Conclusions: We have suggested a novel approach and complete scientific classification of vegetable supply chain concerns about soft computing. We present a view of three delegate supply chains: cruciferous vegetables, dark green leafy vegetables, and tomatoes. We assembled the scientific type in light of different parts to arrange vegetable supply chain issues as per how they can be demonstrated utilizing soft computing methodologies.</jats:p>"

The present study examines the changes in the cavitation index caused by changes in the convergence angle of an ogee spillway's sidewalls with an arc in the plan. To this end, a spillway was constructed on the 1:50 scale. Then, it was tested with four different convergence angles, including 0°, 60°, 90°, and 120°, relative to the spillway's sidewalls and six different flow rates per unit width ranging from 6.74 to 48.42 (l/s)/m. The results indicated that as the flow rate increased, the cavitation index relatively declined at both crest and chute of the spillway while growing at its toe. It was observed that the lowest cavitation index was found to be 1.54 in.X/Hd = 2.42 at an angle of 0° and a flow rate per unit width of 40.52 (L/s)/m.</jats:p>",

Consumers' consumption channels are no longer monolithic. A new retail model was born. Additionally, how to improve the revenue of the new retail supply chain and the scientific and reasonable distribution of revenue is particularly important. On this background, the concept of new retail is defined, and the principle of supply chain synergy is analysed. Stackelberg game is used to analyse and determine the optimal selling and wholesale prices of retailers and suppliers in the supply chain. The defects of the traditional supply chain model and the necessity of optimization are further analysed and demonstrated. Because of the traditional retail supply chain, new retail channels are introduced, and the second‐order supply chain is established. New retail channels are added to the supply chain, and the profitability before and after the addition is analysed. Stackelberg game and Shapley value method are used for modelling. Finally, Matlab is used for numerical analysis. The results show that adding new retail channels to the traditional supply chain dominated by suppliers will increase the market share of products. The market share f is positively correlated with the profits of suppliers and retailers. Under the multi‐channel retail model, product demand and supply chain profits are higher than a single channel. The Shapley value method can enable supply chain members to obtain corresponding benefits on their input, thereby achieving a win–win situation for retail supply chain members.</jats:p>",

In this study, a cost-effective monitoring programme has been developed and applied by a Spanish water operator to detect cyanobacteria presence in a drinking water plant reservoir; a total of 65 phytoplankton genera and seven cyanobacterial taxa were identified. Based on these monitoring data, different analysis techniques such as classification trees have been used to identify the potential situations of risk and to forecast cyanobacteria evolution in surface water. As a result, a new operational risk management plan has been developed and applied by the water operator since 2019. The main improvements concern the classification of the situations of risk in six groups (from low to very high, according to chlorophyl-a and cyanobacteria concentrations), the planning of the actions required under each situation (monitoring, management practice and treatment), and the use of the risk forecast to perform some of these actions from 2–3 days in advance. The methodology can be replicated to other case studies to facilitate the management of cyanobacteria risk and comply with the requirements of the revised European Drinking Water Directive adopted in 2020.</jats:p>",

The water supply system is energized by 2 sources i.e. power from utility grid and power generated by photovoltaic panels equipped with energy storage. The switching is based on the reservoir water level and determines the operation of submersible pump. The switching system employs electrode sensors in the water control level where 3 conditions are considered to control motor that drives the pump. The Automatic Switching is connected to Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) that selects power sources to energize the pump, where it may be from the solar PV supported by storage system or from the grid. The selection is based on the remaining energy saved in the storage, when it is sufficient then it is used to energize the pump. Otherwise, the power from the grid is used to supply the pump. The combination of Automatic Switching and ATS determines when the pump is on and which power is taken to supply the pump. The manual system is complemented in the switching system to enable manual operation when the automatic system fails to work for some reason. The whole system is developed in a panel for easy operation and monitoring. The water level indicator is given in the panel for the purpose of adjusting the pump operation based on water level in the reservoir.  </jats:p>"

The use of academic databases may seem quaint or antiquated. However, such academic research databases provide many powerful features to support both fast and thorough searches. The author also addresses notetaking because the reading you do can be limited if you are not taking effective notes that you can use in your writing and in the analysis of whether you have more literature you still must find. The value of notes and how to use them to develop your literature review is also addressed. This chapter discusses some of the challenges of searches and different methods and outlines an array of tips and strategies to both do fast, quick, and dirty searches and more comprehensive and in-depth searches. </jats:p>",

The analysis was carried out on 15 Physio-Chemical quality parameters and 6 trace element concentrations (Lead, Zinc, Cadmium, Chromium, Nickel &amp; Copper). Primary data was collected from 6 distinct sites of the district and subjected to methodical analysis. It was revealed that the mean values of various physio- chemical parameters are within the prescribed permissible levels while as heavy metal concentrations exhibit an escalating tendency across all selected sites especially GW1 (Pb 329, Cu 86, Ar 61, Zn 191), GW2 (Zn 132) and GW3 (Zn 144, Ar 67). The results indicate that waste disposal mechanism in hospitals of Srinagar is not environmental conducive and there is necessity to prevent further denigration of ground water sources in the region. Not denying that the present work is not the panacea for ground water contamination but the methodology adopted for this study is expected to pave way for further hydro-geological analysis in the region to identify the critical quality issues and also to explore remedial strategy to conserve the qualitative characteristics of ground water in the region.</jats:p>"

A safety review of a gas-supply system could help to mitigate the potential repercussions of supply disruptions. Disruptions occur at random due to systemic failures in gas distribution networks. Assessing the operational safety of gas distribution networks is challenging and complex, especially when operational data are limited or associated with high uncertainty. This paper focuses on gas leak incidents. Natural gas leaks disrupt the production process and endanger the ecosystem. Mechanically originated damage in pipelines is found to be the major cause of leaks, according to our investigations. This paper proposes a three-parameter risk matrix to be used in the safety analysis of gas-supply systems. This paper then raises the possibility of using grey-system theory. Grey-system theory has been used to overcome the limitations of the conventional matrix method. This choice is motivated by two facts: our data are heterogeneous with a high level of uncertainty, and some of the data are based on experts’ judgement and maintenance reports using qualitative metrics. It is underlined how GST provides insight for the decision-making process, even in the absence of complete information sets. The method developed here is advocated in the context of procedures ensuring the safety and the supply continuity of gas-supply systems.</jats:p>"

Therefore, optimal programming of the cropping pattern is necessary to handle such challenges. To accomplish this aim, a model of irrigation water allocation was developed based on cropping pattern using multistage stochastic programming in accordance with surface water supply fluctuations. In this model, different stochastic states were considered for all irrigation seasons in the irrigation network of the Jiroft plain in Kerman Province, Iran, which faces a severe shortage of surface water resources and the tendency of farmers to overuse groundwater resources. By solving a multistage stochastic model, it can be observed that, by utilizing an appropriate programming of the cropping pattern, more benefits for the farmers could be realized in the conditions of available surface water fluctuations. The results also indicated that if the surface water released into the canals increased in the spring, the share of profitable high water consumption crops in the pattern will increase, which will strengthen farmers' profits and put pressure on groundwater resources. However, this could not be expected to lead to a significant reduction of groundwater resource consumption and a significant increase of cropping intensity. According to the results obtained, surface water resources cannot meet the water needs of the region, even by using optimal cropping patterns, and this has led to overuse of groundwater resources in this area. Finally, such planning can help adoption of desired policies for irrigation water management through the proper release of these resources.</jats:p>",

However, NBS that are exclusively reliant on natural processes are not fit-for-purpose for the provision of safe drinking water—some range of built technology is required. There is a wide spectrum of techno-ecological NBS—“green technologies”—that are fit-for-purpose in the treatment and distribution of safe drinking water. A framework was developed to enable accurate and transparent description of the “green” attributes of technology—including green infrastructure—in the water industry. The framework differentiates technology “greenness” by relatively examining key attributes that may cause environmental impacts across the technology’s life cycle, through the lens of the environmental setting in which it is applied. In the water industry, green technology can be described by four main attributes: natural resource-basis, energy consumption, waste production, and footprint. These attributes are closely linked and must be considered relative to the biophysical and human environments in which they are applied and the other technologies to which they are being compared. The use of the framework can facilitate techno-ecological decision-making that strives to address diverse stakeholder priorities—including the influence of sociocultural factors on green technology preferences of individuals, groups, or communities.</jats:p>"

The industrial chain is a chain network organization system composed of various layers from the initial production of raw materials to the final product sales. The intensified contradiction between supply and demand can easily lead to the problem of resource supply security, and the occurrence of supply shortages will endanger the healthy and orderly development of the whole industrial chain. Therefore, from the perspective of the industrial chain and based on the trade data related to the nickel industrial chain, this study first constructs a multi-layer network model of the nickel industrial chain, and analyzes its trade structure characteristics and the correlation between different layers. It is found that the export policies of resource exporting countries may influence trade structure characteristics. On this basis, a multi-layer network crisis propagation model of the nickel industrial chain is constructed to simulate the impact and its propagation path of Indonesia supply shock on the entire industrial chain. With the increase of supply shock in Indonesia, the impact of crisis gradually concentrates to the downstream. Along the industrial chain, the number of affected countries gradually increases, but the difference in the impact degree gradually decreases. In addition, there are certain differences in countries affected by crisis at different layers of the industrial chain, and the crisis spreads mainly from China and Japan to the countries in midstream and downstream. The research results can provide corresponding policy suggestions for countries involved in the nickel trade.</jats:p>"

In the broadest sense, economic theory distinguishes two basic views defined by the views of monetarists and Keynesians. Although the basic difference is reflected in the determination of price rigidity and money neutrality, specifics of modern economic systems shift the focus towards the positive influence of monetary on real variables. The aim of our research is to identify and quantify the impact of monetary variables on economic growth in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The research was conducted using data from the period 2000-2020. The paper starts with the hypothesis that money supply and inflation ultimately have a positive impact on the real economic growth in BiH. The money supply M2 and the annual inflation rate are taken as explanatory (monetary) variables in the research, while real growth is a dependent variable. The long-term relationship between monetary variables and real growth rates was tested, taking into account the specificity of the BiH monetary arrangement established in the form of a currency board. In order to prove the hypothesis, we applied econometric techniques such as VEC model, cointegration analysis, innovation analysis based on the impulse-responsive function, decomposition variance as well as a causality test. The research results showed the connection between the money supply and the inflation rate with the economic growth in BiH, the relation being positive and statistically significant in the long run. With this, we confirmed the initial hypothesis of the work.</jats:p>"

A numerical model was used with length, width, and height of (7 × 1 × 1) m. Also, the nested mesh was used in the junction to refine the modeling and result depiction. It was observed that if there is a water level difference on both sides of the junction, the mixing will occur much faster, and only longitudinal mixing will prevail downstream of the junction. Therefore, it was concluded that to reduce the contamination effect through the river networks, the water level in the main channel should be higher than the sub-branch. In the flow separation zone, several clockwise vortices were observed, which become weaker by moving towards the outer wall of the channel. Also, the most significant velocity vectors and also the highest contaminant concentration was observed in this region. Moreover, the vertical distribution of pollution concentration showed that the contaminant concentration would be higher at large distances above the channel bed. The highest values of turbulent intensity and turbulent kinetic energy were also observed in flow recirculation zone. It was concluded that by increase of concentration gradient through the shear layers, the required mixing length for complete transverse pollution mixing would be decreased.</jats:p>",

Even if supply chain risks appear to be a minor risk event that was initially ignored, they can cause billions of dollars in costs and long-term supply chain disruptions at the macro level. The ship named Ever Given, which blocked the canal by accident during transportation in the Suez Canal on March 29, 2021, caused significant adverse effects in the supply chains, but also caused a break in the supply chain. In this study, the occurrence of the event is examined in terms of past marine accidents and supply chain risk management. In addition, alternative scenarios that occurred during the accident were examined, their effects on supply chains were determined, and suggestions were made against such accidents in the future.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Avocado consumption and trade are increasing worldwide, with North America and Europe being the main importing regions. Spain is the major European avocado producer (90% of the production), yet it only supplies 10% of the market. Consequently, more than 90% of the avocados consumed in Europe are imported from overseas, mainly from Chile and Peru. In this work, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) impact associated with the transport of two avocado supply chains (short (Spanish) and long (Chilean)) and the effect of the fruit origin and distance of both chains on primary and secondary metabolites from harvest to edible ripeness were evaluated using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection (LC-DAD) based metabolite analysis. The LCA transport impact of the fresh supply chain from production centers in Chile (Quillota) and Spain (Malaga), and then the distribution to several cities in Europe, suggested road export from Spain to European capitals to have the lowest impact (0.14 to 0.22 kg CO2 eq/kg of avocado). When export from Chile was considered, the option of oceanic freight to European ports closer to final destinations was clearly a better option (0.21 to 0.26 kg CO2 eq/kg) than via the Algeciras port in Spain followed by road transport to final destinations in European capitals (0.34 to 0.43 kg CO2 eq/kg), although the situation could be somewhat different if the avocados are transported from the destination ports in northern Europe to long-distance capitals in other European countries. Fruit origin had a significant impact on avocado primary and secondary metabolites. The conditions of the supply chain itself (10 d in cold storage in regular conditions vs. 30 d cold storage + controlled atmosphere conditions) largely influence the fate of some metabolites that certainly affect the pool of metabolites at edible ripeness. The long-assumed hypothesis that the longer the supply chain the more negative impact on nutritional and functional compounds might not hold in this case, as long as transport conditions are adequate in terms of temperature, atmosphere conditions, and time considering distance from origin to destination.</jats:p>"

The effect on alkaline reagents and coagulant reagents on co-stocks is proposed and investigated. The obtained results allow to establish rational doses of reagents for effective removal of pollutants from soapstocks. In the studied wastewater, the concentration of organic matter according to the HSC was 40,000 mg / dm3, low pH 2, at which the stability of the state of organic pollutants in the water (no foaming, sedimentation). Calcium carbonate and sodium hydroxide solutions were used as alkalizing reagents. Comparison of the effects obtained under the action of calcium carbonate, compared with the effects obtained with sodium hydroxide, showed 2.4-2.5 times greater efficiency for HSC. The effects of removal of suspended solids and organic substances by HSC at a dose of aluminum sulfate 2 g / dm3 were, respectively, 85.6% and 72% when providing a pH of 5.5 by the action of calcium carbonate. However, it is not possible to remove organic matter to acceptable values ​​when discharged into the city sewer in one stage of purification. Therefore, both after alkalization with calcium carbonate and after coagulation with aluminum sulfate, it is proposed to use the flotation method of phase separation, for example, using air supply through porous materials.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Torres de Bellavista residential complex has 1,500 apartments, distributed in five towers of thirty floors each, a nine-story building for approximately 750 parking spaces and other community infrastructure. Given the dimensions of this set, it is presumed that electricity consumption entails high economic and environmental costs, so one way to solve this cost is the use of alternative, non-conventional methods of electricity generation, for this reason, it is proposed to design a photovoltaic system that allows partial supply of electricity to the common and administrative areas of the residential complex.  The calculations of the components of the photovoltaic system were carried out using the methodology of the worst month, which consists of finding the month in which the relationship between solar irradiation and electricity consumption makes it more difficult to satisfy the energy demand; When making the design under these conditions, it will be guaranteed that the rest of the year an electricity supply greater than the month of the calculations will be achieved. This methodology made it possible to demonstrate that, with the installation of 100 photovoltaic solar panels distributed on the roofs of the 5 towers and connected to the supply network, it is possible to satisfy up to 27% of the energy demand of the common areas. To achieve the objective of this proposal, an initial investment of COP 220,453,967 must be made, of which 50% must be financed by a bank. However, the investment can be recovered between 5 and 6 years after implementation, starting to generate returns for the rest of the estimated useful life of 25 years. The benefits of implementing this proposal are not only economic but also environmental, since it manages to reduce Greenhouse Gas-GHG emissions by 37.07 tCO2e for the first year of implementation.</jats:p>",

The closed-form expressions for the optimal solutions are derived and the results suggest that the distribution of customer valuations, yield rate and demand uncertainties have a vital influence on the firm’s optimal prices and profits. We then extend our study by allowing stockout-based substitution where a customer may be willing to purchase a substitute if his most preferred product is not available but the substitute provides him with non-negative utility. The results indicate that disregarding stockout-based substitution (i) results in severe supply-demand mismatches for the product line in two directions; (ii) leads to higher or lower profit margins for both products; (iii) may not cause profit loss when the prices of both products are exogenous; however, this result does not hold when the prices are endogenous.</jats:p>",

In particular, this also applies to local resistances of pipelines. In the paper, the separation length and separation height downstream of the contraction plane of axisymmetric sudden contraction of the circular pipe of a single-phase Newtonian flow have been investigated. Area ratios 0.250 and 0.321 were considered. After all, measures to reduce energy losses on the axisymmetric sudden contraction must be effective at values of the area ratio not less than 0.250. The separation length and separation height have the extreme dependence with a maximum at the transition of the laminar flow into a turbulent flow one. When the values of the Reynolds number at the laminar flow increase, these sizes increase, and they decrease at the turbulent flow. In the first case, the separation point is shifted downstream from the plane of contraction. The separation length and separation height are proportional to the Reynolds number. This is similar to changing the separation length and separation height of upstream from the plane of contraction. A transition zone be located between 9650 and 40000 and 1200 and 5000 if the Reynolds number is based on smaller pipe diameter and step height correspondingly. The separation length of downstream of the contraction plane are decreased if these sizes are length - smaller pipe diameter ratio, and increase if these sizes are length - step height ratio. The changing of separation height is similar. But the change of the separation length is greater than the change of separation height. There is enough good agreement between the experimental results and the results described in the literature. For taking measures providing decrease in energy losses, the investigation of the separation length and separation height downstream of the contraction plane at different values of area ratio being more than 0.250 is proposed.</jats:p>"

On working with three cases of no vertical merger, single chain vertical merger and double chain vertical merger we find that joint profits of upstream and downstream firms are lowest when both channels choose vertical integration as compared to Nash Bargaining regime. We also find that Vertical integration is welfare enhancing because retail price will be minimum as upstream and downstream firms behave as a single entity. Hence for both single and double chain mergers, elimination of double marginalization is procompetitive. These results have implications for the enforcement of competition (antitrust) law.</jats:p>"

Experimental results for the present study demonstrate the influence of the rate of flow and clear spacing between the piers on the scour depth. Additionally the results of the soft computing technique GEP during testing and training of proposed modelling, fitness function root mean square error is observed as 0.00133 and 0.00113, with the coefficient of determination as 0.950 and 0.955, respectively. Furthermore, in order to find out the role of each variable for scour depth sensitivity, analysis has been conducted. The findings of the sensitivity analysis show that the pier spacing and rate of flow play the most significant role in scour depth estimation. Results of this study demonstrate a good agreement with the proposed GEP model and conclude that it is a better approach for forecasting scour depth.</jats:p>",

The main combustion stage of the swirler is a combination of swirling and non-swirling air intake. The verified one-dimensional calculation method is used to calculate and evaluate the performance of the combustion chamber. Based on the verification of three-dimensional numerical method and grid independence, the effects of fuel supply and distribution on combustor performance are studied. The studies show that the combustion efficiency and outlet temperature distribution could be improved when the axial position of the pilot nozzle is located at the outlet of vane channel. However, it will cause the problem that the high temperature flame is too close to the outlet of swirler. With the increase of the main nozzle angle, the combustion efficiency increases, and the overall temperature distribution factor (OTDF) decreases gradually. The fuel distribution ratio of main stage has a great impact on the field of temperature. The increase of fuel distribution ratio is contributed to improve the combustion efficiency and reduce the OTDF, while the total pressure loss coefficient increases slightly within a certain range. However, when the fuel distribution ratio exceeds 80%, the temperature near the baffle plate of dome is overheated, and the improvement effect of combustion efficiency is no longer obvious.</jats:p>",

The case study has included 100 companies selected from the automotive production sector over ten years, from 2010 to 2019. Methodologically, the study includes statistically fixed and random effects models, considering within the model parameters as dependent variables asset and efficiency-based ratios and as independent variables financial performance ratios related to returns on assets, equity, capital expenses, and sales. The selection of the fixed or random- effects model is accomplished by performing the Hausman test. The results of panel analysis indicate a causal relationship for the proposed models, highlighting the importance of efficiency ratios such as Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio, Total Assets Turnover Ratio, and Fixed Assets Turnover. From practitioners` perspective, the models` construction and the paper’s results gain insight into strategic supply chain areas that can be prioritised for increased efficiency and corporate competitiveness, promoting sustainable financial performance through asset structure, asset efficiency, and inventory management.</jats:p>",

The stability of the transport offer is one of the pillars of the high demand for transport services. Therefore, the legal regulations introduced at that time have been analyzed. Then their impact on the demand and the supply in the aviation market has been assessed. The destructive influence of the activities undertaken in this period on aviation has been demonstrated.

Tilapia products are mainly supplied to the international market, especially the US. The global market for the Chinese tilapia has grown dramatically, but a downward trend occurred in 2019–2020. The Chinese domestic market demand is relatively stable, and even the COVID-19 epidemic did not significantly impact the supply and demand of tilapia. Internationally, it is expected that the demand for tilapia will decline considerably in the near future. However, this decline could be alleviated after the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic passes and increasing demand will resume. The increased supply of Chinese tilapia might slow down or even decrease due to market uncertainty, the increasing constraints on natural resources, and the Chinese government’s requirements for high-quality aquaculture environments.</jats:p>"

Water quality is influencing our life ubiquitously and prioritizing all the urban management. Traditional urban water quality control mostly focused on routine tests of quality indicators, which include physical, chemical and biological groups. However, the inevitable delay for biological indicators has increased the health risk and leads to accidents such as massive infections in many big cities. In this paper, we first analyse the problem, technical challenges, and research questions. Then we provide a possible solution by building a risk analysis framework for the urban water supply system. It takes indicator data we collected from industrial processes to perceive water quality changes, and further for risk detection. In order to provide explainable results, we propose an Adaptive Frequency Analysis (Adp-FA) method to resolve the data using indicators’ frequency domain information for their inner relationships and individual prediction. We also investigate the scalability properties of this method from indicator, geography and time domains. For the application, we select industrial quality data sets collected from a Norwegian project in 4 different urban water supply systems, as Oslo, Bergen, Strømmen and Aalesund.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Qurbani is a religious practice that takes place during Eid al-Adha. Consumers practicing Qurbani typically wish to collect meat and red offal within a short time after slaughter, which means these products cannot complete normal chilling processes before leaving the slaughterhouse. This could permit greater growth of pathogens and has the potential to increase the risk of consumer illness. The FSA is working with industry and stakeholder groups to ensure that the risk to consumers under these conditions remains at an acceptable level. To help inform these discussions, the FSA commissioned this assessment to understand the difference in risk from allowing meat and offal to be provided to consumers without the normal chilling process.  The microbiological team at the FSA have analysed scientific literature, expert opinion and business and consumer survey data to assess the effect of disrupting the cold chain on pathogens in Qurbani meat. The pathogens that were chosen for inclusion in this assessment are non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens. Their growth characteristics and prevalence in beef, lamb and goat meat and offal are discussed.  The assessment concluded that given the reported variation in the process, there were two important scenarios with distinct outcomes. In the typical scenario, which is the most likely outcome based on the collected data, there is no significant difference in risk to consumer health compared to normal chilling processes, and the risk level was established as Very Low (“very rare but cannot be excluded”). In a reasonably foreseeable worst-case scenario, Salmonella spp. and STEC levels may increase, presenting an increased risk to the consumer. This risk level was established as Low (“rare but does occur”). We also identified several areas where more evidence would be helpful, and as a result identified a High level of uncertainty in our conclusion.</jats:p>"

Disruptions in international supply chains were widely reported as governments imposed containment measures (lockdowns) to halt the spread of the disease. At the same time, demand declined as households and firms scaled back spending. This paper attempts to disentangle the supply and demand channels in trade by quantifying the causal effect of supply spillovers from lockdowns. We utilise a novel dataset of daily bilateral seaborne trade and design a shift‐share identification strategy that leverages geography‐induced cargo delivery lags to track the transmission of supply disruptions across space. We find strong but short‐lived supply spillovers of lockdowns through international trade. Moreover, the evidence is suggestive of the downstream propagation of countries' lockdowns through global supply chains. The short‐lived nature of the disruptions despite the unprecedented scale of the shock caution against any blunt use of trade and tax policies to create costly redundancies in global supply chains.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses the impact of government intervention (greenness threshold limit) and cap-and-trade policy on green investment, stakeholder profits and social welfare under different power structure scenarios in the green supply chain. First, a two-level green supply chain system is constructed: a manufacturer that produces green products and complies with cap-and-trade policies and a retailer that sells green products. Based on the Stackelberg game and Cournot game, we compare the optimal solutions under the government intervention mechanism and cap-and-trade mechanism with manufacturer leadership, retailer leadership and equal power. The results are as follows: (1) both government intervention and the cap-and-trade mechanism are conducive to an increase in green technology innovation and profit, but excessive control will lead to a decline in social welfare. (2) The results in the concentrated scenario were better than those in the dispersed scenario. In the decentralized state, the result of equal power is the best, the result of retailer leadership is next, and the result of manufacturer leadership is the worst. (3) The lower cost of green investment will cause enterprises to give up purchasing carbon emission permits from the carbon market.</jats:p>"

This study aims to find out the factors related to the problem of rice supply and what factors have a significant effect on rice supply. The study was conducted in North Sumatera with the consideration of a decrease in production that could interfere with food security. The results showed that several factors had a major influence on rice supply, including rice prices, rice production, rice consumption, rice imports, government rice reserves, land conversion, prices of production factors such as fertilizers, land conversion and food diversification. Some variables that have a significant effect on rice supply include North Sumatera Rice Price (NSRP), North Sumatera Harvest Area (NSHA) and North Sumatera Fertilizer Price (NSFP). Two variables that have a positive effect are NSHA and NSFP, while one variable has a negative effect, namely NSRP. Of the five variables, there are two variables that have no significant effect, namely North Sumatera Rice Consumption (NSRC), North Sumatera Cassava Price (NSCP).</jats:p>",

As one of the disruptive technologies, Blockchain technology (BCT) has been drawing attention stemming from cryptocurrency proliferation (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), for which Blockchain serves as the backbone. However, the public is haunted by the bewilderment between cryptocurrencies and BCT. Furthermore, the burgeoning of Metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFT) has raised BCT to another notch. This study conducts a holistic literature review on BCT features, implementations, and business implications. In particular, by reviewing and analyzing 2265 up-to-date articles that reveal BCT’s applications across various fields, this Blockchain-centered study reveals the research status and delineates future research directions. It is shown that, among various characteristics of BCT, traceability is the main characteristic fueling BCT’s application in supply chain management (SCM). We further find that the BCT-related research has been extremely growing in SCM, healthcare, and government, while declining in the areas of banking and cyber security. Geographically, the top countries with BCT-related publications are China, U.S., and India. Finally, it is emphasized that BCT-related research in environmental sciences and agriculture have potential to be explored.</jats:p>"

The flood risk on WSS should be managed in the Water Safety Plans (WSP), recommended in the EU Water Directive 2020/2184 to water utilities. Flood event can impact the quality of surface and ground water in multiple ways: contaminated water can enter groundwater through wells, overflow and contamination from sewerage systems can occur, extreme rainfall can increase loading of suspended sediments in surface waters. Flooding can also cause supply service interruption for damaged infrastructures. A comprehensive approach to address flood impact on WSS is not available, while only specific aspects were investigated. This work introduces an overall approach implemented in an informative tool named WAter Safety Planning Procedures Decision Support System (WASPP–DSS) developed in the context of MUHA (Multihazard framework for Water Related risks management) project. The tool is here applied and demonstrated for three case studies: Ridracoli dam (Italy), Larissa municipality (Greece), and area managed by Zadar water supply company (Croatia). The WASPP–DSS is found to be a valid support for the WSP development allowing the description of components and links, hazards identification and risk assessment and can be useful mainly for small water utilities for an early stage WSP development and implementation. Improvements are desirable, as including a specific section to consider the issue of loss of water resources from reservoirs due to overflow.</jats:p>"

Bundling is a popular means to expand 5G subscribers and improve 5G market coverage. Considering the characteristics of bundling, this study establishes a secondary supply chain composed of a terminal manufacturer and a telecom operator under the condition of network externality strength. In this supply chain, the product quality of the terminal manufacturer is complementary to the service quality of the telecom operator. Using Steinberg’s theory, we derive the optimal value of each decision variable in a centralized mode and a decentralized mode and take profit maximization as the goal. This paper also designs a contract of bidirectional cost sharing and revenue compensation for supply chain coordination. Finally, the influence of network externality strength and a mass-additive factor on the supply chain is discussed using numerical analysis. The results show that higher network externality strength has a significant impact on product pricing, the quality of each entity and the profit of the supply chain. At the same time, the degree of complementarity between the terminal product quality and the telecommunications service quality affects whether consumers choose to buy contract products. A higher degree of complementarity promotes the market inflow into high-end consumers.</jats:p>"

We examined the impact of enacting less restrictive NP practice restrictions—NP Modernization Act—in New York State (NYS) on the overall supply of primary care NPs and supply in underserved areas. Methods: We used longitudinal data from the SK&amp;A outpatient database (2012-2018) to identify primary care practices in NYS and in the comparison states (Pennsylvania [PA] and New Jersey [NJ]). Using a difference-in-differences design, we compared changes in 1) the presence and 2) total counts of NPs in primary care practice in NYS and neighboring comparison states (i.e., PA and NJ) before and after the policy change.Results: The NP Modernization Act was associated with a 1.3 percentage point lower probability of a practice employing at least one NP on average across each of the 3 post-periods (95% CI: -0.024, -0.002). NP Modernization Act was associated with 0.065 fewer NPs on average across the post-period (95% CI: -0.119, -0.011). Results were similar in underserved areas.Conclusions: The NP supply in NYS was lower after the NP Modernization Act than would have been expected based on the experience of comparison states. The negative relationship may be explained by gains in provider efficiency which leads to reduced NP hiring. More research is needed to understand the relationship between SOP regulations, NP supply, and access to care.</jats:p>"

The pandemic causes instability in the Indonesian economy from demand and sales. The supply chain is a long process consisting of parties involved directly or indirectly in fulfilling customer needs: suppliers, manufacturers, shipping, warehouses, checking, and the customers themselves. In an increasingly dynamic and volatile global environment, various events threaten to disrupt supply chain operational activities. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused supply chain management to be very vulnerable due to closing access and lockdown policy. Therefore, the designed supply chain system must withstand disruptions and recover quickly at a minimal cost. Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) is the ability of the supply chain to survive, adapt, and overcome operational disruptions that can damage the supply chain system so that the supply chain can quickly recover from disruptions and reconstruct the supply chain to be stronger than before. SCR has attributes that enable companies to anticipate and overcome disruptions. The Automotive Industry in Indonesia needs to identify what capabilities have been or will be used to anticipate supply chain disruptions which are then quantified to find out which capabilities have the most effect on increasing supply chain resilience.

Ecological embeddedness is a subset of the circular economy (CE) that demands legitimacy through design changes to product, production and/or packaging for benefits to economic actors and the environment. This is in contrast with legitimacy as a public relations exercise. Blockchain is a digital transformation technology that is not fully conceptualized with respect to supply chain implementation and the related strategy formulation, particularly in the context of sustainability. Furthermore, the integration of consumers into the CE remains not well understood or researched, with the main focus of CE being the cycling of resources. Methods: This research employs a qualitative case study methodology of the first coffee business in the USA to use blockchain technology as an exemplar. Gap analysis is then applied to identify how blockchain could be used to advance from the current state to a more sustainable one.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Accurately predicting the seasonal inflow into a reservoir accumulated during the snowmelt season, for instance the total aggregated inflow between April and August (A48), in a hydrological basin is critical to anticipate the operation of hydroelectric damns and avoid hydrology-related hazard. Such forecasts generally involve numerical models that simulate the hydrological evoluation of a basin. The operational department of the French electric company EDF implements a semi-distributed model and carry out such forecasts for several decades, on about fifty basins. However, both scarse observation data and over-simplified physics representatioin may leed to significant forecasts errors. Data assimilation has been shown beneficial to improve predictions in various hydrological applications, yet very few have addressed the seasonal streamflow supply prediction problem. More specifically, the assimilation of snow observations, though available in various forms, has been rarely studied, despite the possible sensitivity of the streamflow supply to snow stock. This is the goal of the present paper. In three mountainous basins, a serie of four ensemble data assimilation experiments – assimilating (i) the streamflow (Q) alone, (ii) Q and fractional snow cover (FSC) data, (iii) Q and local cosmic ray snow sensor data (CRS) and (iv) all the data combined – are compared to the climatologic ensemble and an ensemble of free simulations. The experiments compare the accuracy of the estimated streamflows during the reanalysis (or assimilation) period, September to March; during the forecast period, April to August; and the A48 estimation. The results show that Q assimilation notably improves streamflow estimations during both reanalysis and forecast period. Also, the additional combination of CRS and FSC data to the assimilation further ameliorates the A48 prediction in two of the three basins. In the last basin, the experiments highlight a poor representativity of the CRS observations during some years and reveals the need for an enhanced observation system.\n                        </jats:p>"

A quantitative assessment approach has been applied. Experimental and numerical tests were used for stepped spillways with different step configurations. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method with a two-dimensional (2D) flow model, including volume of fluid (VOF) and k-ε models was applied to conduct a critical analysis in different flow conditions. Step heights hs were 0.03 m and 0.05 m, and the number of steps Ns were 10 and 6, respectively. The step configurations assessed were Step models, Sill models, and Curve models with angle θ = 26.6°. The developed 2D model investigated the flow patterns, velocity distribution, and pressure for several step configurations. For validation, the correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) were tested. The results showed negative pressure at the flat steps at Nappe flow, whilst negative pressure did not appear in the Curve model. MAPE and RMSE were 4.32 and 0.21 respectively, with R =0.996. In the CFD results, velocity and the pressure distributions were compared with the experiments and showed a correlation within a (±6%) tolerance. The Curve models were the best in terms of the flow characteristics.</jats:p>",

The problem of insufficient power supply in densely populated metropolis which is characterised by frequent load shedding was solved using optimal placement and sizing of multiple distributed generation. A gas plant was optimally placed at 33 kV injection substations at Awada and General Cotton Mill (GCM). The generators were optimally placed using voltage sensitivity index factor, while their optimum capacities were sized using step method. Simulations were done by power system analysis toolbox (PSAT) 2.1.11 simulation tool in MATLAB 2018a environment and the result of the findings revealed that 32 buses out of 34 buses were violated. The result of the simulation also showed that the optimal operating power output of the generators at Awada and GCM of 12.5 MW and 2.5 MW respectively could only clear 29 out of the 32 bus voltage violations. Overloading of Fegge injection substation transformer was identified as the cause and its upgrade from 7.5 MVA to 15.0 MVA cleared all the voltage violations. The system active loss and reactive loss were 1.82 MW and 35.03 MVar and the research was able to reduce them by 23.30% and 23.80% respectively. The statutory bus voltage limits of ±5% and the requirement that distributed generators installed must be less than the maximum demanded had been achieved in the research. The power supply in Onitsha distribution network was enhanced using distribution generations and the usage of optimal placement and sizing of multiple distributed generation is therefore recommended for problematic distribution networks not only for loss reduction also for better performance.</jats:p>"

The objects of the analysis were the Internet sites and online services of the largest pharmacy chains and services for remote ordering of pharmacy assortment goods (TOP 20). The basis for inclusion in the analysis was the data of the analytical agencies DSM Group, RNC Pharma and AlphaRM. Methods of criteria, logical, comparative and content analysis were used to conduct the study. The authors have developed their own evaluation scale focused on evaluating the content of the Internet sites of pharmacy chains in relation to the information and educational component for the population. RESULTS. Based on the consolidation of data from 3 analytical agencies, the final list of objects of analysis included 18 pharmacy chains and 3 services for remote ordering of pharmacy assortment goods. The average score on the evaluation scale for the totality of pharmacy chains was 9.13±0,74 out of 23 possible. The presence of websites and telephone help service for all objects of research, their features are revealed. The assessment of the availability and information content of mobile applications of pharmacy chains was carried out. The analysis of the information content of pharmacy networks in social networks and Internet messengers was carried out. Conclusions are made about the quantitative and qualitative component of the service for the population \"Question – answer\". The presence and features of information and educational materials for the population on the Internet sites of pharmacy chains are analyzed. A study of instructions for the medical use of medicines was conducted: quantitative components, relevance, compliance with the State Register of Medicines of the Russian Federation. CONCLUSION. The conducted research allowed us to draw conclusions about the insufficient degree of involvement of pharmacy chains in the process of pharmaceutical education of the population and the insignificant use of the possibility of influence of pharmacy chains on the development of pharmaceutical literacy of the population through Internet resources. The article provides recommendations on possible ways to fully develop pharmaceutical education of the population in the Internet space.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ukraine, as an independent state, has a market economy that works according to the requirements of the world natural gas market. Gas has become a commodity, that is, it has its own price depending on its quality and demand for it. Modern gas quality standards provide for the control of about thirty indicators. The efficiency of gas appliances has increased by about 25%. The requirement of accounting for gas in both volume units and energy units is established by law, similar to accounting in EU countries. When accounting for gas, the higher heat of combustion is used, that is, all the energy of the gas.  But when conducting hydraulic calculations in the design and reconstruction of gas networks, values of lower heat of combustion are still used. When selecting gas-using equipment based on the data of the manufacturing plants, the performance characteristics of the devices, focused on lower combustion heat, are also indicated. There are differences in the approach to determining the energy component contained in a certain volume of gas in different sections of the gas transportation system. As a result, the amount of energy changes. It is proposed to use a higher heat of combustion not only when accounting for gas, but also when conducting calculations at all stages of gas movement along the gas transportation network, as well as when conducting hydraulic calculations of gas pipelines. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that at all stages of gas movement in the gas transportation network, both when designing gas networks and when calculating payment for the amount of gas consumed, it is advisable to use the value of the higher heat of combustion of gas. This will lead to a reduction in the volume of construction work and the diameters of gas pipelines during new construction and reconstruction of systems, a reduction in gas consumption due to its more complete use, a decrease in dependence on imported gas, an improvement in air quality due to a decrease in harmful emissions, which will occur when ensuring greater completeness of gas combustion.</jats:p>"

The scope of the paper is to show: (i) which information on costs and prices is used in techno-economic models; (ii) which sources these monetary values are based on; and (iii) whether these values are able to be compared and classified. The methodology employed in this review paper is a systematic evaluation of the supply costs and prices for residual biomass used as the basis for techno-economic analyses in the literature. Three evaluation criteria (COST TYPE, TIME PERIOD and COST SCOPE) are used to operationalise the scope of the delivery, the time frame and the spatial resolution of the monetary values. The pricing and cost variables UNIT and BIOMASS are also studied. The results show that the supply costs and pricing differ in terms of the units used, the scope of the delivery and the spatial scale, making it difficult to compare individual studies or transfer the findings to other use cases. The costs and pricing examined range from 0.00 EUR/Mg (dm) for “bio-waste from private households” to a regional value of 1097.02 EUR/Mg (dm) for “woody biomass from vineyards”. They are rarely based on cost calculations or price analyses over a period of several years, and more than half of the literature sources examined do not take into account regional differences. The findings suggest that the input data on costs and prices are not always of sufficient quality. For that reason, in the future, the data on supply costs and prices that are provided for processing should have a more detailed temporal and spatial resolution.</jats:p>"

Dependence on international markets for medical PPE provision has left states vulnerable to price volatility and supply shortages. As the severity of the pandemic fluctuates amidst an ever‐present risk of regional and global public health crises, medical PPE market volatility – exacerbated by the lack of accurate, up‐to‐date, transparent information of PPE international supply conditions – will continue to undermine effective policy responses and the resilience of healthcare systems around the world. This article proposes a WTO/WHO joint initiative to ensure PPE market supply transparency for future pandemic preparedness. It departs from an analysis of the global PPE market, the impact of COVID‐19 on PPE production and supply, and the systemic lack of basic PPE supply chain information at all levels. From this, it identifies the need for PPE market supply transparency and thus proposes creating a PPE market supply transparency system at the domestic and/or international level as a viable solution to enhance transparency and cooperation in preparation for the next pandemic.</jats:p>",

However, the economic problems lately have resulted in a decline in Indonesia’s economic conditions, which is marked by a reduction in national GDP and a decrease in the output of the Indonesian manufacturing industry sector. Thus, this study aims to analyze the effect of the complex variables in the current economy, namely inflation, exchange rates, labor, and the money supply, on the manufacturing industry sector in Indonesia in the long and short term. This study uses the ECM (error correction model) method in empirical testing. The data used is secondary time series data (quarterly) starting from 2011:Q1 – 2020:Q4; the data obtained comes from the Central Statistics Agency, Bank Indonesia, and the Ministry of Trade of the Republic of Indonesia. This study uses the Eviews10 application as an analytical tool. The analysis results conducted in this study show that the exchange rate and labor have a positive and significant influence on the manufacturing industry sector in the long and short term. The money supply has a positive and significant effect on the manufacturing industry sector in the long term only. Meanwhile, inflation has a negative but not significant effect both in the long term and short term. Of these critical variables, labor has the most crucial influence on the manufacturing industry sector. Therefore, the government needs to pay attention to policies related to labor as the main factor in increasing the output of the manufacturing industry.</jats:p>"

This study proposes a multi-tier supply chain model consisting of a single manufacturer and multiple retailers. A single-setup multiple deliveries (SSMD) policy is adopted considering the synchronized cycle time of manufacturers with that of retailers and the delivery of unequal lot size for each retailer. Preservation technology is used at retailers to minimize the effects of deterioration in a way that the magnitude of decrease in deterioration reduces for additional investment in preservation technology. A centralized supply chain model is proposed by defining a nonlinear mathematical model for maximizing total profit through an analytical optimization technique and an algorithm. Numerical experiments are exhibited to validate the applications of the provided model. The results exhibit that the proposed preservation policy increases the product’s lifetime and the total profit by reducing the number of shipments/transportation and increasing the lot size. The SSMD policy helps to reduce the preservation cost and increase the total profit. Some managerial insights are provided for the decision makers for applying the proposed model.</jats:p>"

By improving the inertia weight of particle swarm optimization and introducing mutation operation, a dynamic mutation particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed to avoid the problem of particles falling into a local minimum in the process of optimization.

These factors are used as variables in the mathematical model, which is working under uncertain conditions when the consumption rate of materials is not constant. The information used in this model is obtained from Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques and the genetic algorithm is utilized to determine the optimal supplier and the quantities of supplies for different materials.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there has been an aggravation of problems in the field of environmental safety of surface water sources, which is caused by the unsatisfactory state of water resources. Among the reasons for this should be noted the lack of effective mechanisms for water management, control and responsibility.\nA comprehensive assessment of the environmental safety indicators of surface water sources of supply by chemical indicators is a laborious task. Indicators are obtained by combining and summarizing many complex indicators into one integrating one, which makes it possible to characterize different positions of water bodies.\nThe practice of monitoring in surface water indicates the need to minimize resources to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the environmental safety of a water object.\nTherefore, the purpose of this work is to justify the choice as an indicative indicator of the ecological state of the surface source of drinking water supply of biochemical oxygen consumption. To do this, it is necessary to characterize the ecological state of the studied area using the combinatorial index of water pollution and establish a link between this index and biochemical oxygen consumption.\nThe calculation of the value of the combinatorial pollution index and the relative assessment of the ecological state of surface water were carried out in two stages: first, for each individual investigated substance and indicator of the ecological state of surface water, then the entire complex of pollutants was considered simultaneously and the resulting assessment was derived.\nBaseline indicators play an important role in the ecology of a water object. Therefore, the content of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen consumption in water is of great interest not only in terms of the development of life, but also as an indicative indicator of the ecological state of the aquatic environment, makes the indicator of biochemical oxygen consumption important for indicative assessment of water pollution by various organic substances.\nFor the tasks for which we justify the choice of indicative indicators of the ecological state of surface water, it is more important to identify the consequences of pollution not directly at the site of pollution, but at some distance from it and after a while. Therefore, the use of the amount of dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen consumption as indicators characterizing the oxidation process of existing pollutants in water is the most appropriate for the tasks of operational monitoring of water bodies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article introduces a simple application of contest theory that neatly captures how Boulding’s ‘loss of strength gradient’ determines the geographic extent of territory. We focus on the ‘supply side’ of territorial conflict, showing how the costs of initiating and escalating conflict over spatially dispersed resources shape the nature and scope of territory. We show that economies of scale in the production of violence and varying costs of projecting power at a distance combine to affect the intensive and extensive margins of conflict, and ultimately the geographic distribution of territory. Comparative statics analysis shows how the distribution of conflict and territory change as costs change, helping shed light on, for example, why new transportation technologies have historically led to a redrawing of territorial boundaries. We test and probe the boundaries of this model in two experiments varying the marginal costs of conflict over space and the fixed costs of entry. Increases in both costs interact to increase the probability of exclusive territories. The first experiment directly tests the theory in a static, one-shot setting that strictly matches the information conditions studied in the theory. The second experiment examines conflict behavior under conditions analogous to those in conflicts outside the lab: where no contestant knows the probability of winning, let alone the function determining that probability, and parties interact repeatedly. Median behavior closely tracks equilibrium predictions in all treatments. </jats:p>",

A multiple case study has been developed, through the administration of a semi-structured interview to 7 Italian companies that design, manufacture and sell 3D printers offering additive technological solutions to the medical sector. The results show how companies believe that the organizational impact related to the adoption of this technology is quite significant, highlighting how it leads to the definition of a new organizational culture. Secondly, it emerges that the adoption of 3D printers within the medical sector also leads to a change in procedures and production activities. Finally, it also emerges that the impact at the supply chain level particularly affects the reduction in the number of players in the supply chain and product time to market.</jats:p>"

The frequency and speed of change however varies from industry-to-industry, business-to business. Thereby, the manner by which a firms’ supply chain adapts to these environment dynamics demand greater attention. Building on the relationship between manufacturing strategy and the environment, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the direct impact of environmental dynamism on supply chain flexibility, and the indirect impact of achieving supply chain flexibility required by the environment through organisational ambidexterity in the Sri Lankan textile and apparel industry which is an industry under increased pressure to be more flexible and the highest export revenue contributor to the economy. A positivism paradigm provided the foundation for this explanatory research. A cross-sectional survey method was used to collect the primary data from operations or supply chain managers across firms in the Sri Lankan textile and apparel industry. Eighty-seven responses were received and analysed using the SmartPLS software. As a preliminary result, this study finds that there is a significant positive impact of environmental dynamism on supply chain flexibility and this relationship is partially mediated by organisational ambidexterity. Moreover, the results reveal a significant positive impact among the variables; environmental dynamism, organisational ambidexterity and supply chain flexibility. In the practical context, managers need to be aware of environmental changes to identify areas which require investment in flexibility as it incurs both costs and risks for a firm. Further, the insights which managers gain on supply chain flexibility, from being responsive to dynamic environments is enhanced when organisational ambidexterity is practiced. Practicing organisational ambidexterity helps managers to refine existing processes to maintain competitive advantage, and achieve the optimal degree of flexibility required by the firm and its environment in being open to innovation. Owing to limitations identified, future research possibilities are extending the research to other industries, carrying out longitudinal studies, and testing other possible mediator variables.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Supply Chain Flexibility, Environmental Dynamism, Organisational Ambidexterity</jats:p>"

This disruption can be fatal for production, logistics, and retail operations. Depending on the scope of the affected areas and the blackout duration, supply chains (SC) can be impacted to different extent. In this study, we perform a simulation analysis using anyLogistix digital SC twin to identify potential impacts of blackouts on SCs for scenarios of different severity. Distinctively, we triangulate the design and evaluation of experiments with consideration of SC performance, resilience, and viability. The results allow for some generalizations. First, we conceptualize blackout as a special case of SC risks which is distinctively characterized by a simultaneous shutdown of several SC processes, disruption propagations (i.e., the ripple effect), and a danger of viability losses for entire ecosystems. Second, we demonstrate how simulation-based methodology can be used to examine and predict the impacts of blackouts, mitigation and recovery strategies. The major observation from the simulation experiments is that the dynamics of the power loss propagation across different regions, the blackout duration, simultaneous unavailability of supply and logistics along with the unpredictable customer behavior might become major factors that determine the blackout impact and influence selection of an appropriate recovery strategy. The outcomes of this research can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of blackouts on the SCs and viability and develop mitigation and recovery strategies. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda toward SC viability, reconfigurable SC, multi-structural SC dynamics, intertwined supply networks, and cross-structural ripple effects.</jats:p>"

With this in mind, the Russia-Ukraine war has caused an immense disruption and great supply shock in organic fertilizer and agricultural production, and food prices across the globe. The authors aimed to analyze the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on agriculture, in particular organic fertilizers and agricultural production. The research employed a systematic research method to collect data on the extent of the impact of the war on organic fertilizers and food production. The research results indicate that the war has disrupted the supply of organic fertilizers, reducing agricultural products and subsequent rise in the price of agricultural produce. The research indicates that the rising cost of fertilizers directly influences food production and supply. The war has disrupted a viable environment for agricultural and organic production and exportation from these countries, causing the rise in food prices and a threat to food security across the globe. There is a need to ensure that international trade becomes more flexible and open in fertilizers and food production and exports. There is also a need to promote policy dialogues and market scrutiny, and transparency, especially with the uncertain global food market due to the disruptions influenced by the Russia-Ukraine war. The results of the study can be used by scientists, economists and public figures to build further forecasts of the state of agriculture, as well as to build strategies to improve the economy of some countries, including Ukraine</jats:p>",

This paper is aimed at assessing the challenges and residents’ coping strategies to improve the potable water supply systems in rural areas in Vhembe District Municipality (VDM). Data for this paper was collected from households, councillors, traditional leaders and municipal officials through questionnaires, interviews and focus-group discussions. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used and thematic content analysis and descriptive statistics were used to analyse data. The results showed that the main sources of water are ground water from boreholes which are used by about 45.3% of the communities, followed by tap water from the dams, by 35.3%, then rivers by 4.0%, fountains by 5.4% and water tankers by 10.0%. Among the identified challenges are: aged water infrastructure, system breakdowns, lack of funding, vandalism of infrastructure and lack of maintenance, operation of infrastructure by unskilled technicians, theft, and non-payment of water services, among others. To cope with water supply challenges, the study recommended that communities play active role in water projects which would include paying of water supply service for its sustainability. They should also play active roles in water committees that will manage, operate and maintain the water supply with the assistance of VDM officials. It was concluded that the rural water supply situation can be improved when communities, government and other relevant stakeholders cooperate and provide solutions and resources.</jats:p>"

As a result of accumulation, a main region of accumulated heat is created, which is limited by the outer contour of the \"bush\", of a certain volume and with a certain temperature, as well as a buffer sub-region of a certain volume, which touches the main one and is the result of thermal interaction of the volume of the main region with the surrounding soil mass, which has constant temperature. The smallest dimensions of the buffer subregion will be in the case of a uniform temperature distribution over the main volume. This is achieved by organizing the same heat load that falls on each heat exchanger, the same potential of the intermediate heat carrier and a small difference in its temperatures, respectively, at the inlet and outlet of each heat exchanger, and a number of other requirements. The dimensions of the buffer subregion can be reduced by creating an upper heat shield. This will lead to a reduction in the dimensions of the entire structure and there will be no need for thermal insulation of pipelines that supply and discharge the coolant in the middle of the heat accumulator. In this case, the dimensions of the structure must be optimal, i.e. meet a certain criterion, in which the ratio of the volume of the buffer subregion to the volume of the entire heat accumulator is minimal. An improved method of structural-parametric optimization of ground heat accumulators in the process of analyzing their functioning is presented. The optimal ratios of the dimensions of these accumulators with an upper heat-insulating shield (or without it) and a developed technique are determined that allow finding the number of heat exchangers, their parameter and the distance between them to ensure minimal costs for building an accumulator.</jats:p>"

To reduce the microbial load in the technical water supply system, a series of experiments was carried out to select a biocide. Several variants of disinfectants of various groups were tested, namely: oxidizing ones (chloramine (a chlorine derivative of ammonia), hydrogen peroxide) and non-oxidizing ones (polymeric derivatives of polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG) produced by JSC NPK Mediana-filter and polyazolidine ammonium ionohydrate (PAG-M) produced by LLC “Constanta”). The polymeric compounds were found to be more effective than the chlorine-based disinfectants.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Geriatric patients are the most frequent visitors to the pharmacy, which makes it necessary to analyze their needs, in particular, assortment analysis of home first aid kits. The aim of the study was to conduct a combined ABC-OTS analysis of the range of medicines (M) in the home first-aid kits of geriatric patients to identify the most expensive groups allowed to leave pharmacies without a doctor’s prescription. Materials and methods: The objects of the study were home first aid kits of geriatric patients over 65 years old (106); instructions for the medical use of medicines; data on prices for medicines from the reference service “003” of the State Unitary Enterprise “Medical Equipment and Pharmacy of Tatarstan”. The method of combined ABC/OTS analysis is used in the work. Statistical processing of the obtained results was performed using MicrosoftOfficeExcel 2010. Results. A combined ABC/OTC analysis of home first aid kits of geriatric patients was carried out. The OTC analysis revealed the pre- dominance of over-the-counter drugs in the home medicine cabinets of the elderly (59.93%). As part of the ABC analysis, group A (79.90%) included 198 names of M, group B (15.05%) - 146 names, group C (5.05%) - 157 names. The most expensive drugs according to the ATC classification in all three groups were the groups “Drugs for the treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system” and “Digestive tract and metabolism”. In the groups, M was determined by the frequency of occurrence in first aid kits: group A – parac- etamol (25.25%), pancreatin (24.24%), ibuprofen (21.72%), acetylsalicylic acid (17.17%), group B – hydrogen peroxide (11.11%), iodine (8.59%), loperamide (8.22%), ibuprofen (1.37%), group C – motherwort tincture (4.46%), marshmallow medicinal herb ex- tract (3.82%), loratadine (3.18%), chlorhexidine (3.18%). The average cost of M by ABC analysis groups indicates a higher cost of M of group A (525.96 rubles), in comparison with groups B (143.15 rubles) and C (46.77 rubles). Conclusion. As a result of the combined ABC/OTC analysis of the range of drugs in the home first aid kits of geriatric patients, the predominance of OTC drugs was revealed (59.93%). The distribution of medicines in the most expensive group A is: medicines sold to the population from pharmacies by prescription - 44.95% of items (the share of costs is 42.15%, the average cost of 1 package is 527.43 rubles), OTC drugs - 55.05% (the share of costs is 57.85%, the average cost of 1 package is 491.73 rubles). Group A is dominat- ed by M ATX-groups “Drugs for the treatment of diseases of the cardiovascular system”, “Digestive tract and metabolism” In groups B and C, OTC drugs predominate both in terms of the number of names (62.33% and 63.69%, respectively) and in terms of costs (61.57% and 63.48%, respectively). In group B, the cost of M is comparable: 143.15 rubles - dispensed from pharmacies by pre- scription and 143.01 rubles - OTC drugs. In group C, the average package price is higher for prescription drugs: 47.04 rubles compared with 45.93 rubles in the case of OTC drugs. The most expensive OTC drugs in home medicine cabinets according to the ATX classification belong to the groups “Other nonsteroi- dal anti-inflammatory drugs”, “Bioflavonoids”, “Other immunostimulants”, “Other drugs for the treatment of diseases of the muscu- loskeletal system”, “Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs”, “Combination of drugs for the treatment of liver and biliary tract diseases”. The predominance of OTC drugs in home first-aid kits, both in terms of the number of names and the financial costs of their acquisi- tion, indicates an increasing role of pharmaceutical workers in the rational pharmacotherapy of geriatric patients.</jats:p>",

The results show that the water quality of the ten lakes has improved significantly after pollution control, with an improvement rate of more than 70%. Pollution interception and management are particularly successful for improving lake water quality in rural lakes. The replenishment of water from the backbone river to the lakes could enhance the fluidity of the rural lakes but cannot eliminate the total phosphorus (TP) risk. Therefore, in the relatively closed water bodies of rural lakes in the shallow hilly water network area, pollution intercept and control is key to controlling TP, and taking measures such as increasing lake hydrodynamic conditions in summer will be a more efficient approach to improve rural lake water quality.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a new systematic approach for selecting and computing SDHI for monitoring drought risk for human water supply from surface water and for river ecosystems that is also relevant for meteorological or soil moisture drought. We rec-ommend considering the habituation of people and ecosystems to the streamflow regime (e.g., a certain interannual variability or relative reduction of streamflow) when selecting indicators. Distinguishing four indicator types, we classify indicators of drought magnitude (water deficit during a pre-defined period) and severity (cumulated magnitude since onset of the drought event). We quantify eight existing and three new SDHI globally using the global hydrological model WaterGAP2.2d. We recommend streamflow hazard indicators that should be included in large-scale DEWS as they are suitable for risk systems that are differently adapted to low water availability and characterized by either perennial or intermittent streamflow regime and the existence or not of large reservoirs. Drought magnitude is best quantified by return period or relative deviation from mean, and severity by return period or water volume below a threshold relative to mean annual streamflow. Both anomaly and deficit indicators should be provided.\n                        </jats:p>"

The aim of this paper is to investigate and analyse how stakeholder influences and risks may impact the sustainability of supply chains (SCs). Social, environmental, and economic concerns are addressed by a company's engagement with different players in the supply chain. Respectively, companies become more vulnerable from exposure in their SCs and need to balance the pressures from stakeholders and sustainable practices to develop suitable risk mitigation practices.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The authors use a qualitative approach by means of a systematic literature review to examine the empirical data on the way managing stakeholder influences and risks impacts sustainability for supply chains (SCs) from dependable databases: Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Findings</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The findings of the analysis show that knowledge management, collaboration, and top management commitment is a prerequisite for effectively managing various stakeholder influences and risks for sustainable supply chains.

When it comes to the business process organization for payment acceptance, energy retail companies need to take into account the conditions and factors that set the long-term trend in this area: changes in legislation, the strength of market competition and the trends of the payment acceptance market infrastructure, the ongoing coronavirus infection pandemic, and the ongoing technological change. Management decision-making should be based on the principles of economic feasibility and efficiency in conjunction with legal requirement compliance. Power supply companies need to use the conditions and factors highlighted in the study to build up competitive advantages in the field of payment acceptance organization, to maintain and develop their market position, which can only be done through an adaptation policy in this area. For the purpose of economic efficiency increase concerning organization payment acceptance business process, energy sales companies need to plan the indicators of the payment acceptance system, implement measures for their implementation (achieve target values), carry out the analysis of the achieved results and their reflection, which will ensure timely and reasonable acceptance of management decisions.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the flow of the waste supply chain and simulate it to determine the performance of waste handling in an area. The research method begins with a supply chain questionnaire which will then be statistically tested to be used as input for supply chain flow generation and simulation using Arena software. Based on the identification of the supply chain, the flow of the waste supply chain in the Wonosari area of Semarang is from households to the garbage dump to be taken to the landfill as far as 10 km. From the landfill, it is further processed into a selling value product. In this study, waste from the landfill is also the input material for the paving block production workshop (WPBP FT) at the Faculty of Engineering, Dian Nuswantoro University. Plastic waste will be used as a mixed material for making paving blocks. The supply chain simulation results using Arena show that the performance is good.</jats:p>"

The issue of human rights in business is gaining importance both in the context of legal regulations and the approach of enterprises. Nevertheless, human rights in supply chains pose many challenges. This issue should be particularly important to companies that have decided to implement social responsibility. Two crucial research questions were asked. First, to what extent do socially responsible companies pay attention to human rights issues in supply chains? Second, if human rights issues are managed in supply chains, how is this done? The main results show that this issue is considered, but it is difficult to unequivocally assess to what extent the subject of human rights is treated strategically as an element of a business case and how far it results from the current need to be adjusted to the present societal expectations. This article outlines the general overview of the situation.</jats:p>",

The Administration created it to help achieve efficiency and provide people with services that meet their needs, also known as e-government. In addition, it leads to an increase in participation in the equity of the distribution of social benefits. This research examines the essential aspects that influence a community’s perception of E-Government Continuance Intentions Toward E-Services. A questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale was issued to 1,000 community water consumers, and the researcher received 627 valid responses. Data were collected using a simple random sampling technique with a sampling ratio of 14 villages. Subsequently, descriptive statistics characterize the data (frequency distributions, percentages, averages, medians, and standard deviation). Furthermore, PLS-SEM was utilized to study the interactions between variables and launch the conceptual model via partial least squares (PLS) path modeling. This research demonstrates that digital technologies are critical to boosting community expectations and satisfaction with e-Services. Numerous factors contribute to its growth. Moreover, this paper presents an excellent case study approach based on expectation confirmation theory for examining people’s community participation behaviors regarding e-services. In addition, community water consumers participate in electronic services by confirming their expectations with satisfaction.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the innovation of talent training mode needs to become an important goal of college development at this stage. Based on the previously mentioned background, this paper included 853 university students as research objects and their data from 2010 to 2018. First, we used the BP neural network as the starting point to conduct in-depth research, selected the sequential model algorithm based on the Keras framework, built a one-layer network and six types of eigenvalue labels to predict the development direction of college students’ employment and entrepreneurship, and evaluated the prediction accuracy of the model. This proves that the prediction effect of the model has the value of continuing in-depth research, and then, the prediction model is further optimized. Then, we added a three-layer network to the model and an SGD optimizer and used Softmax as the regression function to verify that the optimized model predicts well. The average accuracy of the prediction model constructed in this paper is 81.48%, the standard deviation is 4.34%, the Acc value of the model is stable at around 0.835, and the loss value is stable at around 0.3, which proves that the prediction model has a good prediction. It provides a set of application models that can be used for reference for the combination of BP neural network related knowledge and college students’ employment and entrepreneurship development direction prediction. Based on the background of the supply-side structural reform, this paper mainly analyzes and researches the current employment and entrepreneurial paths of college students in my country, hoping to provide reference for the cultivation of talents in colleges and universities.</jats:p>",

Blockchain technology is an effective method to solve the problem of information silos. Based on differential game theory, this paper constructs a game model of supply-chain financial information-sharing behavior based on blockchain technology. Three scenarios of independent decision, the cost-subsidy mechanism of financial institutions, and dealers and collaborative decisions are studied, and the theoretical model is verified through a simulation algorithm. The results show that information sharing in supply-chain finance based on blockchain technology is much higher than that of traditional supply-chain finance, and the use of blockchain technology can promote more sustainable development of supply chains. Blockchain technology can effectively solve the information-silo effect, and the information sharing cost-subsidy mechanism can effectively relieve the cost pressure of information sharing and optimize the supply-chain structure. In addition, the amount of information and benefits shared among the three parties of supply-chain finance based on blockchain technology and the overall benefits show an increasing and stabilized trend over time.

Counterfeit risk management is characterized by factors of Counterfeit Risk Mitigation (CRM) and Integration of Risk Management (IRM), while performance is represented by Cost Benefits (CB), Supply Chain Benefits (SCB) and overall Organizational Performance (OP). A structural equation model is tested based on the participation of 139 logistics and SC managers. For service-oriented organizations, the relationship between CRM and both CB and SCB is fully mediated by IRM. Moreover, both CB and SCB have a significant direct positive effect on OP. In the case of manufacturing-oriented organizations, while IRM fully mediates the relationship between CRM and CB, no mediation effect is found in the link between CRM and SCB. Furthermore, no relationship materializes between SCB and OP. The empirical findings of this research offer a firm-level counterfeiting framework for managerial decision-making.</p>",

A total of 72 sources of non-centralized water supply were surveyed. Water quality was assessed by physical and chemical (pH, iron total, total water hardness) and toxicological (nitrites, nitrates, and ammonium) indicators, the content of which was compared with the norms given in the State Sanitary Regulations and Standards 2.2.4-171-10 “Hygienic Requirements for Drinking Water Intended for Human Consumption.” The assessment of drinking water quality was carried out in accordance with DSTU (National Standards of Ukraine) 4808:2007 and with the water quality index (WQI). It was found that the largest deviations from the norm among toxicological indicators were observed for nitrates – 63.9%. In terms of water quality classes according to DSTU 4808:2007, drinking water from sources of non-centralized water supply of villages showed the following distribution: 2.8% of the samples belonged to class 1 (excellent water quality), 72.2% to class 2, and 25% to class 3. According to WQI, 16.7% of the examined sources of non-centralized water supply had excellent water, 63.9% had good water, and 19.4% had poor water. Despite the fact that the water from the investigated sources of non-centralized water supply was of acceptable quality, it is impotable due to the excessive nitrate content. The results obtained show that there is a need for monitoring of drinking water quality from the sources of non-centralized water supply, especially in rural settlements that are not provided with centralized water supply.</jats:p>",

In order to enable companies to make decisions that are in line with changes in the market, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to optimize deep learning neural networks. Firstly, the model parameter setting is improved, and the inertia weight strategy of normal distribution attenuation is combined. On this basis, a normal distribution decay inertial weight particle swarm optimization (NDPSO) is proposed. The inertia weight of the optimized algorithm maintains a large value in the initial stage, which makes the PSO algorithm maintain a large step size in the optimization process and a small value in the later stage. Through experimental analysis, the trend parameter of the best normal distribution of the algorithm is obtained as 0.4433 and then using the detection function, the NDPSO algorithm is tested by two types of test functions. The NDPSO algorithm is compared with the optimization results of other algorithms which are optimized on the Sphere function. The minimum value of 554.29, the average value of 2032.11, and the standard deviation of 918.47, all of them are at the leading level. Taking into account other experimental results, it is proved that the normal distribution decay inertia weight can balance the global search and local development capabilities from the perspective of parameter improvement. It can speed up the convergence with ensuring the convergence accuracy. The improved PSO algorithm has certain optimization capabilities for neural network models. The use of optimized neural network models can enable companies to make decisions in line with changes in the market and optimize the dynamic relationship network of the company's supply chain, which is of great significance to the implementation of the company's international management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article highlights the study of models and methods of supply chain management. There have been realized the need to adapt existing logistic mechanisms and create new ones in the ever-changing business environment. The overview and analytical assessment of current models, methods and concepts used in supply chain management in modern conditions is presented. Generalization of the experience of leading specialists made it possible to conditionally divide the models and methods used in logistics into the general scientific methods and special ones. Special models and methods are modeling tools that have been developed and are effectively used to solve such logistical problems as the tasks of managing logistics infrastructure facilities (object modeling) and the tasks of managing logistics flows and processes (process modeling). The optimal approach to supply chain regulation is substantiated. The Quick Response model based on immediate action when delivery dates change The advanced model for restoring the normal operation of supply chains based on the principle of taking urgent means at changing the delivery time is found the most helpful. The model is being actively implemented into the digital platforms for active tracking the status of goods and possible delays. Due to the lack of information it is proposed to use analytical methods including mathematical models, and various auxiliary tools to solve the tasks. There are investigated the prospects of applying a multimodal approach to the supply chain regulation, green logistics reengineering, models and methods of supply chain management based on the introduction of digital technologies, namely the introduction of blockchain technologies and the creation of an information platform in which the main objects of supply chains will be involved. There is considered the project of the European electronic cleaning certificate designed to reduce the time costs in searching for logistics operators. The Cargo Stream digital platform, which is an aggregator for ordering logistics services, is considered. The key features of green logistics reengineering based on the unification of the mechanism for selecting raw materials and the use of reusable containers are identified.</jats:p>",

So, identifying influential factors in water demand forecasting (WDF) for the residential sector performs a vital role in water crisis management. Nowadays, long-term macro-planning for vast geographical areas helps policymakers to achieve sustainable development goals. This study uses the same perspective to present a pattern for water consumption behavior and prediction. For this purpose, yearly residential water consumption data, along with climatic characteristics, and socioeconomic factors of rural areas of Isfahan, Iran, are aggregated. The feature selection task is conducted on the collected data using various machine learning (ML) methods along with a novel approach, forward selection based on smoothness index (FSSmI). Posterior to selecting features influencing residential water demand (WD), the raw data are analyzed using regression techniques, including multiple linear regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression. The employed methods show an improvement in the feature selection procedure and coefficient of determination as a result of implementing the FSSmI method. Based on the results, multiple linear regression and support vector regression gain 96% and 95% accuracy and less than 11% and 13% error respectively; it demonstrates the validity of forecasting methods.</jats:p>",

The standard surgical treatment for these craniofacial abnormalities is monobloc osteotomy with distraction osteogenesis. Complications of this technique include the failure of osteogenesis or resorption of the frontal bone. The authors propose an alternative surgical technique with a frontal arch in continuity with the midface segment to ensure vascularization to anterior and posterior borders of distraction. A case report of an 8-year-old female patient with Apert Syndrome is reported using our technique. Our frontal arch monobloc distraction procedure preserves blood supply to a cranial component of the monobloc segment site that becomes the anterior portion of distraction rather than with the traditional devascularized frontal bone flap. This technique modification should improve osteogenesis outcomes by preventing resorption or failure of bone formation.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

This issue is now most urgent due to various political processes and the constant decrease of the total amount of non-renewable natural resources. One of the ways to implement the issue of replacing natural gas, coal and other types of fossil fuels is the burning of waste from agriculture and the woodworking industry. But this is associated with a significant number of technical difficulties and an insufficient theoretical basis for implementation. The article presents the results of an experimental study of the fuel-air flow inside a fluidized-bed vortex furnace using a special air-distributing nozzle. A nozzle with a 15ͦ slope of the plates is used, which does not exceed 10% of the total area of ​​the free section of the chamber of the experimental setup. In the course of the experiment, the limiting conditions for the formation of a vortex flow at different amounts of fuel and different air flow rates are indicated, and the values ​​of pressure losses and flow rates are shown. So for 2.9 kg of sawdust, the maximum speed of formation of a vortex flow is 0.72 m/s, for 5.8 kg this value is 0.57 m/s. The results obtained make it possible to formulate recommendations for the improvement of existing solid fuel furnaces through the use of special nozzles to intensify combustion processes. In the future, it is planned to consider other types of solid fuel and the influence of different angles of inclination of the blades on the air distribution nozzle on the aerodynamic characteristics inside the vortex furnace. All this will make it possible to formulate recommendations for the improvement of existing solid fuel vortex furnaces.</jats:p>"

The proposed converter greatly increases the voltage level of the seawater battery and directly supplies the underwater observation vehicles. Compared with the traditional boost converter, the voltage gain of the proposed converter is more than ten times higher than it under the same duty ratio condition. Its structure is asymmetric interleaved parallel, which can enable power devices to obtain lower voltage stress and ensure that the input current ripple is low. The operating principle and homeostasis property of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail. Finally, a prototype is built.

For this purpose, a case study of Rutba City in Iraq was applied. It is planned that water demand of the city is supplied by four different pumped pipelines (Pipelines 1–4). An optimum water supply among these pipelines was determined by considering their daily incomes (water charge per m3) and expenses (electricity price of pump stations), and daily demand for the city. In order to solve this optimization problem, a heuristic optimization model using a modified clonal selection algorithm (Clonalg), a class of artificial immune aystems was improved. The algorithm was coded in Matlab programming language, and it was run ten times to test its stability. Two objective functions of total daily income and expense were simultaneously used to maximize total daily net income under the constraints of the required daily water demand of the city and pump discharge capacities. Another constraint was that total net income for ten years should finance the initial cost of the unconstructed pipeline 4. The results showed that the optimization model using the modified Clonalg is useful and feasible for determining optimum water supply in terms of the cost-benefit relationship.</jats:p>",

Supply chain finance is an effective way to improve and enhance the financing situation by easing financing constraints and reducing financing costs. As an important source of supply chain short-term financing, trade credit plays an important role in enterprise production and circulation. Taking Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2020 as samples, this paper studied the impact of trade credit on sustainable growth and its internal mechanism. Furthermore, we analyzed the moderating effect of digital finance development on the influence of trade credit on sustainable growth. It is found that receiving trade credit benefited firms’ sustainable growth. Furthermore, study found that receiving trade credit has a greater positive impact on the sustainable growth of enterprises in regions with higher levels of financial development, high-tech industries, state-owned enterprises and small enterprises. Whereas, the provision of trade credit had an obvious inhibiting effect on the sustainable growth of enterprises in the regions with low level of financial development, non-high-tech industries, private enterprises and small enterprises. The results of the influencing mechanism showed that receiving trade credit promoted firm’s sustainable growth by “agency cost reducing effect,” while providing trade credit inhibited firm’s sustainable growth by “forcing effect.” In addition, the development of digital finance weakens the positive impact of trade credit financing on enterprises’ sustainable growth but strengthens the negative impact of providing trade credit on sustainable growth. From the perspective of sustainable growth, this paper explained the role of trade credit financing in alleviating the financing dilemma of enterprises, which is urgently needed by most emerging economies pursuing high-quality development. Therefore, in order to give full play to the role of trade credit financing, the government should actively create a good credit environment. At the same time, the government should vigorously develop digital finance to enhance its ability to serve the real economy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Globally there are pressures on organizations to act responsibly in terms of the protection of the environment and create value for all stakeholders. There is a rising global interest in reverse logistics.  Product disposal may no longer be the consumer’s responsibility as products need to be recycled or remanufactured by the original manufacturer. Increased, strict environmental and packaging regulations are forcing firms to become more accountable for residual and final products, long after the product is sold and is in the hands of the customers. As a result, there is a great opportunity for researchers and academicians to advance the study of reverse logistics to solve the problem of product handling within the supply chain. This study aimed to determine the influence of reverse logistics recycling practice and the performance of large manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study used a descriptive design and the target population was large manufacturing firms that are registered with the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Pearson correlation coefficient for the output indicated that recycling practice was able to explain 31.7% variations in the firm performance. The study concluded that there is a significant positive relationship between recycling practice and firm performance.  The beta coefficient for recycling practice was 0.563. This indicates that a unit increase in recycling practice would result in 56.3% increase in manufacturing firm performance. The study recommended that recycling practices be adopted by manufacturing firms as a way of improving firm performance. The study also recommended that all manufacturing farms should adopt Recycling practices to gain material recovery and environmental improvement.</jats:p>"

It was found that sharp fluctuations in the values of microhardness in the zone of thermal influence of the welded joint exceed the baseline values in the middle part of the weld and the base metal of the pipe. The obtained results can be used to test the performance of carbon steel steels designed for the construction of water towers of long service life in corrosive environments. Under the action of the temperature gradient on the outer surfaces of the walls of the water tank tensile stresses occur, and on the inner surfaces-compressive, which is a favorable factor that reduces the risk of corrosion. Temperature stresses that occur in the case of temperature inhomogeneity along the contour of the cylindrical tank are unfavorable. Stresses from the weight load are small and do not have a significant effect on the destruction of the steel tank, because they are compressive. The value of technological final stresses was determined experimentally by mechanical strain gauge according to the classical method, as well as with the help of electric strain gauges and ultrasonic method according to the method of E. O. Paton Electric Welding Institute (PWI). It has been experimentally established that the most dangerous final welding stresses in assembly seams, the value of which for the longitudinal stress component is close to or exceeds the yield strength , and for the transverse – close to the yield strength , while on steel plates VSt3 of the same thickness . It is likely that welding during installation in conditions of rigid compression of the metal causes an increased level of final stresses. The magnitude and sign of the final stresses  significantly depends on the method of installation. Even during block installation, when the water tower is mounted from several pre-annealed blocks, the connection between the mounting ring seams in some areas of the base metal near these seams during fitting creates significant stresses (up to 17.6 kgf / mm2), in some areas – up to 6 kgf / mm2. When sheet assembly stresses can reach a level close to the yield strength.</jats:p>"

Using three case studies of publicly-available information on Australia’s red meat industry, we identify the process of digitally enhanced value creation according to four themes: (1) supply chain operability; (2) product quality; (3) animal welfare; and (4) innovation and learning. We find reasons for both optimism and pessimism concerning the adoption of digital agriculture. While digital technology is being offered by various stakeholders to support collaboration within supply chains, it is also being met with scepticism amongst some producers who are not actively engaging with a digital transformation. We identify that the ‘technology fallacy’, which proposes that organisations, people, learning and processes are as important to digital transformation as the technology itself; but while digital technologies enable change, it is the people who determine how quickly it can occur. We argue that – since quality appears to be the major basis on which Australian red meat producers will compete in global markets – the broad adoption of digital technology will prove increasingly essential to future growth and sustainability of this supply chain.</jats:p>"

This paper first uses the capacity coefficient index (CCI) to represent the power generation ability of different technologies and proposes a forecasting method for the CCI of renewable energy generation. In this paper, a two-layer optimization model considering multiple constraints is established and solved using the MPC method. The results show that China’s installed capacity of renewable power could account for more than 50% in 2030, while the carbon emissions will decrease after reaching a peak in 2023.

This study explored trends in rebates for GLDs from 2010-17. We defined total payments as the retail amount the pharmacy received, including two components:1) rebates, the estimated proportion of the total payments retroactively passed through to pharmacy benefit managers and the payers; and2) net payments, the net spending for the GLDs. We used data from the 2010-17 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to estimate the total payments including out-of-pocket payments, and data from the SSR Health and Medicaid programs to estimate the net payments and rebates. Four high-cost GLDs were included in this study: basal insulin, bolus insulin, GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RA) , and SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) . Costs were adjusted to 2017 U.S. dollars. While the total payments for a 30-day supply of bolus insulin, basal insulin and GLP-1RA increased by almost 200% from 20 to 2017, the rebates increased by more than 300%, attenuating the increase in net payments. By 2016-17, rebates accounted for 59%, 54%, 37%, and 49% of total payments for bolus insulin, basal insulin, GLP-1RA, and SGLT2i, respectively (Figure 1) .

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the evolution of the Internet and the introduction of third-party platforms, a diversified supply chain has gradually emerged. In contrast to the traditional single sales channel, companies can also increase their revenue by selling through multiple channels, such as dual-channel sales: adding a sales channel for direct sales through online third-party platforms. However, due to the complexity of the supply chain structure, previous studies have rarely discussed and analyzed the capital-constrained dual-channel supply chain model, which is more relevant to the actual situation. To solve more complex and realistic supply chain decision problems, this paper uses the concept of game theory to describe the pricing negotiation procedures among the capital-constrained manufacturers and other parties in the dual-channel supply chain by applying the Stackelberg game theory to describe the supply chain structure as a hierarchical multi-level mathematical model to solve the optimal pricing strategy for different financing options to achieve the common benefit of the supply chain. In this study, we propose a Multi-level Improved Simplified Swarm Optimization (MLiSSO) method, which uses the improved, simplified swarm optimization (iSSO) for the Multi-level Programming Problem (MLPP). It is applied to this pricing strategy model of the supply chain and experiments with three related MLPPs in the past studies to verify the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the MLiSSO algorithm is effective, qualitative, and stable and can be used to solve the pricing strategy problem for supply chain models; furthermore, the algorithm can also be applied to other MLPPs.</jats:p>"

Multi-stage sampling procedure was used to obtain data from 39 turkey farmers and 95 consumers. Data were analyzed with the aid of descriptive statistics and two stage least squares model. The results of the descriptive statistics showed that majority of the turkey producers were male, married with an average age of 39 years. They operate on a small scale of production with an average of 73.21 flock size and have an average of 5.31 years of farming experience. The results also revealed that majority of the turkey consumers were married with a mean age of 41years and have formal education. The two stage least squares estimates showed that the significant determinants of supply of turkey meat are flock size, diseases outbreak, return on investment, educational level and cost of production. On the other hand, significant determinants of demand of turkey meat are income and educational status.  It is therefore recommend that farmers should be sensitized on good management practices to prevent and control diseases by making available extension and veterinary services in order to increase turkey meat supply. Also, consumers should be sensitized on the nutritional benefits of poultry meat through advertisement. This will in turn help consumers in meeting the FAO recommendation for daily animal protein intake</jats:p>"

However, in Brassica napus, which is a highly S-demanding species, the Si effect on S deficiency remains undocumented. The aim of this study was to assess whether Si alleviates the negative effects of S deficiency on Brassica napus and modulates root sulfate uptake capacity and S accumulation. For this, Brassica napus plants were cultivated with or without S and supplied or not supplied with Si. The effects of Si on S content, growth, expression of sulfate transporter genes (BnaSultr1.1; BnaSultr1.2) and sulfate transporters activity in roots were monitored. Si supply did not mitigate growth or S status alterations due to S deprivation but moderated the expression of BnaSultr1.1 in S-deprived plants without affecting the activity of root sulfate transporters. The effects of Si on the amount of S taken-up and on S transporter gene expression were also evaluated after 72 h of S resupply. In S-deprived plants, S re-feeding led to a strong decrease in the expression of both S transporter genes as expected, except in Si-treated plants where BnaSultr1.1 expression was maintained over time. This result is discussed in relation to the similar amount of S accumulated regardless of the Si treatment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>BACKGROUND: Public hospital managers in Rio de Janeiro must deal with severe budget costs, which is the only source of income of public hospitals. In this sense, systematic supply chain risk management can contribute to identifying such risks, assessing their severity, and developing mitigating plans, or even revealing the lack of such plans. Private hospital networks must also map their risks since they are facing a diminishing of demand given that unemployment in Brazil, which is growing in the past years, generates an impossibility of affording private healthcare. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how supply chain risk management is being applied in healthcare supply chains from Rio de Janeiro – Brazil. This study considers supply chains located in the state of Rio de Janeiro. To accomplish this objective, we provide answers to two Research Questions: RQ1 - Is SCRM known as a concept among Rio de Janeiro healthcare supply chains? RQ2 - How are risk identification, risk assessment, and risk mitigation being implemented by companies from the healthcare supply chains in Rio de Janeiro – Brazil? METHOD: Our research design is based on four steps: i) Research design; ii) Case selection: iii) Data collection (11 cases selected); iv) Data analysis. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that SCRM is an entirely unknown concept among healthcare supply chains from Rio de Janeiro – Brazil. Managers have empirical knowledge of the risks, and they can identify the most hazardous risks and can come up with solutions to mitigate them, nevertheless, in many situations they do not have the authority or the manpower to implement the solutions, at most, managers implement local risk mitigation initiatives that do not consider the supply chains broader context. CONCLUSION: The healthcare organizations studied by this paper do not apply SCRM. They only apply local isolated solutions not considering a supply chain scope. This can become hazardous since isolated risk mitigation initiatives are often innocuous and have the potential to generate other risks.</jats:p>",

Authenticated human or robotic Internet of Things (IoT) actors digitally sign and cryptographically commit to the veracity of real-world events on an immutable database, without having to take responsibility for their aggregate consequences. User-specifiable interpretations, corresponding to queries and analytical functions in database systems, provide auditable aggregate information computed from recorded events across the entire SCN. This includes fine-grained and trustworthy tracing of final products through multiple stages of production processes, semi-finished products, quality certifications and transportation all the way back to their raw materials. We present a case study for an end-to-end coffee supply chain that tracks fine-grained and detailed information from a farmer’s coffee cherries to retail coffee bags, involving all its actors. Our model handles product provenance; auditable sustainability, quality and trade information; production processes from parchment via green to roasted coffee; product quality tests; farmer certifications; and transportation across the entire coffee supply chain. It is based on field work involving farmers, cooperatives, processors, traders, importers, and a major roasting company stretching from Colombia to Scandinavia. Its REALISTIC-based modeling is the foundation for the design of our prototype implementation, which includes Ethereum blockchain code, RDBMS-based server code and a web app client.

SWGN handles a vast amount of data that is collected by IoT devices from different points related to water supply and quality. The data is processed in a distributed way by a number of fog servers that are located at the edge of the network. The fog controllers are deployed at the fog layer in order to take action locally for frequent events. The cloud layer has a cloud controller to take actions globally for infrequent events. The LoRaWAN provides communication technology that allows devices to operate regularly. The SDN technology decouples network traffic to control data routing decisions efficiently. A primitive evaluation under the Mininet emulator, focusing on SDN, shows the feasibility and efficiency of the architecture.</jats:p>"

The issues of formation and transformation of food chains are currently one of the most discussed and studied by foreign and domestic scientists. It is substantiated that the share of direct producers of beef and pork has a negative dynamics of reduction and ﬂuctuates within 30-40% in the fnal price formation. The share of producers in the retail price of poultry meat is much higher (47.1-59.5%) due to vertical integration and a closed production cycle. It is proved that the inconsistency of economic relations between the participants of the \"production - processing - trade - the meat market consumer\" chain aﬀects both the supply of meat processing plants with raw materials and the formation of prices that would satisfy all the participants and results in unsatisfactory price situation for meat. Generalization of theoretical, methodological and practical principles of the \"production-processing-trade-consumption\" food chain, analysis and evaluation of the role of each of the links and studying the international experience gives grounds for identifying a number of areas in regulation of the relations and predetermine the increase the producer share in the chain through concluding fair and eﬀective agreements between meat market participants; creation of agricultural service cooperatives and other associations of producers; establishment and running a network of wholesale markets for agricultural products; support for the creation and development of short supply chains; development of innovative logistics approaches and methods based on modern digital technologies. It is established that the relations between the participants of the chain \"production-processing-trademeat market consumption\" should be based on the principles of trust, justice, mutual respect, corporate social responsibility. It is substantiated that changes in consumer demands for food, including meat, increased competition, changes in government regulation, technological advances, increased emphasis on efficiency and sustainability, food safety aﬀect changes in business and competitiveness strategies, which ultimately cause transformations in food chains in the form of new and innovative logistics approaches and methods.\nKey words: meat market, food chain, price, relationship settlement, innovative logistics approaches.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted to analyze growth rates and financial profitability of supply chain actors of Large Cardamom based on a sample survey of randomly selected 90 farmers, 10 input suppliers, and 15 traders. Secondary data of area and production were obtained from Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development whereas price information was acquired from the Federation of Large Cardamom Entreprenuers of Nepal. The area, production and productivity of  Large Cardamom in Ilam district was found in decreasing trend. Market data analysis showed that the price was drastically fluctuating but the compound annual growth rate was significantly increasing by 4.48%. Financial analysis indicated that the enterprise with a project life of 10 years was viable and highly profitable with benefit cost ratio of 3.14, payback period 4.09 years, internal rate of return 81.4%, and net present value of NPR 3.58 million per hectare. Four major supply chain actors were involved. The profit margin was found the highest for the producers (45.68%) followed by regional level traders (28.42%), district level traders (16.36%) and least for the village level traders (9.54%). Traditional driers were still used for curing the capsules with a compromise to the quality of the product. The producers were not found doing value addition activities, whereas tail removing, grading, and packaging were done by regional level traders. Training the farmers on value addition and providing them market information can help to scale up large cardamom production enterprises.</jats:p>",

Research on the study and improvement of certain problems of ensuring the quality of medicines (MP) in medical and pharmaceutical organizations (MO and FD) has been carried out in recent years by many specialists (Loskutova E.E., Maksimkina E.A., Yagudina R.I., Bagirova V.L., Telnova E.A., Bidarova F.N. and others). The use in practice of the previously mentioned works contributed to the achievement of modern results in matters of drug provision of the population. However, studies to improve the system of drug supply within the framework of the activities of MO (outpatient and inpatient levels) that have a license to sell pharmaceutical products have not been carried out. Given the great importance and social significance of the problem of ensuring the quality of medicines in MO, further research is needed to identify reserves for improving the processes of drug supply in MO with the right to implement them. This article discusses the causes of the problems of drug provision of the population in rural areas, remote and hard-to-reach areas and raises issues of insufficient efficiency of MO in the study region. Shortcomings in the work of the indicated medical organizations are identified, requiring the adoption of specific steps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their activities. The priority of the direction of the state policy on drug provision of citizens of remote settlements with high-quality, effective and affordable drugs should give a long-awaited result. Improving the management structure of drug quality assurance in medical organizations requires the creation of a unified methodological framework. On the basis of structural and system methods of analysis, criteria for evaluating the practical and economic activities of these MOs were formed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Demand management concerns what customers need and want, while supply management focuses on producing products/services to fulfill demand. It is challenging in coordinating demand and supply from both sides. Multi-method modeling, which is an interesting combination between system dynamics and agent-based models, is adapted to address this issue through the Bass diffusion model to replicate a non-competitive supply chain, including a retailer, a wholesaler, and a factory in this study. The research findings show that there is a bullwhip effect on the supply chain due to sudden changes in demand impacted by marketing efforts, namely advertising, words of mouth, and electronic words of mouth. It is recommended that in the process of sales and operations planning, businesses should implement, measure, and estimate marketing effectiveness corresponding with supply capabilities. Additionally, through the study, the strengths and weaknesses of the multi-method simulation in facilitating business research reflect through multiple scenarios running with cost and time efficiency, as well as the validity of the study findings associated with modelers’ decisions on the model’s level of simplicity and elaboration.</jats:p>"

The monthly average capacity factors oscillate between 71 and 100%, with an average of 87.5%. Thanks to an electric heater for the heat storage fluid, the system can accept excess electricity from the grid to compensate for the loss of the solar energy collected every other month versus the solar energy collected during the best summer month, to operate at rated power 24 h a day in every day of the year. In this case, the capacity factor can reach 100% every month. By further increasing the size of the thermal energy storage and the power of the engine, the electric thermal energy storage capability of the system can be enhanced, increasing the amount of electricity otherwise wasted that could be collected from the grid to be then returned when needed.</jats:p>",

The analysis of foreign and Russian experience in the organization of heat supply in municipalities is presented; the main peculiarities, namely, the predominance of individual heat supply in the private sector and the availability of central heating systems in large cities are reflected.\nThe peculiarities of municipal management of the heat supply in rural areas were studied on the example of the Sukhobuzimsky district in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. The analysis revealed that engineering heat supply systems — boiler houses and heating networks, are poorly developed in the studied area. The basic equipment of most boiler houses is morally and physically outdated. There is a change of resource-supplying and heating network organizations.\nThe authors propose some aspects for improving the management process in this area. Using the method of economically justified expenses (costs) to calculate the tariff is one of the ways to reduce the burden on the budget of the municipal district. Based on this method, the authors calculated the tariffs for thermal energy (power) released from a source of thermal energy for a heat supply organization.\nThe role of the municipality in the management of heat supply in modern conditions is becoming decisive. The key element in the municipal management of this area is the municipal program of the district, which is aimed at providing the population of the district with high-quality housing and communal services in the conditions of the development of market relations in the industry and limited growth of payment for housing and communal services, as well as at forming the integrity and effective management system for energy conservation and energy efficiency.</jats:p>"

In this regard, this research explores the joint implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT) in supply chains for extending operations performance boundaries and fostering sustainable development and data monetisation. Specifically, this study empirically studied the tuna fish supply chain in Thailand to identify respective end-to-end operations, observe material and data-handling processes, and envision the implementation of AI and BCT. Therefore, we first mapped the business processes and the system-level interactions to understand the governing material, data, and information flows that could be facilitated through the combined implementation of AI and BCT in the respective supply chain. The mapping results illustrate the central role of AI and BCT in digital supply chains’ management, while the associated sustainability and data monetisation impact depends on the parameters and objectives set by the involved system stakeholders. Afterwards, we proposed a unified framework that captures the key data elements that need to be digitally handled in AI and BCT enabled food supply chains for driving value delivery. Overall, the empirically-driven modelling approach is anticipated to support academics and practitioners’ decision-making in studying and introducing digital interventions toward sustainability and data monetisation.</jats:p>",

The lack of waste reduction strategies affects the environment in terms of pollution and over-consumption of energy. The study is descriptive, and the SLR (Systematic literature review) approach is used to evaluate the impact of green practices on organizational performance. The green supply chain practices reduce the company's cost because green strategies eliminate valueless elements for customers and increase the price.

The building energy consumption values in heating season under 9 envelope reconstruction conditions were obtained by orthogonal experiments, and 4 different energy supply systems were designed for buildings under 9 envelope reconstruction conditions. The “with or without comparison method” is used to evaluate the building energy efficiency of 40 working conditions after the superposition of the initial state and passive transformation of existing buildings in the whole life cycle. The evaluation results show that the external wall insulation and extrusion plate thickness is 80 mm, the roof insulation and extrusion plate thickness is 100 mm, and the glass type is ordinary hollow glass ( 6 + 9 + 6 ). The air source heat pump assisted energy supply effect is the best, but the overall economy will change with the initial investment, local electricity price policy and building scale.</jats:p>",

Therefore, supply chain financing has achieved rapid growth in a short period of time in China. This paper aims to study how to analyze and study the collaborative development of supply chain finance based on system dynamics. This paper puts forward the problem of system operation optimization, which is based on system dynamics, then elaborates on the concepts of SD and SCF, and designs and analyzes a case of a supply chain financial system based on system dynamics. The experimental results show that increasing the “bank input” from 0.1 to 2 can bring considerable economic benefits in the long run. As far as the simulation results are concerned, the promotion effect on the supply chain is the most significant. The output value of the supply chain can be increased from 2,963.04 billion yuan to 4,211.73 billion yuan, an increase of 42.14%. The simulation results showed that the financial industry has a significant positive effect on the factor of supply chain support, which provides evidence support for further guiding practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main issues with drug safety in the counterfeit medicine supply chain, are to do with how the drugs are initially manufactured. The traceability of right and active pharmaceutical ingredients during actual manufacture is a difficult process, so detecting drugs that do not contain the intended active ingredients can ultimately lead to end consumer patient harm or even death. Block chain’s advanced features make it capable of providing a basis for complete traceability of drugs, from manufacturer to end consumer, and the ability to identify counterfeit-drug. This paper aims to address the issue of drug safety using Block chain and encrypted QR(quick response) code security. Manufacturer generates an encrypted QR (quick response) code for the details and attaches the transaction to the block chain system. If any participants want details of drugs, then public key must be shared by that participant to the manufacturer. Manufacturer will encrypt the QR code and will send back to the participant. The QR code will be decrypted by the valid participant by their private key.</jats:p>"

Like its other components, the construction supply chain (CSC) involves multiple stakeholders requiring varying levels of information sharing. In addition, the intensity and diversity of information in CSCs require dexterous management. Studies reveal that information complexity can be reduced using collaborative technologies (CTs). However, the barriers to information management (IM) hinder the CTs’ adoption process and cause complexity in CSCs. This research identifies barriers to IM and factors affecting the adoption of CTs in developing countries. In order to understand and address complexity, the system dynamics (SD) approach is adopted in this study. The aim is to investigate if SD can reduce information complexity using CTs. Causal loop diagrams (CLDs) were developed to understand the relationship between the IM barriers and CT adoption factors. The SD model, when simulated, highlighted three main components, i.e., complexity, top management support, and trust and cooperation, among others, as factors affecting the adoption of CTs. Addressing these factors will reduce information complexity and result in better IM in construction projects.</jats:p>"

The Stackelberg game theory is used to analyze the optimal decision of the supply chain under the three methods of government subsidy, the influence of the correlation coefficient on optimal decision-making is discussed, and the effects of different government subsidy methods on the equilibrium solutions are compared and analyzed. Finally, the results are verified and illustrated by example analysis. The study found that the government subsidy reduces the sales volume of common products but increases the sales volume of low-carbon products, the emission reduction of unit low-carbon products, total emission reductions, and manufacturer’s profit. The unit emission reduction and total emission reductions are the highest when the government subsidies are according to the R&amp;amp;D cost, and the manufacturer’s profit is the highest when the government subsidies are according to the production volume of low-carbon products. Total emission reduction and supply members’ profit have a positive relationship with the subsidy coefficient and the sensitivity of consumers toward price difference and have a negative relationship with the R&amp;amp;D cost coefficient.</jats:p>"

For most of the cases, the basic correlation technique proved to be insufficient to measure the time lag with the required confidence. We implemented a wavelet cross-correlation algorithm for time lag estimation. At least in five cases out of nine, it managed to estimate time lag accurately. In three of the remaining cases, it failed. Unfortunately, due to a lack of information on field studies when records were produced, we are not able to investigate the reason of failures.

Soon international and especially national governmental regulations will increase recommendations for maritime shipping in Europe and worldwide.

Green fuels allow to reduce those emissions. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) create the Maritime Pollution contract (MARPOL). The MARPOL Annex VI gives the possibility to de ne strictly controlled air polluting areas for SOx and NOx (Emission-Controlled Areas, ECAs or SECAs).

Collected data was analyzed using manual content analysis. The findings revealed, how each market determinant affected the demand and supply of apartments respectively during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting numerous challenges on the market participants, directing the apartment market towards a disequilibrium state. Urban living fears, demographic shifts, unemployment shocks, consumers’ financial concerns, tourism crisis along with several other factors caused demand to be dropped while approval delays, lesser investments, lack of funding, developers’ failures, market imperfection and construction delays majorly affect the supply of apartments. Although demand for apartments in some market segments showed recovery with the new normal adaptation followed by several positive market aspects, demand dropped within the rental market and upper tier remains constantly. However, supply side is worsening overtime since financial losses are lessening developers’ supplying capabilities, while the crisis within the construction sector getting more affected due to the country’s economic downturn.</jats:p>",

It is the solution to use less fuel in an aircraft and to reduce the economic cost. Because the current state of our fossil fuels makes it unlikely that we will be able to fly an aircraft in the future, hybrid technology was developed to reduce fuel consumption. In this system, the amount of fuel used for takeoff, climb, and cruise can be bypassed using electric engines. The working principle is based on the electric engines and the batteries (lithium-ion). In the present, we have seen a propulsion design that can be used without any hassles and minimizes both the cost and the amount of fuel consumed. Because the Magni650EPU electric motor was the most compatible with the project, it was chosen. The goal was to improve fuel efficiency as well as hybridization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Primary producer communities are often growth‐limited by essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The magnitude of limitation and whether N, P or both elements are limiting autotroph growth depends on the supply and ratios of these essential nutrients. Previous studies identified single, serial or co‐limitation as predominant limitation outcomes in autotroph communities by factorial nutrient additions. Little is known about potential consequences of such scenarios for herbivores and whether their growth is primarily affected by changes in autotroph quantity or nutritional quality. We grew a community of phytoplankton species differing in various food quality aspects in experimental microcosms at varying N and P concentrations resulting in three different N:P ratios. At carrying capacity, N, P, both nutrients or none were added to reveal which nutrients were limiting. The nutrient‐supplied communities were fed to the generalist herbivorous rotifer <jats:italic>Brachionus calyciflorus</jats:italic> to investigate how changing phytoplankton biomass and community composition affect herbivore abundance. We found phytoplankton being growth‐limited either by N alone (single limitation) or serially, i.e. primarily by N and secondarily by P, altering available food quantity for rotifers. Rotifer growth showed a different response pattern compared to phytoplankton, suggesting that apart from food quantity food quality aspects played a substantial role in the transfer from primary to secondary production. The combined addition of N and P to phytoplankton had generally a positive effect on herbivore growth, whereas adding non‐limiting nutrients had a rather detrimental effect probably due to stoichiometrically imbalanced food in terms of nutrient excess. Our experiment shows that adding various nutrients to primary producer communities will not always lead to increased autotroph and herbivore growth, and that differences between autotroph and herbivore responses under co‐limiting conditions can be partly well explained by concepts of ecological stoichiometry theory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Supply chains are usually faced with a considerable number of external and internal drivers of complexity. They can originate from diverse sources such as a big product variety to produce, difficulties in raw material sourcing, a vertically disintegrated production network, ever-changing customer needs, or strong regulatory requirements. Those drivers typically correlate to each other and are mutually dependent. For example, a widespread production network makes raw material sourcing a complex task. In reverse, varying raw material availability across regions determines the design of a production network that is then not necessarily trimmed on leanness. Some industry supply chains are more complex than others, meaning they are exposed to more complexity drivers than supply chains in other industries. Thai Union Europe (TUE) predominantly operates in the canned seafood industry, and the related supply chain with its multitude of complexity drivers can be considered very complex. The way TUE manages sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) in this environment is key to its market success. The company’s execution of S&amp;OP is inevitably linked to its corporate culture of collaboration and process discipline. Focus is not only on an S&amp;OP programme with best practice processes but also on achieving the necessary cultural change. The way TUE plans and manages its complex supply chain is the subject of this case study.</jats:p>"

This analysis assesses to what extent Late Antique societies managed the cities’ water supply by maintaining or transforming preexisting hydraulic networks. It considers the continuity of aqueducts and the reorganization of water networks, the state of hydraulic management and technology, and the perception of water resources. The hydraulic networks inherited from the Early Roman period were to some extent preserved, although greatly adapted to new concerns for security and new technical and environmental constraints, illustrating the resilience of Late Antique societies.</jats:p>",

For the selected electronic security system (ESS) of the airport, a graph of relations in the system in terms of reliability and operation will be developed. Subsequently, it will enable mathematical analyses to obtain a system of equations describing the system. The obtained results of the reliability and operational analysis of the selected airport ESS, taking into account electromagnetic disturbances, made it possible to estimate the probabilities of the system being in the selected states. The introduction of the factor describing the level of the impact of electromagnetic disturbances on ESS allows for estimating the effectiveness of various solutions counteracting such interactions' effects. The presented reliability and operational analysis of the selected electronic security system used to protect the airport allowed us to estimate its most important reliability and operational parameters.

Literature provided various models and frameworks to explain the concepts of supply chain resilience. However, it remains unclear how companies could quickly and temporarily repurpose their SCs and what are the required capabilities during the COVID‐19 crisis. Therefore, this study investigates the role of developing dynamic capabilities such as manufacturing, logistics, production capacity and procurement in facilitating production changeover. Based on 36 semistructured interviews conducted with multinational corporations, the study findings demonstrate four specific capabilities known as the 4Rs: retooling, repurposing, recalibrating and reconfiguring. Hence, the study provides a conceptual framework of operational resilience to understand how production changeover could be achieved. In addition, this 4Rs framework helps decision‐makers to improve SC resilience and capabilities when facing a crisis such as COVID‐19.</jats:p>",

The results of the study show that there are 32 variables that explain the causal relationship in the form of a Causal Loop Diagram of rice supply. Rice supply in North Sumatera is an accumulation of production, government rice reserves and imports. Rice consumption is assumed to only take into account consumption in North Sumatera without any exports outside the region. Positive and negative production is obtained through a combination of several factors of production. The total number of rice imports will positively increase with rice imports imported from several countries. The government’s rice reserves in Bulog come from the initial stock plus rice intake. The consumption of rice by the community will reduce the supply of rice in North Sumatera.

Building on the relationship between manufacturing strategy and the environment, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the direct impact of environmental dynamism on supply chain flexibility, and the indirect impact of achieving supply chain flexibility the environment requires through organizational ambidexterity in the Sri Lankan textile and apparel industry, an industry under increased pressure to be more flexible and the highest export revenue contributor to the economy.&#x0D;\nA positivism paradigm provided the foundation for this explanatory research.  A cross-sectional survey method was used to collect data from operations or supply chain managers across firms in the Sri Lankan textile and apparel industry. Eighty-seven responses were received and analyzed using the SmartPLS software. As a preliminary result, this study finds that there is a significant positive impact of environmental dynamism on supply chain flexibility and this relationship is partially mediated by organizational ambidexterity. Moreover, the results reveal a significant positive impact among the variables; environmental dynamism, organizational ambidexterity, and supply chain flexibility.&#x0D;\nIn the practical context, managers need to be aware of environmental changes to identify areas that require investment in flexibility as it incurs both costs and risks for a firm. Practicing organizational ambidexterity helps managers to refine existing processes to maintain competitive advantage, and achieve the optimal degree of flexibility required by the firm and its environment.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

Additionally, some methods of counteracting these phenomena were described. Next, multivariant simulation tests were carried out based on the two-dimensional field model of a synchronous machine with permanent magnets. The tests were run in order to determine the internal capacitances of the machine, on which the level of bearing voltages depends. Based on these results, the optimal variant of the design solution ensuring the limitation of the bearing voltage to a safe level was selected.

Relevance - ensuring the stability of the load schedule at the maximum consumption of electricity in the electric power system of a certain region or country is a long-term procedure that needs to be developed and improved means of its implementation. Modern systems have characteristic features, such as: an increase in the unevenness of load schedules, the need to generate power from generation facilities in each period of time, an increase in the steepness of load schedules, scaling of power plant equipment, which increases their economic feasibility of operation, reducing their maneuverability and others. Search and development of new methods and methods for compensating peak loads in the electric power system is relevant and in demand. Purpose -carry out research aimed at developing effective methods and means to improve the reliability of power supply to enterprises with continuous technological processes based on modern power storage devices. Methods - the existing electrical laws and characteristics in the field of calculating the operating modes of the functioning of ionistors are applied. Results - a modular design of an energy storage system based on ionistors has been developed, designed to compensate for peak loads in the electric power system. The possibility of using an energy storage system based on ionistors to compensate for small peak loads through field studies is substantiated. A list of necessary electrical laws has been determined in order to assess and determine the features of the functioning of the developed energy storage system.</jats:p>",

We perform a meta‐analysis of estimates of off‐farm labour supply elasticity to identify systematic factors that influence these estimates. A sample of 137 elasticities is obtained from 43 studies which use data ranging from 1960 to 2012. We examine theoretical assumptions, data availability and empirical specifications, and other study‐specific characteristics. Controlling for potential publication bias, we estimate that the elasticity is approximately 0.64 to 0.77. Results of the analysis show that estimates are affected by modelling choices controlling for self‐selection and life‐cycle elements. However, we found no compelling evidence that study‐specific characteristics of off‐farm labour supply functions, including various measurements of labour supply, explain variation in the elasticities.</jats:p>",

The objective of the research is the construction of trust by analyzing the interrelationships of the three links for their consolidation, or not of the supply chain, using the Nash equilibrium, which allows summarizing satisfaction and loyalty throughout the supply chain. The set of Nash equilibria reflects that achieving satisfaction in the interrelationships between them is the main strategy to be followed by companies seeking to promote coordination within their operations. At the same time, we observe that only one agent is sufficient to maintain the flow of materials, i.e., the problem of the free-rider arises between us.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Emissions are a major contributor to climate change. Some nations are now concentrating their efforts on lowering carbon emissions. In many nations, carbon taxes and caps are the main tools that are used to attain this goal. The majority of the inventory retailer-supplier model assumed that the retailer’s order cost should be paid to the supplier at that time when he gets their order. Few suppliers can expect to receive the entire or a portion of the total cost in advance from retailers in this real-life situation, and others will offer prepayment in numerous equal installments. The advance payment offers the customer the lowest price for the order, but it has the largest carbon footprint. The advance payment has a great impact on carbon emissions and production. Therefore, this study looked at a carbon tax and cap supply chain inventory model for deterioration with carbon emission-dependent demand, and Three payment options: Preliminary, cash, and post-payment have been considered. The model was constructed by first assessing the overall cost of supply chain participants with carbon tax regulation. Finally, we illustrate numerical examples of the proposed approach and its outcomes. The implications of adjusting the various parameters on the optimal total cost are also graphically and tabularly discussed in depth. With the help of Mathematica version-12, a sensitivity analysis was also performed. Several management takeaways are also emphasized. These findings are incredibly managerial and enlightening for enterprises seeking profitability while still fulfilling their environmental duties, and this study is extremely useful for any country’s government policy.</jats:p>",

This study aims to evaluate the impact of green supply chain strategies on organizational performance. High involvement of waste reduces the efficiency of the supply chain process, which ultimately creates an adverse impact on the performance of an organization. The lack of waste reduction strategies affects the environment in terms of pollution and over-consumption of energy. The study is descriptive, and the SLR (Systematic literature review) approach is used to evaluate the impact of green practices on organizational performance. The green supply chain practices reduce the company's cost because green strategies eliminate valueless elements for customers and increase the price. The research contributes to the field of academics and business as well. From a theoretical point of view, the desired study extends the literature for future scholars. From a business perspective, the selected research suggests strategies to reduce supply chain waste. Secondary research is used to collect the data, and results will be generated after evaluating peer-reviewed articles from authentic journals. It is concluded that green practices are the need of the present business era because businesses have to reduce waste and contribute to environmental protection to get a competitive advantage.</jats:p>",

However, the existing literature rarely explores the impact of the offline service effort strategy with the showrooming effect on the platform’s optimal sales mode. Considering a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a platform, we examine the interplay between the manufacturer’s offline service effort strategy and the platform’s online sales modes. We derive conditions under which each of the four scenarios (adopting the service effort strategy under the agency or reselling modes, not adopting the service effort strategy under the agency or reselling modes) emerges in equilibrium. Our results show that the service effort strategy with the showrooming effect can induce the platform’s sales mode selection. Specifically, when the referral fee is low and the showrooming effect is moderate, the platform may choose the agency mode instead of the reselling mode, while when the referral fee is sufficiently high and the showrooming effect is moderate, the platform may adopt the reselling mode instead of the agency mode. Furthermore, when the competition intensity and showrooming effect are sufficiently small, the service effort strategy will be beneficial to the manufacturer and the platform, creating a win-win situation. When the competition intensity or showrooming effect is sufficiently large, the service effort strategy may cause a prisoner’s dilemma for the manufacturer and the platform. In addition, the supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, an offline store and an online platform is also studied in the extension section, and we find that our main results are valid.</jats:p>"

The supply–demand algorithm (SDA) is used in this work to identify a storage system’s unknown parameters.

Furthermore, the open-circuit voltage is approximated using the resulting SOC, which is performed in a nonlinear formula, as well. When used in the dynamic nonlinear BESS model, the SDA was used to verify the fitness values and standard deviation error. Furthermore, the results that were acquired using SDA are compared to recently developed approaches, which are the gradient-based, tuna swarm, jellyfish, heap-based, and forensic-based optimizers. Simulated studies were paired with experiments for the 40 Ah Kokam Li-ion battery and the ARTEMIS driving-cycle pattern. The numerical outcomes showed that the proposed SDA is an approach which is excellent at identifying the parameters. Furthermore, when compared to the other current optimization techniques, for both the Kokam Li-ion batteries and the ARTEMIS drive-cycle pattern, the suggested SDA exhibited substantial precision.</jats:p>"

In some cases, it is extremely important that all battery cells and modules deliver the specified amount of capacity. Therefore, it is recommended to introduce a new measurement line of rapid diagnostics before deployment, in addition to the usual procedures. Using the results of rapid testing, we recommend the introduction of a hierarchical three-step diagnostics and assessment procedure. In this procedure, the key factor is the building up of a hierarchical tree-structured fuzzy signature that expresses the partial interdependence or redundancy of the uncertain descriptors obtained from the rapid tests. The fuzzy signature structure has two main important components: the tree structure itself, and the aggregations assigned to the internal nodes. The fuzzy signatures that are thus determined synthesize the results from the regular maintenance data, as well as the effects of the previous operating conditions and the actual state of the battery under examination; a signature that is established this way can be evaluated by “executing the instructions” coded into the aggregations. Based on the single fuzzy membership degree calculated for the root of the signature, an overall decision can be made concerning the general condition of the batteries.</jats:p>"

It is used to extract the objects within the interval parameters [α, β], and then interval concepts and lattice structure are built. Second, based on the interval concepts and lattice structure, the association rule mining algorithm is designed to further extract the association rules under different interval parameters. Third, to obtain the effective association degree between two objects, the rule optimization algorithm is put forward by comparing the update of rules. Finally, the association degree can indirectly reflect the substitutability between products. Then the price of a new product can be determined.

Methodology. In the course of the study, the following methods of understanding economic phenomena and processes were used to solve the problems posed in the work: system analysis, economic and mathematical modeling, abstract-logical and graphical methods.   Findings. The work identifies specific characteristics of the organization of supply of raw materials, equipment, inventory and finished products to industrial enterprises. An adaptive economic and mathematical model of optimization of material and technical supply of these enterprises is formulated. The proposed model simplifies the choice of raw material inventory management system depending on the specifics of the production process of a particular enterprise and the external conditions of its operation. The use of adaptive model is necessary in the formation of supply and demand change programs in the markets of finished products, monitoring the movement of own funds in the organization of transportation of raw materials from suppliers and redistribution of available financial resources to address the priorities of business entities.   Originality. The authors propose an adaptive economic and mathematical model for optimizing material and technical supply, which takes into account the possibility of violation of the delivery time of inventory items under the influence of force majeure, and also determines the optimal amount of raw materials for supply under certain operating conditions of a particular industrial enterprise.   Practical value. The use of the economic and mathematical model formed by the authors in the economic activity of industrial enterprises will allow the latter to timely forecast and plan their logistics costs and, as a consequence, avoid irrational spending of available financial resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we explore why users’ experiences with emerging supply chain technologies comprise inflated expectations followed by disappointment in the early stages of adoption, as per the Gartner Hype Cycle. We used “affordance theory” to study how managers perceive emerging technologies to explain their adoption experience. Affordance theory indicates that perceived benefits—and goals and constraints—depend on the interaction between technology and the users, not on the technology alone. First, we used the literature for two purposes: first, to obtain characteristics of blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) as emerging technologies; and second, to itemize generic goals, affordances, and constraints in adopting any supply chain technology. Next, we asked 400+ supply chain managers to select those affordances, constraints, and goals that they viewed as pertinent to their organizations’ supply chains for whichever of these three technologies they were implementing. Finally, we compared the responses across technologies for individual respondents (who selected more than one technology) and within the pool of respondents. We found that respondents who selected more than one technology made distinct selections individually for the different technologies relevant to them. The pooled responses across all respondents, however, prioritized the aggregated goals, affordances, and constraints in the same way, regardless of the technology, the organization, or the network features of the supply chain. Overall, it appears that the characteristics of the technology do not inform user expectations at the early stages of adoption. This initial disconnect—between characteristics and expectation—may explain the “inflated expectations” followed by the early “trough of disappointment” with emerging technologies in the Gartner Hype Cycle, as users focus on obtaining the same benefits for the supply chain from any new emerging technology. Only subsequent shared experiences can lead to the long “slope of enlightenment.” </jats:p>",

In order to determine the water quality of wells and analyze the water quality index (WQI), a set of statistical methods such as a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and TOPSIS were used. WQI is considered one of the primary methods for assessing drinking water quality. Still, due to the discrepancy between the results and the WQI (WHO), it was decided to modify the WQI method. The integrated use of FAHP-WQI and the TOPSIS method led to significant changes in the grading and the classification of water wells. The results showed that these two methods combined could be used as a good and complementary technique to eliminate ranking inconsistencies by WQI. Combining WQI results with GIS also allows for a deeper analysis of drinking water quality. The results showed that most of the water quality problems are due to wells in the northern region of the plain, and more than 41% of wells in this region are not in good condition.</jats:p>",

A gravity subsurface hole irrigation system was proposed to regulate rainfall–runoff, achieve rainwater stylization, and reduce soil erosion. Based on HYDRUS-2D/3D, a mathematical model of soil water movement under gravity subsurface hole irrigation was created. Thirty-five scenarios were designed to analyze five cumulative infiltration volumes (I) and wetting front migration distance (W), and changes under different combinations of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), infiltrating hole diameter (D), infiltrating pipe depth (B), matric potential (Ψm), and infiltration time (T). The results indicated that when Ks, D, B, and T increased, I also increased, while Ψm increased and I decreased. In addition, when I and Ψm increase, W increases. However, when D and B increase, W decreases. Ks promotes W in a vertical downward direction but inhibits W in the vertically upward and horizontal directions. The simulation results established the I estimation model and the W estimation model (power function continuous multiplication form). There was acceptable uniformity among the predicted and measured values, and its reliability was verified experimentally.</jats:p>",

With this research, we analyze how the global grain network influences country-level nourishment, while controlling for per capita land and food production. First, we model the trade network structure of the global wheat supply chain to measure the centrality or positionality of countries. We use spatial regression analysis to assess the impact of trade networks, volume, purchasing power, production capacity and geography on undernourishment. We find that the six countries most central to the global grain trade by betweenness and eigenvector centralities account for more than half of all wheat exports globally by volume. The centrality of these countries as opposed to volume of wheat produced or traded, determines their influence in the wheat supply chain network. The parametric component of our analysis confirms that trade, and centrality have significant implications for national levels of nourishment. Our findings suggest that for countries with low purchasing power, increasing centrality allows improvements in nourishment levels but for countries with very high purchasing power, increasing centrality can increase hunger outcomes. To counteract perturbations and shortfalls such as those being experienced currently in the globalized food system, local and regional governments may consider refocusing on regional and local based food systems.</jats:p>"

The optimal design factors for the artificial recharge system were derived through the constructed conceptual model, and were reflected to evaluate the individual performance of the artificial recharge and water intake system in the study area. Finally, an optimal operating scenario for the artificial recharge and water intake system was developed. The operation scenarios were composed of an appropriate injection rate and water withdrawal for each period from March, when the demand for agricultural water was low, to June, when the dry season and farming season overlapped, considering the target water withdrawal amount (30,000 tons) of the region, derived from water budget analysis.

Based on the measurements of deuterium and oxygen-18 in soil water, rainwater and groundwater in the paddy field of Chianan Plain in Southwest Taiwan in the wet season was collected, and the relationship between δD and δ18O in soil water and groundwater recharge was investigated in this study. The soil water in the paddy field of Chianan plain was collected with suction lysimeters for the identification of different sources of subsurface flow. The isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen in different water bodies were used to evaluate the groundwater recharge sources in the paddy field. The intensity of rainfall and evaporation influenced the saturation conditions of pore water present in the soil layer. In general, transiently intense rainfall tended to be difficult in recharging groundwater. The results show the use of stable isotopes in water bodies can be used to monitor or identify the source/sink of soil layer and their respective contributions to groundwater recharge. In this research, the isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen in the soil water at different depths before and after event water were identified. The top soil layer (&amp;lt;30 cm depth) in the presence of the isotope depleted soil water was probably subjected to evaporation. The soil water has more depleted isotope composition that was observed in shallow soil layers. More depleted fraction of isotopes in groundwater was similar to rainwater, which suggested that the groundwater was primarily from rainfall. In addition, the isotopic compositions of hydrogen and oxygen in groundwater slightly deviated from the local meteoric water line in southern Taiwan.</jats:p>",

The average amount of water administered for W100, W80, and W60 was 1120 m3 ha−1, 891 m3 ha−1, and 666 m3 ha−1, respectively. The water treatment at W60 negatively affected the plant growth and yield, resulting in reduced plant height, leaf number, leaf length and width, and a minor yield. Instead, fruit quality showed higher values of total soluble solids and titratable acidity. Conversely, plants watered with W80 showed results similar to the control (W100) in terms of development and yield.

Currently, the process of implementing NATO standards in the processes and procedures of logistical support of the domestic Armed Forces is underway. This applies to providing servicemen with fresh food, rich in essential substances, their maximum preservation during long-term storage and preparation before consumption.&#x0D;\nInnovative proposals of the food industry that can be implemented in the food supply of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are analyzed, recommendations are given. For cooking, it is advisable to use peeled vegetables packed in barrier films in a vacuum or with a modified gaseous environment. It is desirable to supply raw meat to consumers in the form of packaged natural semi-finished products. Peeled vegetables and meat products prepared for heat treatment will reduce the volume of refrigeration chambers for their storage, eliminate the appearance of food waste and dirty water that need to be disposed (cleaned).It is recommended to use fast-cooking cereals and cereals of high nutritional value. Such cereals will reduce the duration of the cooking process from 40–60 minutes. up to 10–15 minutes It is recommended to bake bakery products from frozen semi-finished products of a high degree of readiness. This will ensure the daily need of the staff for fresh bread, eliminate its daily supply, the threat of consumption of mold-infested products and the need for large field bakeries.&#x0D;\nIt is established that the rational organization of food of small units will be provided by semi-finished products with the maximum degree of preparation for heat treatment. Semi-finished products will reduce: labor costs of the cook; time to prepare full-fledged rations; drinking water volumes; fuels and lubricants; the part of food waste.</jats:p>"

The decline in soil productivity for agriculture can be caused by several factors, namely land conversion to a decrease in groundwater quantity. The actual pattern of providing irrigation water with the application of dielectric sensor technology is carried out in soil cultivation to create efficiency in providing irrigation water. This research was conducted using a single factor experimental method with repeated measurements on three types of land use, such as land without vegetation, soil with tomato cultivation, and soil with grass. Measurements were carried out using an automated application of soil moisture monitoring based on dielectric technology with two measuring periods. Each measuring period consists of two weeks or fourteen days. Soil sample analysis was carried out at the Bengkulu University soil laboratory. The results of the observations were analyzed using variance (ANOVA) on the 5% F test table, the LSD test was carried out at the 5% level on data that had a significant effect. The results showed that the daily irrigation water for vegetated land was lower than for tomato cultivation and without vegetation in each measurement period. The frequency of irrigation water application in the two observation periods also showed that the land without vegetation had a higher amount and frequency of water application compared to the other two types of land use. </jats:p>"

Income generated from commercial level fruit cultivations help farmers to manage their household economy. COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown, curfew, restricted movements and closure of public markets and economic centers significantly damage the fresh produce supply chains of the country, especially in key farming areas like Polonnaruwa. Present study was conducted to identify the loss hot spots of the papaya and mango supply chain during COVID-19 pandemic, measure the economic loss and find out the social consequences of it. A total sample of 75 respondents, including farmers, collectors, wholesellers, transporters, and retailers randomly selected from three Divisional Secretariats (Madirigiriya, Hingurakgoda, Thamankaduwa) of Polonnaruwa District. Data were analysis by using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Primary data were gathered through a field survey using a structured questionnaire, focus group interviews, in-depth interviews, and participatory observations. Both banana and mango supply chains were shorter, fragile and concentrated regionally. Regional public markets and dedicated economic centers were connecting regional supply chains into national level. Mango supply chains showed two different structures; most common one has similar structure of banana and the other type ended up with exporters. Closure of market operations crippled the regional supply chains and farmers unable to sell their products. Postharvest losses were high at farm gate, farmers hardly receive any income. Limited number of farmers was able to sell fruits to mobile vendors at very low prices. Some had to throw their rotting crops into piles of rubbish with miserable, which could not be sold because of restrictions on circulation. In addition to that collapse of the tourism industry, the majority of wholesale buyers reduced average purchases and tried to get the harvest from farmers at a lower price. New retail formats were born during the pandemic and most common were the mobile retailers. Household economies of the farmers faced severe financial crisis and issue were doubled with the extra financial requirements for the children’s online education. Resources waste reached to the highest level and farmer debts reached to alarming levels.&#x0D;\nKeywords: Post-harvest chain, COVID-19, Banana and mango</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to explore the effect of different number of periods used in various forecasting models for the amount of natural rubber in Thailand. Monthly data from the Office of Agricultural Economics in the years 2007-2019 were obtained. Then the data were classified into 12 data sets; each of which had different number of periods including 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, 132 and 144 months. Decomposition forecasting methods consisted of the addition divide and the multiplicative divide methods were adopted. Model accuracy indicators were the mean absolute deviation, the mean square error and the mean absolute percentage error. The results showed that the amount of natural rubber and time were positively correlated at 99% confidence level. The most suitable model for forecasting the amount of natural rubber in Thailand found in our study was the multiplicative divide method by using the number of periods at 36 months yielding the mean absolute deviation of 66,264.61, the mean square error of 7,988,871,007.41 and the mean absolute percentage error of 24.66%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To prepare for the era of climate change, carbon-neutral countries have become a trend worldwide. The government has selected ‘Eco-friendly Future Mobility’ as one of the top 10 projects for the Korean version of the New Deal, and plans to invest more than 20 trillion won in green mobility such as electric vehicles and hydrogen cars by 2025 to supply 1.13 million electric vehicles and 200,000 hydrogen cars. Accordingly, in this study, the proper supply amount of hydrogen charging stations according to the supply of hydrogen cars was analyzed.\r\nAnalyzing the appropriate supply of hydrogen charging stations equipped with one unit, 19,404 hydrogen vehicles will be supplied in 2021, and at least 176 charging stations should be installed. According to the government’s supply policy, 67,000 hydrogen vehicles will be supplied in 2022 and 2.9 million units in 2040, and accordingly, the proper supply of hydrogen charging stations should be 609 in 2022 and 26,3636 in 2040. However, the number of hydrogen refueling stations to be supplied will be 310 in 2022 and 1,200 in 2040, short of 299 and 25,163, respectively. It is judged that the reduction of the charging time of hydrogen vehicles and the development of technologies for hydrogen production and use will be the variables of the appropriate supply amount of hydrogen charging stations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>COVID-19 has further strengthened consumers’ online consumption habits and brought a new boom in which enterprises can use online transactions and green products to avoid risk and gain profits in the pandemic. A green supply chain model is established containing one e-commerce platform and one manufacturer. The Nash bargaining contract and Rubinstein bargaining contract are applied to mitigate conflicts of profits in the model. From the coordination analysis, we show that both Nash and Rubinstein bargaining contracts can achieve coordination and mitigate conflict of profits through the adjustment of platform usage rates. According to each member’s bargaining power and patience, the optimal platform usage rate is determined, the supply chain profits of both sides are allocated, the green production’s research and development are promoted, and a win-win situation is realized. Specifically, in the Nash bargaining contract, the excess profit of each member depends on their bargaining power. The stronger the bargaining power, the more excess profits will go to the e-commerce platform, and the less excess profits will go to the manufacturer. In the Rubinstein bargaining contract, the excess profit of each member depends on the lowest profit bound and bargaining patience. The higher the manufacturer’s (or e-commerce platform’s) patience, the higher his profit. When the patience of both is high (or low), the e-commerce platform (or the manufacturer) plays a leading role and obtains more profits.</jats:p>"

However, direct access to end-use data through physical sensors is prohibitively expensive for most researchers, building owners, operators, and practitioners. Therefore, machine learning models can alleviate these costs by predicting downstream end-use events (e.g., sink, shower, dishwasher, and washing machine) via an affordable subset of upstream sensors. Choosing which upstream sensors, as well as data preprocessing methods, are best for machine learning has historically been a manual process. This paper proposes a novel approach to systematically configure the machine platform automatically. The optima were determined through a Pareto analysis of the exhaustive combinations of upstream predictors and preprocessing methods. The model was trained and validated with real-world data obtained from a house that has been extensively monitored for over a year. Results from the analysis suggested that downstream events can be effectively predicted with minimum overfitting error for most categories, using as few as two to four upstream sensors. This study automatically implemented highly accurate machine learning models to predict downstream features within premise plumbing systems, significantly lowering the costs of researching residential plumbing best practices such as water conservation.</jats:p>",

During the first days of the pandemic, supply chains were severely impacted by a great uncertainty in socio-economic terms, causing irrational variations and the inability to forecast demand. In this paper, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behaviour of different companies is analysed based on the variation in supply and demand of consumer-packaged goods. The pandemic outbreak disruption, the bullwhip effect caused by demand fluctuations, and the resilience of different companies were studied. A multiple case study methodology is used to analyse the decision-making process of fourteen different companies, from diverse sectors in Uruguay, affronting the pandemic. The paper’s main findings include the identification of disruption and operation risks along with coordination in supply chain management during the first four months of the pandemic. Moreover, due to the necessity of sanitation and comestibles, and the fear of stockout, consumers’ demand was uncertain, and the bullwhip effect was observed in critical channels of some products. Finally, the resiliency and robustness of the affected companies were studied and good practices for a resilient and robust response to the pandemic were identified and analysed.</jats:p>"

Methods: The work presents an assessment of operator reliability of a selected water treatment process based on the fault tree analysis (FTA). Elementary events are determined by the operator’s error probability. Results: A failure tree was prepared for the peak event of the filter station failure, resulting from an operator’s error during the filter washing procedure. The probability of a peak event occurring is 0.0580. Conclusions: The developed fault tree allows for the identification of elementary events leading to an emergency event.

It was established that the distribution function of the feeder feeding the tram depot corresponds to the logarithmic normal law, the distribution function of the modules of the idle voltage deviation and the angles between the idle voltages of adjacent traction substations to the truncated normal law. It is proposed to modernize the information bases of electric traction network parameters with complex power schemes to increase the efficiency of modeling the modes of operation of sections of urban electric transport.\nA method of calculating instantaneous schemes has been developed, which allows to create algorithms that do not depend on the degree of complexity of the scheme. A method of simulation modeling of complex power supply systems of electric transport based on the synthesis of the matrix method of calculating instantaneous circuits and the method of statistical tests for modeling the organization of traffic of trams and trolleybuses is proposed.\nAlgorithms and simulation models of traction power supply systems of urban electric transport have been developed, taking into account the modes of operation of power systems. A single simulation complex has been created that takes into account the traffic schedules of trams and trolleybuses, power flows in power supply systems, which makes it possible to obtain generalized dependences of power flows and energy losses, and to increase the accuracy of calculations of electrical parameters to 5–7%.\nAdequacy of the simulation model to the real process was verified by experimental data on a number of two-track, single-track sections of electric traction networks and complex power supply schemes of traction substations. The error in determining the integral indicators of costs and energy losses does not exceed 5%, and the rms currents – 3%.\nThe use of simulation modeling in the design of traction power supply systems allows to improve the quality of electrical engineering calculations of complex power supply schemes and to propose energy-efficient power supply modes.</jats:p>",

Water loss management (WLM) methods generally have high initial investment and operating costs. However, the budget planned within the scope of WLM in administrations is generally limited. Therefore, the most appropriate method should be determined by considering the budget conditions and cost–benefit analysis. The aim of this study is to propose a new economic water loss level (EWLL) model in WDSs with the different budget constraints of 5, 15 and 20% of the annual income. This EWLL model was developed by the discrete stochastic optimization algorithm. The EWLL and economically recoverable leakage volumes were determined by considering the budget constraints. Moreover, the most appropriate methods were determined to reach the EWLL values defined according to the budget constraints. The EWLL was calculated as 8.62% by the optimization model without budget constraints. Moreover, the EWLL values with budget constraints of 5, 15 and 20% of the annual income were determined as 56.82, 21.14 and 18.02%, respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the transformation of the supply chain from factor driven to investment driven and to innovation driven, supply chain innovation has attracted more and more attention. This paper obtains the Bayesian prior probability of innovation and studies the supply chain innovation path from the perspective of strategy and behavior. The model divides the overall innovation capability of the supply chain into specific node tasks and assets (Capability Set), and the innovation demand of the supply chain is expressed in the form of the conditional probability of market demand. Under the conditions of minimum risk, minimum cost, and rapid market response, it determines who should lead the supply chain innovation first and what type of supply chain innovation should be carried out first. Finally, taking the supply chain of the professional market in Zhejiang Province as an example, this paper verifies the theoretical model of supply chain innovation decision-making. The innovation of the supply chain of Zhejiang’s specialized market is decomposed into the capability set of each enterprise node of the supply chain. This paper transforms the group innovation ability of the supply chain in the professional market into the individual innovation ability of a single enterprise node and reveals the starting point and intensity of the demand innovation of products/services in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

Pigmeat is currently the most consumed meat globally, even exceeding the consumption of poultry meat. Despite the disproportionate environmental burden of animal production—mostly attributable to associated feed demand, up-to-date country-scale quantifications of the land and water impacts of the concentrate feed (mainly cereals and soybean) and co-products required to support pig production are still missing. In addition, the specific role that international feed trade plays in separating resource use from consumption and in altering resource use efficiencies remains unclear. This paper analyses at a country-scale the internal and external consumption of natural resources (i.e. land and water) to support pig feed production in 2018. Combining data on the country- and production system-specific diets and crop-specific yields with an agro-hydrological model, we find that 64.1 Mha of agricultural land (5% of all croplands) and 332.6 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of water (both green and blue) (6% of all agricultural water use) were utilized by China, EU-27 and the United States (accounting for 70% of pigmeat production) to produce pig feed alone. Comparing domestic feed production scenarios with those that also consider the feed trade, we show that global resource consumption tends to be more efficient when considering international feed trade, especially in China and EU-27, while sometimes causing significant environmental impacts. This demonstrates the need to investigate the environmental effects of pig feed associated both with the domestic use of natural resources, but also to the ones displaced by international trade.</jats:p>",

The analysis showed that coefficient increase of metal utilization requires loss decrease arising from the supply inaccuracy of the bar workpiece to the length of the part. The task is to reproduce the given law of motion of the actuator, i.e. to ensure maximum speed, smooth acceleration and braking with the possibility of a shockless stop at the end of the stroke. The solution of this problem is proposed to be carried out by entering  the fuzzy control unit into the structure of the system for controlling the supply..&#x0D;\nThe hardware basis of the control system in this work is the Arduino hardware and software complex based on the Atmel AVR microcontroller. The software model of the control system is developed in the graphical programming environment LabVIEW, which is widely used as a standard tool for data collection and control of devices in industry, education and research laboratories. The construction of a fuzzy regulator and its implementation are considered using Fuzzy Logic Designer.&#x0D;\nOn the basis of systematized knowledge about the object of research, its characteristics and features, linguistic input and output variables were selected, as well as membership functions and a fuzzy production model of knowledge was formulated. The configuration of the control system depends on the number of controlled outputs and controlled input data and in this case the MISO information structure is applied. The paper presents the front panel of the virtual device developed by LabVIEW, which is designed to display information about the current state of the system. The purpose of the developed fuzzy regulator model is to output the value of the initial air pressure in the cavity of the actuating pneumatic cylinder, which will create an air cushion in the process of advancing the piston, which has properties similar to those of a normal spring. Smooth stopping of the piston is provided by the coordinated choice of rigidity of a pneumatic spring taking into account length of a detail and weight of a rod and allows us to reduce kinetic energy in an end point of positioning that increases accuracy of supply.&#x0D;\nThe analysis of research results confirmed the efficiency and adequacy of the  model used and the developed set of operation  rules of the fuzzy regulator. Testing of the control system on parts of different lengths confirmed a reduction in total losses and an increase in the utilization of the metal.</jats:p>"

CO2-EOR in unconventional reservoirs presents an opportunity for both financial gain through improved recovery factors, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of the produced oil. In this work, we examine the CO2-EOR potential in 4 organic-rich shale samples from the Canadian Bakken Formation. A number of characterization tests alongside CO2 extraction experiments were performed to gain insight into the controlling factors of CO2-EOR in these ultra-tight formations. The results show CO2 can penetrate the tight rock matrix and recover a substantial amount of hydrocarbon. Concentration gradient driven diffusion is the dominant form of recovery.</jats:p>"

How to curb the over-exploitation of groundwater and realize the sustainable use of groundwater resources has become an important issue for ecological environmental protection. Therefore, accurate prediction of groundwater depth is an important foundation for the rational use of groundwater resources. Based on the significant advantages of empirical model decomposition (EMD) in dealing with non-smooth and nonlinear data and the long-term memory function of long and short-term memory (LSTM) network, a coupled EMD-LSTM-based groundwater prediction model is constructed and apply to groundwater depth prediction of three professional observation wells. The results show that the maximum relative error of the prediction results of the EMD-LSTM model for the three professional observation wells is 5.00% and the minimum is 0.07%. The prediction passing rate is 100% and the prediction accuracy of the coupled model for groundwater depth is higher than that of the single LSTM model and back-propagation (BP) model. In conclusion, the model has high prediction accuracy and provides an effective method for the prediction of groundwater depth.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>HIGHLIGHTS Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a relatively novel data preprocessing method that can effectively reduce the non-smoothness of time series.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of N and K on fruit quality parameters of three clusters of hydroponically grown tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Nitrogen (10, 12, 14 and 16 molc N m-3) was evaluated at the vegetative stage, and potassium (5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 molc K m-3) at the reproductive stage. The evaluated N and K concentrations showed significant main effects on the quality attributes total soluble solids, citric acid percentage, reducing sugars, color and lycopene concentration; yield was affected only by K, while the effects of N × K interaction were not significant. Increasing N concentrations from 10 to 16 molc m-3 enhanced hue angle, brightness, reducing sugars and citric acid percentage, but decreased total soluble solids and lycopene. As K increased from 5 to 13 molc m-3 in the nutrient solution, total soluble solids, citric acid, reducing sugars, lycopene, yield and fruit brightness increased, but hue decreased. Total soluble solids, reducing sugars and lycopene gradually increased from the first to the fifth cluster, while yield, color attributes of hue and brightness tended to decrease as the crop cycle progressed. Titratable acidity percentage showed no clear trends between clusters. It is concluded that N and K differentially affect tomato quality between clusters.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this article is to analyze the possibility of energy saving when using solar energy for the heating system of an individual residential building in Vladivostok. The latitude of the city is 43 °, but the estimated temperature for the design of heating is -22 ° C. This greatly complicates the use of solar heat. The possibility of accumulation of low-potential heat in a specially equipped outhouse (greenhouse) for conversion by a thermal air-water pump is analyzed in order to use it for heating needs in the future. Two constructions are considered as the finishing material of the extension: a two-layer polycarbonate with an air layer and an energy-saving double-glazed window. The calculation shows that in the coldest month is January, the potential of solar thermal energy is 14 %–37 % of the required heat demand, depending on the material used in the construction of the extension. In March and April, excess heat is generated. It can be used for hot water supply needs. Thus, for an individual residential building, the use of solar heat accumulated in a greenhouse extension is relevant as an additional source of heat for the heating system.</jats:p>",

To design proper risk mitigation strategies, after identifying key risk factors, the next step is to conduct assessments that would facilitate the process of risk element prioritization. Risk assessment comprises the establishment of factor interrelation and discerning the indicators of importance. This research proposes a novel version of an integrated prioritization method and analyzes twelve all-inclusive key supply chain oriented risk factors identified in a previous study. Through a comprehensive literature review three criteria, impact, probability, and manageability are selected. Also, a fourth criterion namely influence rate is included in the model, based on the driving powers that can also be derived from the Interpretive Structural Modeling’s (ISM) assessment. Fundamentally, the calculations hinge on the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method which provides an assessment of the alternatives’ weights based on pairwise comparisons concerning the criteria specified. To enhance the accuracy of the perceptive judgments of the expert panelists, a bell-shaped fuzzy function is used to convert the verbal statements to crisp values. In addition, Row Sensitivity Analysis is administered to check the stability of the results and provide predictive scenarios. To validate the model, a case study, located in Iran, was conducted, where an expert panel consisting of four individuals made the pair-wise comparisons through an ANP questionnaire. Results indicate priority and sensitivity of the alternatives concerning criteria, for the case under study. </jats:p>",

The main water tank and pipes were rusted; 13 out of the 19 water samples tested positive for total Coliform (1–920 colony-forming units (CFU)/100 ml) and E. coli (1–720 CFU/100 ml). Chlorine levels were below 0.2 ppm in seven of the nine samples. Information of 1,815 cases was obtained from the hospital records with a crude attack rate of 2.9%. Cases widespread in the district increased throughout the holiday, epidemic curve revealed a point-source outbreak. The case–control study revealed that consumption of drinking tap water and using it to clean vegetables/fruits were significantly associated with the illness. While drinking only bottled water had a protective effect against the illness. The culture technique showed that the water supply samples were positive for pathogenic bacteria.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Collisions between ships and offshore platforms frequently occur, with severe consequences. Predicting the collision depth under different conditions is very important to evaluate the severity of the consequences. Considering the time-consuming numerical simulation problem and the accuracy problems of existing approximation algorithms, this paper proposes a comprehensive approach to estimating penetration depths by obtaining two collision coefficients for specific collision structures based on the partial results of numerical simulations and simplified theoretical analysis. In this study, the collision process between a supply ship with a transverse framing stern and an offshore semi-platform was first numerically simulated based on the explicit dynamic method. The changes in ship velocity, impact force, and energy conversion before and after the collision processes were obtained through numerical simulations of the collisions with different speeds and angles. Then, by combining the external dynamics and numerical results, the analytical results of dissipated energy under other collision conditions were obtained using a simulated restitution coefficient. For the following internal dynamics analysis, according to the failure modes of specific structural components in different regions, an appropriate structural energy absorption formula was combined to obtain the relationship between the penetrations and energy absorption in a particular collision area. According to the friction energy ratio derived by the simulation, the penetration depths in the offshore platform were calculated. The results showed that the deviations between the proposed method and direct simulation results were less than 15% in the cases of a medium- to high-energy collision. It can be concluded that the restitution coefficient and friction energy ratio in different collision conditions can be approximately determined for a specific collision system by typical numerical simulations, thus quickly calculating the penetration depths of other conditions.</jats:p>"

Design/Methodology/Approach: This study follows a qualitative, case study methodology. The major sources of this study’s data were collected through semi-structured interviews, documentary reviews and informal observations. Research findings: Influenced by its parent company’s management style that concerns aligning business practices with the fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), the case company has subscribed to a set of accounting systems and SCM practices to manage its complex business activities. As much as accounting systems influence its SCM practices more naturally, SCM practices also influence its accounting practices quite extensively. On the one hand, it has used accounting reports to manage its cashflow, to develop its marketing plan, and to monitor its performance. On the other hand, its SCM practices have shaped the ways pricing and performance measures are set with much negotiation. Theoretical contribution/Originality: Using the Resource Based View (RBV) as a theoretical lens, this study analyses the role of accounting within the context of the supply chain network by exploring how accounting systems influence and/or get influenced by SCM practices. Practitioner/Policy implications: The findings are important in shedding light on the interplay between accounting and SCM in view of their strong networks and mutual roles in relation to the natural supply chain setting of a Japanese subsidiary company by relating to the IR 4.0’s demands. Research limitation/Implications: This study is based on one case study and that the specific accounting information that were reported in the company were not identified. This study has revealed that information sharing has streamlined SCM and influenced performance as members in the supply chain network are able to collaborate in a more integrated and seamless manner to enhance the organisational competitive advantage as highlighted by the RBV theory and as emphasised by IR 4.0.

This deterministic model is extended to a robust network model to secure supply chain decisions against uncertainty. Using the proposed model for the development of algal fuels in Iran shows that the green fuel production cost is currently 27 cents/liter. The current cost of producing fuel from algae cannot compete with fossil fuels, but this cost can be greatly reduced in the future by slightly increasing the growth rate of algae and their oil content. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>This article addresses the inherent risk in a supply chain that comprises primarily Very Small Entities (VSE) with little to no security proficiency and limited resources and incentive to prioritize system security. In a globalized economy based on outsourcing and risk‐sharing, most engineering activities occur in the smallest companies, even for large and complex projects. The Future of Systems Engineering initiative (FuSE) appropriately has agility at the core of its Systems Security Engineering (SSE) foundation concepts, and VSEs are by their very nature agile. However, the line between agility and chaos may be thin, and engineers at VSEs must often accept a level of restraint and rigidity beyond their comfort level to achieve functional agility. The primary challenge in VSEs is adding structure without the necessary resources to enforce compliance manually. We propose that VSE focus their initial efforts on FuSE SSE Foundation Concepts that play into their nature and strengths as dynamic human social activity systems. Improvements in security proficiency and stakeholder alignment do not necessarily require much formal structure, and digital tools combined with social strategies can add structure to a resource‐constrained environment. Games can be excellent low‐cost tools to provide structure while minimizing resistance, and Agile Model‐Based Systems Engineering (AMBSE) using digital models can support automated enforcement. Here we use the card game<jats:italic>Elevation of Privilege</jats:italic>(EoP) as an example. Within the context of a SysML Threat Model integrated into a larger System Model, players naturally treat security requirements as traceable functional requirements. Automated model validation, re‐usable components and patterns enforce a Zero‐Trust architecture, a sufficiently formal trust model to provide evidence‐based assurance, yet achievable for small companies with limited resources.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to assess the risk and identify hazards from the production source to the point of use and plan to reduce or eliminate these hazards to provide safe drinking water. This study was conducted on the water supply system of Talesh city in 2021. The WSP has 12 stages and the third stage is risk assessment and hazard identification. This stage scored 69 points out of a total of 100 raw points, which indicates 69% coordination with the WSP. Based on the analysis, 47 hazards were identified in production sources, transmission lines, distribution network, and point of use. The presence of domestic sewage wells near the source of supply, undesirable chlorine concentration, and old pipes in the distribution network, as well as the failure of the check valve at the point of consumption are the most important risks. With the implementation of different phases of WSP, especially the stage of identification and assessment of microbial contamination risk in the distribution network, has been decreased to 0% and the desired residual chlorine concentration has been increased to 100%. Currently, water supply system of Talesh has a moderate level of safety.</jats:p>",

This study also proposes a new industrial upgrading mechanism, the “smile‐curve‐driven supply‐chain upgrading,” for supply‐chain firms. Increases in production complexity and level of factor intensity in each production stage are found to be the two essential conditions for the smile‐curve‐driven supply‐chain upgrading.

Many businesses had to close during this time due to lack of customers, lack of workers, and due to staffing issues due to the virus. As things started opening back up the demand for goods and services has been overwhelming to many industries. Ships are waiting off the coast for months to be unloaded, shelves are empty, the next day deliveries are taking days and weeks as the transportation system is overwhelmed. High demand and a lack of workers in every industry has led to a major global supply chain disruption that has not been experienced before. These disruptions affect every part of the supply chain from manufactures, warehouses, shipping, rail, truck, down to the retail level.

The novelty of the presented approach lies especially in the linear formulations of the models for electrolysis and salt cavern storage. The proposed linear electrolysis model allows for an accurate consideration of operating limits and operating point-specific efficiencies, while the two-dimensional cavern model treats the cavern volume as a decision variable. The developed formulations are implemented in the open energy modeling framework (oemof) and applied to representative case studies with 2020 marginal conditions. Thereby, it has been confirmed that the individual consideration of power supply and hydrogen demand is crucial for optimal system design and operation.

Mit Beginn des russischen Kriegs gegen die Ukraine sind sie noch einmal in die Höhe geschnellt. Neben Lieferkettenstörungen und Exportrückgängen dämpft das die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung, Konjunkturprognosen wurden deutlich nach unten revidiert. Darüber hinaus stellt ein mögliches komplettes Ausbleiben aller Lieferungen von Energieträgern aus Russland ein erhebliches Risiko dar. Über die zu erwartenden Folgen ist viel diskutiert worden. Wenn es um die Auswirkungen eines Lieferstopps von Gas geht, kommen bisherige Berechnungen auf Basis ökonomischer Modelle zu uneindeutigen Ergebnissen mit einer Spannbreite von einem verkraftbaren Schock (Bachmann et al., 2022) bis hin zu massiven und dauerhaften wirtschaftlichen Schäden (Krebs, 2022).</jats:p>",

However, the condition of natural resources in each region is different, not all regions have sufficient water availability. One of them is in Serut, Gunungkidul which is an area with hilly geography. During the dry season, clean water sources in Serut District become scarce and very limited. Therefore, the Serut District Government cooperates with the Community Self-Help Group (KKM Tirta Abadi Jaya) to drill deep wells to distribute water to residents. However, along the way, the operational costs are very large, especially for water pump electric pulses. In addition, the geographical condition of Serut which is hilly and has many trees causes frequent power outages, especially in extreme weather. This affects the resistance of the water pump because it is often on and off. The power outage can also stop the distribution of water to residents. This community service provides a solution to these problems, namely the installation of solar electricity generation. With this solar electricity generation, it can reduce the operational costs of electric pulses. In addition, using solar electricity generation can increase the durability of the tool because there is no on-off. Residents also still have their water needs met even though there is a power outage because the electricity needs for water pumps are supplied from solar electricity generation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, environmental and energy issues relating to global warming have become more serious, and there is a need to shift from conventional power generation, which emits an abundance of carbon dioxide, to renewable energy sources without emissions, such as solar and wind. However, solar power generation, which is one of the renewable energies, changes dynamically, depending on real time weather conditions. Thus, power supplied mainly by solar power generation is often unstable, and an appropriate on-demand energy management for demand-to-supply is required to ensure a stable power supply. Demand-to-supply management methods include inventory management analysis and on-demand inventory management analysis. The cumulative-control method has been used as one of the production management methods to visually manage inventory status in factories and warehouses, while the on-demand cumulative-control method is an extension of inventory management analysis. This study models a demand-to-supply management method for a solar power generation system by using the on-demand cumulative-control method in an actual case. First, a demand-to-supply management method is modeled by an on-demand cumulative-control method, using actual power data from a childcare facility in Tokyo. Next, the on-demand cumulative-control method is adopted to the case without batteries, and the amount of electricity to be purchased is estimated. Finally, the effectiveness of the maximum battery capacity and the amount of the initial charge are examined and discussed by sensitivity analysis.</jats:p>"

To obtain a suitable supply-related protocol, this study proposes a supply selection model which considers both manufacturers’ development orientation and material ordering. In contrast to traditional approaches that rely on expert opinions, the proposed approach in this study allows the time series analysis (ARIMA) to forecast the trend in manufacturers’ development during the execution of the plan. Based on the predicted trend, taking the minimum of total material management cost as the objective function, the control function and optimization conditions are constructed to select the appropriate protocol. The dynamic prediction protocol is obtained by considering the variation in production and material costs by an evolutionary algorithm. The model enables users to determine material supply protocol in continuous time and autonomously adapt to changes in the manufacturers’ production goals within a lower convergence time.</jats:p>",

To accommodate this change and remain accessible, the University of Arizona Cancer Center’s Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) transitioned cancer education efforts to virtual webinars and social media. These multilingual and multicultural efforts were targeted toward residents of Arizona, as well as a broader network of participants.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Objective: To develop accessible, virtual programming to engage communities across Arizona during the COVID-19 pandemic to continue cancer education and health promotion efforts in bilingual (English and Spanish) webinars where possible.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods: Utilizing a vibrant social media presence, the COE team developed a weekly webinar series, entitled Let’s Taco ‘Bout Cancer!, a monthly Morning Cat Chat webinar, and an annual “Col-Chella” festival that focuses on cancer education. These series are based on informal interviews and conversations with cancer researchers, community health partners, cancer survivors/caretakers, and community advisory board members. All presentations were streamed via Zoom, social media accounts, and YouTube to be accessible for later use. Lastly, demonstration webinars (e.g. food preparation) for healthy behaviors were also implemented.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Since March 2020, more than 22,000 viewers have been recorded over 122 virtual cancer-related presentations that were given. Sixty-one percent of the presentations were in English and 39% were in Spanish. Collected surveys indicate the median age of the audience is 55 years old, 77% females, and 43% community members. Twenty-nine (29) percent identify as Hispanic, 48% as non-Hispanic white, and 17% as American Indian/Alaska Native. Evaluations reported that 86% of the audience were engaged, 94% that their knowledge was increased, and 69% indicated that their knowledge is applicable. Eighty-seven (87) percent thought the research topics discussed benefits their community and 83% preferred to receive cancer education materials via email.

The success of the supply chain depends on the integration and coordination of all its institutions to form an efficient network structure. An efficient network leads to cost savings throughout the supply chain and helps it respond to customer needs faster. Accordingly, and with respect to the importance of the supply chain, in this study a developed mathematical model for the design of a green closed-loop supply chain is presented. In this mathematical model, the economic and environmental objectives are simultaneously optimized. In order to tackle this mathematical model, two methods of epsilon constraint and multi-objective gray wolf optimization (MOGWO) algorithm have been applied. The results of comparisons between the two mentioned methods show that MOGWO reduce the average solving time from about 1300 seconds to 88 seconds. In the last step of this research, in order to show the application of the proposed mathematical model and the method of solving the research problem, it was implemented in the supply chain of Dalan Kouh diary product and the Pareto optimal solutions were analyzed.</jats:p>",

This means additional performance metrics for these technologies should be considered, such as embodied energy, embodied carbon, recycled content and recyclability, environmental impact of material sourcing, impact on land and ecosystems, materials recovery at end of life, and production through quality nonexploitive jobs with community benefit. Many commercial and emerging energy technologies have not yet been explicitly evaluated based on these environmental and social performance metrics, which presents multiple opportunities for researchers and analysts. In this paper, we review the importance and current limitations of techno‐economic and life‐cycle assessment models for research design and manufacturing decisions. We explore emerging manufacturing modeling options that could improve environmental and social performance and how they could be used to help guide research. Even with the deployment of low‐carbon energy‐generation technologies, the future of a successful clean energy transition requires collaboration between researchers, advanced manufacturers, independent standards and tracking organizations, local communities, and national governments, to ensure the financial, environmental, and social sustainability of the entire supply and manufacturing process of energy technologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural development is essential for the community's survival because it is a major source of food. Food production is a critical component of food security. Food security must be improved to meet market demand, and one of the fundamental goals of agricultural growth is to provide sufficient quantities of food. Increasing demand for natural resources, as well as environmental issues, are putting pressure on the current agricultural supply chain, which includes agricultural land suitability. Land evaluation is a process of analyzing land resources for specific uses using an established technique or method, and it is required to incorporate land appropriateness. According to the criteria, the findings of land suitability will give information and/or land use guidance. The land's appropriateness might be evaluated in its existing state (actual land suitability) or after changes have been made (potential land suitability). To address these issues, the agricultural sector must transition from traditional agriculture to smart agriculture. One of the technologies and system modeling that drives the current technique to smart agriculture with an integrated approach to evaluate the sustainability of agricultural land suitability is the geographic information system (GIS). The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) from prior investigations is presented in this publication. The articles are divided into two groups based on their approaches: agricultural land appropriateness for rice plants and the application of geographic information systems (GIS), comprising agricultural land suitability, site selection, and effect evaluation. The goal of this research is to determine what criteria are significant in increasing the quality of GIS applications in agriculture. This outcome is expected to assist stakeholders in formulating policies based on the performance of GIS data management in enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting agriculture supply chain management.</jats:p>"

We find that the suppliers suffering from information asymmetry can sacrifice the direct profits gained from a supply contract with a Chaebol group member contractee while pursuing certification for further growth. The valuation of suppliers with a Chaebol group member as the contractee is lower when the suppliers’ information asymmetry is higher. The results also show that the operational margins of the suppliers deteriorate after obtaining a supply contract with a Chaebol group member, whereas the sales increase significantly more than the contract amount. These results imply that the Chaebol groups play a role in the certification of the product market and help quality suppliers achieve greater recognition.</jats:p>",

This study was conducted to measure the reliability and validity of the instrument designed to evaluate the role of institutional pressures in implementing green supply chain management practices and their impact on environmental sustainability through the moderating role of green marketing and mediating role of customer green purchase intention among manufacturing firms in Pakistan. The self-administered questionnaire was distributed among employees of manufacturing companies and customers of green products. A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed and 162 valid responses were received which were used for this pilot test. The initial content and face validity of the survey questionnaire were obtained from subject and field experts. However, the results of this pilot showed that all the constructs met the reliability and validity threshold and the instrument is valid to measure the theoretical model proposed for the study. The study suggested that easy access to credit should be given to augment economic growth.</jats:p>"

Results of electrokinetic experiments have shown that coliforms are electroosmotically transported to the cathode with a velocity of 0.6 cm h−1 (E = 4 V cm−1). In the absence of an electric field and at electric field strengths of &amp;lt;4 V cm−1, a diffuse random movement to the cathode and the anode was the only translocation mechanism. Hence, the electroosmotic transport may represent an additional component of motion during E-slow sand filtration influencing its disinfection performance. Based on this, comparative experimental investigations on the disinfection performance of a slow sand filter without and combined with an electric field were carried out. In the absence of an electric field, the adsorptive filter effect of quartz sand contributes to an initial bacterial retention by 0.8 log levels. Applying an electric field strength of 4 V cm−1 caused an increase of E. coli reduction up to 4 log levels. The electrokinetically enhanced accumulation of E. coli in the filter bed is assumed to be the major effect mechanism in the E-slow sand filter.</jats:p>",

However, little information about the physiology of different growth stages, agronomic traits, and associated genetic bases of N use efficiency (NUE) are available at low-N supply. Two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars were grown with optimum N (120 kg ha−1) and low N (60 kg ha−1) supply. Six growth stages were analyzed to measure the growth and physiological traits, as well as the differential proteomic profiles, of the rice cultivars. Cultivar Panvel outclassed Nagina 22 at low-N supply and exhibited improved growth and physiology at most of the growth stages and agronomic efficiency due to higher N uptake and utilization at low-N supply. On average, photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, plant biomass, leaf N content, and grain yield were decreased in cultivar Nagina 22 than Panvel was 8%, 11%, 21%, 19%, and 22%, respectively, under low-N supply. Furthermore, proteome analyses revealed that many proteins were upregulated and downregulated at the different growth stages under low-N supply. These proteins are associated with N and carbon metabolism and other physiological processes. This supports the genotypic differences in photosynthesis, N assimilation, energy stabilization, and rice-protein yield. Our study suggests that enhancing NUE at low-N supply demands distinct modifications in N metabolism and physiological assimilation. The NUE may be regulated by key identified differentially expressed proteins. These proteins might be the targets for improving crop NUE at low-N supply.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the analysis of water resources supply and demand balance and the mapping of water resources spatial flow can be an effective suggestion for the regional water resources allocation to relieve the regional water pressure. The uneven distribution of water resources in the Dongjiang River Basin is significant, and how to effectively allocate water resources in the Dongjiang River Basin has become a major focus of research. Based on the multi-source data of the Dongjiang River Basin from 2005 to 2020, this paper uses the SWAT model and water demand model to establish the spatial flow model of water resources supply and demand, and uses the subbasin-scale to explore the spatial distribution and flow of water resources supply and demand, obtaining the spatial scope and flow of water resources supply and beneficiary areas in the basin. The results show that (1) the water supply in the Dongjiang River Basin has been decreasing year by year, and the water demand has been increasing from 2005 to 2015, leading to an increase in the imbalance between supply and demand, and there is a significant reduction in industrial water use from 2015 to 2020, resulting in a reduction in the imbalance between water supply and demand; (2) the supply and demand pressure of water resources in the Dongjiang River Basin has obvious spatial heterogeneity, showing that the pressure of water use in the middle and upper reaches is small, while the pressure of water use in the lower reaches is large; (3) under the framework of spatial service flows of water resources supply and demand, this paper obtains three main beneficiary area ranges, which are Dongyuan County of Heyuan City, Yuancheng District of Heyuan City, and the main urban area of Shenzhen Dongguan Huizhou, and specifies the flow of service flows. This study can not only provide reasonable suggestions for water resources allocation in the Dongjiang River Basin but it also provides references for water resources management in other basins.</jats:p>"

The interfacial mechanics of a Janus evaporator with an interpenetrating structure are proposed to achieve a dramatic improvement in the solar–thermal evaporation rate. The Janus evaporator is composed of a membrane material of Cu1.96S grown in situ on a foamed copper skeleton (CF@Cu1.96S) and a graphene oxide/sodium alginate aerogel (GA), through an interfacial freeze-drying shape technology. In this unique architecture, the superhydrophilic GA can be stretched into the hydrophobic CF@Cu1.96S interior to build an interpenetrating network architecture (CF@Cu1.96S/GA), thereby adjusting the Laplace pressure and constraining capillarity. Due to the optimized water supply of interfacial mechanics, the CF@Cu1.96S/GA evaporator achieves an evaporation rate of 1.79 kg m−2 h−1 under 1 sun irradiation and exhibits superior salt resistance. This provides a rationale for the reasonable design of the structure of the solar–thermal evaporators.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to develop an instrument to assess and measure the factors influencing the adoption of AI in SCRM. The development of the instrument has been done in stages covering factor identification, item generation, pre-testing, pilot testing, and scale validation. Data has been collected through a survey of supply chain executives, risk professionals, and AI consultants across manufacturing, wholesale trade, retail trade, and services industries in India. The questionnaire has been pre-tested based on interviews with nine industry experts and two academicians. The scale has been assessed for reliability and validity using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The scale generated consists of eight factors that are modeled as latent variables covering a total of twenty-eight items. The systematic approach followed resulted in a scale fulfilling a need for the creation of an empirically validated instrument for AI adoption studies in the field of SCRM. This instrument can be used by supply chain executives and researchers to examine and measure factors that influence the adoption of AI in SCRM for the selected industries.</jats:p>"

This study sought to characterize the national and provincial trends in the medical oncologist (MO) and MO trainee workforce during the last 27 years and explore the relationship between workforce and cancer incidence. Methods: Publicly available databases from the Canadian Medical Association (CMA; 1994-2019) and Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) database (1994-2020) were utilized to estimate the number, demographics, and regional distribution of practicing MOs in Canada from 1994 to 2020. Cancer incidence by province was obtained from Statistics Canada for the period 1990 to 2018, except for Quebec where only 1990-2010 data was available, and then projected to 2020 across five regions (The West Coast, The Prairies, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada) using Canadian population statistics from Statistics Canada and age-period-cohort modeling. To estimate changes in demand for, and supply of, medical oncology services over time, annual cancer incidence to MO provider ratios were calculated. Finally, the Canadian Post MD Education Registry (CAPER) database (1994-2020) was used to characterize the number of MO trainees. Results: Between 1994 and 2020, annual cancer incidence nationally rose from 120,255 cases to 225,800 cases (88%), while the number of MOs increased from 161 to 642 (298%). Incident cancer cases to medical oncologist (MO) ratio dropped from 749:1 in 1994 to 352:1 in 2020. This ratio fell in all five analyzed regions from 1994 to 2020 (Atlantic Canada 1836:1 to 447:1, The Prairies 1257:1 to 377:1, The West Coast 909 to 261:1, Ontario 682:1 to 411:1 and Quebec 543:1 to 300:1). In 1994, 24% of MO providers were ≥ 50 years old compared with 40% in 2020. Nationally, the MO workforce has nearly reached gender parity with 46% female in 2020 versus 25% in 1994. Trends in Canadian MO trainees have largely mirrored MO trends with a 203% increase in the annual trainee cohort from 34 in 1994 to 103 in 2020. In 1994, 34% of trainees were female compared with 63% in 2020. The largest proportion of the country's MOs (34% in 2020) and MO trainees (49%) are located in Canada’s most populous province, Ontario. Conclusions: Although the Canadian MO workforce has shown considerable growth between 1994-2020, a higher proportion of MO providers are nearing retirement age and may influence future workforce trends. Moreover, our study was not able to take into consideration referral patterns or the increasing number and complexity of systemic therapies that also influence MO workload. Ongoing monitoring of human resource levels in medical oncology and cancer incidence data are key metrics to meaningfully inform MO training programs of an appropriately sized trainee cohort and ensure future demands for MO services in cancer care are met. </jats:p>",

Land resources are fundamentally important to human society, and their transition from one macroscopic state to another is a vital driving force of environment and climate change locally and globally. Thus, many efforts have been devoted to the simulations of land changes. Among all spatially explicit simulation models, CLUMondo is the only one that simulates land changes by incorporating the multifunctionality of a land system and allows the establishment of many-to-many demand-supply relationships. Its central mechanism is complex and has not been fully revealed or clearly explained, thus preventing further improvement. In this study, we first investigated the source code of CLUMondo, providing for the first time the complete, detailed mechanism of this model. More importantly, we found that the featured function of CLUMondo – balancing demands and supplies in a many-to-many mode – relies on a parameter called conversion order. Still, the setting of this parameter should be improved because it is a manual process according to the characteristics of each study area and based on expert knowledge, which is not feasible for users without an understanding of the whole, detailed mechanism. Therefore, the second contribution of this study is the development of an automatic method for adaptively determining conversion orders. We revised the source code of CLUMondo to incorporate the proposed automated method, resulting CLUMondo Version 2.0. Comparative experiments demonstrated the proposed automated method’s validity, high effectiveness, and universal applicability. They showed that the new version of CLUMondo is more effective and easier to use than the existing version. A case study showed that the simulation performance has improved as high as 103.36 %. This study facilitates future improvement on CLUMondo and deep coupling with other earth system models, clearly describing its mechanism. It also helps to exploit the full potential of CLUMondo with a new version.\n                        </jats:p>"

Therefore, a simulation tool is proposed for planning routes for the physical distribution of refrigerated products, making the entire logistics process more efficient, reducing the unwanted gain of internal temperature of the vehicle and the product, considering the time windows available, number of vehicles and its available capacity.

Hence, I4.0-driven CE-oriented supply chains (SCs) have improved sustainable performance, flexibility and interoperability. In order to smoothly embrace circular practices in digitally enabled SCs, quantitative techniques have been identified as crucial. Therefore, the intersection of I4.0, CE, supply chain management (SCM) and quantitative techniques is an emerging research arena worthy of investigation. This article presents a bibliometric analysis to identify the established and evolving research clusters in the topological analysis by identifying collaboration patterns, interrelations and the studies that significantly dominate the intersection of the analysed fields. Further, this study investigates the current research trends and presents potential directions for future research. The bibliometric analysis highlights that additive manufacturing (AM), big data analytics (BDA) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are the most researched technologies within the intersection of CE and sustainable SCM. Evaluation of intellectual, conceptual and social structures revealed that I4.0-driven sustainable operations and manufacturing are emerging research fields. This study provides research directions to guide scholars in the further investigation of these four identified fields while exploring the potential quantitative methods and techniques that can be applied in I4.0-enabled SCs in the CE context.</jats:p>",

Today, most foreign wheeled tractors use the latest technology in the design of internal combustion engines, transmissions and wheeled engines. In particular, there is a greater bias towards the use of continuously variable transmissions. In order to create real competition for domestic producers, it is necessary to implement modern solutions, which is not possible without quality cooperation with scientists. Therefore, the material of this article aims to form guidelines for mathematical modeling of the dynamics of the wheeled tractor, taking into account the operation of the main clutch, hydraulic clutch and fuel control in the internal combustion engine. In solving this goal, a technique was used that provided mathematical modeling of the crankshaft of an internal combustion engine with the available harmonic components, as well as the ability to control the fuel supply. The simulation of the transmission operation was based on classical approaches in the study of the dynamic load of the power plant, taking into account the operation of the main clutch and hydraulic clutches. As a result, the dependences of the change of technical and operational parameters of the wheeled tractor at the stage of start-up and acceleration are obtained. The practical significance of the work lies in the possibility of its use in assessing the performance of a wheeled tractor, which is equipped with preselective and continuously variable transmissions, as well as a transmission that uses dual-clutch technology.</jats:p>"

The researchers performed the CBA using sensitivity analysis methodologies such as marginal cost of capital (MCC), weighted average cost of capital (WACC), coefficient of variance (CV), the net present value (NPV) ratio, and cumulative and total cost methods. The findings for socio-domestic retrofitting capital investment showed that at an average investment cost of USD 5735 per household, consumption was reduced from 1369.4 m3/year to 301.99 m3/year, whereas a projected water savings average of 521.05 m3/household/year was achieved. The results show that the cumulative cost of water losses equaled USD 43.9 million per year, and that, if the water loss trend continues beyond the year 2026, almost 100% of the system input volume (SIV) will be non-revenue water (NRW) in the water balance. Using the MCC method, the integrated results for the socio-technical strategy showed that the economic level of leakage (ELL) was achieved at a WACC of 16.2, a CV of 0.66, and an NPV ratio or net capital risk of 0.246. This study demonstrates that the socio-technical approach is a viable alternative for water loss control and may be adopted in various parts of the world.</jats:p>"

There is significant research interest in the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for supply chain management (SCM). A challenge that remains is analyzing the interactions of BCT in different areas of SCM. This study aims to identify the influential dimensions of the impact of BCT adoption in SCM and to discuss the synergetic and counter-synergetic effects between these dimensions. Advantages, disadvantages, and constraints of adopting BCT in the SCM context are explored through a systematic literature review, which provides the foundation for identifying the dimensions of impact. The interactions between these dimensions are conceptually discussed. This study introduces three dimensions of the impact of implementing BCT in SCM: ‘operations and processes’, ‘supply chain relationships’, and ‘innovation and data access’. These dimensions are interrelated and have overlapping areas within them, which leads to synergetic and counter-synergetic effects. The overlaps and synergies of the three dimensions of impact are illustrated, and the virtuous and vicious cycles of BCT adoption in SCM cases are highlighted. This study assists scholars and practitioners by clarifying the synergetic relationships within the dimensions of the impact of BCT in SCM and by providing considerations to prevent undesirable effects and expand desired ones. </jats:p>",

Five physicochemical parameters were monitored in all groundwater samples from 2008 to 2017 to identify major differences between the wells, assess temporal variations and understand the capacity for rainfall to alter groundwater pollution loadings. Multivariate discriminant analysis showed statistically significant differences between the six sampled wells based on the analyzed parameters (Wilks' lambda: 0.001; <jats:italic>F</jats:italic> = 26.2; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.0000). Principal component analysis revealed two significant factors, including factor 1 which explained 32.8% of the variance (suggesting that the quality of the groundwater was mainly controlled by nitrate) and factor 2, accounting for 16.2% of the total variance (which corresponded to KMnO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/oxidizability and to a lesser extent, pH). The time series data showed disparate trends, with nitrate concentrations increasing, whereas pH and KMnO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> decreased, while electrical conductivity and chloride levels remained stable. Although rainfall can impact groundwater pollution loadings through dilution processes in aquifers, the resulting fluctuations in physicochemical parameters are complicated by variations in rainfall events and local topography, as well as from climate change. Therefore, it is important to predict the contamination of groundwater quality in the future using machine learning algorithms using artificial neural network or similar methods. Multivariate statistical techniques are useful in verifying temporal and spatial variations caused by anthropogenic factors and natural processes linked to rainfall. The resulting identified risks to groundwater quality would provide the basis for further groundwater protection, particularly for decisions regarding permitted land use in recharge zones.\n</jats:p>",

Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is the most common method for alternative selection in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM). However, complex information is mixed with ambiguity and uncertainty, which makes decision makers unable to use precise or crisp numbers, so fuzzy numbers are presented to remedy this difficulty. Therefore, this research proposes a fuzzy additive preference programming (FAPP) to select the optimum SMS for a supply chain. FAPP method can produce the unique normalized optimal priority vector of fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices for SMS selection effectively with linear constraints. The additive linear constraints can eliminate the weaknesses of existing methods and equalize the upper and lower triangular fuzzy judgments. In addition, the proposed method can identify abnormal pairs of fuzzy judgments that cause inconsistency. The proposed methodology can prioritize the key criteria which lead to the selection of the most appropriate SMS. An example of SMS selection in a rubber factory demonstrates the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

Developing countries are considered the new fertile territory for developing global chains for multinational enterprises (MNEs). Despite the positive outcomes derived from this global development, it also induces negative impacts in the domain of domestic firms' competition, education, welfare and infrastructure system. A way to overcome this pessimistic view has been found in corporate social responsibility (CSR) best practices. MNEs seek to involve local stakeholders in their social activities to show their commitment and generate innovations. It calls for a multi‐tier domestic involvement integrated into a global supply chain to create value. This study builds its empirical analysis exploring a range of 1547 Chinese manufacturing multinational enterprises listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges between 2010 and 2018. The findings revealed that multi‐tier supply chain integration (SCI) practices positively moderate the relationship between CSR and MNE performance. In turn, it implies benefits for developing sustainable development goals, generating new job opportunities mostly in the developing countries guaranteeing wealth employment conditions. The sense of involvement and engagement towards their employees requires more development of CSR practices, which can be moderated by multi‐tier SCI, as shown in the present study.</jats:p>",

The existing studies on external publicity concentrate more on the information release of bilateral side, namely, on the side of information issuer, than on the side of information receiver, not to say, the perspective of the supply and demand deviation between media and audience. Based on the questionnaire and in-depth interviews, this paper has investigated the deviations between the information supply of Chinese Media and the information demand of the foreign residents in China, as well as the deviations of the information channels between Chinese Media and foreign residents in China. It is revealed that the factors of age, nationality, occupation, and the length of stay in China have exerted a significant influence on the preference of information needs and also the mode of their access to the information issued by Chinese media. Despite the fact that the current Chinese external publicity could meet the general needs of foreign residents, the awareness of targeted supply of information should be continuously improved. The influence of Chinese media on foreign residents is still limited, even though they undertake the responsibility of information dissemination in China and function as a bridge between China and western world. For this reason, there is still much room for the improvement in the scope of communication concept, communication methods, the media topics, as well as the effect of external publicity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. The practical operation of water supply networks, made of steel and gray cast iron, has proven that deposits accumulate on the inner surface of pipes under certain conditions. Deposition depends on the quality of transported water and the water flow regime, same as in gravity sewerage networks. A sediment layer accumulates in the flume of pipes if the actual flow rate is smaller than the minimum standard one. A layer of deposits in metal water pipes changes the value of the actual inner diameter of pipes and rises the pressure loss due to resistance along the pipeline length, which contributes to an increase in the energy consumption by the pumping equipment and affects the pressure value at the end point of a network. A layer of sediment in the flume of a gravity drainage network also rises losses along its length, slows down the flow rate and may block the water flow in the network. The purpose of the study is to find dependence between the remaining service life of water supply and sewerage networks, having internal deposits, and the thickness of the layer of deposits on pipe walls. Materials and methods. The authors use the dependences, that they have already derived for the hydraulic analysis of metal water supply networks and gravity sewerage networks, having internal deposits. Results. The authors have identified dependence between the remaining service life of water supply pipelines and sewerage systems and the thickness of deposits on the inner walls of pipes. Examples, confirming such a relationship, are provided. They are substantiated by graphs showing dependence between the remaining service life and the thickness of the layer of deposits in pipelines. A hydraulic criterion is proposed for projecting the term of operation of water supply and sewerage networks with internal deposits. Conclusions. The authors have proven the need to use special tables to analyze the characteristics of pipes within the framework of a hydraulic analysis of water supply and sewerage networks, having internal deposits.</jats:p>",

Preventive maintenance (PM) models were also constructed to determine the optimal PM strategy in alignment with specific scenarios that reflect the power performance requirements and resource limitations. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the design of experiments (DOE) scheme that simulated climate change and revealed that extreme climate worsens power-related efficiency measures.

In addition to its many positive features, this poses problems in terms of reactive power compensation. The large number of LEDs interacting with traditional reactive power compensators leads to a harmful phenomenon—overcompensation. This was experimentally determined in the investigated power distribution lines. Along with LEDs, a large number of devices with variable frequency drives (VFD) are connected to the same power distribution lines. This study presents an innovative approach to conventional diode rectifier supply side AC-DC-AC VFDs. It is proposed to use these VFDs as a reactive power compensation device while maintaining their main functions—motor powering and motor speed control. Minor improvements have been proposed to enable these VFDs to provide and draw out reactive power, thereby keeping power factors close to the unit in LED-loaded power distribution lines. The proposed improvements are based on the interaction between the power distribution lines inductivity and the DC circuit capacitance of the VFD. It has been shown that the power factor can be controlled by varying the capacity of the DC circuit. The ability of the AC-DC-AC VFD to compensate for the reactive power provided by the light-emitting diode lighting devices was confirmed by mathematical calculations and experimentally with a laboratory prototype.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The extensive interest in sustainable water management reflects the extent to which the global water landscape has changed in the past twenty years, which is a natural development of changes in water resources and an increase in the level of imbalance between water supply and demand. In this paper, a simulation model based on system dynamics (SD) methodology was developed to aid sustainable water management efforts in a semi-arid region. Six policy scenarios were used to study, analyze, and assess water management trends in the Southeast region of New Mexico, USA. The modeling process included two phases: calibration (2000–2015) and future prediction (2016–2050). Several statistical criteria were applied to assess the developed model performance. The findings revealed that the simulated outputs were in excellent agreement with the historical data, indicating accurate model simulation. The SD model’s determination coefficients ranged from 0.9288 to 0.9936 and the index of agreement values ranged from 0.9397 to 0.9958. Findings for the business-as-usual scenario indicated that total water withdrawals and total population will continue to rise, whereas groundwater storage, agricultural consumptive water use, and total consumptive water use will decrease over the simulated period. Sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation indicated that cultivated irrigated land change is the most influential parameter affecting groundwater storage, water supply storage change (total withdrawals), agricultural consumptive water use, and total consumptive water use. The changes occurring in the agricultural cultivated area had a great influence on controlling the groundwater system. Overall, the results showed that our SD model has been successful in capturing the system’s dynamic behavior, and confirmed its capability in modeling water management issues for policy and decision makers under semi-arid conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern conditions of industrial fish farming are accompanied by the uncontrolled influence of natural or man-made factors that affect water quality, which in turn affects the quality of products. One of the specific factors is the negative effect of microalgae and their toxins on water quality indicators. There is a need to create mechanisms to eliminate the factors of microalgae development and the manifestation of their toxins, if possible - the destruction of the toxins themselves. Industrial farms must have a system that can eliminate in a preventive automatic mode the negative effect of microalgae on the aquatic environment, while such a system must be safe for the environment and humans. Substantiation of technological and constructive solutions for the microalgae disinfection system operation using an adaptive approach to the structure in general, as well as individual blocks and units based on pulsed electrochemical methods as the main factors influencing water condition. The use of electrolytic methods of microalgae neutralization enables us to simultaneously realize the mechanism of change of toxic effect of aquatic organisms' urine when it is accumulating into nontoxic. This is done through the transformation, oxidation, and reduction of its aqueous solutions, which provides a change in the solution properties to optimal for plant nutrition. The use of electrolytic transformation methods is a new approach to the innovative technology of closed water supply systems (CWSS) for fisheries or greenhouse complexes, which can perform one, two, or more important tasks in a single technological cycle. The first one is the disinfection of hazardous bioagents as well as the destruction and removal of microalgae. The second one is the controlled transformation of the urine of aquatic organisms into a nutrient solution with the necessary ionic form for use by the plant root system. The third one is the synthesis and production of important components such as oxygen and hydrogen. The fourth one is the collection and subsequent use of the condensed fraction of microalgae. The main control parameter of water is light transmission - as a simplified, generalized indicator of the presence of microalgae in the aquatic environment. The system uses an effective process of destructive action on microalgae and their toxins - pulsed load current of electrodes with changes in its parameters and shape to prepare the water structure for better current effect due to cavitation blocks, which also destructively affect microalgae and toxins.  When changing light transmission and pH of the working solution, the parameters of the pulsed load current are also changed by the adaptive power supply source to the most efficient. The proposed solution can be improved by using known developments used for better water purification in adaptive water purification systems. One of the promising areas is the selection and direction of microalgae and the condensed fraction of aquatic organisms at the same time to the adaptive biogas system (ABS) to obtain quality organic fertilizers and biogas. Another area is creating adaptive control systems for water parameters for hydroponics and aquaponics systems. An important extra factor of the new technological approach is the use of an electrolyzer with an insoluble anode and oxygen membrane that can be injected into the aquatic environment with aquatic organisms, as well as hydrogen for use as a source of power or heat.</jats:p>"

The high voltage power source was created with the purpose of powering the electrospinning device using electronic waste from microwaves, air conditioners, and cars although it can also be modified to power devices such as X-ray machines or ozone generators. On the other hand, the dip coating device was assembled using spare parts from a discarded printer. The validation of their functioning was demonstrated through the presence of sufficiently high voltages and the synthesis of polymeric nanofibers, which were found to be comparable to those produced in a BIOINICIA FLUIDNATEK LE 10. The production of homogeneous films estimated to be of nanometric proportions validated the functioning of the dip coating device. Such equipment can benefit research in locations with a lack of funds, as it is far more economic than the devices from well-established companies.</jats:p>",

Proceeding from the context of confrontation with the People’s Republic of China, the Biden Administration’s strategy for global alliance is hinged on the notions of “identity politics” and “clash of civilizations.” Through these processes, the United States is rebuilding and reorganizing the global space of political economy. Today, the bilateral relations between the United States and China has moved beyond the scope of cooperation based on the “Kissinger Order” and has arrived at the system of confrontation. The Biden Administration is planning and building a new global alliance framework that is intended to keep China in check, and this framework is creating a post-Kissinger order. The new global framework includes alliances and gatherings of democratic countries(D-10 and Summits for Democracy), economic partnerships with allied and pro-US countries based on reorganizing global supply chains(IPEF), and expansion of various military security organizations(bilateral alliances, AUKUS, Quad, and Five Eyes). After the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden Administration’s global alliance strategy exhibits the hybrid characteristic of merging the security framework with the economic framework, the latter of which is represented by the reorganization of global supply chains.</jats:p>",

We estimate the ban's effects on ZTE's tier‐one US and non‐US suppliers, as well as the upstream and downstream supply chain propagation effects by considering ZTE's tier‐two suppliers and business customers. We also estimate impacts to ZTE's competitors. We find that tier‐one US suppliers experienced a stock price effect of −3.33% following the ban, and the reaction was more negative for those suppliers more dependent on ZTE for revenues. We find a stock price effect on tier‐two suppliers of −0.40%, but an insignificant effect on non‐US tier‐one suppliers. Business customers experienced a stock price effect of 0.66%, and the competitors' stock price effect was 1.34%.

This paper presents a three-level DMA, short-term water demand prediction method based on water use patterns, aiming to solve the problem of inaccurate water demand prediction caused by climate and social factors. Correlation analysis and factor analysis analyze the main factors affecting daily water demand changes. The extracted information of the main influencing factors and historical monitoring data are used to establish the Elman water demand prediction model. At the same time, the daily water consumption pattern was extracted by correlation analysis, matched with the water consumption pattern of the predicted day, and combined with the expected value of water demand for momentary water demand allocation, which improved the prediction accuracy of short-term water demand. This paper is based on the precise leakage location based on the real-time hydraulic model. The real-time hydraulic model under leakage conditions is established, GA and NSGA2 are designed, and the nondominated ranking algorithm with elite strategy is used to achieve accurate leakage location using hydraulic model calibration search. This paper uses a random matrix algorithm to establish the leakage estimation model. A laboratory case pipe network is built to simulate the water supply conditions in residential areas, and the operating data of the laboratory case pipe network are used to confirm that the random matrix leakage estimation model can estimate the leakage. The applicability of the random matrix leakage estimation model and the wavelet transform algorithm for leakage calculation are compared in an engineering example. The example confirms that the leakage amount calculated by the random matrix model has a less relative error and more similar trend than the wavelet transform algorithm.</jats:p>",

Due to the fact that nowadays big amount of work is done or monitored in the remote mode the requirement is stipulated for every specialist to be able to use digital technologies professionally. For a future seafarer it means, first of all, the ability to use modern technologies as the information and data resource and also it presupposes the ability to work with software libraries, to create data bases, to perform necessary calculations by means of cloud services inclusive. This component is of extreme practical importance as it enables the satisfaction of the social mandate to prepare future seafarers for the living in the information environment. The task is quite challenging so it requires the adequate knowledge level. That is why the main objective of the course “Information technologies” together with other subjects within the curriculum for the professional training in maritime academy is to develop the reliable scientific and methodological grounds for the realization of any professionally related tasks of future merchant feet officers. Specially selected tasks acquaint cadets with information technology in terms of implementing the solution of applied professionally oriented tasks, such as navigating the course, determining the location of the vessel, calculating stocks for the trip, etc. Therefore, the obligatory elements of the tasks are: construction of mathematical (computer) models;analysis of possible solutions to the problem; of technological processes, taking into account all factors influencing the process and methods of decision-making;implementation of mathematical models of problems in spreadsheets. This article proposes a strategy for solving an applied problem using an information-modeling approach to the analysis and evaluation of the technological process, namely, the algorithm for calculating the required voyage and storm fuel reserves of a marine vessel. Both office spreadsheets and cloud services were used to implement the mathematical model for solving this problem. The use of “cloud computing” technologies in the training of seafarers is due to the fact that, firstly, while on board, the master or ship mechanic can perform some components of their work, especially joint projects, in modern services, and secondly, these technologies, supporting traditional forms of education, is a new stage in the development of education and a cost-effective, efficient and flexible way to meet the needs of students in acquiring new knowledge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article presents the results of the application of modern systems for modeling and forecasting the production process of lentils in the Southern Steppe of Ukraine. The correlation-regression analysis shows the high reliability and practical value of the obtained mathematical models of growing lentils for grain depending on the conventional tillage, fertilizer rate, and plant density under different moisture conditions; that is confirmed by the curves based on the experimental data and calculations. Mathematical models of lentils grain yield under different moisture conditions were compiled according to the obtained regression coefficients and free members: without irrigation - Y=1,5896+0,0032×Х1+0,0007×Х2-0,2561×Х3, and when applying irrigation Y=1,0200+0,0051×Х1+0,0022×Х2+0,2656×Х3. The following results were obtained for the dependent variable for different conditions of moisture supply after conducting a regression-normalized analysis of the researched factors in view of yield of lentils, where: in variant without irrigation R = 0.7059; R2 = 0.4983; adjusted R2 = 0.4682; F (3,50) = 16,551 p &lt;0,00000 and standard estimation error was 0,1232; in variant with irrigation R = 0,6131; R2 = 0.3759; adjusted R2 = 0.3385; F (3.50) = 10.04 p &lt;0.00003 and the standard estimation error was 0,2591. Nonlinear multilayer artificial neuron models have been developed for the first time to predict lentils grain yields. Generalized regression artificial neural network GRNN (4-12-7-1) with 12 neurons in the first hidden layer and seven ones in the second hidden layer; learning productivity was 0.215; control productivity was 0.290; test productivity was 0.362; learning error was 0.136; control error was 0.049; test error was 0.066. Taking into account nonlinear patterns of factor effect on lentils grain yield the multiple correlation was 0.96. Based on the results of ranking the researched factors' effect on the dynamics of formation and yield of lentils, it was found that moisture conditions (water consumption, m3/ha) with an impact factor of 4.21 which exceeds other researched factors by almost 2.2 times, are in the first place. Plant density (million/ha) was in second place with a factor of 1.62. The rate of mineral fertilizers (kg/ha of active substance) was in third place, which was slightly inferior to the density of standing plants, resulting in a total of 1.61. The depth of tillage (cm) was in the last fourth place with an impact factor of 1.01.</jats:p>"

Closed-loop supply chains do not end with the delivery of the finished products to the end customers, the process continues until economic value is obtained from the returned products or they are disposed properly in landfills. Incorporating reverse flows in supply chains increases the uncertainty and complexity, as well as complicating the management of supply chains that are already composed of different actors and have a dynamic structure. Since agent-based modeling and simulation is a more efficient method of handling the dynamic and complex nature of supply chains than the traditional analytical methods, in this study agent-based modeling methodology has been used to model a generic closed-loop supply chain network design problem with the aims of integrating customer behavior into the network, coping with the dynamism, and obtaining a more realistic structure by eliminating the required assumptions for solving the model with analytical methods. The actors in the CLSC network have been defined as agents with goals, properties and behaviors. In the proposed model dynamic customer arrivals, the changing aspects of customers' purchasing preferences for new and refurbished products and the time, quantity and quality uncertainties of returns have been handled via the proposed agent-based architecture. To observe the behavior of the supply chain in several conditions various scenarios have been developed according to different parameter settings for the supplier capacities, the rate of customers being affected by advertising, the market incentive threshold values, and the environmental awareness of customers. From the scenarios, it has been concluded that the system should be fed in the right amounts for the new and refurbished products to increase the effectiveness of factors such as advertising, incentives, and environmental awareness for achieving the desired sales amounts and cost targets.</jats:p>",

The aim of the chapter is to uncover and analyse the challenges imposed by COVID-19 to the retail sector as well as possible solutions implemented in order to overcome such difficulties. The chapter reports the case study of the largest retailer in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although seeing sales increase, the managers had many difficulties on the side of procurement and distribution of goods. The performance monitoring system was suddenly insufficient to manage the emergency. The solutions concerned the adjustment of the algorithms with dynamic components addition to KPIs and the conversion of some efficiency targets into effective ones. The chapter suggests insights on how performance measurement systems can be designed and developed in advance to allow more dynamism during emergencies. </jats:p>",

The mill manufactures Fruit Fresh Bunch FFB from all channels and sells CPO with low Free Fatty Acid (FFA) CPO for foods and CPO for industrial. CPO with low FFA for export consists of premium-grade CPO with FFA level &lt; 2% and super-grade CPO with FFA level &lt;3.5%. This Low FFA CPO is exported for food to developed countries. The food industry as a CPO customer needs a lot of information about the origin of the CPO commodity and information about sustainable oil palm agriculture governance. The challenges of building low FFA CPO traceability system raw material of CPO come from three-channel of FFB procurement and produce the various quality of CPO. This study aims to map the FFB supply at PT. RSI from Roundtable on Sustainability Palm Oil (RSPO) certificate farm in independent smallholders groups channel in the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network and smart contract. The interaction of entities with smart contracts is described in the ERD diagram, and the form of collaboration between entities is illustrated in the sequence diagram. The design of blockchain network of FFB supply and traceability of FFB from independent smallholders group procurement channel was based on CPO sales data from the exporter. The contribution of independent smallholders group channels to produce low FFA CPO was calculated. By presenting the CPO supply system on a map, independent smallholders’ farms’ source of low FFA CPO can be identified. Finally, various sustainable information in the farms can be shared.</jats:p>",

As for a tourism O2O, i.e., online to offline, supply chain, the tourism platform sells the product online, and the tour operator provides services offline. (2) Methods: We establish a game theory model and study the optimal strategies of supply chain members in two scenarios (decentralized and centralized) when the online platform does not adopt or adopts blockchain technology. Then, we introduce a two-part tariff contract for coordination. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of the cost of adopting blockchain technology, disclosing information and the proportion of information-sensitive consumers on the optimal strategies. (3) Conclusions: When the costs of adopting blockchain technology and information disclosure are low, if the proportion of information-sensitive consumers is large, adopting blockchain technology is beneficial to supply chain members. Compared with a wholesale price contract, a two-part tariff contract can encourage the platform to improve information disclosure quality, so the tour operator can adjust their cooperation contract to achieve Pareto improvements. Under a two-part tariff contract, the tourism platforms are more likely to disclose information and can effectively regulate the operational performance of the tourism O2O supply chain.</jats:p>"

We used the water quality data generated monthly at 17 water quality monitoring networks (WQMNs) in Seoul for 18 years, from 2002 to 2019. Results of the research show that the monthly S-WQI showed an average 70 out of 100, ‘good (II)’ grades, whereas the average water quality grade according to the environmental standards was ‘slightly good (II),’ with an R2 value of 0.8298. The annual S-WQI was found to be 39 (bad) to 97 (very good), with an average of 72 (good). Through this study, S-WQI, a customized WQI for urban rivers, was judged to be a reasonable index that can represent the characteristics of urban river water quality. This is because it is easy to apply and is a calculation method that uses relatively fewer water quality items than the WQI calculated in the past, and it is highly likely to be linked to the currently implemented water quality grade system. In addition, to extend the application of WQI to various water quality survey points, based on the calculation methodology performed to derive the indices in this study, such as modified S-WQI (MS-WQI), by adding new water quality items and changing some items, it is also possible to develop an advanced customized WQI for urban rivers considering watershed characteristics and measurement items.</jats:p>",

We extend this incipient research stream by drawing on information economics and Penrose's resource‐based view of the firm to theorize about how financial markets act as a source of information and influence exchange activities in the agricultural commodity supply chain. We test our hypotheses in the U.S. agricultural commodities context, specifically the U.S. rice industry, using a novel data set that combines financial market data with proprietary data on exchanges between farmers and customers. Time series econometric analyses reveal that information from financial markets influences exchanges between farmers and customers, but it has asymmetric effects depending on exchange dynamics and local market conditions. Overall, our analyses support our hypotheses and advance supply chain research by building theory about market‐based exchange dynamics and by broadening the scope of mechanisms through which financial institutions impact exchange activities. For practice, we offer quantitative insights that can be leveraged by farmers and purchasing managers. For policymakers, we offer timely guidance related to the provision of information and the ‘real’ implications of financial markets.</jats:p>",

The CL supply chain can serve as a good example of an environment‐friendly and sustainable solution because it assumes waste reduction and further usage in production. Hence, the notion of the CL supply chain is premised on the design, control and operation of a system that creates extra value using the entire product life cycle and capture value recovery from various returns over time. In practice, a successful integration of CL principles depends on many contextual factors. This study aimed to identify the factors that support and discourage CL supply chain innovations in emerging markets. The study employed institutional theory as theoretical background and conducted an in‐depth case analysis of a Russian waste management company to present empirical evidence. The results showed that cooperation with an experienced and legitimate partner can drive the introduction of a CL initiative. Meanwhile, a low level of knowledge and trust might become a serious impediment. Thus, investment in knowledge dissemination and reputation building are crucial in an emerging market.</jats:p>",

The research is aiming to precise the modern situation of traditional water supply systems estimating the possible ways of theirs sustainable development and revitalization. The research conducted on the case grounds mainly with field studies and interview methods. The water supply system of M’zab has been implemented more than eight centuries ago and is still in use. It is a complex hydraulic system based on the principle of total utilization of torrent water and on the equitable division of this water over the entire oasis. Local people now beginning to understand its cultural significance aiming to popularise it. Miyakojima Island medieval water supply underground system consist of the network of cave sources integrated with architecture. Now it is in decay not using like a source of potable water but still preserving some sacral significance with not pointing on popularization. For the sustainability and revitalization of the traditional water supply systems now it is not enough to preserve their initial function but also need to develop the potency of tourist attraction with reservation as cultural property.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a different magnetic parts design and manufacturing techniques of power supplies, design and selection criteria of switching elements as well as the optimal design of control loops based on small-signal stability modeling and an appropriate stability criterion. The designed telecom power supply consists of the power factor correction (PFC) stage to increase the input power factor and the isolated phase-shift pulse width modulation (PWM) zero-voltage switching (ZVS) DC–DC converter stage to regulate the supply voltage to the specified load value while maintaining a high conversion efficiency. A two-stage outdoor telecom power supply with a power rating of 2 kW was designed and fabricated on a printed circuit board (PCB). The distinct two-stage power components of the power supply were subjected to loss analysis. Furthermore, PSIM simulation and experiments were used to demonstrate the total harmonic distortions (THDs), voltage ripples, power efficiency, and PF performance of the supply current for the proposed power supply under various operating situations. This work produces an industrial high power density power supply with a high PF, low THD and high conversion efficiency which is suitable for telecom power server applications.</jats:p>"

The methodological approach used in this study is that of a relational database combining attribute and spatial data. The result of this work is a user-friendly interface that facilitates consultation and data entry on the boreholes. Spatial and statistical analyses show an uneven distribution of boreholes throughout the study area. Furthermore, all the boreholes in these two departments have flow rates classified as low and the most productive alteration thicknesses are between 15 and 30 m. The optimal depth of drilling in this area can be defined between 60 and 90 m. Finally, it appears from this analysis that, among all the lithological formations in these departments, the shales are the most productive. This database constitutes a real decision support tool for managers for the planning and evaluation of drilling.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the tremendous socioeconomic importance of supply chains (SCs), security officers and operators are faced with no easy and integrated way for protecting their critical, and interconnected, infrastructures from cyber-attacks. As a result, solutions and methodologies that support the detection of malicious activity on SCs are constantly researched into and proposed. Hence, this work presents the implementation of a low-cost reconfigurable intrusion detection system (IDS), on the edge, that can be easily integrated into SC networks, thereby elevating the featured levels of security. Specifically, the proposed system offers real-time cybersecurity intrusion detection over high-speed networks and services by offloading elements of the security check workloads on dedicated reconfigurable hardware. Our solution uses a novel framework that implements the Aho–Corasick algorithm on the reconfigurable fabric of a multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC), which supports parallel matching for multiple network packet patterns. The initial performance evaluation of this proof-of-concept shows that it holds the potential to outperform existing software-based solutions while unburdening SC nodes from demanding cybersecurity check workloads. The proposed system performance and its efficiency were evaluated using a real-life environment in the context of European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, i.e., CYRENE.</jats:p>"

The government has implemented large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) as an effort to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. With the PSBB, it causes disruption to the hospital supply chain management. As a step to anticipate the hospital's impact on the PSBB, the hospital needs to evaluate the performance of supply chain management. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the performance evaluation of hospital supply chain management using a balanced scorecard approach. A new finding from this study is to measure the performance of hospitals experiencing various disruptions in their supply chain management caused by the COVID-19 pandemic with a balanced scorecard. The author concludes that measurements with the balanced scorecard approach can provide information about the performance of hospital supply chain management broadly in areas experiencing disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </jats:p>",

This paper investigates a two-tier supply chain composed of a supplier and a capital-constricted manufacturer with carbon reduction demand under different low-carbon policies (Cap-and-Trade Regulation and Carbon Tax Policy, respectively). The manufacturer is motivated to cooperate with the supplier to reduce carbon emissions through EPC services. Different from other research, the emission reduction decision maker of EPC services in this paper could be any supply chain member. The results show that cap-and-trade regulation and carbon tax policy have the same impact on the optimal pricing and emission reduction decisions in the monopoly supply chain, but the manufacturer’s profit is higher under cap-and-trade regulation. And when the cost-sharing coefficient is within a low range, the emission reduction targets decided by the manufacturer are lower. Otherwise, the targets decided by the supplier are lower. Moreover, supply chain members can obtain higher profits when the reduction targets are determined by themselves, and supply chain coordination under different decision models could be realized through revenue sharing contracts. Considering the total profit of the supply chain, when the cost-sharing rate is within a low range, the supply chain can achieve a Pareto improvement if the supplier determines the emission reduction targets. Otherwise, the reduction targets decided by the manufacturer can realize a Pareto improvement.</jats:p>",

In doing so, we analyzed a panel of annual data from 133 countries from 2008 to 2014. We apply a generalized stochastic frontier model, which allows us to differentiate between persistent and transient inefficiency, as well as individual effects. Our results indicate a threshold level in terms of a country’s development that needs to be obtained to benefit from increasing renewable energy involvement over time. However, if this threshold level is obtained, productivity gains are evident. We also found that the role of the energy supply in aggregate production is nontrivial. That is, its inclusion changes the relationship between key input factors (capital and labor) by decreasing their overall elasticities and increasing the observed economies of scale.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Late Triassic, a global environmental change called the Carnian Pluvial Episode (CPE) emerged, causing major biological turnover. The CPE has been recognized by siliciclastic input to sedimentary basins, multiple carbon isotope perturbations, and climate proxies for humidification. The CPE is considered to have been associated with increased atmospheric <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from eruptions of large igneous provinces. However, the nature of this global environmental perturbation on the continents is still not well understood. Here we present a geochemical analysis of a pelagic deep-sea bedded chert sequence across the CPE in the Jurassic accretionary complex of Mino terrane, central Japan. Fluctuations in terrigenous material supply were reconstructed using Principal Component Analysis of major element compositions. The first principal component positively correlates with elements enriched in clay minerals such as Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, whereas it negatively correlates with CaO, P<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>, and MnO, derived from apatite and manganese. A sudden increase in terrigenous supply was detected around the Julian/Tuvalian boundary, suggesting that CPE-related siliciclastic input also occurred in the abyssal plain environment. The terrigenous supply returned to the pre-CPE state in the Tuvalian. Since the terrigenous material supplied to the abyssal plain is thought to be derived from eolian dust blown from continental arid regions, the increasing terrigenous supply detected in the pelagic deep-sea chert succession may indicate extensive aridification. This result seems to conflict with the common view of the CPE as a humidification event. This contradiction possibly suggests that the extensive aridification occurred within the interior of the supercontinent Pangea, while hydrological circulation enhanced on the coastal region during the CPE.</jats:p>"

As a case study it was applied to the residential energy demands of the L’Illa Perduda neighbourhood, located in the east of the city of Valencia and consisting of 4194 residential cells. In total, eight different alternatives were studied according to the load curve, the power of the system, the mode of operation and the distribution of the fuel cells. In this way, the advantages and disadvantages of each configuration were found. This information, together with the previous study of the energy characteristics of the neighbourhood, enabled selection of the most promising configuration and to decide whether or not to recommend investment. The chosen configuration was a centralised system of phosphoric acid fuel cells in cogeneration, with approximately 4 MW of thermal power and an operating mode that varied according to the outside temperature. In this way, when heating is required, the plant adjusts its production to the thermal demand, and when cooling is required, the plant follows the electrical demand. This configuration presented the best energy results, as it achieved good coverage of thermal (62.5%) and electrical (88.1%) demands with good primary energy savings (28.36 GWh/year). However, due to the high power of the system and low maturity (i.e., high costs) of this technology, would be necessary to make a large initial economic investment of 15.2 M€.</jats:p>"

Under well-watered conditions, canopy transpiration (Ec) could potentially be continuously calculated from stem water potential (Ψstem), but only if the root to stem hydraulic conductance (Kr-s) remains constant and plant capacitance is relatively small. We tested whether such an approach is viable by investigating whether Kr-s remains constant under a wide range of daytime transpiration rates in non-water-stressed plants. Optical dendrometers were used to continuously monitor tissue shrinkage, an accurate proxy of Ψstem, while Ec was manipulated in three species with contrasting morphological, anatomical, and phylogenetic identities: Tanacetum cinerariifolium, Zea mays, and Callitris rhomboidea. In all species, we found Kr-s to remain constant across a wide range of Ec, meaning that the dynamics of Ψstem could be used to monitor Ec. This was evidenced by the close agreement between measured Ec and that predicted from optically measured Ψstem. These results suggest that optical dendrometers enable both plant hydration and Ec to be monitored non-invasively and continuously in a range of woody and herbaceous species. This technique presents new opportunities to monitor transpiration under laboratory and field conditions in a diversity of woody, herbaceous, and grassy species.</jats:p>",

A total biogas potential of 400 329 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year was estimated from area using agricultural residues and livestock wastes, thus capable of establishing biogas plants in a centralized (20 to 100 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) or decentralized (2 to 20 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) manner. For the three scenarios were considered in this study, i.e., (I) combined electricity and thermal energy generation, (II) for direct cooking, and (III) according to energy requirements, a maximum electricity generation and thermal energy potential were estimated to up to 800 658 and 1 200 988 kWh. A maximum amount of 162 646 kg.year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> of firewood, 443 190 kg.year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> of dung cake, 70 996 kg.year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> of charcoal and 13 713 kg of liquified petroleum gas could be replaced using produced raw biogas, which is even higher if the biogas is upgraded. In the third scenario, a maximum surplus amount of 169 894 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>.year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> of raw biogas and 221 969 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>.year<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> of upgraded biogas are available if all the available wastes are co‐digested. Vast cost opportunities and greenhouse gas emission reduction could result from replacing conventional cooking fuel and chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizer, contributing to the local circular economy. Eventually, the study proposes and discusses a self‐resilient bio‐energy model comprising energy demand fulfillment, sustainability, and a circular economy for rural India. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

A series of physicochemical characterization and adsorption studies were conducted for biochar pyrolysed from bamboo, dried leaves, wood shavings, rice husk, tree branch and wood chip, in a stainless-steel canister (without oxygen) at 600oC for three hours using a muffle furnace. Bamboo was the only precursor which fulfilled the requirements for water treatment in rural areas, i.e., biochar yield, structural integrity in water and adsorption characteristics. The pyrolysis of bamboo achieved a biochar yield of 32.8%, which attributed to the high fixed carbon content of 70.9% required for adsorption. The biochar consisted of homogeneous carbon structures with BET surface area of 317 m2/g, total pore volume of 0.189 cm3/g and micropores averaging 1.218 nm, which demonstrated favourable adsorption characteristics. The selection of bamboo as precursor is practical in rural areas as it is easily obtained and safe to be pyrolyzed into biochar. The application of biochar for water treatment helps to overcome the water supply issues and promote sustainable biomass waste management in rural areas.</jats:p>"

To establish warning levels and anticipate future blood needs, an estimate of the current carriers of rare blood groups, both potential patients or donors, is crucial but complex. Indeed, if the strict needs can be estimated in medical terms, the modalities of blood product collection must be considered from an interdisciplinary perspective, at the interface of biological data and social norms. Here, we aim to understand how legal choices and a set of representations of otherness may influence the supply of rare blood for SSAA populations. After examining these issues, considering different norms and limits that govern French society, we compare this data with those of four Western countries facing the same difficulties (United States, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands). This work began as part as the reflections of Social Lab, an institutional programme created by the French Blood Establishment (EFS). How can we effectively improve the qualitative blood coverage for SSAA populations? There is no unique solution, but there are many more or less effective answers. Comparison across countries reveals a strong influence of the socio‐political histories and ethical choices before technical and medical considerations. We consider that an institutional policy is required to resolve recruitment issues of SSAA donors sustainably. Lastly, we introduce a working group called the EFS Social Lab, which aims to set up a monitoring mechanism for donors and societal trends to make blood donation effective.</jats:p>",

One of the most crucial factors is the company’s stewardship of the environment, but economic factors must be regarded when keeping the environment clean by balancing the economic situation to make a profit. This study extracts the barriers to implementing SSCM from previous studies, adapts these barriers to the healthcare industry, and ranks them using a hybrid best-worst method (BWM) and combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method. The result indicates that hospital 7 should rank SSCM higher than the other six healthcare centers evaluated. Moreover, among the barriers, high disposal costs is the most crucial factor when considering implementing SSCM.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The reverse supply chain (RSC) recently attracted many Vietnamese authorities, enterprises and academia owing to the rise of concern on the environment and regulations of waste process. Along with rapid development, Vietnamese manufacturing network has become tightly strained when the end-of-life (EOL) items are not taken back by their manufacturers but end up being processed disorderly in different local businesses. A distressing example is the waste of imported solar panels in Vietnam. Since the number of solar panels has grown steadily in Vietnam recently, we speculate that the network flows of EOL solar panel of Vietnam will be very large and complex in a few years. In order to help Vietnamese government establish efficiently RSC, our paper will apply the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and demonstrate an optimized solution for the RSC of EOL solar panel in Ho Chi Minh City. Indeed, via our collected data from current financial market of Ho Chi Minh city, our MILP shows that the optimal cost-reduction is 11219 USD, even with limited constraints of only two landfills and very few collection facilities in Ho Chi Minh city at the moment. This result of our proposed RSC demonstrates that a significant profit is definitely possible when the number of collection facilities in Ho Chi Minh city increase in the future. Also, our MILP approach is flexible for decision-makers to achieve a satisfactory solution.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited. </jats:p>"

This article partially analyzes the factors affecting the oils of power transformers and autotransformers used in the agricultural sector. It is known that transformer oil performs the functions of cooling and insulation. During use, the oil is in direct contact with air through the respiratory system. There is a process of transition of moisture and various gases in the composition of the air into the composition of the oil. By the composition of gases, it is possible to determine the reasons for the deterioration in the quality of the main and additional insulation of oil-immersed power transformers. The issues of influence on the state of insulation of marsh gases appearing inside (at the bottom) of the tank of oil transformers and partial discharges in oil-gas medium have been little studied.</jats:p>",

An emerging body of research concerning the possible physiological and psychological side effects of hormonal contraception has been published over the past two decades. Consequently, discontinuing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) as a conscious decision for reasons other than desired pregnancy has become increasingly common for menstruating individuals. The question remains as to what physical and psychological consequences can be observed after discontinuing COCs. In addition, the consequent healthcare needs and situations of affected individuals in Germany have not been explored. This study aims to gain greater insight into the relationship between discontinuation of COCs and (1) possible health consequences, and (2) to explore the supply situation for affected women within the German healthcare system.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods and analysis</jats:title><jats:p>Qualitative episodic interviews with women who discontinue COC therapy will explore possible health consequences, and their current healthcare needs and situations in Germany.

Thus, this paper introduces green factors to the existing closed-loop supply chain network models and studies the impact of carbon trading, green innovation efforts, and green consumers on the choice between two remanufacturing strategies: an in-house remanufacturing strategy and an authorized remanufacturing strategy. The results concerning the choice of the remanufacturing strategy are as follows: from the perspective of obtaining more profits, when the carbon trading price is low, the companies choose the authorized remanufacturing strategy; when the carbon trading price is high, the companies choose to remanufacture by themselves. For all the green innovation efforts and the proportions of green consumers, when the recovery rate of the used product is low, the companies choose to remanufacture by themselves; when the recovery rate of the used product is high, the companies choose the authorized remanufacturing strategy.</jats:p>"

Especially the heat supply requires innovative concepts. In many districts, renewable energy resources are limited, and district heat supply relies on energy imports from the upstream energy infrastructures, especially the gas and electricity grid. These upstream infrastructures are in an ongoing process of transformation into a renewable energy system with uncertain speed and depth. To design future-proof heat supply concepts, this work presents a scenario-based design approach considering different scenario paths for the upstream energy infrastructures as well as the development of the existing building stock. Therefore, a mixed-integer linear programming model is set up to optimize the energy converter and storage capacities of a generic district heat supply with respect to costs and emission. Additionally, three different refurbishment scenarios are considered for the existing buildings stock. From the results of the different scenarios, future-proof heat supply concepts are derived. The analysis shows that heat-pump capacities in combination with a thermal storage is of great importance for a future carbon-neutral heat supply. A combined heat and power unit helps to reduce emissions in short term. However, only if the gas network has a high share of renewable energies, this technology will compete with electricity based heating via heat-pumps. The results show that electrolysis is at least in short term not a viable option for designing a cost-efficient carbon-neutral district heat supply.</jats:p>",

Multiple linear regression has been created with which stakeholders and water and sewerage specialists can shape changes in value-added variation, the average cost per employee, labor productivity, and energy expenditure on the net profit of water operators and sewerage. The results indicated that the independent variables used, such as value-added, labor productivity, or intangible assets have a direct influence on increasing the net profit of water and sewerage companies. Other independent variables such as the average cost per employee or the expenditure on electricity and water negatively influence the increase in the net profit of companies in the water and sewerage sector. The conclusions indicated that the average net profit is influenced by independent variables and the model created, and it can be successfully applied to other international companies in the field.</jats:p>"

It is urgent to establish a perfect diversified pension service supply model. The theory of welfare pluralism advocates the participation of multiple subjects in social old-age services and emphasizes that social organizations play an important role in the provision of old-age services. This paper, under the perspective of welfare pluralism, discusses the problems and reasons existing in the endowment service supply in our country, and on the basis of the advanced international experience, it puts forward a new mode for resolving the problems in the endowment service supply, namely the “116 endowment service supply model”. This mode advocates that a top-level design at the national level is necessary, together with cooperation among the community, family, workplace, folk society, market and school in the national endowment service information platform, aiming at building a unified, coordinated and complementary model of diversified elderly care service supply.</jats:p>"

Observing this phenomenon, this paper studies the advertising strategy of a dual-channel retailer. In this paper, we build stylized game models for the retailer’s price and advertising levels on online and offline channels, respectively. Our contribution is to provide prescriptions for how dual-channel retailers make price and advertise decisions and determine which channel is more profitable for retailers. We find that advertising discounts are not always harming the retailer’s profits. The level of advertising discounts causes retailers to increase the selling price when consumers engage in online shopping. Also, we derive that retailers can choose the sales channels based on the level of consumers’ channel preference of consumers. Interestingly, an increase in the level of advertising discounts will contribute to the growth of the retailer’s profit. Finally, by numerical analysis, we demonstrate the robustness of the results.</jats:p>"

Çalışma, Türkiye istatistik Kurumu (TUİK) veri tabanı ile Eurostat veri tabanı 2015-2019 ve 2008-2020 dönemlerine ilişkin veriler ışığında gerçekleştirilmiştir. Araştırmada daha çok son 5 yıllık süreçte gelinen durumun belirlenmesi ve değişimlerin vurgulanması amaçlanmıştır. Temel istatistiki göstergeler eşliğinde kadın çalışanların eğitim durumu için Türkiye’deki mevcut yapı ayrı değerlendirilmiş, bunun yanı sıra Türkiye ve AB 27 ülke gurubu için sadece eğitimin etkileri karşılaştırılmıştır. Bununla birlikte önemli parametrelerin ölçülmesinde temel araçlar olarak; işveren olarak kadın çalışanlar, işgücüne katılımı, tarım ve tarım dışı sektörlerde kayıt dışılıkları ve aile işçisi olarak çalışanların istihdam içindeki oranı bakılmıştır. Ayrıca yarı-zamanlı çalışanlar, mesleki guruplarına göre istihdam edilme konumları ile 3 yaşın altında çocuğu olan/olmayan kadın çalışanlar gibi değişkenlere bakılarak durum değerlendirmesi yapılmıştır. Çalışmanın sonucunda, Türkiye’de yüksekokul, fakülte ve yüksek lisans ve doktora mezunu kadın sayısının giderek artış gösterdiği ve Türkiye’nin AB 27 ülke gurubuna nazaran bu anlamda daha ilerde olduğu görülmüştür. Kadın işgücünün son yıllarda eğitim düzeyinin artmasıyla çok daha farklı iş kollarında istihdam edildiği görülmektedir. Genellikle kadınların tarım ve yarı zamanlı ev tipi işlerde çalışma hayatında yer aldığı görülmesine rağmen bilişsel becerileri nedeniyle de daha çok hizmet sektöründe yoğunlaştıkları görülmüştür. Söz konusu çalışma alanları nedeniyle işgücüne katılım oranı içinde son beş yılda kadın sayısının erkeklerin yarısına kadar ulaşması kanıtlar nitelikte olduğu söylenebilir.</jats:p>"

O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar as densidades de cianobactérias e suas possíveis correlações com parâmetros físico-químicos nas águas captadas nos rios para o abastecimento do município de Joinville, a fim de verificar quais os fatores envolvidos no crescimento desses organismos entre os anos de 2015 e 2019. As quantidades de células de cianobactérias por mililitro de água dos últimos cinco anos dos rios Cubatão e Piraí foram analisadas a partir dos certificados de análise disponibilizados pela atual prestadora de serviços de abastecimento de água do município de Joinville. Constatou-se que os valores das densidades de cianobactérias aumentaram significativamente em ambos os rios a partir do ano de 2018. Os parâmetros físico-químicos analisados apresentaram baixa correlação com a densidade de cianobactérias entre 2015 e 2019 para os rios Cubatão e Piraí. Na tentativa de compreender esse aumento de cianobactérias, fatores climáticos como precipitação e média de temperatura anual foram estudados. O aumento expressivo na precipitação no mês de janeiro de 2018, seguido de um período de diminuição das chuvas, além do aumento gradativo da temperatura nos últimos anos, podem estar relacionados a essa elevação da densidade de cianobactérias entre 2018 e 2019, sendo necessário um acompanhamento dessa evolução nos rios de abastecimento da cidade de Joinville.</jats:p>"

Meanwhile, the used products can be recycled by the retail, the third party, or both. We developed nine Stackelberg game models and derived the optimal decision and the equilibrium revenue of all members. Then, the optimal subsidy intensity, retail price, and wholesale price under different scenarios were compared theoretically. Finally, we analyzed the sensitivity of all stakeholders' optimal decisions and revenue to important parameters. Some novel and meaningful conclusions were established: (a) Government directly subsidy for remanufacturing has the same effect as subsidy for recycling; (b) it is better for the government directly subside manufacturing when two recyclers participate under the uncertainty of manufacturing cost or potential market; (c) all members should intervene the recycling cost coefficient, the costs saved of remanufacturing unit used product, and the price elasticity coefficient; (d) it is a conservative and effective strategy for the government to directly subside consumption activities.</jats:p>",

The differences in the quality safety, price, and market demand of agri-foods in the supply chain are compared and analyzed. The study found that the maximum profit of supply chain participants decreases with the increase of price elasticity of demand. When the quality of agri-foods is upgraded in a producer-led manner, the quality of agri-foods in the supply chain does not undergo substantial improvement, and the maximum profit of agri-foods operators is insensitive to the price elasticity of demand at this time. When the seller-led quality upgrading is launched, the maximum profit of the producer decreases with the increase of the quality elasticity of demand, the maximum profit of the seller increases with the increase of the quality elasticity of demand, and the total profit of the supply chain also increases with the increase of the quality elasticity of demand under the centralized decision situation. The quality and safety of agri-foods as well as the overall profit of the supply chain can be improved most effectively under the centralized control decision with the goal of maximizing the supply chain benefits. In terms of quality and price, quality improvement actions of agri-foods driven by supply-side producers are less effective than those driven by demand-side consumption. In addition, cost-sharing contracts can significantly improve the quality of agri-foods in the supply chain and make them more “high-quality and low-price” than before the adoption of cost-sharing contracts.</jats:p>"

Цель исследования – выявление исторических тенденций и закономерностей развития зерновой отрасли и различных отраслей животноводства как единого комплекса по формированию продовольственного обеспечения Российской Федерации. Анализ научных публикаций показал, что существует много исследований по данной тематике, однако необходимо уточнение отдельных научных категорий рассматриваемой проблемы. По данным Федеральной службы государственной статистики выявлено влияние изменений валового сбора зерна на поголовье сельскохозяйственных животных в период с 1951 по 2020 гг. Наибольшее влияние изменения валового сбора зерна оказывают на численность поголовья свиней и крупного рогатого скота без учета коров. Существенное влияние этих изменений прослеживается в течении двух-трех лет после падения валового сбора зерна. При исследовании временных факторов первого порядка, формирующих валовой сбор зерна, была выявлена идентичность происходящих процессов в Нижегородской области и в целом в Российской Федерации, что подтверждает необходимость применения принципов системного подхода при изучении тенденций в развитии отраслей сельского хозяйства. Можно сделать вывод, что устойчивое производство зерна является основой для продовольственного обеспечения как отдельных регионов нашей страны, так и Российской Федерации в целом.

The purpose of the study is to identify historical trends and patterns of development of the grain industry and various branches of animal husbandry as a single complex for the formation of food security in the Russian Federation. The analysis of scientific publications has shown that there are many studies on this topic, but it is necessary to clarify certain scientific categories of the problem under consideration. According to the Federal State Statistics Service, the influence of changes in the gross grain harvest on the number of farm animals in the period from 1951 to 2020 has been revealed. Changes in the gross grain harvest have the greatest impact on the number of pigs and cattle, excluding cows. The significant impact of these changes can be traced within two to three years after the fall of the gross grain harvest. In the study of the first-order temporal factors forming the gross grain harvest, the identity of the processes taking place in the Nizhny Novgorod region and in the Russian Federationas a whole was revealed, which confirms the need to apply the principles of a systematic approach in studying trends in the development of agricultural sectors. It can be concluded that sustainable grain production is the basis for the food supply of both individual regions of our country and the Russian Federationas a whole. The implemented measures to improve the efficiency of the grain industry should be based on the principles of a systematic approach and adaptive intensification.</jats:p>",

The most optimal option for such industrial aquaculture is the use of recirculating water supply systems, which have proven themselves especially well in the cultivation of sturgeon fish. In commercial aquaculture, aimed at year-round production of high-value delicacy products in the form of meat and caviar, hybrid forms of sturgeon are becoming more common. The article describes the experience of growing juvenile hybrids Lensky sturgeon × Russian sturgeon and Bester in the pools installed in the recirculating water installation of Caspian Bekiresy Limited (Atyrau, Kazakhstan) is described. The article presents the results of monitoring the hydrochemical parameters of water, as well as the characteristics of the types of feed used in the cultivation of sturgeon hybrids at different stages of ontogenesis. The indicators of the initial and final weight, as well as the values of the absolute, average daily and relative growth of the yearlings of sturgeon hybrids were determined. A comparative assessment of the survival of sturgeon hybrid fry when grown in a recirculating water installation pools using water from an artesian well was carried out. The experience of growing sturgeon interspecific hybrids, based on the obtained fish-biological indicators, allows us to recommend them as a full-fledged replacement for parental species, the cultivation of which under artificial conditions has a low efficiency. Moreover, bester, which had high rates of growth and survival, is a more promising object for large-scale commercial cultivation in conditions of recirculating water supply installations.</jats:p>",

The management of rural water supply schemes is a global challenge but it becomes more grievous in developing countries. An appropriate solution proposed global to cater to this problem is engaging Community based organizations (CBOs). However, CBOs too have limited capacity for implementing and monitoring all water supply schemes in the province of Punjab, with the result that around 45% remain non-operational. Using the case study method 5 villages of district Jhelum were selected and interviews were conducted with Community Based Motivators (CBMs) and chairpersons of CBOs. The content analysis of data gathered from these interviews yielded results that revealed the reasons behind the deterioration of water supply schemes. It was found that the most common reason behind the non-functioning was the execution of water supply schemes without need assessment of the areas, political pressure, community clash, theft of the engineering equipment and financial embezzlement issues. These dysfunctional water supply schemes lead to negative consequences, but they fall majorly in three categories; waterborne diseases, lack of water for sanitation and washing purposes, and fetching/ purchasing of drinking water. It can be concluded from the study that the idea of handing over of the rural water supply schemes to local people and their representatives like CBOs for operational purpose is not erroneous or less useful. There were several other socio-political reasons that conspired to have damage the rural water supply systems beyond its utility.

In this paper, the green direct supply chain network is presented to an automotive company, including five suppliers, primary warehouses, manufacturing plants, distributors, and sales centers. The objectives of this model are to minimize the total cost of construction, transportation, and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions during forwarding network transportation at all levels. The proposed model is also drawn using the weight method, which is one of the methods for solving multi-objective problems, and the solution of the model part. Ultimately, it has been discussed how much the automobile company should focus on reducing carbon dioxide so that managers can determine the best solutions from the Pareto border according to their organization’s priorities, which can be environmental or financial.</jats:p>",

Harvest practices represent all activities from land preparation to harvest. A key decision that governs the amount of resources required during cassava life cycle is the cassava’s harvesting age. The harvesting age can be from eight to 18 months in two patterns: fixed age, e.g., harvest every 12 months, and variable age, e.g., harvest at an age between 10 and 14 months. After harvesting, there are two common pricing schemes to consider, which are weight-based and starch-content-based. Factors that affect the two decisions made by Thai farmers at a given time are the market price, which highly varies within a season and between seasons, and yields in terms of weight and starch content, both of which change with cassava’s age and/or harvest month. Economic sustainability measure for Thai farmers is the average monthly profit that the farmers gain over cassava harvest cycle under uncertain market price. To handle uncertainties, a simulation model is constructed to imitate cassava planting activities from cultivation to harvest. The purpose is to evaluate various harvesting ages and two pricing schemes under uncertain cassava market prices. Market prices in 15 seasons (2006–2021) are grouped using the k-mean clustering into four price scenarios. As cassava grows in the simulation, the required resources are consumed until the decisions on harvesting time and pricing scheme are made with estimated selling probability under different price scenarios and uncertainty in cassava yield. Through simulation, harvesting age and pricing scheme that are most profitable and robust-to-system-variation are determined. Finally, a guideline for Thai farmers to choose a pricing scheme is developed based on the sensitivity analysis of the simulation model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a grave threat to human life. The stay-at-home quarantine is an effective method of minimizing physical contact and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, the supply of living materials (such as meat, vegetables, grain, and oil) has become a great challenge as residents' activities have been restricted. In this paper, we present a spatial analysis framework for the supply of living materials during COVID-19 outbreak by coupling an infectious disease model with geographic information system (GIS). First, a virus spreading spatial simulation model is developed by combining cellular automata (CA) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Death (SEIRD) to estimate COVID-19's spreading under various scenarios. Second, the demand and supply of living materials in the impacted residents are calculated. Finally, the imbalance of the supply and demand of the living materials is assessed. We conduct experiments in Shenzhen. The experimental results show that localities with supply-demand mismatches are primarily concentrated in the southwest of Bao'an District, the southern of Longhua District, and Longgang District. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the mismatch level between supply and demand for living materials in Shenzhen exhibits a significant agglomeration effect, manifested as \"low-low\" and \"high-high\" agglomeration. The spatial agglomeration effect of material mismatch has increased with the spread of the epidemic. These results support the prevention and control of the COVID-19 spreading.\n                    </jats:p>"

Then, the descriptive statistics were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, evaluating its applicability in different censored data sets. The descriptive parameters were compared with the substitution method. The substitution method showed susceptibility to biased estimates, especially for groups of compounds containing high percentage of censored data and with high limits of quantification and detection, leading to higher descriptive parameters compared to KM method. This work reinforces the need to use appropriate methods for analyzing environmental data and evidences that the analysis of this type of data may be complex. The methods proposed here can help environmental scientists to deal with this issue, providing a systematic procedure to check and solve consistency problems, as well as presenting a nonparametric approach for computing descriptive statistics for environmental monitoring data.</jats:p>"

The hospital receives a discount from the government when ordering the drug and both sellers face a price-sensitive and uncertain demand. The existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium are proved and closed-form solutions are found for linear demand cases. We characterize the pricing and ordering decisions of the hospital and drugstore. The analysis shows that high ex-factory price, high price sensitivity, and a small discount are three factors contributing to drug shortages.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>B vitamins are a group of water‐soluble micronutrients that are required in all life forms. With the lack of biosynthetic pathways, humans depend on dietary uptake of these compounds, either directly or indirectly, from plant sources. B vitamins are frequently given little consideration beyond their role as enzyme accessory factors and are assumed not to limit metabolism. However, it should be recognized that each individual B vitamin is a family of compounds (vitamers), the regulation of which has dedicated pathways. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly evident that individual family members have physiological relevance and should not be sidelined. Here, we elaborate on the known forms of vitamins B<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, B<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and B<jats:sub>9</jats:sub>, their distinct functions and importance to metabolism, in both human and plant health, and highlight the relevance of vitamer homeostasis. Research on B vitamin metabolism over the past several years indicates that not only the total level of vitamins but also the oft‐neglected homeostasis of the various vitamers of each B vitamin is essential to human and plant health. We briefly discuss the potential of plant biology studies in supporting human health regarding these B vitamins as essential micronutrients. Based on the findings of the past few years we conclude that research should focus on the significance of vitamer homeostasis – at the organ, tissue and subcellular levels – which could improve the health of not only humans but also plants, benefiting from cross‐disciplinary approaches and novel technologies.</jats:p>",

However, to leverage big data and achieve supply chain innovation, a variety of complementary resources are necessary. In this study, we hypothesise that supply chain innovation (SCI) is dependent on firms’ big data analytics capabilities (BAC). Furthermore, we propose that this relation is mediated by two crucial capabilities of agility and adaptability that enable firms to efficiently meet the challenges of supply chain ambidexterity. Finally, we also test the moderating role of technology uncertainty in our research model. We collected data from 386 manufacturing firms in Pakistan and tested our model using structural equation modelling. The results confirmed our initial hypotheses that agility and adaptability both mediated our baseline relationship of BAC and big data innovation in supply chains. We further found support for the moderating role of technology uncertainty. Furthermore, technology uncertainty moderates the relationship between BAC and SCI. This study extends the current literature on digital analytics capabilities and innovation along the supply chain. Practically, our research suggests that investment in big data can result in affirmative consequences, if firms cultivate capabilities to encounter supply chain ambidexterity through agility and adaptability. Accordingly, we suggest that managers belonging to manufacturing firms need to build up these internal capabilities and to monitor and assess technology uncertainty in the environment.</jats:p>",

The widespread infection of the medical staff has caused great attention from all quarters of society. There is a particular concern when considering intubation treatment in the emergency operating room, where a significant amount of virus droplets are typically spread within the room, exposing the medical staff to a high risk of infection. Hence, there is currently a pressing need to develop an effective protection mechanism for the medical staff to prevent them from being infected during routine work. In order to understand the spread of droplets and aerosols when different oxygen supply devices are used for intubation therapy, this study uses particle image velocimetry (PIV) technology to analyze the airflow distribution between the medical staff and the patient. In the experiment, a simple version of the respirator was established to reproduce the breathing of human lungs. This model used oil to create smoke as a tracer aerosol, then a high-sensitivity camera was used to record the scattering light from this smoke (which is irradiated by the green laser sheet). Ultimately, after applying post-processing techniques, the airflow distribution is analyzed. PAO aerosol is the primary aerosol source in this experiment, and it is used to quantify the patient’s breathing; the concentration of PAO aerosol was measured at three different points: head, trunk, and feet. In addition, flow field visualization can effectively present the flow field distribution of the entire operating room; also, the results can be mutually verified with the PAO concentration measurement results. Aerosol concentrations were measured for six different oxygen supply devices with various tidal volumes of the artificial respirator, and the results were ranked from high to low concentrations for different oxygen supply devices and their operational oxygen supply flowrates: HFNC (70 l/min) &gt; CPAP (40 l/min) &gt; HFNC (30 l/min) &gt; nasal cannula (15 l/min) &gt; NRM (15 l/min) &gt; VAPOX (28 l/min).</jats:p>",

It mainly proposes a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model based on improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) (IPSO-BPNN) and applies it to inventory management prediction. First, the important technologies of green supply chain and intelligent supply chain are analyzed from the perspective of the ecological environment. Next, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is optimized based on the adaptive improvement of the learning factor and the addition of the speed mutation operator. Then, it is applied to the learning and training of BPNN. Finally, the simulation experiment of the combination model is conducted. The application fields of the combination model are analyzed. The results show that a single BPNN model will produce large errors in the training process. The final error of BPNN using the traditional PSO algorithm is 0.0259, while the error of BPNN optimized by IPSO is 0.0163. The optimized combination model has higher accuracy, better performance, and the lowest error rate. The classification error rate of its training set and test set is 1.51 and 2.16, respectively. The mean square error of the training set is 0.0163 and that of the test set is 0.0229. Under 6 ~ 12 different hidden nodes, the daily measurement model error and monthly measurement model error are both low when the number of nodes is 11. Moreover, the training set is always better than the test set. Finally, the network structure of the combination model is determined as the structure of 6-11-1. This prediction module will provide purchase volume suggestions and inventory volume suggestions to provide a feasible direction for the green development of inventory management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing Uganda’s low electrification rate is one of the country’s major challenges. Power service is essential to achieve socioeconomic development and poverty reduction, especially in rural areas. This paper shows the advantages of using an integrated (grid and off-grid) electrification model with high geospatial, temporal, and customer-class granularity as the Reference Electrification Model (REM). In universal electrification strategies, REM will help better ascertain the role of minigrids, jointly with grid extension, solar kits, and stand-alone systems. REM has been applied to the Southern Service Territory (SST) to determine the least-cost mix of electrification modes—grid extension, off-grid minigrids, and standalone systems—that satisfies the hourly demand requirements of each customer—residential, commercial, or industrial—considering its individual location. REM incorporates the existing grid layout, the hourly solar local profile, and the catalogs of actual components for network and generation designs. The paper shows that minigrids can provide grid-like service at a significantly lower cost in many circumstances and to a considerable extent. Therefore, minigrid strategies should play a more important role in electrification planning, both transitorily and on a permanent basis, particularly when the central grid suffers from frequent and prolonged blackouts.</jats:p>"

As such, diversifying water sources is a key solution to building the resilience of the water supply system. An atmospheric water harvesting can capture water out of the air and provide a point-of-use water source directly. Currently, a series of atmospheric water harvesting have been proposed and developed to provide water sources under various moisture content ranging from 30–80% with a maximum water collection rate of 200,000 L/day. In comparison to conventional water source alternatives, atmospheric water harvesting avoids the construction of storage and distribution grey infrastructure. However, the high price and low water generation rate make this technology unfavorable as a viable alternative to general potable water sources whereas it has advantages compared with bottled water in both cost and environmental impacts. Moreover, atmospheric water harvesting can also provide a particular solution in the agricultural sector in countries with poor irrigation infrastructure but moderate humidity. Overall, atmospheric water harvesting could provide communities and/or cities with an indiscriminate solution to enhance water supply resilience. Further research and efforts are needed to increase the water generation rate and reduce the cost, particularly via leveraging solar energy.</jats:p>"

Due to the sheer large number of EVs on the road, the emerging vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, which allows for two-way electrical flows between EVs and the power grid, is gaining traction. However, establishing a fair and private electricity exchange scheme has gradually become a critical challenge. The emergence of blockchain technology offers a novel approach for resolving this issue. In this study, we overview the opportunities and challenges of blockchain in the smart grid. Then, we provide a privacy-preserving blockchain-based electricity auction scheme for V2G networks in smart grid. In particular, we exploit PS group signatures to keep the privacy of EVs or charging stations and leverage blockchain to provide automated auction execution. With our mechanism, the identity of EV/charging station is conditionally protected. In case of an emergency, the trusted authority (i.e., the group manager) can open the identity. Meanwhile, we present the security analysis to prove our scheme’s security. Finally, we implement the experiment to evaluate efficiency. The experimental results show that our proposal is efficient and suitable for V2G networks.</jats:p>",

We formulate buyers' operating costs as a function of their process innovation levels, which implies that they can reduce the unit operating cost via investments in process innovation in the long run. Our research demonstrates that the uniform wholesale price (UWP) is always preferred over the buyer‐specific wholesale price by the supplier because of the effect of innovation stimulation. The optimal timing of pricing is contingent on the level of market demand variance. If two buyers have the same ability to reduce their operating costs via process innovation, the UWP strategy forms a win‐win situation to the supplier and two buyers. Our results provide the supplier with suggestions regarding when to adopt the UWP strategy and how to enhance downstream innovation performance within the supply chain.</jats:p>",

A comprehensive analysis of the technical condition and existing potential of reclamation infrastructure, including inter-farm engineering infrastructure of irrigation networks at the Lower Dniester Irrigation System (LDIS) was made. It was found that the equipment of the pumping stations of LDIS has long been depreciated and is in very poor technical condition, water losses during transportation are 32-35% of the primary water intake, engineering infrastructure has almost run out of its resource and technical condition and parameters do not meet the required level. The average specific power energy consumption for1 water pumping at LDIS per 1000 m3 is 351 kWh, and the share of energy consumption costs in the prime cost of supplied water for irrigation is about 60%. The operation of obsolete equipment is carried out under the conditions of a severe deficit of budget funding, there are almost no funds for current and major repairs of equipment and facilities. The prime cost of water transportation for irrigation per m3 was determined, and the cost of 1 m3 of water for water users was calculated.&#x0D;\nThe sources of financial support for the operation of LDIS were investigated. The operation of LDIS in 2020 was financed by 66% of the state budget and by 34% from the revenues obtained from water users. It was specified that the system of service cost reimbursement does not cover the cost of water supply for irrigation. Based on the results of the technical and economic analysis and energy audit, the total investment needed for a modernization and reconstruction project for LDIS was calculated. The main results of the project implementation are presented, which will increase the volume of gross agricultural output by 1.6 - 1.8 billion UAH / year. Due to the introduction of a set of reconstruction measures for the reconstruction of NDIS, the specific energy consumption of water supply at the water intake point will be reduced from 1.03 kWh / m3 to 0.65 kWh / m3 or by 37%. The total energy savings will be from 0.03 to 0.21-0.25 kWh / m3.&#x0D;\nKeywords: irrigation, audit, technical condition, energy efficiency, modernization, reconstruction, investments</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. There is an increasing demand for the creation and restoration of tidal marshes around the world, as they provide highly valued ecosystem services. Yet restored tidal marshes are strongly vulnerable to factors such as sea level rise and declining sediment supply. How fast the restored ecosystem\ndevelops, how resilient it is to sea level rise, and how this can be steered by restoration design are key questions that are typically challenging to assess due to the complex biogeomorphic feedback processes involved. In this paper, we apply a biogeomorphic model to a specific tidal-marsh restoration project planned by dike breaching. Our modeling approach integrates tidal hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and vegetation dynamics, accounting for relevant fine-scale flow–vegetation interactions (less than 1 m2) and their impact on vegetation and landform development at the landscape scale (several km2) and in the long term (several decades). Our model performance is positively evaluated against observations of vegetation and geomorphic development in adjacent tidal marshes. Model scenarios demonstrate that the restored tidal marsh can keep pace with realistic rates of sea level rise and that its resilience is more sensitive to the availability of suspended sediments than to the rate of sea level rise. We further demonstrate that restoration design options can steer marsh resilience, as they affect the rates and spatial patterns of biogeomorphic development. By varying the width of two dike breaches, which serve as tidal inlets to the restored marsh, we show that a larger difference in the width of the two inlets leads to higher biogeomorphic diversity in restored habitats. This study showcases that biogeomorphic modeling can support management choices in restoration design to optimize tidal-marsh development towards sustainable restoration goals.\n                    </jats:p>"

Firstly, the wireless communication scheme is assessed based on the interval number technology, and the primary evaluation process and evaluation index system are described. Secondly, the analytic hierarchy process of interval numbers is studied. Besides, a decision model has been established for wireless communication scheme evaluation. Thirdly, the evaluation index of the wireless communication scheme is determined through the simulation analysis of the model. Finally, experiments verify the decision model for evaluating wireless communication schemes based on interval numbers. Channel encoding can be adjusted automatically and can effectively track electrical signals. The results demonstrate that under the same high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the error rate in the 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) mode decreases faster than that in the 2 frequency shift keying (FSK) mode, so the 16QAM mode is better than the 2FSK mode. Under a low SNR, the binary phase shift keying mode is superior to the 2FSK mode, and the 2FSK mode is superior to the 16QAM mode. The bit error rate of the communication signal in the additive white Gaussian noise channel is the lowest. These findings provide a solid foundation for a universal and scalable wireless communication system. This research has practical application value for scheme evaluation and model decision-making in the wireless communication field.

An efficient Ventilation Mode with Deflector and Slot air outlets (VMDS) was developed by this study. The use of a deflector with slot air outlets was introduced by utilizing jet collision and adhesion effect to accentuate the ventilation performance of the side air supply for the large space. The numerical simulation model used in this study was validated experimentally. The VMDS was compared with three other side air supply modes used in large spaces, and the results were evaluated comprehensively. The results show that VMDS is effective in reducing indoor air pollutant concentrations and transmission of infectious diseases in large spaces while satisfying the energy efficiency and thermal comfort requirements. Compared with the common side-supply and side-return ventilation modes, VMDS can reduce indoor air pollutant concentration by nearly 40%, reduce the transmission risk of infectious disease to less than 1% at a low air change rate and increase the ventilation efficiency from about 0.85 to about 1.2. In addition, VMDS can theoretically reduce ventilation energy consumption by about 85%. </jats:p>",

Using blockchain technology’s smart contract technology to simplify the transaction process, the triggering mechanism and algorithm rules of smart contracts in the trading process of the platform were designed, and the smart contract code was developed, deployed, and tested using Remix IDE, and the test results showed the transaction process between the supply and demand sides. Through blockchain technology, it achieves information security and transparency in the process of resource trading in the industry interconnection supply and demand network, establishes a trust mechanism on both sides of the transaction, reduces redundant steps in the transaction and improves the operational efficiency of the industry interconnection supply and demand network by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation.</jats:p>"

Hence, the water, coming into water supply networks, made of steel and cast iron pipes, made of gray-cast iron, is transported to consumers. Its quality must meet the standards of GOST R (Russian National Standard) 51232-98 “Drinking water” and SanPiN (Sanitary Regulations and Norms) 1.2.3685-21 “Hygienic standards and requirements to ensure the safety and (or) harmlessness of habitat factors for people”. The aim of the study is to analyze methods of preventing secondary pollution of drinking water in water supply networks, made of metal, and to identify the most effective and practically grounded method.  Materials and methods. The concepts of electrochemical corrosion and microbiological corrosion of the inner surface of pipes were used to perform the analysis. Three methods of preventing the formation of a layer of deposits on the inner surface of steel and gray cast-iron pipes are used in the practice of water treatment and disinfection of drinking water: the method of using strong oxidants, such as chlorine and sodium hypochlorite, for the disinfection of drinking water; the method of increasing the pH level of drinking water; the method of using chemicals to ensure the formation of a microscopic film on the surface of layers of deposits to “slow down” electrochemical and microbiological corrosion processes on the inner surface of pipes.  Results. The authors have identified a method for preventing the secondary pollution of drinking water, time-tested by the twelve years of practical use by the operator of WTF and drinking water supply and distribution networks made of metal.  Conclusions. The effectiveness of the method of preventing the secondary pollution of drinking water through the use of new generation reagents, made of polyhexamethyleneguanidine hydrochloride, has been proven in practice.</jats:p>"

In this study, the seasonal disparity and occurrence of six phthalates and bisphenol-A in the drinking water supply system and associated health-risk were examined. The detection frequencies of the ∑6PAEs ranged from 24 to 100% in the winter whereas; in summer it is below the detection limit up to 100%. DEHP was the most prevalent phthalate congener ranging from 1.14 to 8351.85 µg/L (winter) and 0.552 to 410.29 µg/L (summer) surpassing the permissible limit. However, BPA concentrations were found under the permissible limit. The results suggested that PAEs concentration displayed significant seasonal variations with the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. The exposure to PAEs and BPA from drinking water was assessed, indicating a possible health risk to humans with a hazard quotient (HQ) &gt; 1 for DEHP only. The findings necessitate an immediate scrutiny of these EDCs in drinking water supply system and are critical for implementing effective technologies at the WTP scale to ensure the quality and safety of drinking water to ascertain human and environmental health.</jats:p>"

The results show that: (1) the ecosystem services value in the research area experienced a change process of “increase–decrease–increase” from 2000 to 2020. The ecological service value of cultivated land and grassland presented a continuous decline, with decreases of 20.446 billion and 4.53 billion yuan, respectively, in the past 20 years, with reduction rates of −4.82% and −3.98%, respectively. (2) The demand for ecosystem services showed an unbalanced and phased growth trend. The total demand for ecosystem services showed heterogeneity and agglomeration effects in space. High demand and higher demand areas are mainly distributed in the regions with relatively developed population and economy, including Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, “Changsha–Zhuzhou–Xiangtan” urban agglomeration, Poyang Lake Plain, Jianghan Plain and Chengdu Plain.

The implementation of these policies has changed the operating environment of traditional closed-loop supply chains, while the privacy of relevant information increases the difficulty of decision-making. Under the background, this paper considers the green closed-loop supply chain (GCLSC) under the hybrid policy of recycling subsidy and carbon tax where the manufacturer is in charge of recycling and the retailer invests in green marketing. Taking green marketing cost coefficient as the retailer’s private information, this paper explores the influence of information asymmetry on optimal decisions and performance of the GCLSC. By constructing game models of information symmetry and asymmetry, the optimal decisions, economic and environmental performance, and social welfare are provided. Combined with numerical analysis, the influence of uncertainty of the manufacturer’s estimation, subsidies and carbon tax on the GCLSC is proposed. The results indicate that the uncertainty in the manufacturer’s estimation can improve the social welfare under certain conditions, but it cannot reduce carbon emissions. Recycling subsidy and carbon tax policies oppositely affect the manufacturer’s optimal decisions and carbon emissions. Information asymmetry is beneficial to the retailer. However, less uncertainty in estimation is not always better for the manufacturer. The manufacturer needs to proactively adopt strategies to stimulate the retailer’s information sharing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite a number of adverse factors, China’s steel industry has maintained a rapid growth trend. China continues to consume two-thirds of the world’s iron ore, the majority of which is imported. In this context, Chinese steel companies have begun to consider integrating their supply chains to increase efficiency and lower costs. However, the increasingly volatile international environment makes this an extremely risky proposition. As a result, the issue of how Chinese steel producers should participate in global supply chain integration has emerged as a critical research question that requires investigation. In this paper, we examine the supply chain integration problem using a typical China–Australia steel trade as an example. Specifically, we discuss in detail whether relevant firms should continue to promote supply chain integration in the Chinese–Australian steel industry, as well as the decision boundary of influence, using evolutionary game theory and policy risk cost factors. The empirical analysis demonstrates that policy risk has a range of effects on different types of steel firms. Even when international tensions are considered, smaller steel companies may retain a greater willingness to integrate their supply chains. Overall, the above findings can provide necessary decision support for enterprises to formulate supply chain management strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, research on supply chain coordination (SCC) with risk‐averse agents has received much attention. Previous studies are primarily concerned with the coordination of a single manufacturer–single retailer supply chain using different definitions of SCC. What is lacking is a comprehensive analysis of the achievability of SCC. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of SCC with risk‐averse agents. We see that three definitions of SCC have been proposed in the literature to investigate SCC with risk‐averse agents, among which the one based on Pareto optimality (PO) stands out. Here we explore the challenges of using the PO criterion. Specifically, we first examine the standard two‐agent supply chain under the mean–variance (MV) and mean‐downside‐risk (MDR) objectives. What we find is that the achievability of PO depends on the contract type. The wholesale price contract even with a side payment may not lead to PO. Also, unlike under MV where risk sharing is Pareto optimal, we observe that the least risk‐averse agent must take all the risk to achieve SCC under MDR. Importantly, we extend our analysis to multiretailer, multimanufacturer, and multitier supply chains. In each case, we characterize the efficient Pareto‐optimal manifold in the multidimensional space and design coordinating contracts that result in Pareto‐optimal actions acceptable to all agents. We also discover that identifying PO across all the contract forms is difficult when some other risk‐aversion criteria are considered. We conclude by providing suggestions and methods for SCC when we are unable to identify PO. </jats:p>",

The research identified 58 studies that, after applying the exclusion criteria, 22.41% of the articles were selected for the first stage, and after the second stage, 5.17% of the total. Research has shown that there are treatment processes for removing “giardia and Cryptosporidium”, such as coagulation/filtration, reverse osmosis, micro or ultrafiltration, advanced UV-based oxidation, etc. and simpler processes such as using slow filtration. Many times, a set of these processes must be used so that the removal can take place in the proper way and that, with this, the potability of the water is guaranteed.</jats:p>"

For a particular case study in Cameroon, the system is optimally designed thanks to a double-objective firefly optimization algorithm, based on a defined operational strategy. The two objective functions simulated simultaneously using FA are: the cost of energy (COE) function and the function defining the loss of power supply probability (LPSP). Different optimal configurations of the system have been obtained on the Pareto front with respect to their LPSP. For a total load demand of 20196.7 kWh, the lowest cost configuration with LPSP of 0% is composed by a number of 63 modules and a battery capacity of 370.295 kWh. The related COE is 0.2587 $/kWh, corresponding to a total net present cost of 87422 $. However with this configuration, the energy of batteries could not be able solely to respond to the energy demand for 3 continuous days. In that case, the increase of the PV power production (by increasing the number of PV modules) could allow to the batteries to fulfil this deficiency. But this solution increases the investment cost to up to 11.17%, considering a system with 80 PV modules. Another solution consists in reducing the size of the battery bank to avoid its unnecessary oversizing. In this case, the COE and the system investment cost reduce to up to 28.77% for 1 day batteries’ autonomy considered. The obtained results have demonstrated that the cost of a PV/battery system is mostly influenced by the batteries’ size, while the system reliability is mostly related to the PV size.</jats:p>",

Many continued tracking for over a year after the study was completed. In the field experiment, participants participated through the use of a GPS tracking app, Catch-my-Day, which logged their daily travel on different transport modes and imputed the trip segments and modes. The experiment lasted 8 weeks, bookended by two online surveys. After the first 4-week control phase, participants were split into two different treatment groups and a continued control group. An analysis of the survey participation shows that the technology is capable of supporting such an experiment on both Android and iOS, the two main mobile platforms. Significant differences in the engagement and attrition were observed between iOS and Android participants over the 8-week period. Finally, the attrition rate did not vary between treatment groups.

Data-driven sustainable growth and innovative development is the main line of enterprise digital transformation. In view of the uncertainty of supply chain demand, the optimization of supply chain management under the influence of carbon tax policy is studied from the low-carbon perspective. By introducing the fuzzy theory and a membership function to describe the need for uncertainty, a supply chain optimization model considering the influence of carbon emissions is constructed. Carbon tax policy is regarded as the constraint condition of external production. In the case of fuzzy cost changes, the optimization decision of enterprise supply chain management under carbon tax policy is explored. A trapezoidal fuzzy number is used to determine model fuzziness, and the trapezoidal fuzzy number combined with a genetic algorithm is used to solve the model. Furthermore, taking a certain enterprise as an example, the validity of the model is verified by the mathematical programming model method, considering the data driven and taking the data as the means of production.</jats:p>",

Simultaneously, the effects of parameters such as recovery rate, unit carbon trading price, and carbon emission reduction factor on the decision making of members of the supply chain system are also discussed. Finally, the conclusions are verified by numerical analysis: (1) When carbon reduction is low, the manufacturer will choose the highest recycling rate to obtain the highest profit, and when carbon reduction is high, manufacturers tend to choose not to recycle when the minimum recycling rate bound by law harms the interests of manufacturers. (2) Under the implementation of the carbon trading mechanism, the unit carbon trading price affects the profits of the members of the supply chain system depending on the size of the carbon emission reduction, and the two are negatively correlated at lower carbon emission reductions and positively correlated at higher carbon emission reductions. (3) From the perspective of supply chain system members’ interests, legal constraints and the existence of carbon trading mechanisms are not always conducive to increasing the margins of members of the supply chain system, both relevant to the size of carbon emission reductions. (4) From the perspective of environmental benefits, supply chain members do not need to pay economic costs in all cases to contribute to environmental benefits, and the existence of minimum recycling rate constraints and carbon trading mechanisms are conducive to achieving carbon reduction targets.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: This article has two aims: 1) to develop a quantitative methodology to select prominent climate ODA sectors and 2) to purpose climate-technology based ODA strategies for the selected sectors.\r\nOriginality: Although climate ODA is the only area that international regimes require technology transfer to the developing world, a methodology for planning climate technology based ODA strategies has not been fully formalized. Considering the fact that the technology cooperation may include diverse types of aid projects such as capacity building, strengthening regulatory environment and the diffusion of technologies, the methodological approach to plan the climate technology-based ODA strategies may contribute to promoting effectiveness of the ODA sectoral programs.\r\nMethodology: To select prominent sectors of climate ODA, three evaluation criteria are used. First, the relevance criteria are measured whether the donor country has ever implemented climate-financed projects since 2015 or the recipient country has stated their climate-technology demand to the technology need assessment reports. The efficiency criteria are estimated by the degree of financial resource concentration and by the inclusion to the 2020-2024 national plan. Lastly, using SDGs panel data that covers 190 countries from 1990-2020, the vulnerability is measured by comparing the country’s GDP predicted values of SDGs, which are estimated by the fixed-effect coefficient, to its actual values of SDGs.\r\nResult: The results show that the most prominent sectors of climate ODA are water management and rural development. However, for the middle income countries in South Asia and Eurasia region, urban development is gradually emerged as a new prominent sector. Focused on these selected sectors of climate ODA, this study also suggests specific ODA strategies by matching Korea’s promising climate technologies in terms of technology maturity and commercialization with the technologies that recipient countries need.\r\nConclusions and Implication: This article’s approach of climate ODA strategies may lead recipient countries to foster the enabling environment to develop, adopt and commercialize the climate technologies, which effectively contribute to promoting sustainable and climate-resilient development.</jats:p>",

It has been established that sediments in the heating system mainly consist of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides: magnetite, goethite and lepidocrocite. All these mineral phases are products of active oxidation (corrosion) of steel pipes and heating system equipment. No mineral phases of ferrous forms of iron have been found in the sediment, which indicates sharply oxidizing environment in the heating system. The presence of sulfur-containing mineral phases, namely, anhydrous calcium sulfate - anhydrite and elemental sulfur, has been recorded in the heating system of the Apatity combined heat and power plant. Indirectly, the presence of such sulfur-containing phases may indicate the possible presence of microflora (bacteria) in the heat-transfer agent, in the metabolic processes of which sulfur and sulfur-containing compounds are involved.</jats:p>",

We then contrasted the preference patterns in the laboratory feeding experiments with a 15-month-long benthic standing stock time series of a stream below a native deciduous forest and another below a eucalypt plantation. Both detritivores preferred consuming alder leaves and more conditioned eucalypt leaves, although the amphipod was more selective than the caddisfly. The consumption preference in the laboratory was unmatched by the availability in the field, especially under eucalypt plantations and for the amphipod. Our results show that the strength of the preference for high-quality resources can differ among different taxa, which can modulate their response to land use changes.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the article is to fi nd out the features of the organization of accounting for logistics costs for the supply of accounting and analytical support of logistics of the enterprise.  It was found that the accounting support of the process of integration of logistics, production, transport, sales and transfer of information on the movement of inventory in a single system – one of the key tasks of cost management that arise when proving the material flow from the primary source of raw materials to the end user. The formation of an effective subsystem of accounting support of logistics operations will allow integrating the received information flows (results of accounting registrations) into a single system of information support of production and sales system management, which in turn will increase its security.  The classification of logistics costs by functional feature is offered, which allows to systematically estimating their absolute values, to solve operational problems to substantiate the optimal size of these costs, using an array of operational accounting information to analyse the structure of logistics costs, to organize an effective control system the implementation of logistics operations. The largest share in the logistics costs of the enterprise is occupied by supply costs.  To increase the level of efficiency of management response to the behaviour of logistics costs, it is proposed to introduce six analytical accounts («Expenses for research of procurement market potential», «Expenses for forming a portfolio of orders», «Representation expenses», «Expenses for control over compliance with supply contracts», «Expenses for maintenance of the personnel of the supply service of the enterprise», «Expenses for acceptance of incoming material resources and their preparation for production consumption»), which are grouped in a separate sub-account 949/1 «Logistic expenses for supply».  This array of information will be the information base for the operational analysis of logistics costs for supply in the system of accounting and analytical support of logistics of the enterprise, which in turn will improve the management of flows in the logistics chain.

It is helpful to quantify the water pollution ecological environment losses for decision-makers to formulate reasonable pollution control plans. However, the current quantitative analyses led by economic methods are not comprehensive and systematic. Therefore, based on the emergy theory and method system of eco-economics, this study analyzed the internal energy flow process of the water-polluted ecosystem, discussed the composition of water-polluted ecological environment loss, and proposed a quantitative model of water-polluted ecological environment loss based on the emergy analysis method. It can reasonably quantify the ecological environment loss caused by water pollution and provide a reference for optimizing regional industrial layout, scientifically formulating pollution control planning, and promoting the sustainable development of the ecosystem. Taking Kaifeng City in Henan Province as an example, the rationality of the model is verified. The results show that the annual average total energy value of water pollution ecological environment loss in Kaifeng City is 3.83 × 1020sej, equivalent to 145 million yuan (0.76) of Kaifeng's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.</jats:p>",

No presente trabalho, os custos de implantação das redes de abastecimento de água dos setores urbanos com predominância de construções verticais são comparados com os de construções horizontais. Para o dimensionamento das redes, em concordância com as condições de vazão e pressão necessárias, utilizou-se o modelo computacional The Environmental Protection Agency Network (EPANET). Os custos foram baseados no Sistema Nacional de Pesquisa de Custos e Índices da Construção Civil. Observou-se que a rede implantada em áreas urbanas verticais apresentou custo 13,4% superior ao da mesma área com construções horizontais, mas ao mesmo tempo abastece um número de habitantes 13 vezes superior ao das áreas horizontais.</jats:p>"

This study uses an ecologically meaningful indicator (range of variability approach method) to assess the dynamic runoff process in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, whose changes negatively affect the ecosystems in the study area. In addition, the study quantitatively analyzed the contribution rate of human activities and climate change to flow change. The effects of ecological index changes on four famous major carp species (FFMC) resources in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were studied. The results show that after the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) operation, the hydrological changes of Yichang Station, Hankou Station, and Datong Station were 65, 58, and 46%, respectively. The weight of the impact of human activities on runoff is smaller the farther away from the TGD. The impact weights of human activities at the three hydrological stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are 73.69, 67.98, and 56.84%, respectively. The operation of the Three Gorges Project caused changes in the hydrological regime of the Yangtze River, which adversely affected the structure and quantity of FFMC populations.</jats:p>",

Foram recebidas 40 respostas (taxa de 74%). De forma complementar, a partir da relevância do Núcleo Ampliado de Saúde da Família e Atenção Básica (Nasf AB) na oferta das PCAF, foi realizada pesquisa em sistema de informações. Apenas o MS, duas SES e quatro SMS apresentavam estrutura específica de gestão das PCAF; a possibilidade de financiamento foi apontada pelo MS, em seis SES e oito SMS. Em relação aos programas, parecem limitar-se ao Academia da Saúde. Já em relação à oferta de PCAF, observou-se que, de 2015 a 2020, o percentual de participação do Nasf AB foi sempre maior do que 70%, chegando a 82,3%. Assim, o panorama constituído no MS, nas SES e SMS das capitais configura uma tímida disposição de elementos essenciais, como estrutura organizacional, financiamento, programas e ações para que as PCAF possam avançar enquanto política pública de saúde.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that the correlation coefficients between the perceived convenience, sound policy, legality, standardizing system and the dispatchers’ satisfaction are 0.606, 0.448, 0.242 and −0.366, respectively. The correlations between perceived convenience, sound policy, legality and dispatchers’ satisfaction are significantly positive. The correlations between standardizing system and dispatchers’ satisfaction are negative. Finally, corresponding improvement policies are proposed based on the analysis of the model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the heating supply systems in apartment buildings utilizing district heating, the supply water temperature setting is a critical control for providing sufficient heating and effective usage of the heating energy. Conventional water temperature control methods such as fixed temperature (FT) control can result in energy wastage and outdoor air temperature reset (OTR) control cannot reflect the variation in the heating demands of households because it only considers the outdoor air temperature. Therefore, this study proposes an advanced control method called flow-based residential energy demand (f-RED) control, which sets the supply water temperature based on the outdoor air temperature and household heating demands (i.e., the changes in the circulated heating water flow). To determine the performance of the proposed method compared to the conventional one, this study utilizes building energy simulation. The simulation analysis results confirm that the f-RED control method appropriately sets the supply water temperature based on a combination of the two factors, supplies heat according to heating demands, and reduces the energy consumption of the circulation pump by approximately 1.6% and that of the secondary pump by 4.2%. Thus, the f-RED control method is able to utilize heat energy more effectively and efficiently than the conventional control method.</jats:p>"

A split natural cooling system module, which consisted of indoor and outdoor heat exchanger based on micro heat pipe arrays connected by liquid circulation system, was selected for experimental research. The heat transfer process and flow characteristics were analyzed under different outdoor environment temperatures, air and water flow rates, and different ratios of heat transfer components (N) of indoor and outdoor heat exchangers. To improve the utilization of natural cold energy, two kinds of heat dissipation conditions, namely room and heat channel-based, were proposed. The indoor temperature of two conditions at 28 °C and 38 °C were simulated in the laboratory at constant temperature-humidity, respectively. Results indicated that the air flow rate had a greater influence on the heat transfer performance than the water flow rate. The pressure drop of the air and water sides was at a lower level, and the fitting curve of the pressure drop was obtained to provide a reference for the heat exchanger design and equipment selection. When the ratio of heat transfer components (N) of the indoor and outdoor heat exchanger was approximately 0.75, the split natural cooling system showed optimal comprehensive performance. Under heat channel-based conditions, the maximum heat transfer rate reached 12.4 kW, and the maximum energy efficiency ratio was 17.15; the maximum heat transfer rate and the maximum energy efficiency ratio increased by 42.5% and 22.64% compared with the room-based condition, respectively. The fitting curve of the energy efficiency ratio was calculated under different outdoor temperatures at two heat dissipation conditions.</jats:p>"

Based on these three widely acclaimed statistical techniques, the study identified, ranked, and identified interrelationships among the challenges. The study is unique not only in terms of research findings, but also in terms of methodology, as it is the first to use the three MCDM (Multicriteria Decision Making) tools to examine supply chain issues in public sector agriculture development projects in a developing country context. A literature review and two modified Delphi rounds with 15 industry experts’ opinions were applied to identify and validate a list of 11 key supply chain challenges. To determine the priority of the challenges, a panel of eight industry experts was consulted, and their responses were analysed using the BWM. Then, another group of 10 experts was consulted using ISM to investigate the contextual relationships among the challenges, resulting in a five-layered Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) and MICMAC (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) analysis of the challenges. According to relative importance (global weights), \"improper procurement planning (0.213), \"delay in project initiation (0.177), \"demand forecasting error (0.146)\", \"lack of contract monitoring mechanism (0.097)\", and \"lack of competent staff (0.095)\" are the top five ranked key challenges that have a significant impact on the project supply chain. Regarding contextual relationships, the ISM model and ISM-MICMAC analysis identified the \"political influence\" challenge as the most influential, and also independent of the other challenges. The findings are critical for project managers in managing challenges because understanding both relative importance and contextual relationships are required to address the challenges holistically. Additionally, these findings will benefit policymakers, academics, and future researchers.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Animal welfare is an essential part of the sustainability of animal production. While low-input farming, such as organic animal production, is often considered animal-friendly, several ways to enhance animal welfare in low-input animal production exist. However, currently there is little information on how farmers and other supply chain actors view different innovations and tools which may influence animal welfare in low-input outdoor and organic production systems. The aim of this study was to examine farmers’ and experts’ reactions to new approaches to pig and poultry production, with special attention to their animal welfare-related measures. The reactions were tested formally in by using a quantitative survey instrument in nine European countries (Finland, UK, France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Romania). In the survey, respondents’ views on production practices and novel measures were asked. These included aspects such as applicability and advantages and disadvantages of various measures such as avoiding mutilations, using dual-purpose or local breeds, or in-ovo sexing. The data included altogether 218 responses from nine countries. Differences between countries were tested and groups of respondents were identified. The results suggest that supply side stakeholders foresee the welfare benefits and some disadvantages of welfare improving measures proposed to them. However, they also indicate that several measures were considered inapplicable despite their benefits. Inadequate financial provisions to adopt a measure was considered as one of the most important reasons for inapplicability of a measure. This may imply either high costs of implementing measures of low market incentives or perceived low demand for animal-friendly products. Other barriers for adopting welfare-friendly measures included farm-specific factors such as limitations imposed by housing. The respondents indicated a high relative preference for feeding, breeding, shelter from predators and the use of vaccines and anti-parasitic treatments to the provision of enrichments and nesting material to pigs, and to mutilations. Farmers agreed that environmental enrichments are important welfare-improving levers and preferred their use in low-input pig and poultry production. Animal breeding-related measures in pig production were perceived quite favorably by supply side stakeholders. Despite their welfare benefits, farmers in some countries had quite high preference towards maintaining castration and tail docking in pig and beak trimming in broiler production as part of their production method.</jats:p>"

However, precipitation is influenced by a variety of factors together, showing the characteristics of nonlinear variation patterns. Given that backpropagation (BP) neural network has a strong mapping ability for nonlinear fitting, we consider using BP neural network for precipitation prediction, then use Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) to optimize BP network initial threshold and weight information to improve the efficiency of precipitation prediction. To further enhance model predictive performance, the Markov model is employed to predict the residual series of the SSA-BP model, so as to finally construct a combined SSA-BP-Markov model of precipitation. In this paper, the model is used to simulate the rainfall prediction in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, China, and to compare and analyze with the other traditional models. The empirical prediction results show that the SSA-BP-Markov model is more accurate and the convergence of the algorithm is better. The model provides a new way of thinking for precipitation prediction and is also useful for predicting precipitation in other regions.</jats:p>",

Then, the Green Field Analysis experiments are used to locate the backup facilities and optimize their inventory levels. Finally, risk analysis experiments are carried out to verify the resilience of the redesigned mask supply chain. Our major research findings include the following. First, when the pandemic spreads to the downstream of the supply chain, the duration of the downstream facilities disruption plays a critical role in the supply chain operation and performance. Second, adding backup facilities and optimizing their inventory levels are effective in responding to the pandemic. Overall, this paper provides insights for predicting the impacts of the pandemic on the medical mask supply chain.

This article aims to study the Hainan port logistics supply chain and its flexible operation mechanism of digital visualization remote control and hopes that through the blessing of remote control technology, the port’s ability to deal with the external environment will be improved. Based on the theory of logistics service availability of supply line flexibility, this paper constructs the evaluation of Hainan port logistics service supply chain flexibility; logistics flexibility refers to the ability of an enterprise to respond quickly and effectively to changes in customer demand for transportation, delivery, and services. Logistics flexibility includes four important elements: logistics supply flexibility, procurement flexibility, distribution flexibility, and demand management flexibility. Using the concept of two-level planning to build a port collection and distribution network optimization model in the supply chain environment and analyze related examples to find the best route for port transportation, the attributes related to port flexibility are selected from the perspectives of strategic flexibility, system flexibility, service provider flexibility, and organizational flexibility. The test outcomes of this document show the radiation capacity of Haikou port is relatively strong, the proportion of people who think it is excellent is 60%, and the proportion of people who think that the radiation ability of Haikou Port is good is 20%. Haikou Port has a good resource utilization capacity; 70% think its resource utilization rate is good, and 20% think its resource utilization is very good. Haikou Port’s response capability is relatively average compared to Kia’s capability, and even 10% of people think that Haikou Port’s response capability is very average, so Haikou Port needs to strengthen training for port response capabilities. According to the operating flexibility data, the informatization development of Haikou Port is showing a good level.</jats:p>",

Online social networks (OSNs) have become a necessary component of ICT-enabled services, affecting every area of human existence. The espousal of OSNs into tourism supply chain networks during a pandemic is crucial. However, scarce studies have been conducted on the espousal of OSNs in tourism supply chain networks. The study developed a research model based on the IS success model, uses and gratifications (U&amp;G) theory, institutional theory, and transaction cost theory to analyze the espousal of OSNs in the tourism supply chain network (TSCN) during COVID-19. The study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine 99 data acquired via online surveys from supply chain specialists in the travel and hospitality sectors. The research model outperforms better and fulfills all model fitness requirements. The research found that tourism supply chain experts adopt online social networks to address supply and demand disruptions caused by COVID-19. Utilitarian features (e.g., supply chain perceptibility), technological features (e.g., system quality), and cost-benefit aspects substantially influence the espousal of OSNs in the tourism supply chain network. Espousals of OSNs improve tourism supply chain performance during Covid-19. As a result of this research, tourism supply chain management, MIS, and social media literature will be enriched by introducing OSNs in the tourism supply chain environment. The research will also provide adequate implications to supply chain managers and OSNs service provider to adopt OSNs in the tourism supply chain during COVID-19.</jats:p>",

It is challenging to provide site conditions that allow the trees to thrive in the long term, particularly under climate change. Knowledge about the hydrological properties of artificial urban planting soils related to the response of tree species-specific growth is crucial, but still lacking. Therefore, we established a three-year experimental field setup to investigate the response of nine tree species (135 individuals) to two common urban planting soils and a loamy silt reference. We determined and measured soil hydrological parameters and monitored tree growth. Our results revealed low plant available water capacities (6% and 10% v/v) and hydraulic conductivity restrictions with the drying of the sandy-textured urban planting soils. Therefore, tree species that are investing in fine root growth to extract water from dry soils might be more successful than trees that are lowering their water potential. Tree growth was overall evidently lower in the urban planting soils compared with the reference and differed between and within the species. We showed that using unfavorable planting soils causes severe, species-specific growth deficits reflecting limited above-ground carbon uptake as a consequence of low water availability.</jats:p>"

The inter-observer agreement in MVD and Q pack examination is evaluated. We also compared MVD and Q pack examination with color and power Doppler in demonstrating testicular blood supply in children. Material and Methods: 114 testis (between the ages of 4-14) were included in the study. Testicular microvessel structure was examined by using color, power, MicroV Doppler and Q-pack examination techniques. A grouping system was created for color, Power and MicroV Doppler to score the vascularity of the testicular parenchyma visually. Results: In our study, we confirmed the presence of testicular blood flow with MVD in all children. We found that there was no significant difference between the observers in color, power Doppler and MVD and the consistency value was higher in MVD compared to color and power Doppler. We observed a significant positive correlation between Q-pack values and patient age. Q-pac values obtained from this study increased with age. The lack of statistically significant bias indicates that the method is useful. Conclusion: MVD is a reproducible method since there is no significant interobserver variability and can easily detect acute scrotal pathologies such as prepubertal torsion for the less experienced radiologists in the early years of working life. Thus, the need for senior guidance accompanying radiology resident in the evaluation of emergency cases in children may decrease.

NF1 patients are extremely susceptible to developing neurofibromas, which can transform into deadly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). At the center of these tumors are NF1-null Schwann cells. Here, we found that nanomedicine shows promise in the treatment of NF1-associated MPNSTs. We assessed the cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in NF1-null NF1-associated MPNSTs, NF1-wildtype sporadic MPNST, and normal Schwann cells. Our data show that AgNP are selectivity cytotoxic to NF1-associated MPNSTs relative to sporadic MPNST and Schwann cells. Furthermore, we found that sensitivity to AgNPs is correlated with the expression levels of functional neurofibromin. The restoration of functional neurofibromin in NF1-associated MPNSTs reduces AgNP sensitivity, and the knockdown of neurofibromin in Schwann cells increases AgNP sensitivity. This finding is unique to AgNPs, as NF1 restoration does not alter sensitivity to standard of care chemotherapy doxorubicin in NF1-associated MPNSTs. Using an in vitro model system, we then found that AgNP can selectively eradicate NF1-associated MPNSTs in co-culture with Schwann cells at doses tolerable to normal cells. AgNP represents a novel therapy for the treatment of NF1-associated MPNSTs and addresses significant unmet clinical need.</jats:p>"

The application of humic acid (HA) and the selection of the appropriate genotype in the suitable site is one of the most important methods of tolerance of wheat plants to drought-stress conditions. The aim of this study was achieved using a three-way ANOVA, the stress tolerance index (STI), the Pearson correlation coefficient (rp), and principal component analysis (PCA). Three field experiments in three sites (Al-Qasr, El-Neguilla, and Abo Kwela) during the 2019/21 and 2020/21 seasons were conducted, entailing one Egyptian bread wheat variety (Sakha 94) with three HA rates (0, 30, and 60 kg ha−1) under normal and drought-stress conditions (supplemental irrigation). According to the ANOVA, the sites, supplemental irrigation, HA rates, and their first- and second-order interactions the grain yield and most traits evaluated (p ≤ 0.05 or 0.01) were significantly influenced in both seasons. Drought stress drastically reduced all traits registered in all factors studied compared with normal conditions. The wheat plants at the Al-Qasr site in both seasons showed significantly increased grain yield and most traits compared with that of the other sites under normal and drought-stress conditions. HA significantly promoted all studied traits under drought stress, and was highest when applying 60 kg HA ha−1, regardless of the site. The greatest grain yield and most traits monitored were observed in wheat plants fertilized with 60 kg HA ha−1 at the Al-Qasr site in both seasons under both conditions. Grain yield significantly (p ≤ 0.05 or 0.01) correlated with water and precipitation use efficiency as well as the most studied traits under normal and drought-stress conditions. The results of STI, rp, and PCA from the current study could be useful and could be used as a suitable method for studying drought-tolerance mechanisms to improve wheat productivity. Based on the results of statistical methods used in this study, we recommend the application of 60 kg HA ha−1 to improve wheat productivity under drought conditions along the north-western coast of Egypt.</jats:p>"

To restore water resources, nature-based solutions can be applied. Nevertheless, it is unclear which solution promotes greater water supply resilience: restoring riparian vegetation, improving management practices in key areas for water recharge, or both? In addition, how significant are these results in the face of climate change effects? To answer this, we used the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to simulate and compare four different land use scenarios under three climate conditions (i.e., observed climate and two of the IPCC’s future climate projections). Focusing on key areas contributed more to increasing water supply resilience than forest restoration. Applying both solutions, however, yielded the greatest increases in resilience and groundwater recharge and the greatest decreases in surface runoff and sediment loads. None of the solutions caused a significant difference in streamflow and water yield. Furthermore, according to both of the IPCC climate projections evaluated, by the end of this century, the average annual streamflow will be lower than the historical mean for the region. Climate adaptation strategies alone will be insufficient to ensure future water access, highlighting the need for implementing drastic mitigation actions.</jats:p>"

Specially, we consider the crucial role of service in affecting customers’ valuation for a kind of experience product and establish a channel choice model by employing utility theory. Then, we analyze the optimal pricing and service decisions under decentralized and centralized scenarios. To achieve overall optimization, we propose three contract mechanisms, namely price hike (Mechanism 1), price hike with service cost sharing (Mechanism 2) and price hike with service cost sharing and surplus compensation (Mechanism 3). We reveal the way of price difference and service provision in affecting customer free-riding behavior. Besides, we find that the three mechanisms can reduce free-riding behavior to some extent. However, the extent varies under different mechanisms and is related to the cost-sharing fraction and the degree by which the manufacturer increases his online price. Further, we find that Mechanism 3 can realize overall optimization and members’ win–win situations. Finally, we conduct numerical examples to explore how different mechanisms affect supply chain efficiency. The results also provide managerial insights for dual-channel firms in practice.</jats:p>"

While acclimating to drought, the P. simonii seedlings exhibited a reduction in growth; differential expression levels of aquaporins (AQPs); activation of auxin (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways; a decrease in the net photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate; and an increase in stable nitrogen isotope composition (δ15N), total soluble substances, and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi), with a shift in the homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and scavenging. A low N supply (0.01 mM NH4NO3) or sufficient N supply (1 mM NH4NO3) exhibited distinct morphological, physiological, and transcriptional responses during acclimation to drought, primarily due to strong responses in the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding AQPs; higher soluble phenolics, total N concentrations, and ROS scavenging; and lower transpiration rates, IAA content, ABA content, and ROS accumulation with a sufficient N supply. P. simonii can differentially manage water uptake and hormone modulation in response to drought stress under deficient and sufficient N conditions. These results suggested that increased N may contribute to drought tolerance by decreasing the transpiration rate and O2− production while increasing water uptake and antioxidant enzyme activity.</jats:p>"

Exploring differentiated industrial land supply policy (DILSP) innovations can effectively address this issue. However, due to the limited practical cases, there are few studies on the policy innovations of industrial land supply. Based on the life cycle management (LCM) of industrial land (LCMIL), this study uses the policy analysis method to reform and innovate industrial land supply policy to solve the disadvantages of the current industrial land supply policy and proposes the DILSP as its basis. The research shows the following: (1) there are many problems in China’s current land supply policy, but policy innovation in some economically developed cities has achieved positive results, indicating that an effective institutional supply is the best way to solve these problems; (2) the process of industrial land utilization has obvious cyclical characteristics, and a complete process and differentiated supply policy framework based on “differentiated access evaluation, differentiated supply method, differentiated supply period, differentiated supply price, differentiated post-supply supervision” has a certain rationality and feasibility. This study provides an innovative solution to the shortcomings of China’s existing industrial land supply policy, and the idea of applying LCM theory to government policy-making also has a certain reference significance.</jats:p>"

From the perspective of supply-demand subject populations, this paper discusses the dynamic evolution process of strategy between individuals within construction enterprise populations and between construction enterprise populations and consumer populations. Firstly, based on Moran process, the stochastic evolutionary game model of construction enterprises adopting independent innovation strategy was constructed to obtain the conditions for the dominance of independent innovation strategy. Next, the bimatrix game model of construction enterprise populations and consumer populations was constructed to obtain the equilibrium frequency of the joint strategy. Then, the influence laws of the change of parameters on game were discussed through numerical simulations. The results show that (1) reducing the cost of independent R&amp;D cost, reducing the spillover effect coefficient, increasing the loss of technology introduction, and increasing R&amp;D subsidies for independent innovation construction enterprises are all conducive to IIS becoming an evolutionary stable strategy. (2) The marginal effect of IIS increases with the decrease in the spillover effect coefficient, the increase in the loss of technology introduction of construction enterprises, and the increase R&amp;D subsidies. (3) The smaller the mutation rate is, the greater the cross-price sensitivity coefficient is, the greater the green sensitivity coefficient is, the greater the probability of government active encouragement is, and the more dominant (production of green buildings, purchase of green buildings) is.

Some chemical compounds can be released from these plastic pipes and affect quality of drinking water. The article focuses on analyzing various approaches to examining polymer materials with the aim to assess migration of chemicals into drinking water. These approaches usually underlie methodologies of hygienic assessment developed for polymers.  Migration was assessed under the same conditions as per two types of migration processes, a continuous and a sequential one. These two types of migration processes emulate conditions typical for different flows in drinking water pipelines: situations of continuous stagnation in the system and a standard flow when water is renewed regularly in water supply networks. More than 20 organic compounds were identified in tested water samples. Most of them occurred in small concentrations (excluding benzenesulfonic acid butyl amide). Moreover, many of these chemicals are not regulated in drinking water, there no standards or reference concentrations fixed for them or a relevant toxicological assessment. Given that, it is practically impossible to assess health risks caused by exposure to these chemicals according to conventional assessment procedures.  It was also shown that release of chemicals differed considerably under different experimental designs. The results produced by successive migration tests indicated that intensity of migration from polymer materials the pipes were made from tended to change over time whereas the results of continuous migration tests showed that in case of stagnation quality of drinking water could deteriorate rather rapidly due to migration of organic compounds.</jats:p>",

However, previous research has not fully considered the green degree of products in the demand function of CDW remanufactured products. This study aimed to clarify how consumers’ green preferences and government subsidies affect decision making in the supply chain. First, a CDW resource utilization supply chain model composed of building materials manufacturers and retailers was constructed using consumer behavior theory. Second, the optimal decision making of members under conditions of decentralized and centralized decision making was analyzed using the Stackelberg game solution. Finally, the validity of the model and conclusions were verified by numerical simulation. The main conclusions are as follows. Government subsidies have a different impact on the pricing of new building materials products and CDW remanufactured products. Under decentralized decision making, the optimal profit of the CDW resource utilization supply chain with government subsidies is higher. However, under centralized decision making, the optimal profit is also related to consumers’ green preferences. According to consumers’ green preferences, choosing different decision-making models can not only improve the total profit of the CDW resource utilization supply chain, but also improve the reuse rate of CDW.</jats:p>"

It is demonstrated that a minor change in the system’s fractional-derivative may dramatically affect its behavior. Then, distributed consensus tracking of the multi-agent network is studied.

In order to explore the impact of government subsidy strategies on supply chain recovery in the context of supply chain disruptions, this paper takes high-demand products during the epidemic as the research object, and takes the government’s subsidy choices under the impact of production capacity and transportation disruptions as the entry point for recovery strategies.

The research results show that, for secondary supply chains, whether in the scenario of partial or complete transportation interruption, government subsidies to manufacturers make supply chain recovery more effective, government subsidies do not have an immediate recovery effect during production capacity and transportation interruptions, and that under the complete interruption of production capacity, the cumulative total value of the supply chain after increasing government subsidies has rebounded in a spiral.</jats:p>"

Chain members want to know the investment conditions of a blockchain-based ACTS and how to coordinate their supply chain. To solve these problems, a supply chain with one fresh producer and one retailer was chosen as the study subject. Afterwards, considering the unreliability of the freshness information, the demand function was revised. Then, the profit functions before and after adopting a blockchain-based ACTS were constructed, and then a price discount and revenue-sharing contract was put forward to coordinate the supply chain. Findings: With the growth of the unreliability coefficient of the freshness information, benefits to chain members in the proposed three situations would be reduced. Thus, we can know that after using a blockchain-based ACTS, if chain members want to gain more benefits, they should try their best to excavate the value of the blockchain-based ACTS and reduce the unreliability coefficient of the freshness information.</jats:p>"

Among various climate drivers, direct evidence for the Intertropical\nConvergence Zone (ITCZ) control of sediment supply on the millennial scale\nis lacking, and the changes in ITCZ migration demonstrated in paleoclimate\nrecords need to be better investigated.

On the\nglacial–interglacial scale, chemical weathering weakened during the North\nAtlantic cold-climate periods and falling sea level hindered the transport\nof smectite into the study area due to the exposure of Andaman and Nicobar\nIslands. However, the influence of the South Asian monsoon on the sediment\nsupply was not obvious on the millennial scale. We suggest that the\nnorth–south migration of the ITCZ controlled the rainfall in Myanmar and\nfurther directly determined the supply of clay minerals on the millennium\nscale because the transport of smectite was highly connected with the ITCZ\nlocation; thus, the regional shift of the ITCZ induced an abnormal increase\nin the smectite percentage during the late Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in our\nrecords. The smectite percentage in the studied core is similar to distinct\nITCZ records but different in some periods, revealing that regional changes\nin the ITCZ were significantly obvious, the ITCZ is not a simple\nnorth–south displacement, and closer connections occurred between the\nNorthern–Southern Hemisphere in the eastern Indian Ocean during the late\nLGM.\n                    </jats:p>"

The energy saving potential was shown in the industry in ge¬neral, and in mining enterprises in particular. For example, in some areas of enterprises, such measures as reactive power compensa-tion, the introduction of automated electric drive systems, the development and pilot operation of power quality control systems with continuous recording of indicators were considered. The mathematical modeling method was implemented using the MatLab software package which has proven itself in engineering calculations around the world. Instrumental control and evaluation of power quality indicators were carried out in accordance with the requirements of GOST RF 32144–2013. As a result of the potential optimization of individual power supply systems, the estimated total economic ef-fect due to energy savings was obtained. The figure approached 28 million rubles per year, which is on average 20% of the cost of electricity consumption of the considered sites of mining enterprises.</jats:p>",

This study, from the perspective of tourism sectors, including tourism hotels, travel agencies, and scenic spots, integrated the environmentally extended input–output analysis (EEIO) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to develop a research framework, analyzing the indirect carbon emissions of the tourism supply chain, evaluating eco-efficiency with respect to both direct carbon emissions and total carbon emissions (including direct and indirect parts), and exploring the driving factors of eco-efficiency of tourism sectors using Tobit regression models. This study took Gansu as a case, a province in China characterized by higher carbon intensity, an underdeveloped economy, and rapid tourism growth. The results demonstrate that (1) tourism hotels contribute the most carbon emissions in tourism sectors, especially indirectly due to the supply chain, with carbon emissions mainly resulting from the manufacturing of food and tobacco; (2) the eco-efficiency of tourism sectors in Gansu presents a U-shaped curve, which is consistent with Kuznets’ theory; and (3) energy technology is key to improving the eco-efficiency of tourism sectors. The research results provide a clear path for the reduction of carbon emissions and the improvement of eco-efficiency in Gansu tourism sectors. Against the backdrop of global climate change and the post-COVID-19 era, our research framework and findings provide a reference for similar regions and countries who are in urgent need of rapid tourism development to effect economic recovery.</jats:p>"

Some chemical compounds can be released from these plastic pipes and affect quality of drinking water. The article focuses on analyzing various approaches to examining polymer materials with the aim to assess migration of chemicals into drinking water. These approaches usually underlie methodologies of hygienic assessment developed for polymers.  Migration was assessed under the same conditions as per two types of migration processes, a continuous and a sequential one. These two types of migration processes emulate conditions typical for different flows in drinking water pipelines: situations of continuous stagnation in the system and a standard flow when water is renewed regularly in water supply networks. More than 20 organic compounds were identified in tested water samples. Most of them occurred in small concentrations (excluding benzenesulfonic acid butyl amide). Moreover, many of these chemicals are not regulated in drinking water, there no standards or reference concentrations fixed for them or a relevant toxicological assessment. Given that, it is practically impossible to assess health risks caused by exposure to these chemicals according to conventional assessment procedures.  It was also shown that release of chemicals differed considerably under different experimental designs. The results produced by successive migration tests indicated that intensity of migration from polymer materials the pipes were made from tended to change over time whereas the results of continuous migration tests showed that in case of stagnation quality of drinking water could deteriorate rather rapidly due to migration of organic compounds.</jats:p>",

Comparisons of the CFD results, the measured pressures and the one-dimensional results, demonstrate that the current 3D CFD approach better reproduces the experimental pressure oscillations while helping to visualize the associated physical processes and to further explore the 3D transient characteristics. The mean velocity distributions in the radial direction significantly change as the pipe transient progresses, which is closely associated with transient shear stress. Mean velocity variations at the valve during the closing process undergo three distinct stages: slight change, then drastic reduction, and finally slowing down.

Specifically, high risk represents the potential premise of high return for risk preference decision-makers, and for risk-averse decision-makers, the increase of risk degree will stimulate decision-makers’ aversion to uncertainty and turn to seek safer business strategies. Although there are many pieces of literature on the risk preference of decision-makers, they usually only assume the risk attitude of one party and rarely consider the risk attitude of suppliers and retailers in the scenario of cross-border e-commerce at the same time. Therefore, under the background of supply disruption, for the cross-border e-commerce supply chain composed of cross-border suppliers, overseas suppliers, overseas retailers, and consumers, combined with the risk attitude preference of enterprise subjects, this paper constructs the mean-variance model dominated by overseas retailers and reversely solves the risk-aversion attitude of a single cross-border supplier. When a single overseas retailer maintains a risk-aversion attitude and both cross-border suppliers and overseas retailers hold a risk-neutral or risk-aversion attitude, the pricing of products in different channels is analyzed. Finally, an example is given to analyze the impact of supply disruption probability, risk-aversion coefficient, channel distribution coefficient, and other parameters on purchase price, market demand, target profit, and utility. It is of great practical significance for improving the stability of cross-border e-commerce supply chain system and reducing revenue loss to study how different degrees of risk-aversion attitudes of cross-border suppliers and overseas retailers affect enterprise procurement pricing strategy, target profit, and utility in case of supply disruption.</jats:p>",

Practical neurosurgeons are faced with the treatment of such patients, despite their rarity. One of the successful results of the treatment of patients with tumors of the lateral ventricles is good knowledge of the anatomy, including the blood supply of these tumors. One of the important problems that neurosurgeons face when removing tumors of the lateral ventricles is the condition of the internal veins. Quite frequently the veins are included in the structure of the tumor. If the veins are damaged, a violation of the venous outflow occurs, which leads to the development of complications in the form of edema, and in some cases, dislocation of brain structures. Therefore, knowledge of venous anatomy and its changes in the presence of tumors of the lateral ventricles before surgery is of great importance for the successful surgery of tumors of the lateral ventricles. The proposed article is devoted to the venous anatomy of the lateral ventricles.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Faisalabad is the 3rd largest city of Pakistan where underlying aquifer mostly contains saline water. Heavy population of the city needs huge quantity of fresh water. Water requirements for the existing Faisalabad city are being met by installation of well-fields along Jhang Branch canal, where groundwater is fresh. The increasing population pressure requires more water and identify more suitable sites for installation of well-field on sustainable basis. It was deemed imperative to elevate the existing well field. The MODFLOW, a numerical groundwater model developed by United States Geological Survey (USGS) for simulation and future prediction of aquifer behavior in response to pumping by various well fields was developed, calibrated and validated satisfactorily. A groundwater decomposition approach was also developed to tune various coefficients used in estimation of inflow and outflow components of groundwater system. The calibrated model was used to predict the future response of aquifer under different scenarios of pumping by existing and future/proposed wellfields. Calibrated flow model revealed that a sink has already been developed at the center of existing well-field of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) due to excessive pumpage. Future predictions of model indicate that there is no conspicuous change in regional groundwater flow pattern, even with all the existing tubewells remain in operation. However, the sink in the WASA well field area further deepens, and flow gradients become comparatively steep showing increase in groundwater flow velocity. Depth to watertable has already increased from 12 m in 2005 to 16 m in 2011 in the critical area of WASA well field. Model has predicted that this depth will further increase to 24 m in 2018. It has also been observed that groundwater quality along the river is fresh and becomes saline towards Faisalabad city. Due to pumpage in the freshwater zone model predicts that saline water will rush towards well fields deteriorating the quality of fresh water along Jhang Branch Canal. Therefore, it has been suggested that site for further pumping should be moved towards upstream of Jhang Branch Canal at least up to RD 180-187 and possibly on right side of the canal instead of left side</jats:p>"

To assess the energy supply system state of the gastric fundic and pyloric mucosa cells in children with chronic gastritis associated with mild to severe CTD. Material and methods. 34 school-age children with CG were examined. The patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with targeted biopsy of the gastric mucosa followed by histochemical examination. The presence and severity of CTD were verified according to T. Milkowska-Dimitrova’s clinical criteria (1987). Results. Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase was observed in gastric fundic mucosa cells in children with CG regardless of the CTD severity, thus indicating the suppression of the most effective way of obtaining energy. An increase in the activity of acid phosphatase was established, indicating the activation of lysosomes associated with increased autophagy, aimed at removing damaged membranes and organelles to cleanse the cytoplasm of cells. An increase in the activity of all cytoplasmic enzymes in question was observed in the pyloric region, demonstrating the activation of the processes of both aerobic and anaerobic methods of obtaining energy. Conclusions. Significant disturbances were detected in the energy supply system of exocrinocytes of the gastric mucosa in children with CG, regardless of СTD severity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Excessive rainfall in the soybean preharvest period can make mechanized crop harvesting technically and economically unfeasible, causing 100% losses in soybean grain yield. An alternative to reduce the economic losses of farmers would be using unharvested soybean crop residues as a source of nitrogen (N) for the subsequent corn crop. However, a question that still needs to be understood is whether the amount of N released from unharvested soybean residues (straw and grains) is sufficient to meet all the nutritional demand for this nutrient in the off-season corn. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of unharvested soybean crop residue persistence on the yield response of off-season corn crop (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) to the application of N fertilizer rates when grown in tropical Cerrado soils of medium and high fertility. Four simple corn hybrids (SYN7G17 TL, 30F53VYHR, B2433PWU, and AG 8700 PRO3) were grown in soils of medium fertility and medium acidity level (UFMS 1) and high fertility and low acidity level (UFMS 2) and fertilized with five of N fertilizer rates (0, 40, 80, 120, and 160 kg ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup> of N) applied at 30 days after emergence (DAE). Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the interrelationships between the groups of independent (agricultural production areas, corn cultivars, and N application rates) and dependent (corn agronomic traits) variables. Crop residues remaining on the soil surface from soybeans not harvested and inoculated with Bradyrhizobium spp. can supply most of the nitrogen requirement of off-season corn grown in succession, especially in tropical soils of medium fertility. However, in high-fertility tropical soils, the maximum grain yield potential of off-season corn cultivars can be obtained with the application of mineral N fertilizer in supplement the amount of nitrogen released from unharvested soybean residues. Therefore, the N requirement depends on the corn cultivar and the agricultural production area. However, our results show that when off-season corn is grown on unharvested soybean residues, nitrogen fertilization in topdressing can be dispensed. The agricultural area with high fertility soil (UFMS 2) enhances the grain yield of the off-season corn crop. The corn cultivar AG 8700 PRO3 has a higher thousand-grain mass and high grain yield potential under Brazilian Cerrado conditions.</jats:p>"

        "In this study, the effect of changes in the climate on the hydrological cycle and water supply in the areas where drought continues for a long time during the year, spatial and temporal variations of evapotranspiration values were revealed by using the monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, total precipitation, average wind speed, the sunshine duration, average relative humidity, and radiation intensity data, 8 stations in the province of Şanlıurfa (Şanlıurfa, Akçakale, Birecik, Bozova, Ceylanpınar, Hilvan, Siverek, and Viranşehir) were examined by the period 1980-2020. CROPWAT software developed by FAO was used to calculate FAO56-Penman-Monteith reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values. ArcGIS software was used to create maps showing the spatial and temporal variation of the obtained ETo values. Statistically strong positive increases were observed in the trend of ETo values, especially in the southern stations where agricultural activity is intense. In addition, with the Aridity Index drought calculation method, it has been revealed that semi-arid conditions are dominant in the field. It is essential to know the ETo values in determining the water needed to be used in agricultural activities in Şanlıurfa, one of the GAP’s important pillars. For this reason, it would be beneficial to consider the Penman-Monteith method proposed by the FAO in planning studies. The fact that the water demand changes from crop to crop and depending on the vegetation period of each crop makes it necessary to calculate the ETo values specifically according to the crops."
