Calculations showed that spatial variability of mineral N in soil led to higher 'economic optimum' fertilizer rates and rates of Environmentally Acceptable Production (EAP) decreased. Without spatial variability a positive difference of 13 kg/ha was found between the N fertilizer rates for EAP and Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) even when the strictest environmental standard was applied (soil mineral N content at harvest not exceeding 34 kg/ha). At standard levels of variability there was a negative difference of 16 kg/ha, and at doubled variability the difference was 156 kg/ha. An N residue rate of 45 kg/ha at harvest could be met at standard varibility but not at doubled variability. The model showed that higher degrees of 'luxury consumption' and improved synchronization of N mineralization and crop demand had a positive effect on the difference between EAP and MEY. It was concluded that the degree of spatial variability in N supply must be taken into account for environmental and production targets.

This approach should be cheaper and more efficient than the use of a variable-displacement unit. Computer simulation is used to predict the performance of the system and act as a guide in optimizing the control system. An experimental rig has been constructed to examine the practicalities of these ideas. Some experimental results are presented. Future work will be concerned with noise and efficiency studies.</jats:p>",

El objetivo del trabajo que se presenta es conocer, de manera detallada, los rasgos que definen esta oferta en cada país y en el conjunto de países estudiados. Estructurado en dos partes, en la primera se ofrecen, en primer lugar, datos sobre las características de la información contenida en las bases de datos: naturaleza de la información, temas sobre los que versa, cobertura temporal, técnicas documentales utilizadas, normas de descripción bibliográfica, productores de esas Bases de Datos. En segundo lugar, se estudian los aspectos relativos a la distribución de la información: distribuidores, -paquetes de gestión de bases de datos, instrumentos de ayuda al usuario para las consultas, tipo de acceso que se ofrece. La segunda parte se dedica al análisis de los datos aportados en la primera: distribución de la producción de bases de datos por temas, países y años, estudio de las áreas temáticas no cubiertas, comparación de las técnicas documentales empleadas, compatibilidad de los paquetes de gestión y de los formatos informáticos, análisis de la calidad de los servicios de acceso, precios, formación ofrecida, etc. Se finaliza con unas conclusiones orientadas a proponer los desarrollos deseables para el conjunto de paises así como las posibilidades de cooperación con vistas a mejorar la oferta de información automatizada en Ciencias Sociales.</jats:p>"

There has been some indication that the efficiency of rumen microbial protein synthesis could be higher if protein N is provided (Stock, Klopfenstein, Brink, Britton and Harmon, 1986).
