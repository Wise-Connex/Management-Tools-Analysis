However, the relationship for these data is linear, indicating that the population base that supports arts organizations is constant, regardless of how large the metropolis is. Although urban size is a powerful predictor of the numbers of performing art institutions, the remaining variation is examined in terms of region and metropolitan factors that include stratification variables, government fragmentation, and an aggregate index of status inconsistency. </jats:p>",

Environmental isolates lacked known plasmid-mediated characteristics, with the exception of one Escherichia coli isolate which showed some antibiotic resistance.

At high levels of nitrogen supply, there was a higher net assimilation rate (NAR) and a higher leaf weight ratio in defoliated plants than in undefoliated plants resulting in a faster growth of defoliated plants. In <jats:italic>V. thapsus</jats:italic> growth of defoliated plants did not differ significantly from undipped plants. In a low nitrogen regime all defoliated <jats:italic>V. thapsus</jats:italic> plants died. In the same regime <jats:italic>C. officinale</jats:italic> had a low NAR and thus showed little regrowth. Leaf nitrogen content was not significantly different from control plants.</jats:p>",
