These forecasts are used for a wide variety of purposes including the oil industry itself, financial institutions, public policy planners, nations, and groups of nations (OPEC).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Most forecasts are incorrect after only a few years, but they are often updated without a fundamental under-standing of why the earlier predictions were in error. This leads to painful disruptions and redirections not only within the oil industry but also in public policy debates and decisions on a national and global scale.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper reviews some of the more significant forecasts of energy supply, demand, and oil prices made in the last 25 years, and identifies the basic premises used and why they led to incorrect forecasts. Usually the premises have been too narrowly based. A broader basis is proposed, which includes continuing changes in technology, national goals, public attitudes and environmental concerns. Extrapolation of past trends is a poor basis for forecasts. Hence, a broader understanding of the changing world is essential and must be incorporated meaningfully into forecasts.</jats:p>",

This paper examines transitional dynamics and gains of tax reforms for countries in a global economy, and provides numerical solutions for international tax competition games. Tax reforms in a global economy cause cross-country externalities through capital flows in response to consumption-smoothing and debt-servicing effects, with taxes on world payments affecting the distribution of welfare gains. Within the class of time-invariant tax rates, the gains of replacing income taxes with consumption taxes are large and, in the absence of taxes on foreign assets, the monopoly distortion separating cooperative and noncooperative equilibria is negligible. The analysis starts from a benchmark reflecting current G-7 fiscal policies, and considers the effects of tax reforms on real exchange rates and interest differentials. Tax-distorted equilibrium dynamics are computed using a modified version of the King-Plosser-Rebelo algorithm augmented with shooting routines.</jats:p>"

The results of two surveys are described, which support the assertion that there is no shortage of such teachers in Scotland. Some of the suggested reasons for the shortage in England are then discussed in the light of this finding. The main conclusion is that there is no shortage of physics teachers in Scotland because the pool of potential physics teachers is larger as a result of more university students taking physics‐based courses. More students take physics courses because more youngsters study physics beyond sixteen, and more youngsters study physics beyond sixteen because they are taught by well‐qualified physics teachers. The cycle is, therefore, self‐perpetuating.</jats:p>",

Monte Carlo experiments document that a two‐state Markov model can reproduce the relationships between resilience and reliability for a wide class of water supply systems.

Even the complete elimination of exogenous materials from the overlying waters allowed heterotrophic activity to continue unaffected. Moreover, that continued activity was not supported by the catabolism of endogenous reserves of C (poly‐<jats:italic>β</jats:italic>‐hydroxy alkanoate—PHA). The addition of inorganic nutrients to substrate‐free waters allowed heterotrophic activity to increase within the biofilm.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Continuation of arterial blood supply to the head following slaughter of certain ruminant meat animal species can lead to delays in loss of sensibility and present welfare problems. This sometimes occurs in cattle due to an anastomosis linking the vertebral arteries to the carotid rete. The arterial supply to the head of the ox was found to differ from that of the sheep. In the ox the vertebral arteries can supply blood to the carotid rete via the basi-occipital plexus (Baldwin and Bell, 1963). This additional anastomosis means that there is still a potential blood supply to the head after the carotids have been severed by neck sticking Anil et al, 1995). Blood clots on the severed carotid arteries following neck sticking can occur in up to 40% of cases to varying degrees and sometimes lead to occlusions for a number of reasons. This phenomenon of carotid occlusion means the occipital-vertebral anastomosis and the vertebral-carotid rete anastomosis take on more importance when neck sticking is used. This is especially true for religious slaughter and neck sticking where electrical stunning is used. It is not clear whether such an anastomosis exists in the head of red deer. The traditional and still legal method of slaughter of farmed deer is by head shot in the field, however, there has been an increase in the number of deer being culled in abattoirs. In addition, there have been recent suggestions that religious slaughter without stunning may be initiated in the U.K. abattoirs. This possibility and and the increased number of abattoirs slaughtering deer have prompted this study to look at the arterial blood supply in the head of the deer. This increase combined with the problems of arterial supply found in cattle has prompted this study.</jats:p>",

However, it has instead led to German policy dominance within the system according to several recent studies. We examine the optimal dynamic credit policy of a bank in an EMS country that is subject to such German ‘dominance’. Our stochastic control model reveals conditions under which German monetary policies can influence domestic bank lending behaviour. It also suggests that banks may be able to hedge such risk exposure by increasing in size. the model offers ‘credit supply' based explanations for recent regulatory reforms in Europe towards unified banking and the attempts of several EMS members to de‐link their policies from that of the German Bundesbank.</jats:p>",

Therefore, in established lactation and with a demand feeding regime, a mother's milk production is likely to be a reflection of her infant's appetite, rather than her ability to produce milk, which may in fact be several-fold higher. However, previous studies of human milk production have not provided a clear insight into how the lactating breast matches milk production to infant demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Establishing the extent to which the level of transport supply affects demand generation remains a daunting problem for the transport analyst because of reciprocal causation and dependency between supply and demand. After the US deregulation of domestic air transport, unprecedented increases in air-service supply were observed at many US airports, increases which can be considered to be clearly independent of local service requirements. The supply measures reflect improvements in service both to nearby major airports and to the United States as a whole. In this paper, a sample of three airports is examined in an attempt to establish causal relationships between local demand and several measures of air-transport supply. Causality is established by using cross-correlation-function analysis, and the impacts of supply on demand are determined by using time-series transfer-function modelling. Causality is found to be location dependent, but supply tends to affect demand with a 3–6–month lag. Supply in terms of the total number of destinations served was found to have a significant impact on demand at Syracuse, with estimated transfer-function elasticities of 0.5. </jats:p>",

For effective protein rationing, the aim is to match the supply of FME and ERDP, and to supply further protein requirements as DUP. This should lead to a better balance of energy and protein to meet the requirements of the animal. Diets are likely to have lower total protein contents than those presently available, leading to reductions in diet costs and nitrogen (N) excretion. The MP system was constructed primarily on a theoretical basis and this experiment was an initial step in validating it for beef cattle.</jats:p>",

To ensure a rigorous test of market efficiency, monetary growth has been decomposed, into anticipated and unanticipated elements. The All Share Index of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is regressed against the monetary variables. The test results indicate that lagged changes in anticipated monetary growth are significant in explaining changes in share prices, a finding contrary to the efficient market hypothesis. However, the low coefficients of determination indicate that only a small percentage of the variation in share prices is explained by ex post changes in money supply and consequently the potential for a trading rule to earn superior returns to the market is limited.</jats:p>"

The authors examine public policies designed to impact the supply and training of health care providers in terms of their short- and long-term effectiveness in influencing the composition of the health care workforce. They analyze data from a series of qualitative studies with family practice residents, providers, and key personnel from family practice residency programs for insights to help identify candidates who could be successful in needy environments, and in understanding providers’ perceptions of benefits and drawbacks of working with the underserved. The authors recommend a strategy for recruiting candidates better matched to the requirements of practice with the underserved, revising curricula to provide needed training to facilitate providers’ success in underserved settings, and designing practice environments supportive of providers working with underserved populations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Background:</jats:italic> Fasting and other catabolic states are characterized by reductions in the rate of protein synthesis. Most studies have investigated tissues such as skeletal muscle or liver, but impairments in the biochemistry of cardiovascular tissues also contribute to enhanced morbidity. The objectives of the present study were (1) to determine the response of protein synthesis in the heart and lung of young rats to overnight fasting; and (2) to determine whether protein synthesis could be ameliorated or modulated by refeeding or provision of enteral or parenteral nutrition. <jats:italic>Methods:</jats:italic> Fractional rates of protein synthesis (ie, the percentage of tissue protein renewed each day, <jats:italic>k<jats:sub>s</jats:sub></jats:italic>) were measured <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> in the ventricular muscle and lungs of young male Wistar rats (body weight, 100 to 130 g) with a “flooding” dose of L‐[4<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>H]phenylalanine. Rats were fed <jats:italic>ad libitum</jats:italic> or fasted overnight. Fasted rats were subjected to various treatments. <jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> When nutrient supply in fasted rats recommenced by refeeding for 1 hour, there were small but significant increases in the rates of ventricular protein synthesis, although the infusion of amino acids and glucose for 1 hour had no significant effect. Increases in ventricular <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> <jats:sub>s</jats:sub> were also obtained when amino acids were infused for 6 hours. Infusion of glucose alone for 6 hours did not cause a significant increase in ventricular <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> <jats:sub>s</jats:sub> <jats:italic>.</jats:italic> The effect of infusing a mixture of glucose plus amino acids for 6 hours was similar to the effects of amino acids alone. In all instances, ventricular <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> <jats:sub>s</jats:sub> in rats infused with amino acid for 6 hours did not attain rates observed in fed rats. <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> <jats:sub>s</jats:sub> was reduced in the lung after overnight fasting but was unresponsive to refeeding or to acute or chronic provision of amino acids and glucose by either IV or oral routes. Measurements also suggested that changes in neither insulin nor glucagon <jats:italic>per se</jats:italic> were responsible for the amino acid‐induced increases in heart protein synthesis. However, acute treatment of rats with anti‐insulin serum reduced rates of ventricular <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> <jats:sub>s</jats:sub> below values observed in fed rats. Anti‐insulin serum also increased lung <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> <jats:sub>s</jats:sub> <jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> It was concluded that rates of heart protein synthesis could be increased by the chronic provision (ie, 6 hours) of nutrients by oral or IV routes. In contrast, the lung was insensitive to these treatments. The observations have important implications for clinical situations, which are characterized by diminished cardiopulmonary protein synthesis.

Consecutive 4‐mm thick two‐dimensional CT slice data were reconstructed to 3‐dimen‐sional volumetric images to enhance spatial evaluation of the blood supply. Gross dissection and angiographic studies identified three major vascular sources. Above the fetlock, the DDFT was supplied by either a branch of the medial palmar artery (Arteriae digitalis palmaris communis II) or a branch of the medial palmar digital artery (A. digitalis [palmaris propria III] medialis). Below the fetlock, the DDFT was supplied by branches from the lateral and medial palmar branches to the proximal phalanx (Ramus palmaris phalangis proximalis). The most distal aspect of the tendon received small branches from the medial and lateral palmar digital arteries. Using histology and microangiography we observed an extensive and uniform intratendinous vascular network above and below the fetlock, with a relatively avascular region of tendon palmar to the fetlock. The most distal 2.0 to 2.5 cm of the tendon within the sheath was heavily infiltrated with fibrocartilage along its dorsal aspect.</jats:p>",
