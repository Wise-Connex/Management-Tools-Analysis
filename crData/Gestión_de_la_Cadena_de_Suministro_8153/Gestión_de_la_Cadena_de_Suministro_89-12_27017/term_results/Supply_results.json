In particular, it tries to evaluate the effectiveness of the few relevant supply‐side policies adopted in Italy, which were based essentially on labour oriented policy instruments. It is found that technological change was far more important than policy factors for restructuring and reconverting industrial activities and increasing the level of production.</jats:p>",

The independent variables of the supply function are the price of roundwood, the unit felling cost, the net (post-taxation) real rate of return on capital, and the resource inventory of mature trees ready for final feiling. The short-run roundwood demand is dependent on capacity, roundwood short-run average revenue product and the price of roundwood. All the coefficients exhibited the signs suggested by economic theory.

This paper sets out a hypothesis for the determinants of re-let supply in terms of the characteristics of council tenants and local market factors. This hypothesis is tested for English local authorities between 1980 and 1987 using correlation and regression analyses. The behavioural model thus developed can explain 60 per cent of the variation in re-let rates between districts outside London. The most important factors are shown to be the household structure of existing council tenants and the level of house prices in the local private housing market. </jats:p>",

Two experiments tested the effects of sowing date and N supply, the third sowing density and nitrogen supply. Extension growth of main-stem leaves was measured by ruler and expressed in thermal time units to allow comparisons between sowing dates. Rate and duration of leaf extension were determined from linear regressions of leaf length against thermal time.</jats:p><jats:p>Increasing N supply increased leaf extension rate but had no significant effects on leaf extension duration. Leaf extension rate increased with leaf position on the main shoot, but decreased slightly in leaves extending at the time of stem elongation. Leaf extension duration also increased with leaf position on the main shoot and was related to mean temperature during the leaf extension phase. Plants sown in September were able to compensate for lower radiation receipts by having a faster rate and longer duration of leaf extension, by producing larger leaves with a greater specific lamina area and by partitioning a greater proportion of extension growth into lamina and less into sheaths. In plants sown in June, the largest leaf occurred at a lower stem node and leaves emerging later showed a strong response to N. It is suggested that this is attributable to earlier onset of internal competition for assimilates. Variation in leaf extension rate was the main factor influencing variation in final leaf area. There was a strong positive relationship between leaf extension rate and leaf N content.</jats:p><jats:p>Increasing sowing density increased the area of the first four leaves on the main shoot and decreased that of later leaves, changes mainly associated with changes in leaf extension duration. It is concluded that progress in the modelling of leaf area expansion, light interception and dry matter production requires more information about how sowing date, sowing density and N supply interact to influence crop development and leaf growth.</jats:p>",

Treatments were a factorial combination of two feeding frequencies (1 × or 4 ×/d) and two diets fed at 2% of body weight (alfalfa silage with or without 10% soybean meal (SBM), dry matter basis). Diets were made isocaloric by the addition of corn. Supplementary SBM did not affect concentration of most rumen metabolites, except for increasing ammonia levels (P &lt; 0.05). Rumen liquid kinetics were not affected by supplementation with SBM. However, SBM increased (P &lt; 0.05) duodenal flow of microbial and residual N as well as efficiency of microbial protein synthesis when the diet was fed more frequently. Four times feeding increased the turnover rate of rumen liquid (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the diurnal variation of all rumen parameters was reduced, suggesting more stable rumen conditions and more uniform fermentation. Nevertheless, site and extent of organic matter and cell wall digestion were not affected. Nitrogen retention was improved (P &lt; 0.05) with both diets due to 4 × feeding. Neither N flows to the duodenum nor efficiency of microbial protein synthesis were influenced when the control diet was fed frequently.

The symptoms, which develop in mid‐summer, include interveinal chlorosis, development of necrolic areas on the leaf and eventual leaf death. Field observations strongly indicated the involvement of the root system. The present study investigated the extent to which temperature and oxygen supply at the root influenced the physiology of kiwifruit vines.</jats:p><jats:p>Maximum root growth occurred at 20 °C, while temperatures in excess of 25 °C reduced growth. Shoot growth was also reduced by root temperatures above 20 °C. No obvious leaf symptoms developed on the vines affected by the high temperatures. Below 20 °C there was a marked reduction in growth with little or no growth occurring at 10 °C. While soil temperature can be expected to influence root growth <jats:italic>per se</jats:italic>, it would appear unlikely that it directly controls the seasonal pattern of root growth or greatly influences the physiology of the leaf.</jats:p><jats:p>This study showed kiwifruit vines are not well adapted to tolerate low concentrations of oxygen in their root zone. Growth was substantially reduced when the supply of oxygen to the roots was reduced. The extent of the reduction was proportional to the number of hours per day the vines were without aeration. Root growth was particularly affected. Distinctive leaf symptoms appeared on all oxygen‐stressed vines and included the sudden appearance of large necrotic areas on the older leaves, sometimes preceded by an interveinal chlorosis. Measurement of the porosity of the roots indicated that the average air space between the tightly packed cells accounted for 2% or less of the total root volume. There was no obvious change in root porosity with decreasing oxygen supply or difference between the solution grown vines and vines from the field.</jats:p><jats:p>Decreasing the supply of oxygen to the roots resulted in rapid reduction in the stomatal conductance of the leaves and the virtual elimination of the diurnal pattern. Associated with the decrease m the stomatal conductance was a marked increase in the maximum daily temperature of the leaves compared to the control vines. The difference between the two treatments increased with time. An estimate of the rate of consumption of oxygen per unit length of root (9.1 × 10<jats:sup>−10</jats:sup> mol m<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> s <jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) suggests that a mature kiwifruit vine could deplete the oxygen supply in a well aerated soil to an anoxic condition in about 5 hours. The relatively high consumption of oxygen coupled with the low porosity of the roots ensures that even short periods of low concentrations of oxygen in the root zone will seriously affect the physiology and growth of kiwifruit vines. It was concluded that poor aeration of the root system is likely to be a major factor in the incidence of the leaf disorder currently affecting kiwifruit vines in a number of countries.</jats:p>",
