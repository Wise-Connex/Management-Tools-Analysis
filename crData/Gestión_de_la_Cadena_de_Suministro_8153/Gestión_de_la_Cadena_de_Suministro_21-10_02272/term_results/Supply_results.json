      "abstract": "<p>Resilience - the ability to deal with crises and recover from their effects as quickly as possible - has been glorified since the COVID-19 pandemic as the new miracle cure against the effects for disruptions that occur in the future. Especially for Germany as an export-oriented location, the resilient design of supply chains is an economic success factor. However, a strategic anchoring of resilience thinking in management as well as the use of future-oriented technologies are necessary to harness the potentials of a robust, agile, adaptive and integrative supply chain. Additive manufacturing, due to its digital \"DNA\" and great design freedom, has the potential to more efficiently create or drive supply chain resilience. Redundancy due to inventories, for example, becomes obsolete due to the location-independent, flexible production of required products without long start-up times on the basis of computer-aided design files. Companies in a supply chain also do not have to bear the investment risk for additive manufacturing machines due to new, data-based business models. For many manufacturing companies and entrepreneurial alliances in the form of a supply chain, the question is therefore increasingly whether additive manufacturing technology can be increasingly used as an instrument to increase resilience along the supply chain in the future. The study \"Resilience in Supply Chains - How Additive Manufacturing Enables a Resilient Supply Chain\" sheds light on this economic and also ecologically valuable question and presents potential data-driven business models for the technology sector.</p>"

The research was supported by primary and secondary data. The primary data obtained through structured questionnaire prepared for export abattoirs and slaughter animal suppliers, whereas the secondary data obtained from published and unpublished documents. Sixty (60) respondents from ten (10) meat export abattoirs which are at managerial positions and sixty (60) managers of slaughters animal suppliers and the total number of respondents were one hundred twenty (120). The study used brokers’ involvement in supply, transportation facility, price of slaughter animal, illegal live animal export, and quality of slaughter animal, sustainability of slaughter animal supply and traditional livestock production system as independent and supply performance as dependent variable. Correlation analysis was accustomed to analyze relation between independent and dependent variables whereas multiple regressions were applied to analyze and identifies impact level of every independent on dependent variable. The study found that sustainability of slaughter animal supply, traditional livestock production system; transportation facility and quality of slaughter animal have strong effect on supply performance in positive direction respectively. Brokers involvement in supply, price of slaughter animal and illegal live animal export also have strong effect on supply performance in the negative direction.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Regulatory literature, namely the DBN \"Domestic Water Supply and Sewerage\" does not offer an algorithm for obtaining the optimal diameters on all, without exception, the calculated sections of internal networks of cold and hot water supply. In general, it is not proposed to consider the entire network as a single object. It indicates only the maximum velocities of water in the calculated sections, which depend on the material of the pipe, and states that it is necessary \"to maximally use the guaranteed head in the city network. These are two mutually exclusive recommendations. When one is implemented, it is impossible to implement the other and vice versa. It is proposed to completely formalize the calculations of internal networks from finding diameters on individual design sections of the internal network of cold or hot water supply. Optimization is performed simultaneously for all sections of the network without exception. For calculations, to find the best network variant, it is suggested to use two parameters: quantity and quality. As it is generally known, only simultaneous fulfillment of these two parameters enables the water supply network to be reliable. The quality of water depends on the time in which it reaches the consumer. The longer the time, the worse the quality of water. This applies to both cold and hot water. The quantity of water depends on the pressure. The greater the head, the higher the speed of movement and accordingly the higher the flow of water, but there is a disadvantage - the higher the head loss on the way to the consumer and the higher the fee for the service. The search for optimality, so that it was both fast and the head loss is minimal and gives the best option for the network. When using the methodology, neither the designer's experience in solving such problems, nor his general professional level has any influence on the result. This, in turn, makes it possible to quickly solve problems of finding the best option in a short time, as well as to further reduce the time when calculating the network to make the software and in this case the professional level of the designer in general will not have any bearing on the quality of calculations.</jats:p>"

We firstly explore the historical production of climate injustice through extractive economies of colonial control, the accumulation of climate debts, and ongoing patterns of uneven exchange. We develop an account which highlights the relationship between the production, exchange, and consumption of fossil fuels and historical and contemporary inequalities around race, class, and gender which need to be addressed if a meaningful account of climate justice is to take root. We then explore the role of resistance to the expansion of fossil-fuel frontiers and campaigns to leave fossil fuels in the ground with which we are involved. We reflect on their potential role in enabling the power shifts necessary to rebalance energy economies and disrupt incumbent actors as a prerequisite to the achievement of climate justice</jats:p>"

The quantity of per capita water supply and hours of supply per day varies substantially across the city. Some central parts of the city benefit from a large availability of water as compared to peripheral areas. This research employed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and the new version of GWR termed Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) models to better understand the factors behind observed spatial patterns of water supply distribution and to predict water supply in newly merged and proposed villages in the Pune city's periphery. Results showed statistical significance of slope; distance from service reservoirs; and water supply hour. MGWR and GWR models improved our results (adjusted R2: 0.916 and 0.710 respectively) significantly over those of the OLS model (adjusted R2: 0.252) and proved how local conditions influence variables. The maps of GWR display how a particular variable is highly important in some areas but less important in other parts of the city. The results from the current study can help decision-makers to make appropriate decisions for future planning to achieve Sustainable Development Goal number 6 (SDG #6), which focuses on achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.</jats:p>",

The pharmaceutical supply chain is subject to many pressures including non-availability and shortage of requisite drugs. A drug shortage is a deficiency in the supply of medicines or products that affects the ability of a patient to get the required treatment in due time. The roots of drug shortages are multifaceted, varied, and the issue can be due to supply or demand. However, the situation affects almost every stakeholder in the healthcare system, which is why collaboration is a must to deal with drug shortages. Hence, adopting an exploratory and single-case approach of the largest public hospital in the context of Namibia, the objective of this chapter is to provide a contemporary perspective of supply chain management re drug sourcing shortages, analyze the causes of drug shortages, recommend measures to minimize the crisis, and suggest strategies for enhanced efficiency in drug supply. </jats:p>",

A two-echelon supply chain with uncertain customer demand and delivery lead time operating with the periodic-review reorder cycle policy is studied. The parameters of smoothing inventory replenishment and forecasting methods are required. These parameters are optimized in terms of minimizing the Total Stage Variance Ratios (TSVRs) of both echelons. The results show that even though all factors of interest have an impact on the bullwhip effect, using smoothing proportional controllers can reduce TSVRs (the sum of the order varaince ratio and net stock amplification). The meta-prediction models can effectively help predict the amount of the bullwhip effect of a chain under various situations with an average MAPE of less than 11%. The results can assist decision makers in the management of a supply chain to realize, benchmark with the optimal results, and reduce the TSVRs under an uncertain environment.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article is devoted to the research the problems that arise in pharmaceutical vaccine supply chains. Slow vaccination leads to global economic losses, and the lack of free access to vaccines in many developing countries is a problem not so much in the economic category as in the cost of human life category, which is confirmed by the research of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United Nations (UN). Pharmaceutical vaccine supply chains are subject to special organization and flow management requirements to avoid waste. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, bottlenecks inevitably arise that lead to economic, social, human losses, potential and real losses of vaccines and an increasing pressure on reverse logistics. The main bottlenecks at each stage of the supply chain have been identified, which indicate a shift in the main problems in the pharmaceutical supply chain to the distribution and last mile logistics. A detailed analysis of the vaccine distribution system in the city of Kiev was carried out with the help of sites that cover information on used vaccines and losses based on the types of vaccination points of different forms of ownership. Vaccination sites were ranked according to the degree of effective use of vaccines. As a result, the problems of insufficient information support of the vaccination campaign by government agencies were identified, which leads to the loss of vaccines. The role of the state in solving these problems was assumed by public organizations. To accomplish these tasks, an interactive vaccination map was launched, which makes it possible to find the nearest vaccination point, see how many vaccinations were given in a particular medical institution and how many vaccine doses were potentially lost. For the study, empirical research, data analysis and synthesis, expert assessments and generalization methods were used. Calculated the amount of real and potential monetary losses from vaccines that have been disposed of. Recommendations on the use of innovative tools such as Blockchain to prevent potential and manage existing problems in pharmaceutical vaccine supply chains were provided.</jats:p>"

However, there is a dearth of studies in lower-middle-income countries indicating the unique challenges industries face whilst practising circular economy principles and how the challenges can be overcome. To address the calls of previous researchers, this study aims to explore the following relationships: engagement and alliance capability whilst data analytics capability plays a mediating role; the relationship between alliance and data analytics capability with sustainable supply chain flexibility whilst industry dynamism is considered as a moderating variable and the relationship between sustainable supply chain flexibility and circular economy-target performance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n<jats:p>A cross-sectional survey was performed and data was collected from 760 employees of Indian firms.

Thus, this study proposes a dynamic model to optimize water supply system under different scenarios aimed at improving sustainability of system. In fact, due to the negative impacts of the water crisis, the sustainability of the dynamic water supply system is evaluated and optimized according to the performance indicators of the system. Also, to investigate the proposed model, a real case study of the Sistan basin in Iran over ten years period is conducted. Based on the model, different management insights along with the scenario analysis are considered in order to assess the sustainability of system in more detail. According to the final output, the highest level of sustainability is related to the domestic sector because it has higher reliability and less vulnerability than other sectors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Animals of all types, be these domestic or wild, native or exotic, were routinely required for spectacles and events in the Graeco-Roman world, most notably, perhaps, in the context of the amphitheatre games of Roman antiquity. Behind such events, however, lay networks involved in the capture, transport, and supply of these animals. The integration of ancient textual, iconographical, and archaeological (including zooarchaeological) evidence provides the requisite data to investigate these aspects. Available ancient textual and artistic evidence suggest that soldiers and professional hunters, assisted by civilians and natives as required or demanded, undertook many of these tasks. Guilds or professional organizations of wild beast hunters and merchants provided further administrative, technical, financial, and transport assistance. Equipment involved in capturing the animals varied depending upon factors such as the size, age, or ferocity of the animal, but included a range of nets, cages, and traps, among other methods. Extrapolation from more modern practices, however, suggests that baiting and ambushing, arguably somewhat less noble or brave tactics, likely characterized much of exotic animal capture in antiquity. Treatment for many of these animals, in transit to their final destination, was probably poor; large numbers certainly perished during transport or while in captivity. Available zooarchaeological evidence helps locate exotic animal bones across different contexts in the ancient Graeco-Roman world, including beasts presumably involved in amphitheatre games, but also provides tempering evidence to downplay the magnitude of numbers actually supplied to such events, as is attested in ancient textual and iconographical data.</jats:p>"

Most men are found to use pornography, especially young men, while few women do. The multibillion-dollar pornography industry’s considerable and expanding size is noted. Empirical findings showing consumers’ desensitization and increased demand for more aggressive, subordinating, and degrading content are discussed, as is the producers’ adaptation to this popular market. Evidence of exploitation and abuse during production is considered in light of documented links and similarities between populations used in pornography and populations generally used in prostitution. Multiple disadvantages such as poverty, childhood sexual abuse and neglect, racial disparities, and lack of alternatives in these groups are assessed. Mental health sequelae (e.g., PTSD) due to abuse in pornography production is considered. Similar (but more limited) findings on gay male pornography and male performers are discussed. Contending views in the literature are addressed.</jats:p>",

The supplier invests in corporate social responsibility (CSR) events and displays supply uncertainty. The supplier decides whether to leak information (L) or not (N). Additionally, the supplier has two financing strategies: bank credit financing (B) and trade credit financing (T). Thus, by combining the supplier’s information leakage and financing decisions, we formulated four possible strategies (i.e., NB, NT, LB, LT) and built a game analysis model to address the interaction of information leakage and financing decisions. We first provide the SC members’ optimal operational decisions (including the order quantity, the wholesale price and CSR effort level) under four strategies. Subsequently, we compare the profits of the suppliers and retailers under four strategies by combining analytical and numerical analysis. Several interesting results were found: (1) the supplier’s optimal wholesale price, CSR effort level, and profit under information leakage were higher than those under no information leakage; (2) the supplier’s financing decisions are dependent on the loan interest rate as low supply uncertainty and low supply correlation motivate the supplier to prefer choosing trade credit financing; and (3) finally, several interesting insights in managing SCs are provided.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>In the Big Data environment, when green manufacturers invest in the green production technology, to satisfy consumer demand timely and accurately, they may begin to gain consumer performance information (hereafter, CBDI) to design and produce product. However, these will go up their extra costs. Meanwhile, for a green manufacturer who sells the green product through the online channel and the offline channel, the expression of its market demand needs to rethink in the new environment. In these conditions, for a dual-channel green supply chain (hereafter, DGSC), chain members pay more attention on the pricing problems considering the inputs of CBDI and greening R&amp;D. Hence, to resolve this question, a DGSC a green manufacturer selling by the online channel and with one retailer selling by the offline channel was chosen. Afterwards, the demand function of the DGSC was revised, and we analyzed the profits models and its pricing rules in the proposed four common cost-sharing models. Results indicate that whether the retailer bears the CBDI costs or the greening R&amp;D costs, the retailer will not change its retail price. If the retailer can bear some CBDI costs, the alteration tendencies of the best wholesale price are related to the cost-sharing parameter.</jats:p>"

Its assessment requires an understanding of its quantitative factors to provide indicators that are easy to interpret. Effective reconfigurability assessment can be achieved by measuring quantitatively its six characteristics (modularity, integrability, convertibility, diagnosability, scalability and customization). This paper aims at identifying the quantitative factors of each characteristic and their inter-relationships by using Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM). The structural model obtained by TISM is applied to understand the dependency quantitative factors. Based on TISM results, a classification of quantitative factors is determined using « Matrice d'Impacts Croisés, Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement » (MICMAC) analysis. This paper may be helpful to understand the previously mentioned characteristics of reconfigurable supply chain in order to facilitate the measuring and the assessment of reconfigurability.</jats:p>"

We used 2019 data and the CMS methodology to calculate race-stratified donation data among racial/ethnic minorities across the 57 OPOs. We found that the variability in donation rates across the 57 OPOs are greater among minority populations than non-Hispanic white potential donors. Among Tier 3 OPOs, there are: a) some with low donation rates across all racial/ethnic groups; b) some with low donation rates among only certain groups, and c) some where donation rates are lowest among non-Hispanic white patients. Among low-performing OPOs, these race/ethnicity-stratified data show that under-performance in certain areas is not due to the population demographics, and identifies areas for targeted interventions to increase donation and avoid decertification</jats:p>"

The empirical results of the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) unit root test at 5 percent critical levels indicates that all the variables (M2 and MCAP) were not stationary at levels. However, all the variables became stationary after first differencing. Hence, the variables are of the same order of integration I (1). A cointegration test tells us that there exists a long run relationship between or among the variables and that they will not wander far apart away even though on the short run they exhibit random walk behavior. The Vector Error Correction test shows that Money supply (M2) has a significant relationship with market capitalization of the Nigerian stock exchange. The value of the Adjusted R-Squared of 0.726710 implies that Money supply (M2) explained about 72.67% systematic variations in the dependent variable (MCAP) over the observed years while the remaining 27.33% variations are explained by other determining variables outside the model. In order to further establish the relationship between money supply and stock market price, a granger causality test was carried out and it was established that there is a bi-directional causality between money supply and stock prices. The researcher therefore recommends that there should be collaboration among agencies of government in charge of money supply and stock exchange in order to make sure that sound policies are made to achieve the objective of government. Furthermore, that there should be a deliberate and concerted policy and effort to improve the Nigerian stock exchange market in line with other stock exchanges of the world, since stock prices cause money supply and vice versa.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted to determine the production and disruptions and prawn and crab basis for supply chain management strategies of the growers. The study employed a descriptive research design using quantitative data. The study used secondary data for performance and disaster history. A content analysis was used in processing the data. The researchers validated the findings and results of the study, and a random interview was conducted. Findings revealed that disruptions affect the production of prawn and crab, growers have their fishing technique and management practices, supply chain management strategies were not prioritized for value-adding and technology accessibility. A supply chain management strategy may be employed to operate and produce prawns and crabs in the Province of Capiz to achieve profitability and sustainability. It should be noted that the data is from 2011 to 2017. The data coverage is the Province of Capiz and focuses on the volume and value of prawns and crab (tiger prawn, endeavor prawn, and mud crab).</jats:p>",

In the context of supply chain optimization, scheduling has always been a challenging task for experts, especially when considering a distributed manufacturing system (DMS). The present study aims to tackle the supply chain scheduling problem in a DMS while considering two essential sustainability aspects, namely environmental and economic. The economic aspect is addressed by optimizing the total delivery time of order, transportation cost, and production cost while optimizing environmental pollution and the quality of products contribute to the environmental aspect. To cope with the problem, it is mathematically formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. Due to the complexity of the problem, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) named GA-TOPKOR is proposed. The algorithm is a combination of GA and TOPKOR, which is one of the multi-criteria decision-making techniques. To assess the efficiency of GA-TOPKOR, it is applied to a real-life case study and a set of test problems. The solutions obtained by the algorithm are compared against the traditional GA and the optimum solutions obtained from the MILP model. The results of comparisons collectively show the efficiency of the GA-TOPKOR. Analysis of results also revealed that using the TOPKOR technique in the selection operator of GA significantly improves its performance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a widely recognized tool used to evaluate environmental impacts of a product or process, based on the environmental inventory database and bills of material. Data quality is one of the most significant factors affecting the analysis results. However, currently most datasets in inventory databases are generic i.e., they may represent material and energy flow of a process at market average, instead of a specific process used by a manufacturer. As a result, stockholders are unable to track their supply chain to find out the actual environmental impact from each supplier and to compare the environmental performance of alternative options. In this paper, we developed a new framework i.e., blockchain based LCA (BC-LCA), where block-chain technology is adapted to secure and transmit inventory data from upstream suppliers to downstream manufacturers. With BC-LCA, more specific data can be acquired along the supply chain in a real-time manner. Moreover, the availability, accuracy, privacy, and automatic update of inventory data can be improved. A case study is provided based on an industrial supply chain, to demonstrate the utilization of BC-LCA.</jats:p>"

The results show that as the number of subsidies increased, the optimal amount of water supply and the profits increased, but the price of water work decreased. When the amount of subsidy stays same, the price of water plant also stays same. However, the price of the water transfer company is constantly changing, the higher the proportion of subsidies it received, the lower the price. In terms of data, the authors take a practical example – the Tao River Water Diversion Project to analyze. This paper’s limitation is that the conclusion is based on a single water transfer company and a single water plant as the research object. However, the actual situation of the water transfer project is that a water transfer company faces a complex supply chain network formed by many water plants and farmers’ water users’ associations.</jats:p>",

Contracts are agreements between two or more parties that define the duties and obligations for execution of any kind of activities. In this research, we are trying to automate the supply chain related contracts by identifying the important entities such as contract type, start date, end date etc., by using Natural Language Processing methods, then convert the contract to smart contract.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A reliable non-contact pneumatic pressure regulator of a pressure hydrocyclone is offered. The regulator is installed in the area of ​​the sand nozzle. The pneumatic regulator of the standard pressure cylindrical-conical hydrocyclone provides non-contact thickening of the product in the area of ​​the sand nozzle. In the process of controlling the operation of the hydrocyclone along its axis, an air column is formed. Features of the regulator affect the formation of the air column of the hydrocyclone. The pressure in the air column is manometric.\r\nThe task is to investigate the effect of pulp pressure at the inlet of the hydrocyclone, pulp thickening and air column pressure. Experimental studies were performed in the laboratory on a model of a standard industrial cylindrical-conical hydrocyclone HC360. The connection between the technological parameters of the hydrocyclone operation and the pressure in the air column has been studied. to establish possibilities of control of work of a hydrocyclone on pressure in an air column. The planning of the experiment in the laboratory on a hydrocyclone model was performed in the program Statgraphics Centurion XV.\r\nExperimental studies were performed for the optimal parameters of the angle and slit of the pneumatic regulator. The optimization criterion is chosen – the maximum effect of pulp thickening while minimizing local energy losses in the nozzle. In laboratory conditions, the change in pulp pressure and density at the inlet of the hydrocyclone over the entire operating range is simulated. The laboratory model of the hydrocyclone was made on a scale of M1:10. Flotation waste was used as pulp. Modeling of hydrocyclone operation as a part of water-sludge system at the concentrator is carried out. The density of the solid phase is 1500 kg/m3.\r\nThe solids content at the inlet is 10 g/l. Samples were taken by volumetric measurement with a measuring vessel. A statistically significant relationship between the pressure in the air column of the hydrocyclone and the effect of pulp thickening in a standard cylindrical-conical hydrocyclone was established. The presence of the linear character of the dependence of the coefficient of thickening and pressure in the air column of the hydrocyclone with the pneumatic regulator is checked. The absence of a statistically significant effect of hydrocyclone supply pressure on the dependence of other selected factors was established.\r\nExperimental studies were carried out at the optimal design parameters of the pneumatic regulator according to the criteria of minimizing the loss of energy of air current in the nozzle and minimizing the volumetric flow of air.</jats:p>"

This study considers a two-level supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a capital-constrained retailer with trade credit, in which the retailer exchanges unsold products for needed subsidiary products on a barter platform. The retailer’s optimal order quantity and the manufacturer’s wholesale price are derived, and the influences of barter and other factors on the equilibrium strategy and performance of the supply chain are examined; these results are verified and supplemented by numerical simulation. We find that the retailer can increase profit by bartering when facing highly uncertain demand, that the retailer’s optimal order quantity increases with the supply rate and demand for subsidiary products, and that both manufacturer and retailer benefit from the high supply rate of subsidiary products. However, barter induces the manufacturer to raise the wholesale price to prevent its profit from being harmed. In addition, the manufacturer suffers from the retailer’s initial capital.</jats:p>"

Thus, the balancing of planning, production and inventory figures of products is important in a business activity. The model of optimizing procurement and production sizes is integrated into a model that provides optimal results for all parties involved in the supply chain. This research proposes the development of a supply chain model of one manufacturer and 3 distributor components with the aim of minimizing total inventory costs (TIC) and determining the length of time of one production cycle so that producers can meet each distributor's needs and achieve the best coordination between producers and distributors so as to allow for no delays in delivery and the total amount of optimal inventory costs to each distributor. A simple algorithm is used to determine the optimal cycle time and total cost of supply to each distributor. A simple algorithm is used to determine the optimal cycle time and total cost of supply to each distributor. At the end of this study came a numerical example of the use of models that have been built based on case study data of a fertilizer industry as a producer and 3 components of distributors, namely subsidies, in-house and commercial. The results of numerical examples that have been done show that the optimal distributor is subsidized with optimal production of 274,773 units for 4 working days to run one production cycle. The optimal distributor selection is determined by the lowest TIC value of the three trials that have been conducted, namely obtained the value of TIC n = 1 of $ 1,905,651.</jats:p>"

Due to its large size and involvement of various components, it is one of the most expensive civil infrastructures and thus demands optimization. Much work has been done to reduce the distribution system cost. However, with only one objective, the obtained solutions may not be practical to implement. Thus, improving cost along with the efficiency of the network is the demand of the hour. The present work introduces a unique parameter-less methodology for generating Pareto fronts without involving the concept of non-dominance. The methodology incorporates the Jaya optimization model for a bi-objective problem, one being the reduction in network cost and the other improving the reliability index of the network. The efficiency of the proposed work is analyzed for three different benchmark problems. The Jaya technique is found to be very efficient and fast when compared with the other evolutionary technique applied for the same networks. The parameter-less nature of the Jaya technique smooths the process to a very large extent as no synchronization of algorithm parameters is required.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this monograph we aim to analyse the eﬀects of leaving excess reserves in the banking sector by the central bank on the level and the variability of interest rates, as well as on money supply. To this end, we use mainly data for Poland, but in some cases, for robustness, also for a panel of Poland, the euro area, the Czech Republic and Hungary, as there had only been a limited variability in some policy variables in our sample for Poland. We estimate the parameters of GARCH, (P)VAR (vector autoregressive or panel vector autoregressive) and (panel) linear regression models. We ﬁnd that excess reserves aﬀect the level and the variability of an overnight money market interest rate. However, the variability of the overnight money market interest rate, shaped to a large extent by excess reserves, does not aﬀect the level of longer-term interest rates, and we ﬁnd little evidence of its impact on their variability. Neither do excess reserves translate into higher money supply. Our results imply that the current monetary policy operational framework in Poland is adequate to ensure the transmission of the central bank policy rate to money market interest rates. Furthermore, it appears unlikely that raising the amount of excess reserves left, as proposed by some policymakers, would aﬀect money supply. Instead, it would lower the money multiplier and the overnight money market interest rate, as well as increase its volatility.</jats:p>",

Use of these spillways has increased in recent decades, they can reduce construction time and they are effective for reducing the flow's downstream kinetic energy. In this study, the width and height of the steps as well as the slope and height of the overflow spillway were considered as variables. Due to the large number of variables, non-linearity of the objective function and constraints, and the lack of an explicit relationship between decision variables, a genetic algorithm (GA) was used. A stepped spillway with optimal dimensions was proposed as a replacement of the smooth spillway of Sarogh Dam located in West Azerbaijan province, Iran. The proposed steps increase energy dissipation; for constant discharge and varying slopes, the changes in the optimal height of the steps were insignificant. Sensitivity analysis using the objective function showed that the relative energy dissipation for a constant discharge is independent of the optimal height of the steps and decreases with increasing spillway slope. In addition, for fixed slopes, increasing the flow rate leads to a decrease in relative energy dissipation and an increase in the optimal height of the steps.</jats:p>",

Factors such as climate change, depletion of natural resources, environmental pollution and increase in carbon footprint as well as violation of human rights which have characterized the activities of these organisations over decades have led to a growing call by key stakeholders on manufacturing companies to have a paradigm shift in their approach to manufacturing in ways that meet environmental, economic, and social needs. It appears that an integration of manufacturing activities among channel members within the supply chain is a good approach in reducing the harmful effects of their operations, create value and wealth out of such activities and improve upon their operational performance. This paper is purposed to extend and strengthen theory building on sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) concept and supply chain integration to foster improved operational performance based on resource dependence theory.</jats:p>"

Community, state and national interventions had little impact. This study looks at citizen initiatives to attain domestic energy security in Ado-Ekiti Nigeria- a medium sized state capital (Ekiti state). The study adopted a mixed method that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches. The study specifically investigated the socio-economic characteristics of the residents (age, family size, educational status and monthly income), sources of modern domestic electric power supply, including cleaner electric energy strategies. It is an empirical research that used simple random sampling to select 1029 cases from a frame of 30,195, who supplied information through the questionnaire instrument. The research methods include comparative analysis, indepth fieldwork, observation, interviews, collation and information derived from research institutes. Research findings showed a variety of sources utilized by residents to meet their energy needs. Among the rich, the use of solar panels to argument public power supply was common. The middle class combined generators with public supply. The poor were content to use candles and kerosene lamps when public supply failed. Energy reform, directed at nationalisation, adequate funding of the grid and decentralization, innovation in energy technology, such as solar power were recommended to improve the energy sector of the state and lessen hardship for the citizens.</jats:p>",

Lean typically deals with superior quality, lowest cost and quicker lead time. Lean Supply chain technology in the traffic control system has supplied intelligent green interval responses to control the incapability of standard fixed traffic controllers. The researchers have implemented the technology of lean supply chain to boost up the performance of traffic light and control the traffic jam. The limitations of traditional passing vehicles have been solved by the set of rules. The two set of guidance have been monitored the traffic light system by dynamic system; the vehicle, upstream and downstream lane follows red light and the number of vehicles have passed through a green light. These kinds of vehicles have dynamically controlled the timing of red and green. The dynamic traffic controller and a fixed time controller have shown the differences in performance through the Lean supply chain theory. The researchers have compared and stimulate the data of the performance of their algorithm with the undeveloped one. The results have shown that the algorithm has much better than undeveloped one, because it increases the traffic efficiency and decreases the waiting time by 45 minutes.</jats:p>"

This paper relied mostly on data from secondary sources through literatures, publication and other prints materials. This paper established that the resources deployed to the transportation sector through the yearly budgetary allocation are grossly inadequate.

The purpose of the research is to substantiate the necessity of ecological upgrading of thermal power facilities in the Irkutsk region and using a part of municipal solid waste as an alternative fuel at thermal power facilities of the Russian Federation. The research shows that the use of the two kinds of fuel (solid biofuel and alternative fuel) can reduce the anthropogenic load. This measure can be a way of energy efficient disposal of accumulated and annually generated production and consumer waste. The transition to alternative fuels can be most efficiently implemented in boiler houses. This is due to lower capital investments in the modernization of boiler houses as compared to the modernization of thermal power plants. The calculations in the article confirm that the implementation of environmental modernization of regional heat supply systems is not economically beneficial for entrepreneurs. The state should supplement the methods of regulation with targeted co-financing of programs for the modernization of thermal power facilities in order to accelerate the processes of modernization of heat supply in the Russian Federation. At the same time, the recipients of support must comply with the established indicators further on.</jats:p>",

This paper offers the first empirical exploration of the first full year of the pandemic and provides data points from both early and one year into the pandemic. Results: Our findings indicate that not only are pandemic risks far from mitigated, several types of risks have also increased in severity. Multifaceted and multidirectional approaches have been adopted, going well beyond demand and supply risks (the risks most widely considered in the literature) and much more work remains for supply chain managers to mitigate risks and improve supply chain resilience. Conclusions: We find that in addition to the risk management techniques, considering behavioral aspects is key for navigating a pathway towards risk mitigation.</jats:p>"

The work-effort ratio is found to be higher in a Leviathan state, but the comparison between the two other tax-use regimes is uncertain. The response of the effort ratio to a change in the wage ratio follows the same pattern, while this response is weakened by a change in the current tax rate and strengthened by a change in the future tax rate, regardless not only of the use of tax revenue, but also of its change over time. In the case of change, the comparison of effort ratios is clear only when the change prompts them to move in the same direction.

In this paper, we present the results from a thorough bibliometric review that analytically and objectively identifies the intellectual structure of this field, the seminal papers, and the most influential scholars. We employ a knowledge domain visualization technique to generate insights that go beyond other review studies on blockchain research within logistics and SCM. The analysis starts with selecting a total of 628 papers from Scopus and the Web of Science that were published during 2016–2020. The bibliometric analysis output demonstrates that the number of blockchain papers has rapidly increased since 2017. The most productive researchers are from the USA, China, and India. The top academic institutions contributing to the literature are also identified. Based on network analyses, we found that the literature concentrates mainly on the conceptualization of blockchain; its potentials for supply chain sustainability; its adoption triggers and barriers; and its role in supporting supply chain agility, trust, protection of intellectual property, and food/perishable supply chains. Besides systematically mapping the literature, we identify several research gaps and propose numerous actionable research directions for the future. This study enriches the extant blockchain literature, provides a timely snapshot of the current state of research, and examines the knowledge structure of blockchain research in logistics and SCM with the help of evidence-based scientometric methods.</jats:p>"

This study designed a model of the baseflow index (BFI) and the baseflow rate (Qb) in one of the watersheds in Turkey. The smoothed minima method designed by the United Kingdom Institute of Hydrology (UKIH) was used to calculate the BFI and Qb at 10 flow observation stations in the Çoruh watershed. The Çoruh Watershed Baseflow Model was designed using BFI and Qb values with watershed characteristics and other variables. The determination coefficient of the BFI model was calculated as R² = 0.842, and the Qb model determination coefficient was calculated as R² = 0.99. The usability of the Çoruh model was proven by using the UKIH's smoothed minima method and comparing its relative errors with the BFI and Qb in the Çoruh model.</jats:p>",

In such an environment, pollution has become more severe in recent decades, and with the weakening of the environment and global warming, green SC management (GSCM) strategies have become more attention in recent decades. In this research, we consider the integrated production and distribution (PD) planning problem of a multi-level green closed-loop SC (GCLSC) system, which includes multiple recycling, manufacturing/ remanufacturing, and distribution centers. We present a three-level bi-objective programming model to maximize profit and minimize the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. A hierarchical iterative approach utilizing the LP-metric method and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is introduced to solve the proposed model. Also, the Taguchi approach is applied to find optimum control parameters of NSGA-II. Moreover, Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is applied to tackle uncertainty in demand, and the NSGA-II algorithm is fusioned with MC simulation (MCNSGA-II). The results obtained show that the simulation-optimization approach presented better results than the deterministic approach.</jats:p>"

Insights are offered regarding traditional manufacturing lines where some enabling technologies have been included. The manufacturing supply chain is envisaged as enhancing the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 through their integration. A systematic literature review is undertaken to evaluate each enabling technology and the manufacturing supply chain and to provide some theoretical synthesis. Similarly, obstacles are listed that must be overcome before a complete shift to smart manufacturing is possible. A brief discussion maps out how the fourth industrial revolution has led to novel manufacturing technologies. Likewise, a review of the fifth industrial revolution is given, and the justification for this development is presented.</jats:p>"

Confirmatory factor analysis is used to develop measures for the non-financial factors (i.e. trust, contracts, opportunistic behavior, information sharing and information quality) and Structural Equation Modelling is employed to test study hypotheses. The result shows that trust is positively associated with farm’s performance. On the other hand, communication (i.e. resulting from the merge of information sharing and information quality) is negatively associated with performance. However, communication appears to have a positive association with farm’s performance indirectly through its effect on trust. Thus, it can be deducted that communication builds trust and trading relationship based on trust show higher levels of farm’s performance. Lastly, contracts and opportunistic behavior do not show any significant association with farm’s performance.</jats:p>"

The UDDI cloud level allows web services, which represent providers' business functionalities, to be classified, discovered, selected, and invoked by agents that are applied to the supply chain construction. The agent level contains an agent society that manages the different steps of cooperation and negotiation between the different business entities in a supply chain, as business-to-business and business-to-customer transactions.

The topic has both practical and scholarly implications. We start with an observation: the variability of orders placed to suppliers is larger than the variability of sales to customers for most firms, yet the aggregate demand variability felt by suppliers upstream does not amplify commensurably. We hypothesize that changes to the supplier’s customer base can smooth out its aggregate demand. We test the hypothesis with a data set that tracks the evolution of supply relationships over time. We show that the effect of customer base management extends beyond the statistical benefits of aggregation. In particular, both the formation and the dissolution of customer-supplier relationships are associated with the smoothing of the aggregate demand experienced by suppliers. This provides fresh insight into how firms may leverage their customer-supplier relationships to mitigate the impact of the BWE. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Jay Swaminathan, operations management. </jats:p>",

Weak chlorine resistance is a distinctive challenge for composite polyamide thin-film reverse osmosis membranes. A commercial aromatic membrane was modified by grafting nitrogen-doped graphene oxide quantum dots (N-GOQDs) to enhance chlorine resistance, embedding two-dimensional MXene Ti3C2Tx, introducing synthetically reductive thioether units and oxidized graphitic carbon nitride (OGCN). In this work, salt rejection, chlorine resistance, and water flux increased compared to the pristine membrane. Comprehensive arrangement of desalination performance and chlorine resistance was achieved by varying time and concentrations of prepared chemicals. For instance, improved chlorine resistance, after 12 hours of grafting time by N-GOQDs doped membrane, was 32.8%, after 6 hours of exposure time by MXene Ti3C2Tx membrane was 27.4%, after 1 hour of exposure time by thioether membrane was 28.1% and after 40 hours of doping time by OGCN membrane was 31.3%. N-GOQDs doped membrane showed a good chlorine resistant property, but on the other hand, thioether nano units showed other properties more effectively, including water flux, salt rejection, and less reaction time.</jats:p>",

This research used a descriptive approach with SCM analysis. Based on the research results, the company's suppliers consist of suppliers of main and supporting raw materials. Purchases of raw materials are made by pre-order with a credit payment system. Incoming raw materials will be checked with order data. If the item does not match the order, it will be returned to the supplier for replacement. Meanwhile, the appropriate goods will be placed in the warehouse and then the production process is carried out. The production process is carried out in two stages, namely the first stage to produce low TDS &amp; nearly neutral PH and the second stage to produce Aqua Demineralization. The production results are then checked for conformity with the predetermined standards. Products that pass will be distributed to consumers using a car provided by the company. Orders that do not fit or are defective, then consumers can return to the company to be replaced with new goods.</jats:p>"

Some of the available methods for SI measurement are multi-criteria analysis, external costs, energy analysis, and ecological footprint methods. However, validity remains a concern due to a system's needs, criteria, and requirements. Generally, sustainability is assessed in economic, environmental, and social issues, which varies across regions and countries. Most of the studies accept sub-indices but to a limited extent. Therefore, the proposed study develops an SI evaluation method based on the idea of multi-sustainability incorporating operations, institutions, risks, and climate factors besides economic, environmental, and social issues. All these issues might not be applicable to a single project but may help to develop a complete index when applied. The present study considered different scenarios in building a method to calculate SI using ANN. The results obtained by the ANN model for various input parameters helped to identify the best water conservation strategy. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the uncertainty contribution/significance of the input variables for the water scarcity in the study region. The developed model in the study is tested on a rural water management system.</jats:p>",

However, the volume of the air vessel must be extra-large to guarantee security of the system, especially in a system with a high head and large flow. In this paper, to reduce the volume of the air vessel, a novel protective method combining an air vessel and over pressure relief valve was proposed and verified using a numerical simulation based on a practical project. In addition, the protection performance under the combined protective method was compared with the traditional method. The results show that the combined protective method can significantly reduce the volume of air vessel and exhibit a better protection performance. Furthermore, after analysis and optimization of the rule of opening and closing over the pressure relief valve, the valve should be opened in a short time to produce fast discharge so as to eliminate the large pressure rise rapidly. The duration of opening the over pressure relief valve has little effect on the maximum pressure. The closing time of the over pressure valve should be slow, as much as possible, to avoid producing large pressure wave.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: The use of blockchain technology for tracking and tracing (T&amp;T) in supply chains is the subject of lively debate in scientific literature. However, distributed ledger technology (DLT) does not have to have the characteristic blockchain structure and often performs better without such a structure. Generalized DLT for T&amp;T in supply chains has rarely been discussed in the existing literature. Methods: This article presents an exploratory case study research of eight companies to identify the main goals, and problems that the companies have when they engage in T&amp;T. This practical perspective is complemented by a theoretical systems thinking perspective. Based on these two foundations, we discuss the usefulness of blockchain technology and, more generally, DLT for T&amp;T in supply chains. Results: Based on our analysis, DLT is only necessary in special cases, e.g., when the owners of the data have an interest in deleting the data, but the data stakeholders do not. In the other cases examined, DLT competes with other technologies, such as conventional, centralized databases in combination with digital signatures. Furthermore, it became evident that DLT can only be useful for supply chain tracing. The technological features of DLT do not provide any benefit for supply chain tracking, i.e., the timely communication of the status of a physical good. Conclusions: Distributed ledgers often have a disadvantage in that they are very complex and, therefore, expensive. DLT should preferably only be used when it is technologically necessary or the simplest/cheapest choice, which is probably not all that often. Finally, the usefulness of distributed ledger technology and its integrated smart contract technology is highly dependent on how easy it is to link the real physical world to a digital record/contract in an error-free and tamper-proof way. Currently, such a definite link exists only in very few cases and is often impossible.</jats:p>"

In this study, we examine the effects of updating models in a supply chain using a minimal setting. We demonstrate that when each party in the supply chain has its own forecasting model, uncoordinated model retraining causes the bullwhip effect even if a very simple replenishment policy is applied. Our results also indicate that sharing the forecasting model among the parties involved significantly reduces the bullwhip effect.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, a circular flume was used with mean diameter of 1.6 m and a width of 0.2 m. The adsorbing bed was considered as a thin layer of the sediment particles with mean diameter of 0.53 mm and three sediment concentrations of 3, 12, and 20 gr/lit. To determine the sorption parameters of the sediments, some experiments were conducted with three cadmium concentrations of 150, 460, and 770 ppb. Then, the dispersion experiments were carried out with and without the bed sediments with the same cadmium concentration as the sorption experiments. A numerical model was then developed to solve the advection–dispersion equation with considering the sorption term by river bed sediments. The longitudinal dispersion coefficients were estimated by comparing the experimental and numerical breakthrough curves. The results showed that, with increasing the sediment concentrations, the sediment sorption rate increased and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient decreased by about 38, 36 and 33 percent, respectively, for cadmium concentrations of 150, 460 and 770 ppb. In addition, by increasing the cadmium concentrations, the changes in the longitudinal dispersion coefficient are decreased. Furthermore, a relationship was developed using non-dimensional longitudinal dispersion as a function of the new parameter of sorption ratio. From a practical point of view, the results of this study demonstrated that, at the presence of riverbed sediment, the cadmium is longitudinally dispersed with more delay in comparison with no sediment at the river bed.</jats:p>",

The modelling approach has been developed aiming at defining strategic rules of pumps activation thresholds. It considers the need for seasonal variations of activation and the different costs of energy in diverse time slots, according to the usual cost rules adopted by the authorities. Starting with the traditional scenario analysis approach, a new algorithm has been developed considering a multiple-steps scenario optimisation implemented using GAMS interfaced with CPLEX solvers. The results should allow the water authority to establish a robust strategy for pumping activation to guarantee the fulfilment of water demands and to ensure an energy-saving policy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Factoring is a financial arrangement where the supplier sells accounts receivable to the factor against a premium and receives cash for immediate working capital needs. Reverse factoring takes advantage of the retailer’s payment guarantee and the credit rating differential between a small supplier and a large retailer, enabling the supplier to receive financing at a more favorable rate. We develop a supply chain theory of (recourse/non-recourse) factoring and reverse factoring showing when these post-shipment financing schemes should be adopted and who really benefits from the adoption. We find that recourse factoring is preferred when the supplier’s credit rating is relatively high, whereas non-recourse factoring is preferred within certain medium range of ratings. Both factoring schemes, if adopted, benefit both the supplier and the retailer, and thus the overall supply chain. Further, we find that reverse factoring may not always be preferred by suppliers compared to recourse and non-recourse factorings. Retailers should only offer reverse factoring to suppliers with low (but above a threshold) to medium credit ratings. The optimally designed reverse factoring program can always increase the retailer’s profit, but it may leave the supplier indifferent to the current factoring option when followed by an aggressive payment extension. More importantly, contrary to conventional wisdom, our theory implies that reverse factoring could be adopted even when the retailer has no credit rating advantage over the supplier, and it could benefit the retailer even without extending payment terms. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz, operations management. </jats:p>",

The results from previous pilot-scale experiments performed showed that linen fabric was the most effective medium at retaining particles. In continuation of this research, the aim of this paper was to utilize Hydrus-1D simulation software to simulate cross-flow filtration with fabric filter medium. This was done to further confirm the efficiency of cross-flow filtration, in particular with linen fabric filter media. Simulation entailed investigating fabric water content versus pressure head; bottom pressure head versus time; fabric water storage versus time; and cumulative infiltration versus time with both single and four layers of fabric filter media. Hydrus-1D simulation was productive since it confirmed that cross-flow filtration with linen fabric filter media has the potential of becoming a pre-filtration step in surface water treatment, further adding to the results obtained from previous pilot-scale experiments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Immediately after birth, most newborns undergo a number of medical procedures to assess how the body functions. Some of these procedures are invasive and involve breaking the continuity of the baby's tissues, leading to pain and discomfort. Confirmation of pain sensation by newborns is relatively one of the newer scientific discoveries - this fact was not acceptable until the end of the 1980s. Therefore, analgesia was used very rarely during all medical procedures. Nowadays, medical personnel are aware that the youngest patients also feel pain and should be knowledgeable about its prevention and treatment. The aim of the study is to analyze the available studies on glucose supply as a way to reduce procedural pain in newborns. The non-systematic review of the literature was carried out according to the following keywords: pain, glucose, newborn, prevention, recommendations. Analyzes carried out in neonatal departments and a literature review have shown that pain prevention and treatment still pose many problems, as there are no clear guidelines as to how and methods to administer the therapy. Oral glucose is the most common pain reliever used in neonates during medical interventions. Its mechanism of action remains unclear, but it is believed to have a calming effect and reduce behavioral indicators of pain. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the administration of three doses of sucrose appropriate to the gestational age of the newborn, but there is concern about the long-term use of this preventive measure, especially in premature babies, who are at greater risk of hyperglycemia and disturbances in the development of the nervous system.\n\n</jats:p>",

An online survey (n= 423) focus on trust and concern over food safety was conducted. The survey was addressed to very concerned and active consumers, which are interesting because they represent a powerful consumers’ profile from the policies point of view. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) studied consumers’ preferences on the different SFSC categories. This paper draws a map that signals which of SFSC attributes (such as labelling, common values or direct contact with producers) are more relevant in order to build consumers’ trust. In addition, this paper offers a classification of SFSC consumers according to their priorities. The information provided by the article offers ideas to policy makers and producers for designing their marketing strategies according to different consumers’ demands.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is to compare and analyze the dynamic effects of different subsidy policies to the manufacturer in a green supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer. Three differential game models, considering the consumers preference, are established under three subsidy policies, and the corresponding optimal equilibrium strategies of the supply chain members are analyzed. An example is used to compare the effects of the three policies under the equal government subsidy expenditure. The study finds that the rankings of indexes to evaluate steady-state subsidy effects under the different subsidy policies are time invariant, and the government can preliminarily evaluate these policies according to different subsidy goals. The rankings of indexes to evaluate phased subsidy effects under these policies are time varying. If both subsidy effects and subsidy efficiencies in steady state are taken into account, the optimal selection paths of subsidy policies in the whole period can be obtained. The subsidy effects of the same policy are amplified under the condition of equal steady-state subsidy expenditure, but the rankings of effect indexes under the different subsidy policies are not affected.</jats:p>"

The aim of the research is to establish patterns of change in the quality indicators of the country's water resources in the largest basin of the Dnipro River. The study was carried out on the basis of an assessment of indicators for monitoring changes in the quantitative and qualitative indicators of water resources in the Dnipro basin in 2016-2021.A decrease in the Dnipro runoff was recorded: the average long-term natural runoff at the mouth is 53.3 km3, and the actual runoff is about 11 km3 (20%) less than the natural runoff. A decrease in the quantitative indicators of water intake from the Dnipro basin in 7365 million m3, a decrease in the quantity (up to 547.1 million m3) and a deterioration in the quality of return water and the general state of water resources in the basin from the northwest to the southeast. The measurements’ results of the indicators of the waters’ qualitative state in the reservoirs and the main watercourses of the basin at the locations of the monitoring points indicate that the norms are exceeded by a multiplicity of more than 5 times, including in terms of BOD and COD, which reflect the intensity of pollution of water bodies with easily oxidizing and difficult oxidizing organic compounds. The screening of pollutants revealed the content of pesticides, drugs, antidepressants, heavy metals-carcinogens in the Dnipro water, which makes it possible to investigate the problems with water resources, taking into account the specifics of the river basin. Such an assessment shows that climate change and industrial enterprises, as notable anthropogenic component, are significant factors affecting water resources. This indicates the importance of the direction of the policy of state regulation on water monitoring, the introduction of an irrigation and drainage strategy, the construction of centralized water supply and sanitation systems and strict control over the indicators of wastewater discharge.</jats:p>"

It is necessary to control the oxygen excess ratio of fuel cell systems in the process of variable load, preventing the oxygen starvation in the loading process and excessive parasitic power consumption caused by oxygen saturation. At this time, the modeling of fuel cell systems and the development of control strategies are critical. The development of a control strategy depends on the construction of the control model. Aiming at the difficulty of air supply system modeling, this paper uses radial basis function (RBF) neural network and state equation method to establish the dynamic model of air supply systems. At the same time, PID, fuzzy logic plus PID (FL + PID), feedforward plus PID (FF + PID), fuzzy feedforward plus fuzzy PID (FF + FLPID) control strategy are proposed to control the oxygen excess ratio of the system. The simulation results show that fuzzy feedforward plus fuzzy PID (FF + FLPID) has the best effect and the oxygen excess ratio can be followed in 1 s.</jats:p>"

The admission of thousands of provincials into Rome’s governing elite is often taken as evidence for the successful integration of subject populations. This article challenges such views of the senate as an inclusive institution. It shows that the overwhelming majority of non-Italian senators came from merely four (out of more than thirty) provinces: Baetica (in southern Spain), Narbonensis (Provence), Africa (the coastlines of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya) and Asia (western Anatolia). The elites of these regions entertained close links to Italy since the second century bce. In the first centuries ce, they acquired enormous wealth through predation, through investments in capital-intensive agriculture and through their ability to exploit state supply networks for their own benefit. The steep rise in the number of provincial senators should thus not be read as evidence for the large-scale participation of conquered groups in the imperial administration. Rather, it chiefly was a product of the new opportunities for wealth accumulation and exploitation generated by Roman imperialism.</jats:p>",

The results were compared with those for an ordinary Jaya algorithm (JA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and an invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm. In Model-1, the minimum irrigation deficit obtained by SAMP-JA and JA was 305092.99 . SAMP-JA was better than JA, PSO and IWO in terms of convergence. In Model-2, the maximum hydropower generation achieved by SAMP-JA, JA and PSO was 1723.50 . When comparing the average hydropower generation, SAMP-JA and PSO performed better than JA and IWO. In terms of convergence, SAMP-JA was better than PSO. In Model-3, a self-adaptive multi-population multi-objective Jaya algorithm (SAMP-MOJA) was better than multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and multi-objective Jaya algorithm (MOJA) in terms of maximum hydropower generation, and MOPSO was better than SAMP-MOJA and MOJA in terms of minimum irrigation deficiency.

Smart solutions play an important role in monitoring system parameters and making on-site measurements. This paper focuses on Smart Water Grid, an ingenious way to monitor and preserve the quantity and quality parameters in real-time by deploying remote sensors in the water distribution system. It presents a review of various sensors deployed, networking protocols used and cloud platforms employed in monitoring the water distribution system. The suitable networking protocols for the water distribution systems are suggested by analyzing various smart solutions. It also proposes an architecture for an IoT-based system to monitor residual chlorine concentration in the water distribution system. Smart Water Grid using Wireless Sensor Networks and the Internet of Things enables the monitoring of on-site conditions and generates alerts during abnormal conditions.

However, as many companies recover from disruptions (COVID-19 being a recent example), less attention has been paid to how these events impact business-to-business (B2B) relationships characteristic of supply chains. Drawing on justice theory, we examine how the suppliers’ management of the recovery process affects behavioral reactions in the context of supply chain relationships. This study empirically examines the role that partners’ recovery process, honesty, effort, availability, and outcome fairness play in influencing satisfaction, future business volumes, and word-of-mouth. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to test survey data, results indicate that how recovery processes are managed positively affects satisfaction, reduces the likelihood of future business loss, and affects the propensity to communicate negatively about a relationship partner. Unexpectedly, outcome fairness (distributive justice) has a significant positive impact on negative word-of-mouth, indicating that increased perceptions of distributive justice actually increase negative behavioral outcomes in certain settings. We conduct exploratory post hoc serial mediation analysis to further examine this finding and uncover a potential extension to the boundaries of a justice lens. These post hoc results, which generally confirm the OLS results, drive opportunity for better understanding of complaining behavior and navigating the tricky environment associated with managing B2B relationships in a post- disruption environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increased awareness of environmental sustainability has led to increasing attention to closed loop supply chains (CLSC). The main objective of the CLSC is to capture values from end-of-life (EOL) products in a way that ensures a business to be economically and environmentally sustainable. The challenge is the complexity that occurrs due to closing the loop. At the same time, considering stochastic variables will increase the realism of the obtained results as well as the complexity of the model. This study aims to design a CLSC for durable products using a multistage stochastic model in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) while considering uncertainty in demand, return rate, and return quality. Demand was described by a normal distribution whereas return rate and return quality were represented by a set of discrete possible outcomes with a specific probability. The objective function was to maximize the profit in a multi-period and multi-echelon CLSC. The multistage stochastic model was tested on a real case study at an air-conditioning company. The computational results identified which facilities should be opened in the reversed loop to optimize profit. The results showed that the CLSC resulted in a reduction in purchasing costs by 52%, an annual savings of 831,150 USD, and extra annual revenue of 5459 USD from selling raw material at a material market. However, the transportation cost increased by an additional annual cost of 6457 USD, and the various recovery processes costs were annually about 152,897 USD. By running the model for nine years, the breakeven point will be after three years of establishing the CLSC and after the annual profit increases by 1.92%. In conclusion, the results of this research provide valuable analysis that may support decision-makers in supply chain planning regarding the feasibility of converting the forward chain to closed loop supply chain for durable products.</jats:p>"

Untuk mengatasinya perlu adanya inovasi-inovasi dalam bidang tenaga listrik. Yang bisa menopang penggunaan beban yang besar. Salah satu langkah mengatasi hal tersebut adalah dengan menggabungkan beberapa sumber tenaga listrik dengan alat sinkronisasi. Alat sinkronisasi merupakan alat yang dapat mendeteksi tegangan, frekuensi, sudut fasa dan urutan fasa. Dalam pembuatan alat penelitian ini, memerlukan kontaktor dengan coil 110 volt sebagai kontak tegangan, relay frekuensi untuk membaca nilai frekuensi dan sistem lampu terang redup sebagai urutan fasanya. Untuk penelitian ini, dilakukan metodologi penelitian dengan pengujian alat sinkronisasi di laboratorium dan dengan simulasi menggunakan software proteus 8 serta perhitungan data dari rumus yang ada. Hasil alat sinkronisasi dan analisa alat tersebut dapat bekerja dengan baik pada nilai tegangan 55 volt dari generator sinkron, dan tegangan 55 volt dari jaringan PLN. Generator sinkron ini diberi penguatan sebesar 31,3 Va.s dari power supply sanfix dengan arus yang mengalir sebesar 0,25 A. Penguatan arus pada generator sinkron sangatlah diperlukan dalam pembangkitan listrik dari generator. Pada nominal tegangan sinkronisasi sebesar 55 V hanya dapat menanggung beban diatas 1 H. Pada beban resistif nilai tegangan tidak berkurang karena memiliki faktor daya yang baik yaitu bernilai 1.

We utilize a combined empirical approach consisting of an event study in Step 1 and a simulation model in Step 2. The event study identifies the quantitative magnitude of central bank decisions and rating changes on the interest rate differential. The simulation computes with a rolling-window methodology the daily cost and benefits of reverse factoring from 2010 to 2018 under the assumption of the efficient market hypothesis. Our major finding is that changes of crucial financial variables such as interest rates, ratings, or news alerts will turn former win–win into win–lose situations for the supplier contingent to the business cycle. Overall, our results exhibit sophisticated trade-offs under reverse factoring and consequently require a careful evaluation in managerial decisions.</jats:p>"

Because different meteorological conditions will affect the use efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer, this method of fertilization will limit the yield of maize. Based on the DSSAT crop model, this paper simulated the optimized nitrogen fertilizer schedule of maize in Central Jilin Province of China from 1973 to 1992 on the basis of verified DSSAT model. It was found that the optimized nitrogen fertilizer schedule in different meteorological years had significant differences, and this optimized nitrogen fertilizer schedule changed with different meteorological years and could increase maize yield by 3.9% compared with the fixed optimized nitrogen fertilizer schedule. At the same time, there was a significant positive correlation between amount of nitrogen fertilizer and rainfall in the stages of sowing, VJ and VT. In these stages, the amount of nitrogen fertilizer should be increased with the increase in rainfall. Finally, an optimized agrometeorological prediction method was proposed to provide a theoretical basis for the real-time optimization schedule of maize nitrogen fertilizer in the future.</jats:p>",

By formulating platform interaction rules, the system information exchange format is standardized to ensure the stability and efficiency of system interaction. Smart contracts are used to manage supply chain system transactions and information interactions to achieve efficient and convenient information sharing, ensuring the security and reliability of supply chain information. The comprehensive performance of the system is evaluated through experiments.

This has led to the degradation of hyporheic zones, a sensitive interface between a stream channel and its surrounding sediments, responsible for transforming pollutants, natural solutes and supporting benthic communities. Several authors have reported the influence of stream restoration measures on hyporheic exchanges and have called for the inclusion of hyporheic zone restorations in stream management. Engineered Hyporheic Zones (EHZ) are the creation of artificial transition areas due to induced hyporheic flows, brought about by some feature modifications done to the stream channel or its subsurface. These feature modifications and their implications have been investigated through lab experiments, outdoor flumes, modelling and field studies for several years. This paper attempts to summarize the endeavours made in the study of EHZ and its applications in water quality improvement and habitat restoration. A comprehensive review of up-to-date literature with specific focus on the influence of engineered structures on hyporheic exchanges is presented, followed by the comparison of preferences opted for different studies and their limitations. The paper ends with suggestive future scope in EHZ studies and its potential as a low cost alternative treatment technology for river restoration.</jats:p>",

The original thoughts and value propositions in this research are portrayed as a supply chain framework. Unlike goods supply chain management, the service supply chain of education tourism grows complex due to the coexistence of the overlapping service objectives for education and tourism.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Measures to reduce energy losses in pipeline transport systems must be implemented already at the design stage. In particular, this also applies to local resistances of pipelines. For symmetrical sudden pipe contraction, one of such measure is profiling using insert. The paper considers a sharp-edged pipe insert, which in comparison with others has larger areas of flow separation. The diameter of the insert was calculated as the arithmetic mean between the diameters forming the sudden pipe contraction. Using the methodology described in the literature, the contraction length ratio as the areas of influence between two symmetrical sudden contractions of a circular pipe during the flow of a single-phase turbulent flow of Newtonian fluid was investigated. The coefficient of mutual influence of these local resistances was determined by formulae for direct-flowing and non-direct-flowing locking devices, which simulated symmetrical and asymmetrical fluid flow after the constriction plane, respectively. The contraction rate from 0.064 to 0.696 inclusive are considered. According to the results of calculations, no mutual influence of two sudden contractions of circular pipe was found. This indicates the unsuitability of using formulae for locking devices in this methodology for determining the contraction length ratio. Therefore, to study this problem on the sudden pipe contraction with different contraction rates, it is proposed to conduct a physical experiment. In a mathematical experiment, you can use formulae to determine the following values: upstream recirculation length and downstream recirculation length; inlet length of cylindrical pipes with turbulized the flow devices; length of the velocity profile stabilization after local resistances.</jats:p>"

The usage of lean innovation practices in product development stages in the pharmaceutical supply chain is the topic of an increasing amount of research on the critical question of how lean innovation practices can be implemented in a pharmaceutical supply chain or logistic sector. To answer this question, we first identified lean innovation practices by reviewing the literature. Methods: the identified practices were screened using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). The expert panel included eight persons working in pharmaceutical supply chain fields. In the next step, the causal relationships between practices were analyzed using the Gray DEMATEL (GDEMATEL) technique. Results: show that technological knowledge was the most crucial factor in lean innovation practices in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Conclusions: Actualizing lean innovation in the supply chain is more than just utilizing the correct strategies and instruments. To execute lean innovation effectively, a reevaluation must be accomplished: A culture that recognizes requirements for change and is set up for consistent change is essential. Methodological strategies such as the value system cannot be set up as a one-time strategy. To execute lean innovation on a long-haul premise, members must be included and become acclimated to a proceeding with the progress process. Changes in forms are frequently used because of an absence of association of suppliers, regardless of whether measures are sensible.</jats:p>"

Methods: A modified approach of the well-known model SERVQUAL is suggested and used in the case of Greek online supermarkets. Thus, an initial contribution of this paper is the formulation of a framework which can be used to assess the quality of B2C logistics services. Results: The results show that customers’ expectations are exceeding their experiential perceptions in all the examined fields, and therefore there is room for substantial improvement. The study identified areas in which supermarkets’ online shops are close to meeting customer expectations and areas in which they fall far short. Conclusions: Competition is expected to become more intense and efficient supply chains that provide services of high quality will have a determinant role to play. Moreover, online supermarkets will have to rethink of their omni-channel structures to maintain and increase their market share. This is of particular importance during turbulent times such as the ones we are experiencing now.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction. A promising direction in the development of gas supply systems, which is widely used in the developed countries of the world, is the use of an alternative energy source — biomethane. The effective use of biomethane requires the development of scientific provisions and recommendations for the use of biomethane gas supply systems, taking into account technical and economic factors. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an economic and mathematical model for choosing a gasification method and determining the area of rational use of gas supply systems with biomethane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. To develop an economic and mathematical model for choosing a method for gasification of settlements, methods of mathematical modeling and parametric optimization were used. The implementation of the economic and mathematical model was carried out in the Mathcad software package. Mathematical and graphic processing of the results obtained was carried out.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nResults. An economic and mathematical model was developed for determining the rational area of application of biome­thane for gas supply to settlements. The model is based on the technical and economic calculation of the reduced costs for gas supply systems with network natural gas and biomethane. Using the developed model, the technical parameters of the biomethane gas supply system were determined: the critical length of the gas pipeline branch, the radius of the biomethane plant, the biomethane consumption, the length of the gas pipeline for the biomethane supply, and the reduced costs to the gas supply system. A graph of the dependence of the critical length of the gas pipeline branch on the population size has been obtained, which makes it possible to determine the area of rational use of biomethane for gas supply to settlements. It was found that for a rural settlement with a population of 5,000 people, the critical length of the gas pipeline branch is 24.820–28.044 km, for an urban-type settlement with a population of 15,000 people, the length of the gas pipeline branch is 50.923–64.677 km, and for a city with a population of 30,000 people — 89.617–127.279 km.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusions. The results obtained can be used for the development and design of gas supply systems based on biomethane for the gasification of settlements remote from the main gas pipelines. The use of biomethane makes it possible to gasify settlements in developed agricultural regions and to increase the efficiency of the gas transportation system of the Russian Federation.</jats:p>",

The value of this parameter depends on various factors, including the kind of porous media (homogeneous or heterogeneous), flow velocity, initial contaminant concentration, travel distance, and sampling method. A physical model with dimensions of 0.10 m in width, 0.80 m in height, and 1.10 m in length was constructed to investigate the effects of these parameters on the dispersivity value. The stratified soil used consisted of three 20-cm-thick layers containing fine-grained, medium-grained, and coarse-grained soil. Sodium chloride solutions with electrical conductivity values of 10, 14, and 19 dS/m were used as the contaminants. Flow was forced through the layered heterogeneous soils at three discharge velocities of 17.58, 22.02, and 26.18 × 10−5 m/s. The point and mixed sampling methods were used. The results indicated that the soil dispersivity values in layered heterogeneous soils and homogeneous soil were influenced by contaminant concentration, flow velocity, and travel distance. Moreover, the dispersivity values obtained by point sampling were lower than those obtained using the mixed sampling method, and the mean dispersivity value in the layered heterogeneous soils was lower than that of the homogeneous soil.</jats:p>",

This is likely to affect plant growth and physiological performance, with subsequent effects to the functioning of many important high-elevation ecosystems. We conducted a quantitative systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of altered water supply on plants from high elevation ecosystems. We found a clear negative response of plants to decreases in water supply (mean Hedges’ g = −0.75, 95% confidence intervals: −1.09 to −0.41), and a neutral response to increases in water supply (mean Hedges’ g = 0.10, 95% confidence intervals: 0.43 to 0.62). Responses to decreases in water supply appear to be related to the magnitude of change in water supply, plant growth form, and to the measured response attribute. Changes to precipitation and water supply are likely to have important consequences for plant growth in high elevation ecosystems, with vegetation change more likely be triggered by reductions than increases in growing season precipitation. High elevation ecosystems that experience future reductions in growing-season precipitation are likely to exhibit plant responses such as reduced growth and higher allocation of carbohydrates to roots.</jats:p>"

While there is a general agreement that stakeholder pressure can lead to more sustainable SCs, a lot remains for a more differentiated stakeholder perspective in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). Thus, this study aims for theory elaboration by structuring relationships between SSCM and stakeholder constructs through an exploratory single case study design on the Otto Group, a German apparel frontrunner. It enables an in-depth investigation of the complexity of both stakeholder engagement/relationships and SSCM. As key results, sustainability managers and employees are important facilitators to realize win-win situations. Further, most progress is nowadays made in participating in multi-stakeholder-initiatives (MSI) and with standards to tackle sustainability issues in SCs. Furthermore, this study shows the importance of a shift from the perspective of sustainable products toward sustainable values, and it outlines best practices regarding the integration of stakeholders' expectations in SSCM.</jats:p>"

It has reduced the annual mean flow discharge in the Karkheh River from 120 to 50 m3/s and dried land around the river. The area of dried land is 90.17 km2 around the river and 333.45 km2 in the Hawr-al-Azim wetland. The Rosgen method, Fluvial-12 software, and Shulits equation demonstrate the instability of the plan, cross sections and longitudinal slope of the river, respectively, around Pay-e-pol hydrometric station (upstream of the river). After dam construction, extreme erosion occurred in this part of the river. The type of sediment is clay and silt with D50 = 8 μm. The eroded sediment settles downstream (around Hamidiyeh hydrometric station) and the Hawr-al-Azim wetland. The wind can easily lift these particles especially from May to July. Because of the size of these particles, the haze concentration increased from 25% to 45% in dust storms. After construction of the dam, the dust storm days increased to 90 days in 2008. By increasing the stability of the river, the dust storms reduced from 2011. The annual volume of generated haze by geomorphological characteristic changes is almost 3107 m3.</jats:p>",

Finding a long-term replacement for fossil fuels, such as biofuels, has become a major problem for energy supply management in recent years. Sustainability must be addressed as a key problem in building biofuel supply chains (BSCs), given the pressing need for societies to limit environmental consequences and promote social responsibility of company activities. Various modeling frameworks have been established so far to design a BSC. At the same time, no research exists that examines both the sustainable development paradigm and the influence of various carbon regulatory policies on the strategic and operational decisions made by BSCs.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This study develops a multi-objective, multi-period, multi-echelon BSC from switch grass regarding the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Four carbon policies are taken into account when assessing the environmental aspect: the carbon cap, the carbon tax, the carbon trade, and the carbon offset. To solve the multi-objective model, the fuzzy interactive programming method is used, and the fuzzy best–worst method is used to weight the social objective components.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>An actual case study in Iran is studied to demonstrate the model’s applicability. Under various carbon policies, different network configurations are obtained based on the location of switch grass resources and installed facilities. Biofuel production and transportation activities account for approximately 28% and 51% of total carbon emissions, respectively, according to numerical results. Furthermore, these activities account for roughly 62% of overall expenses. In the suggested case study, implementing the carbon trade policy reduces carbon emissions by more than 30% while increasing total profit by about 27%. In comparison to other policies, the carbon trade policy has a substantial impact on enhancing social considerations. Overall, the carbon trade policy can greatly improve the economic and environmental components of sustainability without significantly decreasing in the social sustainability.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The proposed model can assist policymakers and governments in simultaneously optimizing BSC profitability, carbon emission reduction, and social concern.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

The study is based on secondary data, collected from Directorate of Economics &amp; Statistics, Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. &#x0D;\nMethodology: For the present studied crops (maize, jowar and bajra), those states were selected which covered maximum area, i.e, 85% of the total area under the cultivation. Socio-economic data of farmers such as age, sex, level of education, occupation, size of landholding were collected. The translog profit function approach was used as the econometric technique to estimate output supply, and input demand functions. Labour, fertiliser and seeds are taken as variable inputs. Statistical software STATA version 16 was used for the analysis.&#x0D;\nResults: The results suggest that the changes in market prices of inputs and output significantly affect the farmers’ profits, crop produce supply and the use of resources in the cultivation of these crops. The supply elasticities of maize, jowar and bajra with respect to its own prices are positive and statistically significant indicating that increase in support prices can boost the supply of these nutri-grains and farmers profits. Labour demand for these crops in the country is elastic and significant to its own price.&#x0D;\nConclusion: During both the periods, 2013-14 (typical monsoon year) and 2017-18 (drought year), the elasticities derived are statistically robust as almost all of them carried compatible signs and in line with the theory. Promoting these crops can contribute to labour absorption.</jats:p>"

The wavelet entropy (WE) criterion is a new indicator for analyzing time series fluctuations. In this study, effective factors decreasing the groundwater level in Khorramabad city during the years 2005–2018 were evaluated by the use of WE criterion. In general, it can be said that the decreasing WE criterion or time series complexity of a phenomenon shows the time series decrease of natural fluctuation, which leads to an unfavorable trend. In this regard, in order to identify the factors affecting groundwater level decrease in Khorramabad, the groundwater level was divided into 4 time periods, and after being investigated, the monthly time series of runoff, temperature, and precipitation of this city were also divided into 4 periods. Each of these subsets were decomposed into several other subsets at different time scales under the wavelet transform, and finally, after calculation of the normalized wavelet energy for this subset, the WE criterion was calculated for each period. Investigation of WE complexity shows a 21.3% decrease in groundwater level in the second period, but in the third and fourth periods, it increased by 145 and 272%, respectively. Also, according to the results of analysis of WE changes for the precipitation time series, 35.2, 32.8, and 10.06% decrease in the second, third, and fourth periods were shown, respectively. The air temperature time series complexity decreased by 26.8% only in the third time period and in the second and fourth period, it shows an increase of 29.65 and 34.7%, respectively. However, the runoff time series did not show any reduction complexity according to the WE criterion. These results indicate that the impact of climatic factors has been more effective than human factors in reducing the groundwater level of Khorramabad.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because of the risks existing in supply chain finance, taking accounts receivable factoring business as the research object, this paper uses the evolutionary game method to analyzes the factors affecting the decision-making of the participants in supply chain finance, constructs an evolutionary game model between small and medium-sized enterprises and financial institutions, and analyzes the mechanism of blockchain to solve the financial risks of the supply chain by comparing the changes of evolutionary stability strategies before and after the introduction of blockchain technology. This paper aims to reduce financing risks by analyzing the mechanism of blockchain technology in supply chain finance. It is found that, firstly, blockchain technology can reduce the credit risk of financial institutions and solve financing problem. Credit risk plays a decisive role in whether financial institutions accept financing business decisions. Blockchain technology can reduce the operational risk of financial institutions and improve the business income of financial institutions. Secondly, the strict regulatory environment formed by blockchain technology makes the default behavior of small and medium-sized enterprises and core enterprises in a high-risk state at all times. No matter the profit distribution proportion that small and medium-sized enterprises can obtain through collusion, they will not choose to default, which effectively solves the paradox that small and medium-sized enterprises cannot obtain loans from financial institutions despite the increased probability of compliance. Then, the evolutionary game between financial institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises is balanced in that financial institutions accept business applications, small and medium-sized enterprises abide by the contract, and the convergence effect is better. Therefore, blockchain technology not only reduces the financing risk of financial institutions but also helps to solve the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises.</jats:p>"

The unbundling of the power sector was aimed at boosting electricity supply, this effort has yielded some appreciable results, but not very significant. As a result of the low power generation and distribution, Nigeria’s federal government is working towards solving the prevailing problems of inadequate power in some key sectors by building power generating plants in some of the institutions of learning in the country. This paper looks at the determinants of electrical energy consumption and electrical energy audit, a case study of the University of Jos. The load profiles demand survey, load demand forecast and other important factors were investigated. The result revealed that there is available power of 22–23 hours from the national grid and the balance 1–2 hours of power is supplied by the generating sets, good savings in the cost of diesel and maintenance.

The population contained 35 loan lending commercial banks over a period between 1985 and 2019. Secondary data was used from desired financial statements available to the public of the singular commercial banks and other posted reports of financial institutions and establishments in conformity with the study. Time-series data were analyzed using STATA version 13 software, regression analysis and model specification tests. The hypothesis was tested using the multiple regression approach a significance level of 0.05 was used.&#x0D;\nResults: The study found that interest rate (coef= -0.0822, p= 0.007) and money supply (coef= 0.548, p= 0.00) have significant effects on the growth of mortgage financing among Kenyan commercial banks.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy: Kenya's central bank should put in place mechanisms to guarantee that interest rates and money supply do not have adverse impacts on bank mortgage financing. The government should guarantee currency stability since currency fluctuations may have a negative impact on commercial bank mortgage borrowing. The classical theory is therefore relevant in our research since interest rates impact mortgages when capital demand increases. The quantity theory of money demand also holds that individuals want cash based on the transactions they need.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, some self-supply water sources contain disease-causing biological and chemical contaminants and require point-of-use (POU) treatment. However, recontamination and persistence of chemical contaminants occur, which defeats the aim of POU. This study aims to develop an affordable low-technology system that effectively treats whole-house water sourced from borehole and rain without recontamination. Raw borehole water (RBW) was treated with KAl(SO4)2·12H2O (8.10 mg/L), Ca(OH)2 (68.21 mg/L) and NaOCl (1.875 mg/L) in two separate tanks and thereafter filtered through 5-micron and 0.5-micron carbon filters, and a reverse osmosis system. The results showed that heterotrophic plate count (2,700 CFU/mL) and total coliform (378.00±21.25 MPN/100 mL) in RBW were reduced to zero, and total hardness was reduced by &amp;gt;83% after treatment and there was no recontamination. Chromium (0.05±0.002 mg/L), Cu (0.04±0.001 mg/L), Pb (0.09±0.001 mg/L), Fe (0.26±0.005 mg/L) and Mn (0.2±0.001 mg/L) in the RBW were reduced below detectable limits after treatment. The annual per capita cost of water treatment was estimated at N 4,744.44 ($9.32) at per capita consumption of 100 L/day. Our technology shows exceptional promise in providing affordable and safe water to the entire household throughout the year.</jats:p>",

A Data set comprising cars influenced by attributes like age, market value, sale price, model, etc., are put into statistical investigation like Regression analysis and compared with Data Analytics algorithms output using feature selection and a contemplation for better prediction of the supply of cars, justifying the effect of the source code and under the realm of Big Data Analytics, a comparison of Big Data analytics is performed to estimate the parameter strategy in the supply chain handling. The Big Data implementation is less time consuming and is devoid of significant fluctuation in deciding the quotation and ordering of the goods. It is a green signal to the reflection of time spirit over the supply chain management. As part of this article, efforts are made to recognize the capabilities of Big-Data applications to make valuable forecasts by establishing a high degree of Reliability and implementing related data. By using the wrapper approach of feature selection, feature extraction is believed to be studied into the prediction model.</jats:p>",

Second, consider the challenges of maximizing market demand in the porang supply chain in South Sumatra. The research employed a qualitative descriptive method with a philosophical approach to supply chain management theory. Based on the discussion, P4S as evaluated the porang supply chain design, determining that small and large traders must be eliminated as intermediaries, allowing them to sell porang raw materials direct to consumers and agro-industry enterprises that export porang. All elements, including that of the local government, Sriwijaya University, the corporate sector, and banking institutions, should be involved in the P4S porang supply chain planning. This collaboration is crucial in order to connect and transform the paradigm of direct sales to consumers, enabling P4S porang farmers to sell to the nearest consumer, PT PIP in South Lampung, via a contract farming system.</jats:p>"

Powerful quantum computers enable attackers to break into blockchains by rapid inverse calculations of mathematical problems that are the core of one of the main blockchain security foundations, known as asymmetric cryptography. They are also able to violate the integrity of public blockchains like bitcoin through mining acceleration. Hence, quantum computers can engender threats to the supply chain users of blockchain. On the other hand, there are ongoing efforts to create a quantum-resistant solution. One approach for such a solution is to utilize quantum tools themselves. Moreover, sufficiently powerful quantum computers are still being developed, and it is still unclear whether a quantum solution will arrive first or vice versa. The contrasting duality of quantum computers and lack of a clear picture over the timing of the arrival of a solution and threats give rise to the uncertainty that might hinder the attractiveness of blockchains for supply chains.</p>",

The practical use of active solar energy systems, both photovoltaic and with direct water heating, has found widespread use. At the same time, the specificities of these systems deployment are caused by climatic and technical conditions of their application. For countries found in climatic zones with temperate and cold climate, water heating installations design is most rational when used seasonally. Low coolant potential, heat supply frequency in active solar energy systems, linked to seasonality of their operation, daytime and weather require several technical solutions. For example, solutions with the use of other equipment in form of thermal energy accumulators, heat pumps and other equipment, which in any case must be combined with a traditional source of thermal energy using fossil fuels or electric power, performing the functions of both other and emergency source of heat energy. Capacity reserving of alternative energy sources is most efficient and least energy-consuming when conducting with heat sources using gaseous or degasified fuel. The use of electric power for heat supply purpose, with few capital investments, requires from a developer significant installed capacities of heat source with a low efficiency for primary fuel. In the article one considers thermal schemes of autonomous heat supply installations for objects using modern condensing boilers of low power and along them various heat cumulating devices, supplying full year operation of equipment at heat supply facilities to get the highest efficiency of energy use.</jats:p>",

In particular, the influence of foreign outsourcing manufacturers on textile supply chains has been recognized for decades. The outsourcing manufacturers are multi-criteria selected and changed by supply chain managers from time to time in search of the most efficient state for the entire supply chain. This is a known concern with the community and there is large interest in studying the apparel and textile outsourcing manufacturer problems. Aiming at reinforcing the selection methods, this study develops a three-layer fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making approach that leverages the strengths from the original methods. In turn through the layers, the hierarchy and weights of criteria and sub-criteria, which includes sustainability factors, are determined by the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method. Next, the results from the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) process determine the outsourcing manufacturer’s performance via expert linguistics judgments. Then, data envelopment analysis (DEA) models are applied for the purpose of evaluating the outsourcing manufacturer’s overall performance along with other quantitative effectiveness. This approach is applied to the problem of selecting the apparel and textile outsourcing manufacturers in Vietnam, one of the places that makes the necessity of this problem grow. The third position in the world apparel and textile export ranking, as well as the trend of shifting labor-intensive production systems to Southeast Asia make the necessity of Vietnam outsourcing manufacturer selection problem grow. The results of this study also classified manufacturers into groups as a support for selection decisions. Analysis of quantitative uncertainties using simulation tools and forecasting techniques can strengthen the solutions in future related studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The healthcare supply chain is a complex adaptive ecosystem that facilitates the delivery of health products to the end patient in a cost-effective way. However, low forecast accuracy and high demand volatility in healthcare supply chains have resulted in an increase in stockouts, operational inefficiencies, poor health outcomes, and a significant increase in supply chain costs. To cope with these challenges, organisations are trying to adopt demand-driven supply chain management (DDSCM) operating practices which have been established in other sectors such as the telecommunications, fruit, and flower industries. However, previous studies have not considered these practices in the healthcare industry, and hence no methodologies exist that support the implementation of these practices in this context. Moreover, current studies present cases where the focus has been on improving and expanding individual organisational performance, but no supply chain network-level studies exist on the healthcare industry. Therefore, this paper provides a network-level analysis when addressing DDSCM in the healthcare industry. A grounded theory-based approach coupled with a conceptual framework analysis process was used to leverage a systematized literature review methodology with the development of a network maturity mapping tool for DDSCM which was validated in the public healthcare sector.</jats:p>"

Operation of such converters has negative impact on the in-plant power supply system. To improve the voltage quality of active rectifiers, special algorithms of pulse-width modulation algorithms are used. As a rule, the study of the effect of electric drives with FC-AR on the supply network are carried out based on simplified mathematical models that do not consider possible resonance phenomena in the power supply system and operating mode of electric drives. Thus, the aim of the paper is to assess the acceptability of such an approach. The trends of the main parameters of the rolling mill electric drives have been recorded during the rolling cycle using the IBA PDA software. The obtained dependencies values have been approximated and applied in a complex simulation model of the in-plant power supply system. It considers the parameters of the supply network, cable lines, step-down transformers, rolling mill electric drives and other electrical receivers of the shop substations. The main assumption in simulation modeling is to consider the loads of other electrical receivers in the form of constant values. The authors have studied the effect of the operating modes of the rolling mill electric drive on the electric power quality in the 10 kV distribution network of the in-plant power supply system of a metallurgical enterprise. It is found that the total harmonic distortion KU at 10 kV sections of the main step-down substation of a metallurgical enterprise is changing in a nonlinear manner in the dynamic modes of acceleration and deceleration of electric drives. The nature of the coefficient KU also depends on the presence of resonance phenomena in the frequency response of the medium voltage supply network. The obtained results prove the need to consider the operating modes of electric drives when studying the influence of electric drives with FC-AR on the quality of the supply network voltage. in case we conduct experimental research using the equipment of the enterprises, as well as during theoretical research using mathematical models. The adequacy of the simulation model has previously been confirmed by experimental data and previous studies.</jats:p>",

Responsible waste management is a key issue for the entire recycling industry in Ukraine. The study of trends in the development of solid waste recycling infrastructure in developed countries is the basis for the formation of its own recycling system in Ukraine. This explains the fact that in a difficult environmental situation on a global scale, the issue of recycling is gaining priority today. Modern enterprises that provide services for the removal of household waste, their sorting and further processing today especially need the participation of the state to create market conditions for the development of a competitive environment. After all, in addition to the processing of waste into secondary raw materials, biogas extraction systems are installed at landfills in Ukraine and installations for electricity production are operated. So in parallel with solving the problem of pollution, we have an additional source of alternative energy. At the legislative level, the executive bodies of village, settlement and city councils have the right to address the issues of collection, transportation, utilization and disposal of household waste, setting tariffs for the service of household waste management, organization of separate collection of useful components of this waste. In order to create a proper system and build infrastructure for efficient waste management, it is important to unite local communities. In addition, it is critical to apply a systematic approach to the organization of the execution chain of all stages of recycling by forming the interaction of all infrastructure elements.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gas supply system risk assessment is a serious and important problem in cities. Existing methods tend to manually build mathematical models to predict risk value from single-modal information, i.e., pipeline parameters. In this paper, we attempt to consider this problem from a deep-learning perspective and define a novel task, Urban Gas Supply System Risk Assessment (GSS-RA). To drive deep-learning techniques into this task, we collect and build a domain-specific dataset GSS-20K containing multi-modal data. Accompanying the dataset, we design a new deep-learning framework named GSS-RiskAsser to learn risk prediction. In our method, we design a parallel-transformers Vision Embedding Transformer (VET) and Score Matrix Transformer (SMT) to process multi-modal information, and then propose a Multi-Modal Fusion (MMF) module to fuse the features with a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that GSS-RiskAsser could work well on GSS-RA task and facilitate practical applications. Our data and code will be made publicly available.</jats:p>"

Rather than treating governance as a direct determinant in a tourism demand model, the multifaceted nature of this concept is recognized and nested in the broader supply-side environment of a destination. Reducing five World Governance Index (WGI) dimensions into one holistic governance measure, which is then utilized as an instrument and operates through FDI, this study incorporates the indirect impact of governance on tourism demand in a two-stage least square (2SLS) regression model. The key findings demonstrate that governance is positively associated with FDI accumulation and that this effect is positively conducive to tourism demand. The results suggest a development strategy for building a competitive and sustainable tourism industry should be encompassed in a broader project of enhancing the political-economic environment of the destination. </jats:p>",

A comparative analysis of the obtained diagrams with the diagrams of velocities that occur during uniform motion in pressure pipelines with solid walls was carried out. It is shown that the main difference between them occurs in the flow zones, which are located near the pipeline walls. It was explained by the connected liquid jets effect on the main flow. The degree of diagrams deformation was estimated by the value of the momentum coefficient α0 (Boussinesq coefficient) and the coefficient of kinetic energy α (Coriolis coefficient). It was determined that in the general case these coefficients will be variable in magnitude along the length of the studied pipes. Nevertheless, these coefficients are recommended to be constant in magnitude in engineering calculations. The limits of the structural characteristics of collecting perforated pipes for which this non-uniformity of the diagrams must be taken into account, and for which it can be neglected were determined on the basis of the analysis of the equation of fluid motion with a variable flow rate.</jats:p>"

Modeling agricultural labor supply is more challenging than modeling the supply of other agricultural inputs or of labor to other sectors of the economy owing to unique features of agricultural production and farm labor markets. Data and econometric challenges abound, and estimates of agricultural labor supply elasticities are sparse. This review explains the importance and challenges of modeling farm labor supply and describes researchers’ efforts to address these challenges. It summarizes estimates of agricultural labor supply elasticities over the last 80 years, provides insights into variation in these estimates, identifies priority areas for future research, and reviews the most influential empirical work related to this important topic. </jats:p>",

We prove that the proposed loan contract aligns the decentralized decision-makings of each party and duplicates the optimal channel performance under a fully integrated decision-making framework. A case study is then conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed loan contract. The result shows that the proposed loan contract outperforms wholesale-price contracts, where coordination does not take place, and buyback contracts, where coordination happens between the retailer and the manufacturer only. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis reveals that profit allocations among the lender, the retailer, and the manufacturer resulted from the proposed loan contract are more balanced when the cost-to-retail ratio or risk premium is high. </jats:p>",

However, WDNs are subject to many future changes such as an increase (or decrease) in demand due to population change and migration, changes in water availability due to seasonal and climatic change, etc. Thus, the capacity expansion of WDNs needs to be performed such that the cost of interventions made is minimum while satisfying the demand and performance requirements at various time periods. Therefore, the current study proposed a Dynamic Programming (DP) framework for capacity expansion of WDNs and solved using Multi-Objective Self Adaptive Differential Evolution (MOSADE). The methodology is tested on three benchmark WDNs, namely Two-loop (TL), GoYang, and Blacksburg (BLA) WDNs, and applied to a real case study of the Badlapur region, Maharashtra, India. The results show that the proposed methodology leads to effective Pareto optimal fronts, making it an efficient method for solving WDN expansion problems. Subsequently, an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis was performed on the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions to determine the most suitable solution based on three criteria: Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of expansions, hydraulic reliability, and mechanical reliability. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is its capability to consider hydraulic performance as well as structural integrity and demand satisfaction in the face of hydraulic and mechanical failures.</jats:p>",

Observed oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the tropical Pacific Ocean are\nlocated above intermediate-depth waters (IDWs), defined here as the 500–1500 m water layer. Typical climate models do not represent IDW properties well and are characterized by OMZs that are too deep-reaching. We analyze the role of the IDW in the misrepresentation of oxygen levels in a heterogeneous subset of ocean models characterized by a horizontal resolution ranging from 0.1 to 2.8∘. First, we show that forcing the extratropical boundaries (30∘ S and N) to observed oxygen values results in a significant increase in oxygen levels in the intermediate eastern tropical region. Second, we highlight the fact that the Equatorial Intermediate Current System (EICS) is a key feature connecting the western and eastern part of the basin. Typical climate models lack in representing crucial aspects of this supply at intermediate depth, as the EICS is basically absent in models characterized by a resolution lower than 0.25∘. These two aspects add up to a “cascade of biases” that hampers the correct representation of oxygen levels at intermediate depth in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and potentially future OMZ projections.\n                    </jats:p>"

The main problem in the violation of the software supply chain is that, from 85% to 97% of the code currently used in the software development industry comes from the reuse of open source code frameworks, repositories of third-party software and APIs, creating potential vulnerabilities in the development cycle of a software product. This research analyzes the SolarWinds case study from an exploratory review of academic literature, government information, but also from the articles and reports that are published by different cybersecurity consulting firms and software providers. Then, a set of good practices is proposed such as: Zero trust, Multi-Factor authentication mechanisms (MFA), strategies such as SBOM and the recommendations of the CISA guide to defend against this type of attack. Finally, the research discusses about how to improve response times and prevention against this type of attacks, also future research related to the subject is suggested, such as the application of Machine Learning and Blockchain technologies. Additionally for risk reduction, in addition to the management and articulation of IT teams that participate in all the actors that are part of the software life cycle under a DevSecOps approach.</jats:p>",

A standing wave accelerator containing a high-frequency generator, a phase shifter, a waveguide bridge, a high-frequency load, and an accelerating system of two accelerating sections is equipped with two waveguide tees. Their inputs are connected to the output arms of the waveguide bridge, and the first and second output arms of each tee are connected to the first and last accelerating cells of each section, respectively. In this system, due to the introduction of several elements that do not require large costs for manufacturing and tuning, a significantly greater frequency separation of the operating mode of oscillations from neighboring ones is ensured, or even a single-frequency excitation mode is implemented, which makes it possible to significantly increase the stability of the accelerator operation.

It can serve to expand a laboratory’s options during a supply shortage, and can lead to cost savings. Just prior to the pandemic, our laboratory underwent a large-scale conversion of blood tube suppliers after successful validation of serum, plasma, and whole blood tubes for blood bank, chemistry, immunology, hematology, coagulation, molecular diagnostics, and flow cytometry.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods/Case Report</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>First, we designed a patient consent form for collecting extra blood samples. Per CLSI standards, validation of blood tubes is needed for each testing methodology but not for each analyte. Hence, we selected high-impact assays to represent each testing methodology used by our instrument platforms. We designed comparison studies to test the new blood tubes for result accuracy, precision and specimen stability that covered an assay’s reportable range. Allowable error limits were set based on Westgard and CAP guidelines. Spiked specimens were used when positive patient samples were not feasible. We also took the opportunity to optimize the blood tube sizes, e.g., converting the lavender-top tubes from 2 ml (vendor A) to 3 ml (vendor B). We then confirmed with our reference labs the acceptability of the new vendor’s products, and administered an electronic survey to solicit staff feedback. Finally, we coordinated supply chain, formulary changes and test catalog updates.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Results (if a Case Study enter NA)</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Data analyses showed 100% acceptable performance of the new supplier’s blood tubes. The survey showed that our phlebotomists supported the new products, citing their ease of use and good vacuum. Our hematology technologists provided favorable feedback on the larger lavender-top tubes that reduced the number of insufficient samples. On the economic front, this supplier conversion has yielded a 26% cost savings.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>To our knowledge, our study is the most comprehensive of all blood collection device comparison analyses published. Our validation strategies that were designed to comply with best practice standards have led to our confidence in the interchangeability of the new and old blood tube products. This initiative serves to elucidate a protocol to add vendor options that can be replicated by other laboratories to mitigate blood tube supply shortages and backorders. It has helped us control supply costs without compromising quality.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This uncertainty has also forced many organizations including container liner shipping to redesign their supply chain. Feeder services from hub ports are essential chain of shipping networks. This chapter addresses the design of feeder networks under consideration of demand fluctuations over the year. For this purpose, a perturbation-based variable neighbourhood search approach is developed in order to determine the feeder ship fleet size and mix, the fleet deployment, service routes, and voyage schedules to minimize operational costs. In the case study investigation, the authors consider the feeder network design problem faced by a feeder shipping company as a sample application. The performance of alternate network configurations is compared under dynamic demand conditions. Numerical results highlight the advantage of dynamic and flexible design of feeder service networks. </jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to determine the best PET estimation method as well as to carry out a trend analysis and stationarity test of PET in Peninsular Malaysia. The Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen's slope estimator were applied for the trend analysis while the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin (KPSS) test were applied for the stationarity test. The findings showed that Pulau Langkawi and Kuantan stations exhibited increasing trends while Bayan Lepas station exhibited decreasing trends for the daily, monthly, and annual PET time series. The daily, monthly, and annual PET time series at Bayan Lepas, Ipoh, Subang and Muadzam Shah stations were found to be stationary. Overall, the PET trend was found to be higher in the coastal regions and stationary in the mountainous region.</jats:p>",

In recent era of electronic devices, reducing power consumption is an important objective which can be achieved by multiple supply voltage island aware floorplanning. Optimizing power routing resource to simplify power planning while reducing voltage drop or IR drop (represented by maximum power length) is the major goal of the proposed work. Moreover, it has been observed that locations of blocks and power pads are important considerations for IR drop optimization. The proposed work hence concentrates on generating efficient floorplan with respect to wirelength, power routing resource, and IR drop. The proposed technique uses effective heuristics along with a SAT (Boolean satisfiability)‐based framework to generate efficient floorplan considering all factors. The experimental validation depicts good results with respect to power resource, wirelength, and voltage drop in a fixed outline framework.</jats:p>",

In the suppliers, different types of semi-finished products can be produced in the same batch, and products in the same batch can only be started simultaneously (at the same time) even if they complete at different times. The purpose of this study is to determine the selection of suppliers and their production lines for the production of semi-finished products for each period of a given planning horizon, and the objective is to minimize total costs associated with the supply chain during the whole planning horizon. To solve this problem, we suggest a mixed integer programming model and a heuristic algorithm.

The purpose of this study is to provide an empirical descriptive analysis of the role of digital technologies in improving the efficiency and recovery of SC in the pre-crisis period as well as in a pandemic. The research is based on the processing of statistical data and macroeconomic indicators that are freely available. The following are considered as basic indicators: Gross domestic product as a characteristic of the country's economic development level before the crisis; logistics efficiency index; digital life index. The authors have chosen few countries from different categories for the comparative analysis in the context of the selected assessment indicators The obtained study results confirmed the significant role of ICT in the efficiency improving and restoration of SC which had been destroyed in COVID-19. It is concluded that developed economies showed a high efficiency of their logistics systems at the national level and high values of the digital life rating. At the same time, the influence of ICT on the logistics system performance was not decisive in countries with average economic development and below ones. The results of this study can be used by companies' top management of various levels to build a strategy and tactics for their development including crisis management. The research methods and data can be applied to further explore the impact of ICT on the recovery and efficiency of global and local supply chains, including the updated data with the account of coronavirus pandemic impact to indicators which were used in the paper.</jats:p>"

We also generalize the significant practical strategies and strategic factors that have been investigated, combined with supplier encroachment, such as investment and spillover effects, the retailer’s store brand introduction, strategic inventory, and contract mechanism designs. More importantly, we summarize the classical theoretical models which include the basic models, the signaling game model, and the Hotelling model, and these have been widely used by scholars to capture the supplier’s encroachment behavior.

Accordingly, in this research, solar energy will be used to preheat the gas, which will be used for the most accurate analysis of TRNSYS software. In this regard, the amount of utilization of the sun and the amount of energy required for preheating will be obtained.

Most low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack the robust regulatory quality assurance system necessary to contain the spread of poor-quality medicines. Innovations in regulatory systems strengthening are needed to protect public health. In this study, we assessed the integrity of the antimicrobial supply chain in Bangladesh and suggest innovations. We employed a qualitative methodology comprising a policy content analysis, and literature and database reviews. Bangladesh was chosen as a model LMIC because of its pharmaceuticals production capacity. Using a framework modified from the World Health Organization’s and the United States Pharmacopoeia’s, the Bangladesh National Drug Policy (BNDP) was evaluated for provisions on quality assurance mechanisms that match regulatory functions. Newspaper, peer-reviewed and post-marketing surveillance reports were used to assess the extent of poor-quality antimicrobials in circulation. There are provisions for quality assurance in the BNDP. Newspaper reports identified the circulation of substandard antimicrobials and reported on actions by the government to seize fraudulent/falsified and expired products. Only six peer-review studies testing antimicrobial product quality were identified; the three studies with the larger sample size (over 10 samples tested) reported results of out-of-specifications products. This assessment found evidence of regulatory actions against poor-quality antimicrobials as well as news reports and studies suggesting quality concerns, but no current rigorous assessment of the extent in Bangladesh. We suggest a multi-pronged approach to regulatory system strengthening comprising three strategies: community-based surveillance, task-shifting, and technology-enabled consumer participation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies, have been progressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These and other digitalization-enabling technologies are generating a massive amount of data with enormous potential to manage supply chains more efficiently and sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis. In such a data-driven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved significant momentum to analyze, mine, and extract the underlying data information, or solve complex optimization problems, striking a balance between productive efficiency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some recent studies have sorted the CI literature in this field, they are mainly oriented towards a single family of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics) and review their application in specific FSC stages. As such, there is a gap in identifying and classifying FSC problems from a broader perspective, encompassing the various families of CI methods that can be applied in different stages (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these stages from a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy of FSC problems (associated with agriculture, fish farming, and livestock) from a CI approach; that is, it defines FSC problems (from production to retail) and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from a CI point of view. Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in each stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also introduce a set of guidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to decide on suitable families of methods when addressing any particular problems they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy, we identify and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization of the FSC.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Inventory policy highly influences Supply Chain Management (SCM) process. Evidence suggests that almost half of SCM costs are set off by stock-related expenses.Objective: This paper aims to minimise total inventory cost in SCM by applying a multi-agent-based machine learning called Reinforcement Learning (RL).Methods: The ability of RL in finding a hidden pattern of inventory policy is run under various constraints which have not been addressed together or simultaneously in previous research. These include capacitated manufacturer and warehouse, limitation of order to suppliers, stochastic demand, lead time uncertainty and multi-sourcing supply. RL was run through Q-Learning with four experiments and 1,000 iterations to examine its result consistency. Then, RL was contrasted to the previous mathematical method to check its efficiency in reducing inventory costs.Results: After 1,000 trial-error simulations, the most striking finding is that RL can perform more efficiently than the mathematical approach by placing optimum order quantities at the right time. In addition, this result was achieved under complex constraints and assumptions which have not been simultaneously simulated in previous studies.Conclusion: Results confirm that the RL approach will be invaluable when implemented to comparable supply network environments expressed in this project. Since RL still leads to higher shortages in this research, combining RL with other machine learning algorithms is suggested to have more robust end-to-end SCM analysis. Keywords: Inventory Policy, Multi-Echelon, Reinforcement Learning, Supply Chain Management, Q-Learning</jats:p>"

As a case study, a typical supply chain in the Colombian production system was considered. As a case study, a typical supply chain in the Colombian production system was considered. For this, the study developed a modeling procedure to transform its supply chain architecture from a typical structure to a multi-agent structure. This procedure consists of seven phases. Initially, the case study is characterized as a supply chain, then the information is collected, next the limitations of the supply chain are identified, then the variables and their interactions are defined. In the following two phases, three models are developed: the structural model, representing the physical distribution of the plant; the conceptual model, that relates the system components and their interactions; and the functional model, which integrates the previous models and associates them with the behavior of the variables during the process ow. Finally, a qualitative and quantitative validation of the models are performed, simulating different scenarios. The results show that a distributed supply chain structure, using multi-agent architecture, first, offers robust information and physical flows, and secondly, contributes to supply time reduction, communication quickness, efficiency and quality of information for operational decision making. The results could also motivate organizations to integrate the supply chains considering MASs in resource management.</jats:p>"

It has been estimated that more than two million U.S. BXD calves were born in 2020, which is a practice that is expected to continue to grow throughout the foreseeable future. While not a new concept, the widespread adoption, scale, and strategies currently being used to produce BXD calves have recently received considerable industry attention. Although the increased duration of feeding exposes BXD feeders to increased price and production risks when compared to straightbred beef cattle, these risks are met with several potential benefits. A prime example of such benefits includes a consistent supply of uniform, traceable feeder cattle that are easily age and source verified, that also serve as ideal candidates for enrollment in or development of other value-added marketing programs. Current demand, as indicated by newborn calf prices, suggests that the industry perceives BXD calves to be superior when compared to their straightbred dairy breed contemporaries, and at times, suggests that they may be overvalued. Sustaining such demand will require BXD calves to meet or exceed the performance and profitability expectations of the various production sectors of the beef industry. Results of a multi-year analysis of the economics of BXD calves as compared to cattle of straightbred beef or dairy breed composition will be presented. Furthermore, specific factors expected to influence value throughout the production supply chain will be outlined and discussed. Calfhood management practices that promote calf health, paired with genetic selection strategies focused on complementary traits that minimize cost of gain and increase cutability, such as feed efficiency, carcass yield, and muscularity, will play key roles in sustaining the value of BXD calves to all aspects of the beef supply chain.</jats:p>",

We propose three different models with which to connect the domestic firms to a WIOT. Then, we estimate the value-added losses of Japanese firms caused by shocks of different magnitudes and durations originating in China, in the EU and the US, and globally. The volume and rates at which losses increase are very different across the connection models, which indicates that the assignment of international connections to firms matters greatly. The losses increase sublinearly as the duration expands, which indicates that the shock propagation ultimately saturates the economy. Rates of saturation differ substantially depending on the assignment of international connections. The losses increase superlinearly as the initial reduction rate increases. This occurs because there is a greater probability of one supplier being replaced by other suppliers if the reduction is smaller.</jats:p>"

An interruption risk assessment model of WSMC projects is established through a quantitative evaluation of the impact of emergencies on water users based on input-output theory. First, the concept of the interruption risk index (IRI) is defined as a function of the duration of enterprise shutdown (DES). Second, the DES is divided into two parts: the duration caused by COVID-19 and that under other types of emergencies. Third, the risk tolerance threshold is given to estimate the interruption result, and its different consequences are discussed. Finally, a WSMC project in China is taken as a case study, and its interruption risks are analysed. The results show that the IRIs of this WSMC in both 2020 and 2021 are theoretically greater than the risk tolerance thresholds, and the high pandemic prevention standards and conservative pandemic estimates are the main reasons for the above results. The model established in this study provides a reference for WSMC participants to deal with emergencies and provides the theoretical support for the extension of the WSMC.</jats:p>",

To support the primary data analysis results, we conducted focus group interviews (FGIs) of 16 consumers. According to the primary data analysis, consumers’ subjective norms and perceived behavioral control positively influence GSCM. However, attitude did not have a significant influence. In the FGI, consumers show a highly positive attitude and purchase intention toward the GSCM of companies. However, they exhibit mistrust and lower purchase intentions toward advertising or marketing campaigns promoting GSCM to consumers. In contrast, the influence of subjective norms was found to be different for different products. In addition, a high price—regarded as the biggest barrier among perceived control factors—raises purchase intentions if consumers are provided with good and transparent information about green products. Thus, this study buttresses the fact that if a company uses GSCM practices as an eco-friendly marketing strategy that reduces consumer distrust and considers product characteristics, it can have a positive effect on consumers’ decision to purchase eco-friendly products.</jats:p>"

For this study, 12 manufacturing companies were selected based on convenience sampling. In total, 270 respondents were chosen based on disproportionate stratified random sampling from 12 manufacturing companies through questionnaire. Bayesian Linear Regression was performed on the data collected. This empirical study establishes that employees’ learning styles can play a pertinent role in enhancing green practices in organizations. The learning styles drive, support and exploit the full-fledged potential of Green Procurement and Green Manufacturing practices but no significant impact on Green Distribution and Reverse Logistics. The understanding derived from the analysis is depicted as ‘Learn and Act’ Cycle of green supply chain practices.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

This situation has blurred the conceptual definition of both terms, limiting their research and practice effectiveness. To counteract this situation, scholars and policymakers are approaching Circular Economy as able to inspire the development of sustainable development strategies and to increase the sustainability of the current economic system, balancing the need for economic development and the importance of protecting environmental resources and people wellbeing. Drawing on the previous considerations, this study aims to contribute to address this gap, better understanding how a circular economy approach can contribute to challenge the number of sustainability issues that currently affect supply chains. In doing so, the analysis has been focused on the investigation of a specific supply chain, the pasta supply chain. To this end, after a brief theoretical recognition, an interpretative model has been proposed for better recognizing and describing the enhancing actions that—at each supply chain’s stages—can improve process efficiency, output effectiveness and, therefore, the overall sector sustainability. However, it is worth noting that the inherently theoretical nature of the study somewhat limits it; therefore, future empirical research is needed to further test the proposed model, applying it to other real applicative sets.</jats:p>",

Based on discussions with producers, processors, and retailers from Uttarakhand and nearby regions, this study examines to what extent the Uttarakhand agricultural supply chain ecosystem can sustain and transform with climate change. Perhaps farmers are implicitly taking initiatives to adapt to climate change. These include changing sowing and harvesting timing, cultivation of crops of short duration varieties, inter-cropping, organic farming, agritourism, contract farming, and food processing. These changes may be considered as passive responses or adaptation strategies to climate change. Currently, agricultural practices and policies are perceived as a greater adaptation challenge than climate change, and extra efforts are required to create a remunerative agricultural supply chain ecosystem.</p>",

Environmental impact function was developed by mesohabitat hydraulic simulation. Then, the developed function was utilized in the structure of the reservoir operation optimization. Different metaheuristic algorithms including practice swarm optimization, invasive weed optimization, differential evolution and biogeography-based algorithm were used to optimize reservoir operation. Root mean square error (RMSE) and reliability index were utilized to measure the performance of algorithms. Based on the results in the case study, the proposed method is robust for mitigating downstream environmental impacts and sustaining water supply by the reservoir. RMSE for mesohabitats is 8%, which indicates the robustness of proposed method to mitigate environmental impacts at downstream. It seems that providing environmental requirements might reduce the reliability of water supply considerably. Differential evolution algorithm is the best method to optimize reservoir operation in the case study.</jats:p>",

In this study, statistical downscaling of monthly areal mean precipitation in the Göksun River basin in Turkey was carried out using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) techniques. Large-scale weather factors were used for the basin with a monthly areal mean precipitation (PM) record from 1971 to 2000 used for training and testing periods. The R2-value for precipitation in the SVM, GEP and GMDH models are 0.62, 0.59, and 0.6 respectively, for the testing periods. The results show that SVM has the best model performance of the three proposed downscaling models, however, the GEP model has the lowest AIC value. The simulated results for the Canadian GCM3 (CGCM3) A1B and A2 scenarios show a similarity in their average precipitation prediction. Generally, both these scenarios anticipate a decrease in the average monthly precipitation during the simulated periods. Therefore, the results of the future projections show that mean precipitation might decrease during the period of 2021–2100.</jats:p>",

The change in velocity from valve closures or pump operations causes pressure surges that are propagated away from the source throughout the pipeline.

It should also be noted that when the maximum pressures exceed the bar ratings (mechanical strength) of the piping material, failure can occur. Similarly, if the minimum pressure drops below the vapour pressure of the fluid, cavitation can occur. The purpose of the present study is to model and simulate the hydraulic transients in a pipeline network system of the treated effluent rising main of Mpophomeni sanitation scheme using SAP 2R.

In this article, the water supply reliability (WSR) of 62 major Korean agricultural reservoirs was comprehensively evaluated for varying climate and farming practices. Field surveys identified the recent divergence from standard rice farming practices and a 45-year daily weather data set (1973–2017) was examined to understand the phenomenon of climate change. Effective rainfall increments mitigated the imminent surges in rice irrigation water requirements driven by warming-led accelerated crop evapotranspiration rates; therefore, climate change marginally influenced the WSR of selected reservoirs. The transplanting period and associated water consumption were the primary deviations from standard rice farming practices. A significantly prolonged transplanting period seriously compromised the WSR of agricultural reservoirs and the maximum number of unsafe reservoirs was detected for a 24-day increase in the transplanting period. A watershed/irrigated area ratio of less than 2.5 was the lower threshold below which all the reservoirs had unsafe WSR regardless of the climate change and/or farming practices. Recent variations in farming practices were the primary cause of reservoir failure in maintaining the WSR.</jats:p>"

Consequently, enhancing and objectively assessing the sustainable value of traditional arts and crafts has assumed importance in developing tourism strategies. In China, few scholars have studied policy matching of traditional arts and crafts and intangible cultural heritage. The purpose of this paper is to propose supply–demand models and ordered logistical regression techniques to evaluate the quantitative efficacy of sustainability policies in traditional arts and crafts. The present study focuses on Taiyuan city; empirical study, analysis and results from assessing and analyzing policy measures show that building platforms, organizing exchanges, and hosting competitions and awards are fundamental strategies. The analysis of the efficacy of policy measures shows a positive correlation between price and the quality of arts and crafts products. For every 1% increase in the policy measure, the odds ratio of a sequential price increase is 1.04 times the original value, and the odds ratio of a sequential improvement in the manufacturing of arts and crafts is 1.06 times the original. The research results can be used as a reference to formulate accurate implementation of policies by the relevant departments, thereby accelerating the sustainability of traditional arts and crafts.</jats:p>"

The negative effects of these stressors on yield can be mitigated by crop grafting. The increasing demands for resource-use efficiency in crop production, therefore, require the development and phenotyping of more resilient rootstocks, and the selection of appropriate scions. We tested the effect of combined drought stress and nutrient deficiency on yield and fruit quality of the two tomato cultivars ‘Lyterno’ and ‘Tastery’ in the greenhouse, grafted onto different rootstock genotypes. The use of four different rootstocks, including two novel S. pennellii × S. lycopersicum hybrids and the proven-effective use of ‘Beaufort’, as well as self-grafted plants, allowed conclusions to be drawn about the differential stress mitigation of the rootstocks used. The stress-induced yield reduction of the scion ‘Lyterno’ can be mitigated more significantly by the novel hybrid rootstocks than by the commercial rootstock ‘Beaufort’. At the same time, however, the individual fruit weight and the lycopene content of the fruits were significantly reduced when grafted onto the hybrid rootstocks. In contrast, the cultivar ‘Tastery’ showed a weak stress response, so that a generally positive influence of the rootstocks independently of the scions could not be demonstrated. We conclude that, particularly for more sensitive cultivars, the selection of more resilient rootstocks offers the potential for sustainable and resource-efficient production not competing with the overall quality of tomatoes.</jats:p>"

A thermal network simulation model of a gear reducer for electric vehicles based on amesim software was built for thermal and efficiency analysis of the reducer, where heat production and transfer processes of each component in the reducer are considered. Moreover, secondary development submodels were developed to calculate the convection coefficients in real time based on different lubricating oil temperatures and working conditions. Next, the experiments were conducted to verify the developed model regarding transmission efficiency and lubricating oil equilibrium temperature in the reducer. The deviation between the numerical and experimental results is less than 5%, which indicates high accuracy of the developed thermal network model. Thereafter, efficiency and heat balance simulation tests under different working conditions were performed to determine an optimal lubricating oil supply, which is 14 mm gear-oil-immersion oil supply in this study. Finally, a comparison between the reducer with the optimal oil supply and that with normally used 22 mm gear-oil-immersion supply in the NEDC cycles in low temperature was done. The reducer with the optimal oil supply shows 1.032% energy saving. The method presented in this article provides a good guide to design and optimization of the gear reducer for electrical vehicles.</jats:p>",

Many recent systematic literature review studies have discussed supply chain relationships from various perspectives. However, a comprehensive analysis, summarising the existing research, explicitly identified the implemented B2B supply chain relationships and found the effects of these relationships on supply chain performance remain lacking. To address the gap, this article presents a systematic literature review based on the PRISMA approach regarding the nature of the supply chain relationships between B2B partners and their effect on supply chain performance. Web of Science and Scopus were used in the compilation of studies published between 2000 and 2020. Findings indicate that the majority of B2B partners use a collaborative relationship approach and that the impacts are marked on the operational, financial, innovation, environmental, social and economic performance of their supply chain. This study seeks to contribute to the existing literature on B2B supply chain relationships by conducting a thorough and unbiased review of previous studies, drawing more general conclusions about the adopted supply chain relationships between B2B partners and providing insights for future research.</jats:p>"

An efficient supply chain must have a symmetry of information between participating entities, but in reality, the information is asymmetric, causing problems. The sustainability of the supply chain continues to be threatened because companies are reluctant to disclose information to others. If companies participating in the supply chain do not disclose accurate information, the next best way to improve the sustainability of the supply chain is to use data from the supply chain to determine each enterprise’s information. This study takes data from the supply chain and then uses machine learning algorithms to find which enterprise the data refer to when new data from unknown sources arise. The machine learning algorithms used are logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, decision tree, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and multi-layer perceptron. Indicators for evaluating the performance of multi-class classification machine learning methods are accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score. The experimental results showed that LR and MLP accurately predicted companies (tiers), but NB, DT, RF, SVM, and K-NN did not accurately predict companies. In addition, the performance similarity of machine learning algorithms through experiments was classified into LR and MLP groups, NB and DT groups, and RF, SVM, and K-NN groups.</jats:p>"

The rapid increase in electricity demand has generated great interest in how to tackle a possible long-lasting energy deficiency in the country. This paper aims at analyzing the techno-economic feasibility of a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for the sustainable rural electrification of Lungi Town, Port Loko District, Sierra Leone. Optimization, economic, reliability, and sustainability analyses were carried out using a genetic algorithm (GA), with the main objectives of minimizing the loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and cost of energy (COE). Three different case scenarios were configured, using a diesel generator (DG), wind/PV/DG/battery, and wind/PV/battery. Various combinations of these case scenarios were compared to determine which option was the most economically viable. In order to determine the case scenario with the lowest LPSP and COE, the operations and maintenance costs of the three cases were calculated. Using only DG for case one, the operations and maintenance cost amounted to USD 1050,348.12/year. The operation and maintenance cost for case two, which included wind/PV/DG/battery, was found to be USD 561,674.06/year. The operations and maintenance cost for case three, which included wind/PV/battery, was found to be USD 36,000/year. In standalone microgrids, however, the use of renewable energy sources is not reliable due to the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. Consequently, the simulation results show that the wind/PV/DG/battery-based HRES is the most cost-effective, reliable, and sustainable for the specific location in comparison to the current traditional method of electricity generation. Since there is abundant solar radiation with substantial wind speeds across the country, this HRES can be applied in most rural and remote areas in place of the current diesel generators (DGs) that are widely deployed in the country.</jats:p>"

The corrosion products, formed on the surface of the steel corrosion probes, have been analysed with X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). It has been found, that in condition of low water flow rate (0.15 m/s) and in the absence of water supply the corrosion rate is high (0.29 mm/year) due to low blocking abilities of the surface deposits. Amorphous Fe(OH)3 is the main corrosion product to be detected on the surface. The increase in water flow rate above 0.15 m/s and water supply rate above 30 % of system volume per hour leads to the 1.6 times corrosion rate reduction (to 0.18 mm/year) due to the formation of dense surface layer of calcium carbonate and iron oxyhydroxides.

The fuzzy best-worst approach was then used to rank the risk categories and risk factors. Manufacturing and design risks have the highest significance in HFSC management, and risks in the financial and sustainability categories the lowest. The paper contributes significantly by delivering an extensive inventory of HFSC management risks and their relative rankings that can serve as a foundation for the development of a large number of theoretical studies.</jats:p>",

The paper presents a numerical example of a solution to the transportation problem using: the northwest corner, the least cost in the matrix, the row minimum, and Vogel’s Approximation Methods (VAM). The joint use of mathematical programming and optimization was applicable to real conditions. The transport was carried out with medium load trucks. Both suppliers and recipients of materials were located geographically within the territory of the Republic of Poland. The presented model was supported by a numerical example with interpretation and visualization of the obtained results.

Forecasting in this paper is performed in a make-to-order supply chain using real data, where the logistics company does not know the internal production data of manufacturers. Forecasting was performed in several steps using machine-learning methods such as linear regression and logistic regression. The last step checks if the order will come in the next delivery week or not. Forecasting is evaluated after each shipment delivery to check the possibility of delaying the current arriving orders for a certain customer until the next week or making the delivery to the customer immediately. The results showed reasonable accuracy expressed in different ways, and one of them depends on a type I error with an average value of 0.07. This is the first paper that performs dynamic forecasting for the purpose of shipment temporal consolidation optimization in the consolidation center.</jats:p>"

This paper provides a simple analytical framework through which to view the contours of the vaccine value chain. It then creates a new database that maps the COVID‐19 vaccines of Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax and CureVac to the product‐ and location‐specific manufacturing supply chains that emerged in 2020 and 2021. It describes the choppy process through which dozens of other companies at nearly 100 geographically distributed facilities came together to scale up global manufacturing. The paper catalogues major pandemic policy initiatives – such as the United States' Operation Warp Speed – that are likely to have affected the timing and formation of those vaccine supply chains. Given the data, a final section identifies further questions for researchers and policymakers.</jats:p>",

There are some indirect causes like lead time, the number of echelons, and some direct causes of bullwhip effect such as rationing or price variation. Due to capacity constraints, retailers are forced to experience rationing of their demands. Fear of rationing usually gives rise to manipulable demand and hence increases the bullwhip effect. Moreover, if the retailer’s demand is price sensitive then it will cause price variation. The offerings of premium payment by retailers due to unfulfilled demand lure the supplier to extend his existing capacity and to allocate them more supply. In this paper, an attempt has been made to mitigate the impact of the bullwhip effect using a premium payment scheme. A technique has been coined that will help in reducing the bullwhip effect. The increased value of the supply chain on using a premium payment scheme is proof of the reduction of the bullwhip effect. Results are validated through numerical analysis.</p>",

In this work we ask: What types of supply site offer medicinal plants in the pluricultural city of San Salvador de Jujuy? What are the most important medicinal plants commercialized in the city? How do species composition and their cultural importance vary between biocultural suppliers? The research followed an ethnobotanical approach and techniques, particularly participant observation, semi-structured and structured interviews with salespersons, and prior informed consent. We also identified plant material, considering the 10 plants most cited by the participants as having most commercial importance. Three types of medicinal plant supply site were identified: pharmacies, herbal stores and traditional informal sales stalls (informal vendors). Eighty-two medicinal species and two algal species were the most sold in this city. Total species richness differed between different types of biocultural supply site, herbal stores selling the highest richness (54 species), followed by informal vendors (43 species) and finally, pharmacies (36 species). The similarity index for the three sites revealed that herbal stores and informal vendors shared the highest number of species (46%). Through a GLM (generalized lineal model) we found that the supply sites most likely to sell native plants were the informal vendors. Despite the influence of global patterns of use, the supply sites varied in their intrinsic characteristics and offered different resources. Traditional informal vendors are fundamental to the Jujuy population for the supply of unique native species. This phenomenon has marked consequences for public health, highlighting the essential biocultural role played by this supply point in maintaining the traditional Andean health system.</jats:p>"

This effect was highly disruptive for the food industry where a number of businesses closed down whilst a significant number of businesses had gone bankrupted. Considering this stance, this study explored the impact of COVID--19 on the supply chain of the food industry which was also the objective of this study. The research opted for interpretivism paradigm and qualitative research approach, following which literary analysis of the previous studies conducted within this domain was compared and analyzed. Findings of the study identified that COVID-19 directly hindered the food industry's supply chain in the times of seasonal employment where most of the migrant workers were unavailable due to sickness, lockdown restrictions, or any sort of travel restrictions. Besides that, streamlining and managing the flow of food ensuring that all the stages of the supply chain in the food industry are completed effectively was identified as another key challenge. Likewise, economic shrinkage and reallocation of resources paralyzed the economy of many countries and, hence, hindered governmental institutions' capacity to provide financial incentives to the companies. In addition, logistical efficiency was also affected due to prolonged lockdown, devastating the fine-tuned schedule and causing disruption in the food supply chain. Therefore, many foodproducing companies either closed their operations or had to reduce their production or operational capacity, which further resulted in increased demand, less supply, and less sales or profitability of the food businesses. it is recommended for the food businesses to consider restructuring their business models specifically related to progressive investment in the domain of supply chain. Companies need to foster collaboration among different actors or stakeholders of supply chain including an integration of raw material supply, manufacturing of food products and a streamlined chain of their supply in the market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Worldwide, dairy cows of the type of high-producing cattle (HPC) suffer from health and fertility problems at a young age and therefore lose productivity after an average of only three lactations. It is still contentious whether these problems are primarily due to genetics, management, feeding or other factors. Vascularization plays a fundamental role in the cyclic processes of reproductive organs, as well as in the regeneration of tissues. In a previous study, HPC were shown to have a greater ovarian corpus luteum vascularization compared to dual-purpose breeds. We hypothesize that this activated angiogenesis could likely lead to an early exhaustion of HPC′s regenerative capacity and thus to premature reproductive senescence. The objective of this study was to investigate if a HPC breed (Holstein-Friesian, HF) exhibits higher ovarian angiogenesis than a dual-purpose breed (Polish Red cow, PR) and if this is related to early ovarian aging and finally reproductive failure. For this purpose, we assessed the degree of vascularization by means of ovarian blood vessel characterization using light microscopy. As indicators for aging, we measured ovarian mitochondrial size and telomere length in peripheral leukocytes. We report in this study that in both breeds the distance between capillaries became smaller with increasing age and that the mean telomere length decreased with increasing age. The only difference between the two breeds was that PR developed larger capillaries than HF. Neither a relationship between telomere length, nor the morphology of the mitochondrial apparatus and nor angiogenesis in HF was proven. Although the data trends indicated that the proportion of shortened telomeres in HF was higher than in the PR, no significant difference between the two breeds was detected.</jats:p>"

Experiences from other regions and countries show that demand- and supply-side factors often affect the success of such policies although this is unknown in this context. The study aimed to assess demand- and supply-side factors affecting the utilisation and provision of services during pregnancy under the policy. MethodsA convergent parallel mixed methods study was undertaken, collecting quantitative and qualitative data. The study was carried out in the Kassena-Nankana East Municipality in Ghana. Questionnaire were used to collect data from women (n=406) who utilised services during pregnancy. Focus group discussions with women (n=10) and in-depth interviews with midwives and nurses (n=25) were also conducted. Quantitative data were analysed and presented using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded using themes and sub-themes. ResultsBoth demand- and supply-side factors impacted the use and provision of services. Distance and time to facilities challenged the use of services. Supply-side factors such as laboratory services, equipment, drugs and supplies were not adequately available. Antenatal, childbirth and postnatal services were carried out together in the same rooms at the community-based health planning and services (CHPS) compounds. Emergency transport was also unavailable for referral of emergencies. ConclusionDemand- and supply-side factors were reported to impede the use and provision of services. Government and stakeholders should prioritise building as well as expanding the infrastructure of CHPS compounds. Emergency transport for women should also be provided. These together may contribute to improving the use and provision of services, leading to a reduction in maternal deaths and achievement of universal health coverage.</jats:p>"

The palm oil industry is currently growing rapidly in line with the demand for large quantities of CPO and Kernal and their derivatives. In its operation, it is always faced with various risks, from the field to the processing plant. These risks will cause losses to the factory, especially in the form of financial. From the results of field observations obtained 13 kinds of supply chain risks, namely damaged trucks, FFB not up to standard, damaged FFB, insufficient FFB, network error, FFB damaged in the sorting field, boiling problems, problematic polisyndrom, abnormal steem, abnormal processes. /stops, viber cyclone plugs and leaks pipe. Therefore, it is necessary to identify, measure and manage risks to reduce losses caused by supply chain risks. The method used in this study is the MAFMA (Multi Attribute Failure Mode Analysis) method. The MAFMA method is a development of the FMEA method. The results showed that the risk level value contained 4 critical risks on the part of the factory, namely FFB less with a risk level value of 0.096, FFB not according to standards with a risk level value of 0.085, network error with a risk level value of 0.083 and the process running abnormally. /stop with a risk level of 0.073. These 4 critical risks are the priority to be handled. The handling carried out is planning for the right FFB procurement, providing guidance on the harvesting process, stabilizing the network by providing copper rods and planning machine scheduling.</jats:p>"

A large amount of work has been done to test the purities of KUKL and KVWSIP water supplies (chemically), but even their optical properties have not been studied. This method has no hazardous side effects or requires chemical method testing. In comparing the optical properties, the authors recommended that the public take KVWSIP water for good health and wealth rather than KUKL if they have an option.This is because KUKL is more contaminated and has more total dissolved solids (TDS) particles, while KVWSIP has fewer TDS particles. Therefore, if people take KVWSIP water in their daily life, they obtain relief from different types of water-related diseases.</jats:p>",

Evidence suggests that this extrahepatic supply most commonly originates from a right intercostal artery (70–83%) followed by left intercostal, omental and right renal arteries. Thus a comprehensive knowledge of variations in standard vascular anatomy and cognisance of factors influencing or predicting extrahepatic blood supply in HCC is instrumental in ensuring the success of surgical and interventional procedures. We present the unusual case of a 66-year-old male with HCC in Segment I of the liver with aberrant blood supply from the right renal artery in the absence of any risk factors for extrahepatic circulation. He successfully underwent transarterial chemoembolization. There was no evidence of residual disease on repeat imaging.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Halal logo is designed to protect consumers from fraud and mislabelling. However, over the years, there has been a controversy surrounding the use of a false halal logo to attract Muslim consumers to buy certain goods. The act of unethical business practice to attract consumers to buy their goods have caused some misunderstanding among consumers regarding the halal status of such goods. Therefore, the law is the most important mechanism in protecting the rights and interests of consumers to claim compensation if their rights have been violated. Under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 1999, it puts a responsibility on suppliers and manufacturers to ensure that the goods supplied are the same as specified. However, the question arises as to the extent to which consumers have the right of redress under the CPA 1999 in the issue of supplying false halal logo goods. By using the content analysis method, this article aims to analyze the scope and provisions of the CPA 1999 that govern matters relating to the supply of goods. The discussion of this article reveals that Part VI and VII of the CPA 1999 contains several loopholes that must be addressed in order to provide better rights of redress to consumers on the issue of supplying false halal logo goods.</jats:p>"

This study assessed the impact of various N doses entirely applied by repeated foliar sprayings on wheat growth, yield and quality, in comparison with conventional soil fertilization management with a recommended dose of 160 kg N ha−1 as ammonium nitrate (C-M). Doses of 96, 104 and 120 kg N ha−1 as both UAN (urea-ammonium-nitrate) and urea applied by foliar spraying were evaluated in a 2-year field trial in Northern Italy in a silty loam soil with 1.7% organic matter. Here, it was demonstrated that the canopy greenness was similar in all treatments, with slight grain yield increases by the lowest foliar N dose vs. C-M. The higher N foliar doses mainly improved the grain protein content and both high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS, LMW-GS), particularly with urea. It is concluded that in our fertile soil, managing N fertilization exclusively through foliar spraying is feasible without compromising grain yield and ameliorating quality at the same time. Improved nutrient use efficiency and beneficial environmental effects are also expected by reducing the nitrogen load on the agricultural fields by 25–40%.</jats:p>"

This exploratory study scrutinises trust as perceived by SME managers in the supply chain of logistics and procurement in New Zealand. It uses the repertory grid analysis and is based on two interviews conducted through the repertory grid technique, a semi-structured method. Although different in every company and country, trust plays a major role during the selection of suppliers. Factors such as reliability and value are regarded as the most important ones for choosing the right supplier in the case of ContainerCo. </jats:p>",

These challenges forced the industrial companies to look for lean practices and tools to develop their products leading to create a lean supply chain that eliminates the waste of time, the cost, and inventory along with the supply chain. The research problem was formulated by introducing several questions on the impact of developing the practices and tools of the lean product for the lean supply chain, whereas the research hypotheses were subjected to several tests to ensure their validity. Moreover, a questionnaire included (48) questions was used as a main tool of collecting the necessary data about the sample in order to achieve the objectives of the research. The Light Industries Company was chosen as a sample of applying the research, and the statistical program (STATA- MP V15.1) was used to analyze the data. One of the important results which the research was concluded is that when the dimensions of the variable of developing the lean product (the value stream mapping and set-based concurrent engineering, the visual management and quality improvement, the computer-aided design and modular design) are separated and gathered again, they will have a significant effect on the lean supply chain's variable (the suppliers and procurement, the over production and warehousing, the transportation and customer).</jats:p>",

These processes generate fertilizers, which may differ in composition and N2O release potential. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of processing-related changes in digestate composition on soil-derived N2O emissions after application to soil. For that purpose, N2O emissions within the first 7 weeks after fertilization with two raw and eight processed digestates (derived from solid–liquid separation, drying and pelletizing of separated solid, and vacuum evaporation of separated liquid) were measured in the field in 2015 and 2016. Additionally, an incubation experiment was run for 51 days to further investigate the effect of subsequent solid and liquid processing on soil-derived N2O release. The results showed that, only in 2016, the separation of digestate into solid and liquid fractions led to a decrease in N2O emissions in the following order: raw digestate &gt; separated liquid &gt; separated solid. N removal during subsequent processing of separated solid and liquid did not significantly influence the N2O emissions after fertilization. In contrast, the concentrated application of the final products led to contradictory results. Within the solid processing chain, utilization of pellets considerably increased the N2O emissions by factors of 2.7 (field, 2015), 3.5 (field, 2016), and 7.3 (incubation) compared to separated solid. Fertilization with N-rich ammonium sulfate solution led to the lowest emissions within the liquid processing chain. It can be concluded that the input of less recalcitrant organic C into the soil plays a greater role in N2O release after fertilization than the input of ammoniacal N. Digestate processing did not generally reduce emissions but apparently has the potential to mitigate N2O emissions substantially if managed properly.</jats:p>"

There is a large variability regarding nutritional supply during TH treatment in asphyxiated newborns. We performed a retrospective multicentre study in four level I (highest level of care in Germany) NICUs, including 135 asphyxiated term newborns undergoing TH. We analyzed enteral and parenteral nutritional supply during and after TH. We correlated nutritional supply with risk factors for encephalopathy, pH, Sarnat score, mechanical ventilation, seizures, and sedation. A total of 120 of 135 neonates received enteral nutritional supply within the first 24 h, and the majority of children were fully enterally fed within the first 10 days. The grade of encephalopathy and mechanical ventilation had a significant influence on the amount of enteral fluids (p = 0.01), whereas the pH and appearance of seizures did not affect the amount of nutritional supply significantly. Furthermore, we did not observe any correlation between enteral intake and abdominal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis. We observed a large variability of feeding regimes in the four participating NICUs. Early enteral feeding among newborns undergoing TH was performed in each NICU and was well tolerated without increased rates of complications.</jats:p>"

In accordance with this methodology, the subjects of the Russian education system are distinguished that perform the following functions: “calculator” (Ministry of Education and Science, etc.), “source of energy” (institutions of preschool, secondary and additional education), “engine” (institutions of secondary specialized and higher education), “transmission” (organizations for the employment of specialists in the field of logistics), “working body” (enterprises and organizations in which logistics specialists work).Quantitative dependencies and models are proposed for assessing the effectiveness of the Russian system of personnel training in the field of logistics and supply chain management. The performance of each element of the personnel training system has been determined. It is stated that this system does not fully meet the needs of the market and the expectations of students, and also indirectly inhibits the transition from competition between individual manufacturers to competition in supply chains, thereby holding back the development of the Russian economy.</jats:p>"

People are tricked into working under onerous conditions, and unable to leave or return home due to physical, psychological or financial coercion, and many of these trafficking victims produce goods for United States (US) and other multinational corporations that profit by relying on the lower wages earned by workers in their global supply chains. Well-developed legal standards prohibit these practices, and governments, intergovernmental organizations, business associations and non-governmental organizations have developed mechanisms to prevent, detect and provide redress to victims. Some businesses lead or comply with the standards and enforcement mechanisms, but too many do not. US law offers a powerful but under-utilized tool to address trafficking: the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), which imposes civil liability on those who ‘knew or should have known’ about forced labour or human trafficking in their corporate ventures. Unfortunately, courts have ignored or misinterpreted this standard, at times confusing civil and criminal provisions of the statute. Correct and vigorous legal enforcement is key to addressing the accountability gap between the well-developed standards and the continuing use of forced labour and human trafficking. This article is the first to demonstrate that, with regard to the TVPRA standard, corporations have long been on notice of both the obligation to effectively monitor labour conditions and the mechanisms that would accomplish that task. US courts must enforce the ‘knew or should have known’ standard to protect workers – the most vulnerable people in the supply chain – and to prevent an unfair competitive advantage over companies that have established compliance programmes that actually prevent and punish human trafficking and forced labour.</jats:p>",

While most developed countries are replacing some macrogrids with renewable energy based microgrids, developing countries like Nigeria still maintain the status quo. This study intends to contribute to knowledge in the management of climate change and power supply in Nigeria through the adoption of microgrids as power supply strategy. In the study, data collected from a detached energy consuming community in Nigeria was used in a simulation using HOMER software for five different scenarios of energy resources combination, based on environmental impact and energy cost criteria. Results indicate that microgrids combining solar photovoltaic (SPV) and grid connection with battery energy storage (BES) are best in on-grid detached communities while microgrids combining diesel generators and SPV with BESare good for off-grid communities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The principle is that the output impedance is designed to be passive, and the system is sufficiently stable for any filter impedances. The new design principle for the proposed stabilization method consists of four steps. First, the state feedback (FB) control gains with a mitigated integral compensator are designed to possess a good response characteristic according to the optimal control. The designed characteristic of the output impedance may not be passive at a lower frequency band due to an essential characteristic of an integral compensator. Second, the integral characteristic is modified and a resistive characteristic is added to the band by a new FF control design based on a fitting method to make the total characteristic passive and to ensure stability. Third, the correction coefficients are tuned to eliminate a deviation between the measured and reference output voltage values at transient operations. Finally, the system passivity is re‐checked, and a resistive characteristic is re‐added using the FF control design if a nonpassive band exists. The effectiveness of the proposed method to render the system passive and stable is investigated and validated using simulated and experimental results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several optimization models, which consider economic and environmental perspectives, have been developed recently to support the sustainable biomass-to-biofuel supply chain (BBSC) design. All of the economic-environmental optimization models rely on solving long-term planning problems with a conventional hierarchical approach, where tactical decisions are made based on the optimal strategic decisions from the strategic-level model, despite it arousing non-optimal solutions. Moreover, almost all of them have used non-monetary-based environmental indicators, which result in difficulties with clarity when comparing with economic objectives. Therefore, in this work, an effort is made to develop a more reliable planning strategy that offers optimal strategic and tactical decisions simultaneously and maximizes the economic and environmental benefits. Furthermore, the environmental performance of the BBSC has been assessed in terms of monetary value by adopting an ecocost approach after performing an LCA on the system. The integrated model is applied in the real biofuel sector of Ethiopia to optimize the country’s bioethanol and biodiesel supply chain over a 20-year horizon. Despite the abrupt rise in the model size, with it being a real countrywide case with many variables and large quantities of data, an alternative semi-heuristic method that offers a feasible solution to the multi-objective problem is provided.</jats:p>"

In this case, storage batteries are one of the most important system components. The significance of storage batteries is conditioned by a stabilizing effect obtained at generation from RES that are defined by stochastic oscillating functions. However, it is worth noting that storage batteries also improve the cost-effectiveness of such systems by reducing consumption of diesel fuel. This is particularly noticeable at night when load is the least and the use of diesel generators is inefficient. One of the most important points is the determination of potential internal processes of aging and breakdowns that occur in storage batteries during operation. The use of a tested model for categorization of storage batteries according to the operating conditions makes it possible to take account of these factors at the stage of a system design. The paper presents a detailed analysis of decentralized power supply system Verkhnyaya Amga. The focus is made on the cost-effectiveness of a combined use of RES with storage batteries, annual saving of diesel fuel, operating parameters. The research reveals hidden problems that represent various uncertainties that affect greatly the economic and operation parameters of the system.</jats:p>",

However, energy demand is increasing day by day in many countries due to rapid growth of the population and most of their work being reliant on electronic devices. This problem has highlighted the significance of effectively matching power demand with supply for optimal energy management. To resolve this issue, we present an intelligent deep learning framework that integrates Atrous Convolutional Layers (ACL) with Residual Gated Recurrent Units (RGRU) to establish balance between the demand and supply. Moreover, it accurately predicts short-term energy and delivers a systematic method of communication between consumers and energy distributors as well. To cope with the varying nature of electricity data, first data acquisition step is performed where data are collected from various sources such as smart meters and solar plants. In the second step a pre-processing method is applied on raw data to normalize and clean the data. Next, the refined data are passed to ACL for spatial feature extraction. Finally, a sequential learning model RGRU is used that learns from complicated patterns for the final output. The proposed model obtains the smallest values of Mean Square Error (MSE) including 0.1753, 0.0001, 0.0177 over IHEPC, KCB, and Solar datasets, respectively, which manifests better performance as compared to existing approaches.</jats:p>"

As a case study, we propose a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for a hospital in the south-east of England. Electrical consumption data were gathered from five wards in the hospital for a period of one year. PV-battery-grid system architecture was selected to ensure practical execution through the installation of PV arrays on the roof of the facility. Selection of the optimal system was conducted through a novel methodology combining multi-objective optimisation and data forecasting. The optimisation was conducted using a genetic algorithm with two objectives (1) minimisation of the levelised cost of energy and (2) CO2 emissions. Advanced data forecasting was used to forecast grid emissions and other cost parameters at two year intervals (2023 and 2025). Several optimisation simulations were carried out using the actual and forecasted parameters to improve decision making. The results show that incorporating forecasted parameters into the optimisation allows to identify the subset of optimal solutions that will become sub-optimal in the future and, therefore, should be avoided. Finally, a framework for choosing the most suitable subset of optimal solutions was presented.</jats:p>"

In this analysis, a two-dimensional sand tank illustrates the sand column's role in overcoming seawater intrusion. Besides using dyes, the sand tank is also fitted with sensors to observe the length of seawater penetration. Furthermore, the simulation using SEAWAT numerical modeling is used as a reference in this analysis. The criteria analyzed were the number of sand columns, the reservoir water level, and the isochlors concentration. The results revealed a reasonably close match between physical and computational modeling. It was also found that the more sand columns and the higher the reservoir water level, resulted in the decrease of seawater penetration length that occurred. Physical and computational modeling findings indicated that the optimal results are derived using three sand columns with an RMSE value of 0.76. The seawater infiltration length decreased to 84.72% relative to sand column-free conditions at a reservoir water level of 15.0 cm.</jats:p>",

Evidence suggests that parental supply of alcohol is a risk factor for drinking later in life. However, the vast majority of previous studies have been conducted in North America or Western Europe. Czechia has amongst the highest alcohol consumption per capita, including among adolescents. Providing own children with sips of alcohol is widely perceived as a good way to introduce them to safe drinking. This study examined whether parental supply of alcohol would predict alcohol use among adolescents in an Eastern European alcohol-permissive context.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We used a subsample of 2,570 adolescents from ELSPAC, a longitudinal study of Czech mothers and their children. The outcome was adolescent alcohol use at age 15, reported by adolescents and their pediatricians. Different sources of alcohol (parents, family member, friend, own supply, or other sources) at age 11 were used as longitudinal predictors.

Symmetrical anatomy of the prostatic arteries on both sides was revealed in 14.3% (24) patients, the remaining 85.7% (144) patients showed asymmetry on both sides. The absence of prostatic arteries anastomoses was detected in 75.5% (254) of the pelvic sides, and in 24.4% (82) of the pelvic sides, anastomoses were detected.

Timely transport of VL samples from health facilities to the laboratory for testing is often problematic in Turkana County, Kenya, and transportation barriers cause delays that can negatively impact the health of ART patients. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), or drones, are being promoted as a potential, novel way to reduce transportation times for laboratory samples and medical commodities.

This study assessed the willingness of Haitians to invest in rainwater infrastructure (RWI). A questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions was used for this purpose. For closed-ended questions, ‘0’ and ‘1’ were used for negative and positive answers, respectively. Other numbers were used to encode the open-ended questions. The two-tailed Z-test was used to compare two proportions, where a result was statistically significant when the p-value was less than 0.05. Of 362 rainwater users, 81.2% used it for washing, bathing, cooking, flushing, and drinking. Approximately 73.4% of households with 1–3 people, compared with 84.0% of families with 4–6 people, used rainwater. Of all the respondents, 82.3% would invest in RWI if the government agreed to finance up to 50.0% of the project. More than 73.0% of respondents in each locality would invest in rainwater in RWI under the conditions previously mentioned. It is concluded that the implementation of RWI and decentralization of water systems would be welcomed by the rainwater users in Haiti, but the unwillingness of the Haitian government could be the main barrier to such a transition.</jats:p>",

The product provides the basic need for human, and its safety and stability are exposed to the constant attention of everyone. With the progress of human science and technology, more and more resources can be extracted from nature, and agricultural products nowadays are not be limited to food, but also be used as raw materials for fuel or other products. Meanwhile, trade between the two regions is often due to a comparative advantage in the production of a product, such as better technology, easier access to raw materials and the like (Dollar &amp; Kraay, 2004). Therefore, agricultural product trade is a very important topic. This study believes that supply chains are an effective way to increase the value of agricultural product trade, for example effectively collaborating makes agricultural products available to end-consumers as quickly as possible. Supply chain management aims to satisfy consumer demands and improve the competitiveness (Dias &amp; Ierapetritou, 2017) in various industries (Oelze et al., 2018). However, there is still blank between agricultural product trade and supply chain academically, figuring out what is agricultural product trade supply chain and what is related to this chain would be essential.</jats:p>",

That makes it possible to increase the degree of freedom for each control subsystem and thereby improve the efficiency of finding the optimal mode of operation of the entire cybernetic system.\nA conceptual model of the dual buffering system was built, the stabilization of the quantitative parameter at the output of the buffering system was substantiated through the development of an adaptation mechanism, and simulation modeling of the synthesized system was carried out.\nThe study shows that the use of buffering systems could improve the quality of energy utilization and reduce the wear of technological mechanisms by 14 % in general</jats:p>"

It is a plan of action aimed at achieving global sustainable development in economic, social and environmental areas, which ensures that no UN member state is left behind. The 17 sustainable development goals on the 2030 Agenda can be used as benchmarks for the coordinated development of UN member states. Aviation safety is an important component of the concept of general national security, the system of personal security, ecological and public safety and transport safety from external and internal threats. Maintaining an acceptable level of national aviation safety is a priority for the industry. The aviation transport is a part of the transport complex of Ukraine, which is an important component in the structure of the national economy and a link between all components of economic security to ensure the basic conditions of life and development of the state and society.  The assessment of economic, technological, safety, social and ecological hazards is an integral part of all the logical blocks of the structural and functional scheme of strategic management of aviation safety in terms of sustainable development of the national economy. According to the concept of national aviation risk management developed by the authors, risk can be assessed as a mutual combination of hazarad, vulnerability and consequences. The application of this concept in relation to the air transport of Ukraine allowed to identify the main hazards, vulnerabilities, consequences and risks. The next step in the implementation of the concept is to develop institutional measures to neutralize threats in the field of aviation safety, which is actually a set of risk reduction measures for further sustainable development of the national economy. This article summarizes the hazards, vulnerabilities, consequences, risks, and institutional arrangements for strategic aviation safety management. Among the priority measures are: harmonization of national regulation of air transport with the requirements of global and regional levels, development of mechanisms for commercial protection of domestic air transport enterprises in the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of strategic scenarios for sustainable development of air transport in Ukraine until 2030. The implementation of the proposed institutional measures will ensure an appropriate level of safety, efficiency and regularity of the national air transport of Ukraine.</jats:p>"

To protect their firms, managers often must decide whether or not to take proactive measures. Protection motivation theory suggests that individuals' intention to respond to a threat proactively results from their cognitive appraisal (situational interpretation) processes. These processes evaluate the characteristics of potential coping responses (e.g., its effectiveness in averting the threat) and the threat itself (e.g., its severity). Building on this framework, this study presents an analysis of what drives managers to, or deters them from, proactively responding to the threat of a disruption. The results from a discrete choice experiment suggest that decision makers have a strong<jats:italic>subconscious</jats:italic>focus on cost‐related aspects of a specific proactive action, all the while<jats:italic>consciously</jats:italic>prioritizing the efficacy (effectiveness) of the action over its costs. Moreover, decision makers' perceptions of the relative importance of proactive action attributes deviate considerably from their actual choice behavior. This study investigates additional behavioral aspects of supply chain risk management such as a proactive personality, risk attitude, control appraisal, and experience, many of which have significant effects on the relative importance of certain proactive action attributes. The improved understanding has three relevant messages for managerial practice, which are related to the perception–action gap, the importance of self‐assessment and self‐awareness, and training.</jats:p>",

Hundreds of papers in our field conceptualize responsiveness and related concepts in disconnected ways ignoring this potentially valuable foundation for investigating supply chain strategic and logistical adjustments. Although these extant studies highlight many important issues related to responsiveness, their conceptualizations and nomological networks vary considerably. This diffuse focus seriously hinders efforts to create an overarching theoretical perspective in a dynamic field without one. The result is a masking of promising research directions that could help define the discipline. Drawing from the organizational economics, logistics, and supply chain management literatures, we begin the argument that responsiveness—realized through logistics and supply chain management—has strong potential as our defined foundational perspective. All roads to superior performance depend upon supply chain responsiveness to the environment, supply chain members, stakeholders, and the consumer. Our proposed Responsiveness View of supply chain management supports the exploration of how supply chains compete successfully amidst disruption and change, helping to define a young, theoretically distinct, research domain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Restoration of native oyster (<jats:italic>Crassostrea virginica</jats:italic>) populations in Chesapeake Bay shows great promise after three decades of failed attempts. Population models used to inform oyster restoration had integrated reef habitat quality, demonstrating that reef height determines oyster population persistence and resilience. Larval recruitment drives population dynamics of marine species, yet its impact with reef height and sediment deposition upon reef restoration is unknown. To assess the influence of reef height, sediment deposition and larval supply, we adapted a single-stage population model to incorporate stage structure using a system of four differential equations modeling change in juvenile density (J), and changes in volume of adults (A), oyster shell reef (R), and sediment (S) on an oyster reef. The JARS model was parameterized with empirical data from field experiments. Larval supply included larvae from the natal population and from outside populations. The stage-structured model possessed multiple non-negative equilibria (i.e., alternative stable states). Different initial conditions (e.g., oyster shell reef height) resulted in different final states. The main novel findings were that the critical reef height for population persistence and resilience was jointly dependent on sediment input and larval supply. A critical minimum larval supply was necessary for a reef to persist, even when initial sediment deposition was zero. As larval supply increased, the initial reef height needed for reef persistence was lowered, and oyster reef resilience was enhanced. A restoration oyster reef with higher larval influx could recover from more severe disturbances than a reef with lower larval influx. To prevent local extinction and assure a positive population state, higher levels of larval supply were required at greater sediment concentrations to overcome the negative effects of sediment accumulation on the reef. In addition, reef persistence was negatively related to sediment deposited on a reef prior to larval settlement and recruitment, implying that restoration reefs should be constructed immediately before settlement and recruitment to minimize sediment accumulation on a reef before settlement. These findings are valuable in oyster reef restoration because they can guide reef construction relative to larval supply and sediment deposition on a reef to yield effective and cost-efficient restoration strategies.</jats:p>"

The study aims to test the robustness of the relationships among the concepts of IT analytic capability, demand chain strategy, and firm performance besides investigating the interaction effects of product life cycle (PLC) management on the IT-strategy relationship. Based on the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the research paradigm of “capability-strategy-performance,” 300 Chinese fashion firms were surveyed to collect data by Demand Chain Research Institute of Shanghai University. In order to test the hypothetical relationship in the conceptual model, valid questionnaires from 185 firms were collected in this study, and the effective rate reached 61.7%. Findings suggest that IT analytic capability associates positively with demand chain strategy, and PLC plays a moderation role between IT analytic capability and demand chain strategy. The findings further support the link between demand chain strategy and better firm performance. This study contributes to existing information systems and operation management literature by the above effects in the retail context. Overall, these results reflect recent business and transformation changes from supply chain strategy to demand chain strategy for the Chinese fashion industry.</p>",

This research focuses on the role of strategic and operational information sharing between buyers and suppliers in promoting ambidextrous learning.  Based on a survey of supply chain managers in U.S. manufacturing firms, the findings indicate that sharing operational information promotes exploitative performance, while sharing strategic information promotes exploratory performance. Both exploitative and exploratory performance improvements positively relate to the buyer’s financial performance, but these relationships are moderated by the buyer’s product innovation strategy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Road transport is one of the most important elements of the functioning of a modern city. Maneuverability, mobility, speed of delivery of goods and other criteria have provided him with a special and leading place in urban logistics. However, along with the benefits of a developed transport network for society, its progress is accompanied by negative consequences for the environment and the population of the city. High rates of growth in the number of cars, especially in large cities, cause an increase in emissions of harmful products into the atmosphere, which, accordingly, negatively affects the health of the population. Consequently, the problem of environmental pollution in large cities from harmful emissions from vehicles requires an urgent solution. The increase in emissions of harmful substances is affected by an increase in the consumption of fuel materials due to a decrease in speed because of an increase in traffic density in the city. The frequency, duration, prevalence of congestion is increasing along with the urbanization of the population and the increase in the number of cars in cities. The dense development of the central historical districts of the city exacerbates the problem of unhindered passage of individual, public and freight vehicles. In addition, a decrease in the speed of city traffic affects the speed of delivery of goods, correspondence, etc., which negatively affects the speed of business processes, and ultimately worsens the level of logistics services for customers. The purpose of this study is to analyze the current situation in terms of the dynamics of the average speed of the city's traffic flow by hours of the day and to obtain a mathematical model of the dependence of the speed of movement on the consumption of fuel materials for various environmentally friendly means of urban delivery (car, motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrian courier). The research was carried out in two stages. At the first, the study of the dependence of the average speed of movement in the city on the time of day (for all means of city delivery) was carried out. At the second stage, the study of the dependence of the average consumption of fuel materials in the city (which, accordingly, is a function of the speed of movement) on the time of day for motorized urban delivery vehicles was done. In the course of the study, at each stage, an equation of the trend lines was obtained with a sufficient approximation accuracy. In conclusion, the study proposes an algorithm for determining the average speed and average amount of fuel consumption when delivering small consignments in an urban environment using four urban logistics means - a car, a motorcycle, a bicycle, and a pedestrian courier (with the possibility of using public transport). The proposed algorithm can be applied in any delivery conditions in the city.</jats:p>"

By late February 2020 evidence of community transmission in the United States was documented and soon it developed into a global pandemic. On March 11, 2020, the Mayo Clinic Arizona’s Microbiology Laboratory introduced a PCR test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even as testing demands exponentially increased, the hospital relied on timely results to assist in directing patient care. In order to provide timely results in the face of continuously emerging supply chain threats, we needed to increase our capacity for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing by reducing technologist time and reagent waste, without impacting turnaround time or other quality metrics such as repeat rate.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Methods/Case Report</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Technologist time was measured in hands-on time per specimen.

In this paper, possible biological and chemical weapons that can be used as intimidation, along with their threats, vulnerabilities, and inactivation methods, concerning water treatment processes in the municipality of Irbid, are studied. Irbid is the second largest city in terms of population in Jordan, after the capital city of Amman, and it is the nearest governorate to Syria borders that is considered a war zone. After conducting risk assessment that takes into consideration criticality, threats, and vulnerability, it appears that only one of the eight units, which is the Makhraba pumping station, along with the Bushra water tank, were identified as medium risk. The other units have treatment processes and proper precautions that are able to inactivate or prevent any possible contamination. A response plan should be set by developing a telemetry system with specific sensors that can detect any sudden and unacceptable threats to the water quality and that has the ability to shut down the concerned units automatically.</jats:p>"

In order to meet consumer’s demand, this company faced with an obstacle namely the distortion of information in supply chain. Distortion of information from downstream to upstream channel causes the difference between the product demand from consumer to PT XYZ and order of raw materials from PT XYZ to the supplier which is called the bullwhip effect. The objective of this research is to calculate the value of bullwhip effect as well as designing improvements to minimize the bullwhip effect. Based on the research results, obtained the index value of bullwhip effect on longitudinal pipe products is 1.06 and the index value of bullwhip effect on spiral pipe products is 0.80. The improvement design to minimize the phenomenon of bullwhip effect is to build an integrated information system for the customer, manufacturer, and supplier. The method that is used to improve the index value of bullwhip effect is Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain the order number of raw materials in order to approach the number of consumer’s demand. After applying the Monte Carlo simulation, obtained the index value of bullwhip effect on longitudinal pipe product is 1.01 and the index value of bullwhip effect on spiral pipe products is 1.00. It can be concluded that the use of Monte Carlo simulation had been optimizing the index value of bullwhip effect amounted to 4.71% for longitudinal pipe products and 25% for spiral pipe products.</jats:p>"

Creating the logistics system for the company is based on solving a set of problems, where the development of an algorithm for its design is key one. The article proposes an eventual model of the algorithm for designing the logistics system of a production enterprise. The design algorithm was developed taking into account the activities of oil and fat industry enterprises. Structurally, the algorithm consists of three phases - the formation of an information array for the design of the logistics system, the design of the logistics system, the installation of the logistics system project at the enterprise. The optimal number of stages was substantiated for each design phase. According to the design stages, a list of works that must be performed in the process of project development and installation was described. Information on the time spent on each job at the stages of design and installation of the logistics system was provided. It is indicated that the development and installation of a logistics system at a manufacturing plant can take three to four months. The obtained research results are important for the top management of enterprises. They will allow to be guided in productivity of process of designing and installation of logistic systems. In the future, this will provide an opportunity to correctly draw up a logistics plan and adjust the development strategy of the enterprise. The material presented in the article is useful for researchers in terms of further consideration of improving existing or developing new algorithms and techniques for designing logistics systems of industrial enterprises.</jats:p>"

To conduct the cluster analysis of the results of an expert survey for the development of priority directions of informatization of logistics processes in the medical supply system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nMaterials and methods. To achieve the goal of the study, the analysis of foreign and domestic scientific sources and the current legal documents was conducted. The methods of information retrieval, systematization, content analysis and the technology of hierarchical agglomeration cluster analysis were used.\nResults and discussion. By clustering the results of an expert survey on informatization of logistic processes in the medical supply system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine the distribution into seven clusters formed due to similar answers to the questionnaire was obtained. The number of clusters was determined by the dendrogram construction program without any researcher’s assumptions. The cluster analysis showed stable cluster groupings with a certain level of tightness of relations between features both within a cluster and among several clusters. This corresponds to the vision of the experts who outlined the problem on the research topic and determine the ways to solve it.\nConclusions. Based on the results of the analysis of the personal composition of each cluster, a sufficiently high level of consistency of the conclusions of experts of the medical supply system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine to the need for the introduction of informatization of logistics processes has been determined. Priority directions of informatization of logistic processes in the medical supply system of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been developed; a decisive place in these directions belongs to the implementation of a program for automatic accounting of medical supplies in the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The need for the introduction of modern software for decision-making support in the management of flow processes of providing medical supplies and equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as information analytical tools for the needs of the Medical Supply Directorate of the Medical Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine has been substantiated.</jats:p>"

Analysis of the accumulated meteorological data on wind and solar potentials in Kyiv shows that in an urban city it is possible to create a fully autonomous house, which will be supplied with electricity using solar and wind energy. Year-round monitoring of atmospheric parameters such as current values of wind speed and direction, relative humidity and barometric air pressure was carried out using a portable meteorological station TFA Nexus using appropriate Primus software, which allowed to collect and analyze measurement data. Data on insolation for the location of the energy-efficient house were obtained experimentally in 2019 using measurements with a pyranometer SR-U1. The developed system consists of a wind generator, solar modules, charge controllers, inverters and batteries. The calculation of electricity production by the solar station was performed in the PVSyst program according to meteorological data Meteonorm. At the same time, it should be noted that the energy contribution from photomodules is crucial for the power supply of an energy-efficient house. The proposed instrumental methods for determining the parameters of insolation provide an opportunity to assess its technically available potential for a given area, as well as to use the obtained data for the design of complex power supply systems using energy of wind and solar. The research results prove that in the conditions of the city of Kyiv there are potential opportunities for the creation of residential buildings with zero energy balance, in which, for the purpose of power supply, wind generators and solar modules can be used quite successfully.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Among other industries, health care has been dramatically hit by the scarcity of “medical products,” specifically for personal protective equipment (PPE-like), due to supply chain disruptions coupled with dramatically increased demand. We aimed to analyze how the scarcity of PPE-like during the COVID-19 pandemic has modified the behavior of decision-makers in the PPE-like supply chain at the hospital level, and to explore what changes could be implemented to cope with future PPE-like shortages.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We used an explorative approach based on semi-structured interviews with key informants in the Spanish health care industry.

Depending on the specific production techniques, transportation concepts, and application areas, hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) can be anything from part of the energy transition problem to part of the solution: Even more than battery-driven electric mobility, hydrogen is a polyvalent technology and can be used in very different contexts with specific positive or negative sustainability impacts. Thus, a detailed sustainability evaluation is crucial for decision making in the context of hydrogen technology and its diverse application fields. This article provides a comprehensive, structured literature review in the context of HSCs along the triple bottom line dimensions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability, analyzing a total of 288 research papers. As a result, we identify research gaps mostly regarding social sustainability and the supply chain stages of hydrogen distribution and usage. We suggest further research to concentrate on these gaps, thus strengthening our understanding of comprehensive sustainability evaluations for HSCs, especially in social sustainability evaluation. In addition, we provide an additional approach for discussion by adding literature review results from neighboring fields, highlighting the joint challenges and insights regarding sustainability evaluation.</jats:p>"

Specifically, the U.S. pork industry was hit with multiple, long-term plant closures and slow-downs due to labor safety issues and availability, resulting in a backlog reaction felt throughout the live production supply-chain. Impact and timing differed by region and required variable strategies to address them. While some plants in the Western United States weren’t impacted until the latter stages of the pandemic and thus were attempting to add valuable liveweight, other regions, including the Midwest and Southeastern United States were experiencing moderate to severe reductions in processing capacity that created an accumulation of heavy animals and placed additional feed and ingredient demands on the feed mills. The backlog also reduced available space &amp; disrupted the normal barn fill/empty cycles. While there was no way to prepare for these impacts, university &amp; industry groups attempted to fill the knowledge gap with management and nutritional tools to address the issues of excess inventory, decreasing feed capacity, and supply-chain disruptions. Numerous approaches were employed, including altered grading strategies, sow breeding target reductions, double/triple stocking situations, and feed, ingredient, and nutrient manipulation meant to slow down growth rate and feed intake. Nutritional strategies included the feeding of low energy ingredients as well as low protein/high methionine diets designed to reduce the growth rate of both heavy and light animals. While several of these strategies resulted in moderate success, some resulted in additional issues including stress-related vices, ulcers, increased mortality, and sub-optimal carcass characteristics. Ultimately, continuous planning, coordination, and communication between the plants, feed mills, nutritionists, and production groups enabled a return to normalcy, and while we hope to never experience a pandemic again, we are left with knowledge that will improve the resilience of the U.S. pork industry.</jats:p>",

The performance analyses of the proposed system have been executed for 0.25% concentration of CuO nanoparticles for collectors (N = 4), and fluid-flow rate 0.02 kg/s in 280 kg mass of basin fluid. The system's performance is compared with a previous system of N identical partly covered photovoltaic flat plate collectors connected in series (N-PVT-FPC-DS-HE) with an active double slope solar distiller unit and helically coiled heat exchanger. The thermal energy is 112,109.1 kWh, thermal exergy 312.07 kWh, and yield 3,615.05 kg annually. It is found that daily enhancement in thermal energy of the proposed system with CuO nanoparticles compared with the previous system with various nanofluids CuO, Al2O3, TiO2, and water is found to be 16.75%, 51.13%, 61.82%, and 80.67% more significant correspondingly. The enhancement in yield of the proposed system is obtained for CuO nanoparticles greater than the previous system with CuO by 11.19%, Al2O3 17.2%, TiO2 26.25%, and water 32.17%.

Adoption and effective use of supply chain management (SCM) practices in the FFA industry have become indispensable to achieve this. However, there is a gap in the fast fashion literature on the appropriate modeling of adoption and practice of SCM. In addressing this research gap, this study builds a comprehensive model of SCM adoption and practice by extracting relevant factors and variables from FFA manufacturing firms via qualitative field study. This study is one of the first to analyze SCM adoption from the diffusion of innovation theory perspective in the fashion industry. While existing literature does not clearly differentiate between SCM adoption and practice, this research underpins that the diffusion of SCM practices within FFA firms must go through stages of adoption and practice for successful wide-scale implementation.</p>",

The objective is to plan the sampling, minimising the number of tests to obtain an assessment of the quality of the consignment with the greatest precision. The types of destructive and non-destructive tests, the number of pieces to be inspected per batch and the acceptance criteria will be defined in this article. The quality control will be carried out at three levels, one to be performed by the manufacturer and the others by the buyer and the final client. The approval of the lots by the three parties ensures that the quality of the product is in accordance with the specifications. It will be achieved by dividing the order into different batches to treat them as independent units for acceptance or rejection. To avoid the loss of “see freight time” in case of rejection of any consignment, the customer’s quality control must be performed before shipping the batches.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper deals with the problem of improving the reliability of DC-DC power supplies with pulse-width modulation. The topicality of the work is related to the importance of power supply issues in modern electronics, since the quality of operation of consumer electrical appliances, including critical ones, directly depends on the serviceability of sources. The object of the study is feedback circuits aimed at stabilization of the parameters of power supply of consumers. Failures of the mentioned feedback circuits most often occurs due to the electronic components degradation under harsh operating conditions as well as under severe mechanical overloads. Such failures are dangerous for uncontrolled increase of power supply output voltage and output current. To avoid this, a new method of reserving voltage feedback signals is presented in the paper which is implemented on the basis of flyback supply topology. Feedback signals are formed from the optocoupler located on the load side and from the auxiliary winding of the power transformer, together forming two independent output voltage control circuits. Only one circuit performs stabilization at any given moment of time. If one of these circuits fails, the second one can simply replace it in its operation. The proposed method does not require any digital signal processing algorithms or microprocessor control modules and can be implemented on the basis of cheap, widely available analog chips that perform pulse-width control of the output voltage. As a result, the problem of sudden feedback loop failure is solved and the reliability of electrical equipment is increased. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by the results of computer simulation with the use of MatLab-Simulink environment. The obtained results can be used in design of fault-tolerant secondary power supplies that operate in harsh operating conditions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An algorithm for determining one of the indicators of reliability of the main element of the hydrogen storage and supply system – a gas generator has been developed. Such an algorithm is an integral part of the general algorithm to ensure the required level of fire safety of hydrogen storage and supply systems. The algorithm involves the implementation of several stages. At the first stage, using the expression for the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the gas generator, the functional dependences for its time constants are obtained. These functional dependencies include the values of the transmission coefficient and amplitude-frequency characteristics, which are determined at three a priori set values of frequency. In the second stage, the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the gas generator is determined. For this purpose, an array of data is used, which characterizes the reaction of the gas generator to the test effect in the form of an abrupt change in the area of its outlet. The amplitude-frequency characteristic of the gas generator is determined numerically, and its parameters are the increase in the pressure in the cavity of the gas generator and the time interval at which this increase is determined. The Kotelnikov-Nyquist-Shannon theorem is used to determine this time interval. At the third stage, the probability of the values of the time constants of the gas generator outside the tolerance zone is determined. For this purpose, models of gas generator time constants and their metrological characteristics are used. In the fourth stage, the probability of failure of the gas generator is determined, for which the information of the previous stage is used. At the last stage, the algorithm for determining the probability of failure of the gas generator of the storage and supply system of hydrogen, which is given in verbal form.</jats:p>",

This vulnerability framework has been previously applied to electric power systems and it employs a vulnerability prediction measure to quantify the amount of damage caused in terms of the physical damage measure. Different attack strategies and centrality measures were applied to four WDS benchmarks: the New York Tunnel, the Hanoi, the Modena, and the Balerma networks. It was determined that removing the most central element and recalculating the centrality for each stage are the most damaging attack strategies. Degree, eigenvector, and Katz centrality measures presented the best performance to predict the elements that are more relevant to the network and can have a larger impact on the water supply. It was demonstrated that the vulnerability framework can be applied to the WDS in the same way it was previously applied to electric power systems. Future work will be oriented to the design of the WDS using optimization techniques to minimize the vulnerability of the network under faults that can be generated by droughts and other extreme weather conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>AC steel arc furnaces are the most powerful units connected to the electrical grid, the operating mode of which is dynamic, asymmetrical and non-linear. That is why these furnaces cause the entire possible range of negative effects on the quality of electricity in the grid, in particular, fluctuations, asymmetry and non-sinusoidal voltage.Known proposals for improving the electromagnetic compatibility of electric arc furnaces are mainly focused on eliminating the consequences of their ne­gative impact on the power grid.The proposed approach and the corresponding technical solution are aimed at reducing the level of generation of a negative factor and at the same time reduce fluctuations, asymmetry and non-sinusoidal voltage. This result is obtained due to the fact that the proposed solution takes into account the peculiari­ties of the range of modes natural for arc furnaces. Optimal for such consumers is the use of a constant current power supply system I=const in the range of modes from operational short circuit to maximum load and the system U=const in the whole other range of modes. The implementation of such a system is carried out on the basis of a resonant converter «constant current – constant voltage».Studies have found that the use of such a power supply system, in comparison with the traditional circuit, makes it possible to reduce the non-sinusoidal voltage in a low-power grid from 3.2 % to 2.1 % and the unbalance coefficient from 3.66 to 1.35 %. Previously published data on a significant reduction in voltage fluctuations was also confirmed.The positive effect of such a system on the energy performance of the furnace itself is shown, manifes­ted in an increase in the arc power by 12.5 %, and the electrical efficiency by 5.1 %. This improves the productivity and efficiency of electric arc furnaces</jats:p>"

The paper addresses the issue of predicting the technical condition of a combustion engine using available diagnostic methods. The study focuses on the equipment required for monitoring and analyzing the technical condition of the engine of an unmanned vessel when operating in automatic or remotely controlled mode. An algorithm has been developed for collecting, storing and accumulating data on the condition of the engine components and units in the on-board information system of the vessel to exchange data on the condition of the engine and its components during remote monitoring and to determine fault codes. The approaches to the synthesis of an intelligent automatic system for diagnosing the combustion engine vibration are considered from a methodological point of view. Vibration diagnostics equipment used for the analysis of the technical condition of the engine is proposed. Some results of the classification of the technical condition of the engine are presented. The expediency of introducing and using hybrid intelligent systems based on artificial neural networks is exemplified by diagnostics of the MITSUBISHI S16R engine.</jats:p>",

Bias-corrected climate projections (i.e., precipitation and temperature) from three high resolution (25 km) regional climate models (viz., RegCM4-MIROC5, MPI-M-MPI-ESM-MR, and NCC-NORESM1-M) are used here to force a calibrated hydrological model to project streamflow and sediment loads for two future periods (mid-century: 2046–2065, and end of the century: 2081–2099) under two representative concentration pathways (i.e., RCPs 2.6 and 8.5). By the end of the century under RCP 8.5, all simulations (forced with the three RCMs) project increased annual streamflow (67–87%) and sediment loads (128–145%). In general, streamflow and sediment loads are projected to increase more during the southwest monsoon season (May–September) than in other periods. Furthermore, by the end of the century, all simulations under the RCP 8.5 project a shift of streamflow and sediment loads in the southwest monsoon peak from May to June, while preserving the peak in the inter-monsoon 2 (in October). The projected changes in annual sediment loads are greater than the projected changes in annual streamflow (in percentage) for both future periods.</jats:p>"

First, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making framework following the Pugh matrix approach for group decision-making. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to check the effects of the perturbations in the criteria weights. Then, we identify the factors behind agricultural resilience and organize them into the three groups (food security, agricultural viability, decent jobs). The expert survey is carried out to elicit the ratings in regard to the expected effects of the policy measures with respect to dimensions of agricultural resilience. The case of Lithuania is considered in the empirical analysis. The existing and newly proposed agricultural policy measures are taken into account. The measures related to alleviation of the financial burden (e.g., credit payment deferral) appear to be the most effective in accordance with the expert ratings.</jats:p>"

This study aimed to propose a conceptual and holistic GSCM framework to represents a roadmap towards GSCM implementation by integrating all green supply chain practices by various stakeholders of construction sector in Indonesia.Design/methodology/approach: Green practices were obtained from an extensive literature review. Questionnaire survey of GSCM stakeholders in the construction sector was conducted to obtain the preference of green supply chain variables as the proxy for variable weighting and ranking. Pairwise Comparison (PWC) and Technique for Others Preference by Similarity to Ideal (TOPSIS) were adopted to analyze the weight and to rank the green practices respectively. The finding of PWC and TOPSIS were used to develop the framework.Findings: The implementation of the GSCM in the construction sector in Indonesia is mainly focused on reducing the use of hazardous materials, the management of waste at the project site, selling products and components that are no longer used, using video conferencing both inter- and intra-organization meetings, and support from the management level in the form EMS and ISO 14001 certification.Research limitations/implications: This study did not include other GSCM performances as criteria, such as operational and logistical performance.Practical implications: An efficient evaluation technique developed by the framework can be used in decision making policies by policy makers and stakeholders of the organization which can identify and prioritize the green practices for adoption of GSCM in the construction sectorOriginality/value: The originality of this research is that GSCM framework was developed with most relevant green practices based on ranking and weighting criteria as well as the main stakeholders involved.</jats:p>"

All these non-linear elements generate harmonic components in the supply voltage. This leads to a deterioration in the quality of the supplied energy. In this regard, improving the quality of supplied energy is an urgent task. The article proposes a method of continuous distributed monitoring of the quality of electrical energy in the isolated power systems. This method is based on the use of the PMU infrastructure to continuously obtain information on instantaneous values of currents and voltages. It is proposed to use a smart meter proposed earlier by the authors as a primary measuring instrument for monitoring the level and direction of harmonics in various sections of the power system. This procedure is carried out in the current time mode, and thus there is a continuous adjustment of the power supply system to a mode close to optimal in terms of the content of harmonic components (harmonics) in the supply voltage at the selected points of connection.</jats:p>",

This challenge is an opportunity for Indonesia's food distribution to be able to meet the needs of various food commodities. This study aims to find a solution and strategy in an effort to realize Indonesia's Food Self-Sufficiency. This study uses the Literature Review method, which uses sources of scientific articles from various sources of national and international journals. The results obtained show that the Live Monitoring Distribution system can be used as an alternative tool used to determine the availability and distribution of food needs to all regions in Indonesia in real-time using three-color indications. This system can meet food needs in the right quantity, right quality, on time, and the most efficient food distribution logistics costs based on the information available in real time. Thus, the availability of food in Indonesia will be evenly distributed throughout the region and Indonesia will be able to realize the welfare of the people through Food Self-Sufficiency. </jats:p>"

Our objective was to investigate how methionine supply during mid-gestation, phase where the secondary myogenesis occurs, alters heifers’ plasma concentration of amino acids and offspring’ birth weight in beef cattle. Forty purebred Angus heifers were blocked by expected parturition day and blocks were balanced by sire, body weight, and body condition score. Heifers were randomly assigned to a basal diet with no added methionine (Control) or the basal diet plus a commercial source of rumen-protected methionine (Methionine). The methionine source was dosed to deliver 6 grams of metabolizable methionine daily. Heifers received the treatments from day 90 to 180 of gestation, and all heifers were pair-feed during early- and late-gestation. Heifers’ plasma samples were collected on day 180 of gestation. Data were analyzed using mixed models. The model for plasma samples included the fixed effect of treatment and the random effect of block, while the birth weight model included the fixed effect of treatment, sex, and its interaction and the random effect of block. Plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, and urea were not affected by treatments (P ≥ 0.20). Dietary supply of methionine increased plasma concentration of methionine (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and decreased glycine and serine (P &amp;lt; 0.01). None of the other essential and non-essential amino acids were affected by treatments (P ≥ 0.12). Heifers supplemented with methionine had a greater plasma concentration of the antioxidant taurine than control heifers (P = 0.04). A treatment × sex interaction was observed for calf birth weight; methionine-fed heifers delivered heavier male calves than control-fed heifers (P = 0.03). No treatment or sex effect was observed for calf birth weight (P ≥ 0.18). Our preliminary results indicate that methionine supply during mid-gestation affects fetal growth in beef cattle in a sex-dependent manner.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p />\n               <jats:p />",

Hydrodynamic breakage has a significant impact on the evolution of floc characteristics and the efficiency of turbidity removal. In this work, the effects of hydrodynamic breakage on floc size, fractal dimension, and floc morphology were investigated with an in-situ recognition system. The experiments were conducted in a continuous flocculation and sedimentation reactor equipped with perforated plates to provide different hydrodynamic breakage conditions. The experimental results indicated that the hydrodynamic conditions significantly influenced the floc destabilization and restructuring processes. A low hydrodynamic shear force provided by P1 led to the increase of both bigger sized flocs but accompanied with small particles (0–10 μm). Excessive velocity gradient provided by P3 produced smaller and looser flocs. An appropriate velocity gradient (i.e., the flow velocity through the perforated plate P2 at 18.9 × 10−3m s−1) was conducive for the formation of larger and more compact structures, with higher average floc size and fractal dimension. This flocculation condition in turn resulted in effective improvements in the turbidity removal efficiency. Floc evolution models were described based on the mechanism of the breakage and restructuring process.</jats:p>",

Unplanned deferments at offshore facilities creates enormous impacts on gas quantity leading to loss/lowering of power generation. Such occurrences lead to value leakage and hinders the expansion strategies by non-firming of investment decisions. It therefore becomes imperative as prudent operator to sustain upstream gas supply by ensuring the security by appropriate strategies in occurrence of such events. Also, for complex facilities it is decisive to have comprehensive understanding of network characteristic, offshore supplies distributions and topology in terms of hydraulics &amp; flow regimes from multiple fields to ensure security of gas supply to customers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper proposes an approach to endorse the security of gas supply during normal and ad hoc situations by aligning the relevant feeders to respective demand centers thru comprehensible network modeling and ensure the optimized system response operating envelope for such events. An innovative process was commenced to design, develop, validate, and deploy the network simulation model to cater for the technical characteristics in terms of ullage, hydraulic first principles, blending aspects and safety features during aligning of the respective feeders. The landscape includes around 100+ feeders, multiple export pipelines, several gas highways, and many demand centers with each of its specific requirement. The inline equipment such as pressure boosters with performance curves (compressors/pumps), pressure manipulators (control valves) also formed the integral portion of the model for resilient outputs. Also, the equation of state (for thermodynamic behavior) and appropriate flow co-relation (for pressure drop estimations) were embedded in the model for representative results. The model was validated thoroughly with the plant data by identifying critical junction points to have realistic consequences. Input to the model were classified as engineering input (static such as design capacity, pressure limits, maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP)) and operational inputs (flow allocations, priority of supply, precedence in operation of demand centers). The process was looped to reallocate the feeders till the required intent is met for the supply as well as on technical aspects.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The simulation model could decipher the pain points across the various intensity of the networks such as pressure choking, unintended flow distribution, violations of the resultant specifications and potential breach in the safety limitations. Several iterations could be accomplished in terms of permutations and combinations to align appropriate feeders. The scenarios could be also optimized for the optimal value ranking of the fields to be evacuated for designated demand centers.

This study was carried out to examine the microbiological quality of milk from three different points of milk supply chain to investigate whether the dairy stakeholders are maintaining the consumer safety or not.&#x0D;\nStudy Design: A cross sectional study&#x0D;\nPlace and Duration: The study took place at the Food Microbiology lab of Institute of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Dhaka from November 2019 to February 2020.&#x0D;\nMethodology: A total of 60 samples were studied including raw milk from collection centers, unpackaged pasteurized milk from processing plants and packaged pasteurized milks from retail shops. After carrying out the microbiological analysis the samples were examined for determining the total bacterial count (TBC) and total coliform count (TCC). Antibiotic susceptibility test was done using disk diffusion assay and detection of virulent gene in Salmonella spp. was done by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using specific invA primer.&#x0D;\nResults: The results revealed that all raw milk samples were substandard in terms of TBC and TCC and pasteurized milks from processing plants maintained the standard quality. Importantly, packaged pasteurized milk samples from retail shops had high TBC (&gt;4.0× 104 CFU/mL) and TCC (1.2×103 CFU/mL) containing Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Proteus, Staphylococcus, Bacillus and E. coli. Bacteria like Salmonella (75%), Proteus (62.5%) and Vibrio (62.5%) possessed high Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index and showed resistance towards antibiotics namely Ampicillin, Amoxicillin, Erythromycin and Colistin. Through further molecular analysis we detected invA virulent gene one of the Salmonella isolates which was collected from the pasteurized milk samples of the retail shops.&#x0D;\nConclusion: High bacterial load in raw milk and packaged pasteurized milk indicate that the milk we consume is substandard in microbiological quality. Precautionary measurements and careful processing of milk may reduce the prevalence of microbiological contamination in the milk supply chain.</jats:p>"

However, these reforms were embarked on in the absence of timely and accurate information about the capacity of non-acute care to take on a more central role in the system. To help address this gap, this paper outlines the most comprehensive analysis to date of geographic inequalities in non-acute care supply in Ireland.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Methods: </ns4:bold>Data on the supply of 10 non-acute services including primary care, allied health, and care for older people, were collated.

In this context, the research question arises: how to build the necessary knowledge about supply chain performance indicators in sustainability, systematizing in an evaluation process integrated with the organizational results? The general objective of this research is to build an integrated system of sustainability performance analysis of the supply chain. In order to achieve the general objective, the specific objectives are the following: (i) selection of the bibliographic portfolio and (ii) analysis of articles content. The exploratory-descriptive research method presents and illustrates a structured process for the selection of scientific articles on supply chain performance indicators in the sustainability context. The method identified the most important keywords and the main databases of full texts and abstracts aligned with the topic. An important review of the literature reveals that efforts to improve or influence the practice of sustainability in the supply chain raise critical questions about the transaction costs and effectiveness of the approach. The review promoted the development of a system of indicators inspired by the Balanced ScorCard (BSC) to address sustainability performance issues. The originality or value lies on the useful for managers throughout the supply chain. It was identified in the literature that supply chains still generate significant environmental impacts, social impacts, and use of natural resources, even though they individually present statements in their strategies and accountability indicating the priority regarding the mitigation of social, environmental, and economic impacts. Another finding is that it is not just a matter of complying with legal and institutional frameworks. The scientific literature defines the need to prioritize studies on Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM), which helps organizations in the production chain to achieve competitiveness and at the same time emphasize the reduction of social risks and environmental impacts. The main findings of the paper are related to the possibility of interfacing the dimensions present in TBL with performance measurement in a supply chain.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, considering that suppliers can form alliances, we establish bargaining game models under the conditions of the non-alliance and alliance of suppliers, and discuss the coordination strategy for the NEVs supply chain. It is found that, under the dual-credit policy, the higher the credit coefficient of technology improvement, the higher the transaction price of credits, and the higher the R&amp;D investment of supply chain. Dual-credit policy can effectively encourage NEVs supply chain to increase R&amp;D investment, improve NEV technology level, and improve the profit of supply chain. Under the dual-credit policy, the increment profit distribution strategy based on a bargaining game model can coordinate the NEVs supply chain. When suppliers separately negotiate with the manufacturer, bringing the negotiation sequence forward, the supplier can get more profits. However, as the manufacturer has the right to determine the negotiation sequence, the supplier can only get the profit of the last round of negotiation, and the manufacturer can get excess profit. Forming a suppliers alliance can solve this problem effectively, and increase the profit of all suppliers when the alliance`s negotiating power is improved to a certain threshold.</jats:p>"

Here, Fe3O4/peroxymonosulfate (PMS) system was used to examine the amino acid removal and formation of N-DBPs in the system and the corresponding mechanisms. Results showed a remarked variation in removal efficiency of three typical amino acids, i.e., glutamate (78%), histidine (53%) and phenylalanine (27%) in Fe3O4/PMS system at optimum conditions (0.1 g/L Fe3O4, 1.5 mM PMS, 1 h). Notably, Fe3O4/PMS treatment led to dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN) formation caused by the chlorination of glutamate, phenylalanine and histidine being reduced by 53.3%, 9.7% and 41.9%, respectively. The degradation and subsequent N-DBPs formation in the Fe3O4/PMS system mainly depended on the types and properties of the amino acids. The formation of dichloroacetamide (DCAcAm) exhibited different trends, which may be due to the different R group structure of the three amino acids and the special aromaticity of the imidazole ring in the histidine side chain that facilitates its quick electrophilic substitution and ring-opening reaction. This study highlights that the Fe3O4/PMS system is a promising strategy to remove DON and efficiently eliminate N-DBPs formation in the drinking water treatment process depending on the amino acid type.</jats:p>",

The work uses the results of many years of sanitary and hygienic survey and laboratory studies of water from communal sources of non-centralized drinking water supply. The following main indicators have been determined for a comprehensive hygienic and environmental estimation of the state of non-centralized water sources: the degree of compliance of the water source with the established sanitary, hygienic and sanitary technical regulations and requirements; compliance with the sanitary protection zones; the sanitary and educational, aesthetic and artistic design of water sources; the level of improvement of the territory surrounding the water sources; the water quality of the water sources according to the results of laboratory tests for a certain period. Each of the five indicators was estimated according to the 12-point grading scale with the subsequent summation of points in order to provide for the final result of a comprehensive estimation. Considering the successful holding of a competitive tender for the improvement of non-centralized water supply sources using the developed methodology for a comprehensive hygienic and environmental estimation of the state of non-centralized drinking water supply sources in an area with severe shortages of drinking tap water, extending the experience of these measures to other administrative territories in a similar situation is recommended.</jats:p>",

Much research is devoted to the study of the effect of brassinosteroids and their analogs, as well as zircon, which have a multifunctional effect on the yield and the formation of elements of productivity of various agricultural plants. Also many studies have been carried out to study the effect of microelements on the formation of yield and adaptive ability of grain crops. However, some aspects of increasing the efficiency of growth regulation and microelements require further study. In this regard, studies were carried out to study the effect of the combined use of growth regulators and sodium selenite on the yield and the formation of productivity elements of spring wheat, depending on the conditions of water supply. The efficiency of the action of plants growth epin and zircon, introduced together with sodium selenit, on the yield and production process of spring wheat plants under conditions of optimal irrigation and short-term soil drought has been studies. Methods: The research was carried out in 2018-2019. In a vegetation experiment at the Russian State Agarian University-Moscow Agricultural Academy. The object of research was spring soft wheat of the Ivolga variety. The plants were grown in vessels with a capacity of 5 kg of soil. For the experiments, a soddy-podzolic medium loamy soil was used. The optimal conditions for water supply were created watering the vessels during the entire growing season. A short-trem drought was created by stopping irrigation duting the steming phase. The duration of the drought is 5-6 days. In experiments, growth regulations epin, zircon and sodium selenite were studied, which were used by treating seeds before sowing wich 0,01% solutions of preparations. In the studies, the yield of spring wheat ang the formation of productivity elements were determined. Result: Analysis of variance results for differences in the action of sodium selenite, zircon and epin, as well as their combination on various aspects of the production process of forming wheat yield. The stimulating effect of the combined use of sodium selenite and zircon on the reproductive organs of wheat was established, as a result of cariopses in an ear increased by 1.43 time. The activation of the attracting ability of the ear established when using the conscientious use of sodium selenite and epin. As a result, the wheat yield increased by 20% with optimal water supply and drought.\n</jats:p>"

In this study, the urban water resources carrying capacity of Qingdao based on basin unit over 2010–2030 is predicted using analytic hierarchy process and system dynamics method. The results showed that the total water demand of all the nine basins have an upward annual trend from 2017 to 2030, among which the domestic water consumption increase obviously. The urban water resource carrying capacity indexes in all basins over 2017–2030 show a downward annual trend under the current social development model. So it is urgent to improve the water resource carrying capacity of each river basin by means of industrial structure optimization and upgrading and active development of new water sources.</jats:p>",

Adding to this, an increasing proportion of female doctors is graduating from medical courses but gender is not accounted for within rural workforce policy and planning. This threatens the future capacity of rural medical services. This perspective draws together the latest evidence, to make the case for industry and government action on responsive policy and planning to attract females to rural medicine. We find that the factors that attract female doctors to rural practice are not the same as males. We identify female‐tailored policies require a re‐visioning of rural recruitment, use of employment arrangements that attract females and re‐thinking issues of rural training and specialty choice. We conceptualise a roadmap that includes co‐designing rural jobs within supportive teams, allowing for capped hours which align with childcare along with boosting of female peer support and mentorship. There is also a need to enhance flexible rural postgraduate training options in a range of specialties (at a time when many women are establishing families) and to consider viable partner employment (including for female doctors with university trained partners) and advertising specific rural attractors to women, including the chance to connect with communities and make a difference.</jats:p>",

The power supply system based on an autonomous wind turbine consists of an electric generator, a battery charging controller, a battery pack and an inverter, which provides the required frequency and valueof the consumer's supply voltage.Three  phase  permanent  magnet  synchronous  generator  that  have  high  technical  and  economic  indicators  are  most  widely used as electric generator of autonomous wind turbines.The main disadvantage of these generators is the lack of effective methods of magnetic flux control, limiting the optimization of the energy balance of the wind turbine.The paper discusses the application of synchronous generator with hybrid excitation system that consists of permanent magnets and additional field excitation winding lo-cated  on  the  stator.  Mathematical  model  of  a  hybrid  excited  synchronous  generator  is  presented. Also,an  output  maximum  power control system in a case of wind speed change by varying field excitation current is developed. Control system is developed based on concept of reverse task of dynamics in combination with minimization of local functionals of instantaneous values of energies.In the basics of the control method is put an idea of the reversibility of the Lyapunov direct method for the stability analysis.Obtained con-trol law provides thesystem stability inwhole, which allows solving control tasks of interrelated objects via mathematical models of local loops. Control law also provides low sensitiveness to parametric disturbances and gives dynamic decomposition of interrelated non linear system that ensures its practical implementation. The study of the proposed power control system based on parameters of hybrid excited synchronous generatorexperimental sample has been carried out. The graphs of transient process of armature power, voltage  and  current  in  a  case  of  wind  speed  change  from  3  to  8  m/s  were  obtained,  as  well  as  in  a  case  of  active  resistance  load change.

Secondly, to use an Impact scale to measure the dominant marketing-mix factors that influence procurement decision-making practices. Methods: A descriptive study that used self-administered questionnaires, distributed to community pharmacists from March to May 2021 in Southwestern, Nigeria. A mixed-method sampling technique was adopted. Ethical approval was given by the Ministry of health (HPRS/381/371). Study outcomes were compared against measures of the Impact scale. Descriptive and Inferential statistics were used to test the study hypotheses using SPSS-25. Significance was set at p&lt;0.05 Results: The response rate was 79.6% representing 398 community pharmacists. Age of community pharmacists had significant association with price-sensitivity (p&lt;0.01). Community pharmacists with more employees tended to be price-sensitive (p=0.003). Promotion variable had the highest influence (Mean score=2.73, SD=0.43, Impact-level=moderate), followed by Price (Mean score=2.65, SD=0.34, Impact-level=moderate), Place (Mean score=2.61, SD=0.51, Impact-level=moderate), Perception (Mean score=2.48, SD=0.42, Impact-level=low), and the least impactful was Product (Mean score=2.46, SD=0.41, Impact level=low). The study revealed an overall low-to-moderate involvement (Mean score=2.59, SD=0.42) and influence of marketing-mix on the level of engagement of community pharmacists with supply channels.

Analysis of trace element levels in serum, liver, and kidney demonstrated a successful intervention. Markers of the selenium status were unaffected by the iodine supply. The thyroid gland was able to maintain serum thyroxine levels even under selenium-deficient conditions, despite reduced selenoprotein expression in liver and kidney, including deiodinase type 1. Thyroid hormone target genes responded to the altered selenium and iodine supply, whereas the iron, zinc, and copper homeostasis remained unaffected. There was a notable interaction between thyroid hormones and copper, which requires further clarification.

This study aimed to find methods to optimize chlorine dosage in Yangon City. Onsite sampling and laboratory analyses of residual chlorine and trihalomethane (THM) formation, as well as water quality simulations, were conducted to find the chlorine decay and THM formation kinetics. Due to a high chlorine dose of 2 mg/L for both pre- and post-chlorination, disinfection was effective despite the low removal efficiency of turbidity. However, THMs were found in high levels in both treated and tap water due to the high THM formation potential of raw water. The re-contamination and/or transformation of dissolved organic matter were found in the distribution network by increases in specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA) values and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorophores, which brought about variations of THMs in the networks. The EPANET models were run assuming there to be no water leakages; it was found that the chlorine dose could be decreased to 0.8 mg/L to meet the guidelines for THMs and residual chlorine. The methods employed in this study could be also applied in other water supply systems in tropical developing countries with limited water quality monitoring data.</jats:p>"

Thus, policies to address the epidemic must consider not only the resources available to manage addiction but those to manage acute and chronic pain as well. For the period 2017 to 2019, the authors sought to describe the distribution, by state, of indicators of the supply of resources to address pain and addiction (graduate medical education subspecialty training in pain and addiction, number of board-certified pain and addiction specialists, number of opioid treatment centers), as well as indicators of the demands for those services (opioid prescriptions, opioid overdose deaths), to identify states that seem to suffer from a mismatch between supply and demand. It was also sought to examine the relationships between these treatment resources and indicators of the magnitude of the opioid epidemic, through an exploratory correlational analysis. The resulting model may inform public policy by suggesting areas in need of greater graduate medical education training and more pain and addiction specialists and by suggesting hypotheses about the impact of these specialists on outcome that are worthy of further study.</jats:p>",

We also highlight the sectors exhibiting a match or mismatch between the demand and supply of investments, and explain the potential reasons. Regarding both geographic and sector concentration, the demand for investments is much more concentrated than their supply.

This paper presents streamflow modelling and forecasting using signal difference average (SDA) based variational mode decomposition (VMD) combined with machine learning (ML) methods at Chitral and Tarbela stations on the Indus River network. For this purpose, VMD based random forest (VMD-RF), gradient boosting machine (VMD-GBM) and Bayesian regularized neural network (VMD-BRNN) have been chosen. Moreover, traditional time series flow models, that is seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and classical decomposition approach with particle swarm optimization-based support vector regression (PSO-SVR), are considered as benchmark models for comparison. The results show that overall, VMD-BRNN performed best, followed by VMD-GBM and VMD-RF, whereas SARIMA and PSO-SVR ranked last. Overall, SARIMA and PSO-SVR are failing to capture most of the peaks even during the training period whereas hybridization of VMD and ML methods has shown increased robustness of the models. The results show that the influential role of the high dimensional components and robustness on the river flow may be explored by most optimum SDA based VMD signals hybrid with BRNN method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the continuous development of e-commerce, it has become normal for the manufacturer to sell products and to collect used products through e-commerce platforms (platform for short). We consider an electronic closed-loop supply chain (E-CLSC) where we composed a manufacturer with remanufacturing capability and a platform that can provide logistics services. The purpose of this paper is to address whether the manufacturer should directly collect used products from the consumer under the platform. Specifically, we have developed four game models, namely model N (no collection), model M (the manufacturer collects), model E (the platform collects), and model T (the third-party collects) and derived the optimal pricing decisions, logistics service level, and collection rate for E-CLSC members. We found that remanufacturing used products is conducive to increasing the profits of the manufacturer and the platform as well as to increasing the utility of the consumer. Under the same conditions, for the manufacturer, the platform, and the consumer, the optimal choice is that the manufacturer directly collects the used products from the consumer. If the manufacturer is unable to establish an effective collection channel, he should consider outsourcing to a contractor and should consider the platform to be under the same conditions. Numerical examples are also given to verify the proposed results.</jats:p>"

The result of the unit root test reveals that all the variables are nonstationary in levels but become stationary at the first-order difference. The unit root test further reveals that there are structural breaks in the mid-1990s or 2000s. The Johansen’s cointegration test reveals that the Indian stock market index and stock market capitalization are individually cointegrated with money supply. Further, the long-run co-movement between the Indian stock market and money supply and stock market capitalization and money supply is found to be positive. The results of the VEC model shows that the error correction term in the lnSENSEX–lnMS model is negative and statistically significant, while the error correction term in the lnMARCAP–lnMS model is found to be insignificant. The VEC Granger causality test shows that there is no short-run causal relationship between the variables. The variance decomposition indicates that both Indian stock market index and stock market capitalization are strongly exogenous. The impulse response function suggests that money supply has an immediate positive effect on both Indian stock market index and stock market capitalization. The investors and fund managers should take investment decisions keeping in view the positive co-movement of Indian stock market performance and broad money supply. The study recommends that the government should avoid aggressive tightening of money supply. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Due to their prominent position in the market, construction companies are increasingly required to control and minimise the internal and external environmental impact of their day-to-day activities. To achieve this, all over the world, construction companies have gradually adopted different environmentally friendly practices promoting the preservation of the environment. Generally, many of these practices are carried out in the area of green supply chain management (GSCM) and logistics performance where there is a great potential to reduce the rate of pollution generated. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to identify effective GSCM factors necessary to develop a successful framework that could guide the managers for improving the environmental performance of their companies. For this study, a qualitative approach was adopted. A content analysis was carried out using different types of documents like journals, policies, and published materials. The study suggests that by adopting GSCM and improving their logistics performance, construction companies will be able to improve their environmental performance. In addition, the study implied that construction companies that comply with the different laws and regulations established, development and implement a green information system as well as a good reverse logistics system are more likely to reduce the environmental impact of their activities, while optimising their economic viability. Therefore, it is recommended that construction companies keep giving more attention to GSCM and logistics performance as it is the most innovative means by which they can get cost efficiency and environmental responsibility simultaneously.\n\n\nKeywords: Green supply chain management, logistics performance, regulatory pressure, reverse logistics, green packaging, green information system and sustainability.</jats:p>",

The method used is a survey method. The results showed that as much as 26,94 tons/year of sediment entered the Rupat Strait and was distributed in the research area. Each part of the research area has a different bathymetric change value. This is presumably due to oceanographic factors in the waters of the Rupat Strait such as strong and weak river currents when entering the sea, the distance between the research area and the sediment supply source, human activities in each part of the study area, erosion along the river and abrasion at the river mouth. the presence of mangrove forests, dominant sediment types, sloping water topography, the cross-sectional width of the river as a sediment supplier, and suspended solids</jats:p>"

Findings from qualitative interviews of local council and provider stakeholders exploring barriers and enablers faced by LTC providers in two local authorities (LAs) are presented and discussed. The interviews provided insight in three main areas: staffing, demand and stakeholder relationships. Staffing, in particular, is crucial and we found that there are many difficulties for providers in maintaining their workforce. Consistent with previous research, we also found that public spending levels on LTC puts pressure on providers striving to maintain a good quality service, including improved remuneration of staff.</jats:p>",

The transform coefficients of the low frequency components are used as design variables to represent the fuel supply curves. The improved KS function is proposed to deal with constraints.

This study proposes an approach to improve the vulnerability assessments of U.S. river basins to the shortage at the interannual to decadal timescales by characterizing shifts in intensity, duration, and frequency (IDF) of water shortage events from current (1986–2015) to future (2070–2099) periods. The results indicate that under the driest future climate projection, the frequency and intensity of over‐year (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &gt; 12 months) events at the monthly scale and decadal (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &gt; 10 years) events at the annual scale tend to increase in the Southwest, Southern, middle Great Plain, and Great Lakes regions. Conversely, the frequency of interannual (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &lt; 12 months) events at the monthly scale and annual (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &gt; 1 year) and multi‐year (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &gt; 3 years) events at the annual scale is likely to increase in the West Coast regions. Besides, river basins with a higher rate of aridification are likely to experience more frequent over‐year (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &gt; 12 months) events, while river basins with a decrease in aridification were projected to undergo more frequent interannual (<jats:italic>D</jats:italic> &lt; 12 months) events due to an increase in the variability of extreme weather anomalies within a year. The findings of this study provide new insights to understand and characterize vulnerability to water shortage under current and future water supply‐demand conditions and can inform the development of effective mitigation and/or adaptation strategies.</jats:p>",

The specific features of the algorithms for calculating transients, steady-state modes and static characteristics are discussed. The results of the calculation of the processes and characteristics of induction motors with the power supply from the current source and the voltage source are compared. Steady-state and dynamic modes cannot be studied with a sufficient adequacy based on the known equivalent circuits; this requires using dynamic parameters, which are the elements of the Jacobi matrix of the system of equations of the electromechanical equilibrium. In the mathematical model, the state equations of the stator and rotor circuits are written in the fixed two-phase coordinate system. The transients are described by the system of differential equations of electrical equilibrium of the transformed circuits of the motor and the equation of the rotor motion and the steady-state modes by the system of algebraic equation. The developed algorithms are based on the mathematical model of the motor in which the magnetic path saturation and skin effect in the squirrel-cage bars are taken into consideration. The magnetic path saturation is accounted for by using the real characteristics of magnetizing by the main magnetic flux and leakage fluxes of the stator and rotor windings. Based on them, the differential inductances are calculated, which are the elements of the Jacobi matrix of the system of equations describing the dynamic modes and static characteristic. In order to take into account the skin effect in the squirrel-cage rotor, each bar along with the squirrel-cage rings is divided height-wise into several elements. As a result, the mathematical model considers the equivalent circuits of the rotor with different parameters which are connected by mutual inductance. The non-linear system of algebraic equations of electrical equilibrium describing the steady-state modes is solved by the parameter continuation method. To calculate the static characteristics, the differential method combined with the Newton’s Iterative refinement is used.</jats:p>"

It is an amalgamation of eight small islands with a total area of 13.4 km2. Salinity intrusion has been a serious threat in the downstream areas of Kallada River for more than one and half decades, affecting the groundwater quality of Munroe Island. The present study focuses on the seasonal variation in physico-chemical characteristics of the underground water system of Munroe Island and Kallada River with special reference to saline water intrusion. Physico-chemical analysis of ground water revealed that samples were unsuitable for drinking due to higher content of Na, Ca, and K. Microbiological analysis of island groundwater showed the presence of coliform and E. coli bacteria above the permissible limit. Results indicated a significant correlation between salinity and major anions viz., Cl− and SO42 and cations viz., Mg, Na, Ca, and K of both river surface and island groundwater. In the present study it is clearly evident the occurrence of saltwater intrusion in Kallada River from Ashtamudy Lake and the its severity become higher during premonsoon season. The results also indicated that the salinity increase in Kallada River has a negative impact on island groundwater quality. The paper also suggests suitable management strategies for overcoming the saltwater intrusion thereby upgrading island sustainability.</jats:p>",

Under pressure to reduce their energy-related carbon emissions to zero, water utilities have devised a variety of energy management strategies, including the purchase of renewable energy and self-generation of electricity using locally installed renewables. These strategies will incur different costs for the utility, whilst some may have implications for the reliability of water supply systems. Yet the trade-offs between costs, water security and energy sustainability remain unexplored. Here, we present a regional scale analysis to test competing energy strategies, mapping pathways to zero carbon energy and water security. Results from a case-study of the London water system show a balanced approach that allows for some energy self-generation, using biogas, solar and wind, while also purchasing green energy credits from the electricity supply grid can best navigate this trade-off. Balanced investment plans can accommodate energy-intensive water supply techniques such as long-distance transfers, desalination and effluent reuse while meeting energy targets. By becoming energy generators and also adopting more flexible arrangements for energy use, water utilities could become significant players in energy markets.</jats:p>",

The special effectiveness of these fences has been shown in the transitional periods of the year, that is, in spring and autumn.\nA mathematical model has been developed to reliably predict the process of ensuring temperature comfortable conditions (heat balance) when using nonparametric statistics methods. It will improve the quality of forecasting the effect of external air temperature during the transitional periods of the year. The temperature inside the room is taken into account in the presence of a multilayer energy-active fence.\nTo determine the approach to the use of heat in energy supply systems during the transition period, thermal parameters from the inner and outer sides of the building structure are considered. This makes it possible to take into account changes in the heat transfer of these structures when designing a power supply system and determining the optimal modes of its functioning in various natural conditions.\nThe function of energy-active fences associated with the generation of additional heat into the system, obtained through the conversion of solar radiation energy, is considered. To increase this generation, special multilayer designs of energy-active fencing have been proposed. The proposed thermal modernization with the use of energy-active fences allows, on average, over the cold period of the year, to reduce energy consumption by 3.5 times for industrial and residential buildings</jats:p>"

The findings show that employee perceptions of indirect N-S fit are significantly related to job satisfaction and negatively related to intention to leave and job search behavior. We find that an individual’s desires, needs, and subjective “fit” perceptions can impact considerably on how the individual thinks and feels about their job and their inclinations to leave. In addition to contributing empirical evidence of how employee perceptions of N-S fit can affect employee intentions to leave, we conclude that it is of practical importance for practitioners to assess the congruence between an employee’s perceptions of what he or she needs in a job and their subjective perceptions of what is supplied. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>All over the world, a common problem in the soil is the low content of available zinc (Zn), which is unevenly distributed and difficult to move. However, information on the foraging strategies of roots in response to heterogeneous Zn supply is still very limited. Few studies have analyzed the adaptability of maize inbred lines with different Zn efficiencies to different low Zn stress time lengths in maize. This study analyzed the effects of different time lengths of low Zn stress on various related traits in different inbred lines. In addition, morphological plasticity of roots and the response of Zn-related important gene iron-regulated transporter-like proteins (ZIPs) were studied via simulating the heterogeneity of Zn nutrition in the soil. In this report, when Zn deficiency stress duration was extended (from 14 to 21 days), under Zn-deficient supply (0.5 μM), Zn efficiency (ZE) based on shoot dry weight of Wu312 displayed no significant difference, and ZE for Ye478 was increased by 92.9%. Under longer-term Zn deficiency, shoot, and root dry weights of Ye478 were 6.5 and 2.1-fold higher than those of Wu312, respectively. Uneven Zn supply strongly inhibited the development of some root traits in the -Zn region. Difference in shoot dry weights between Wu312 and Ye478 was larger in T1 (1.97 times) than in T2 (1.53 times). Under heterogeneous condition of Zn supply, both the –Zn region and the +Zn region upregulated the expressions of <jats:italic>ZmZIP3, ZmZIP4, ZmZIP5, ZmZIP7</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>ZmZIP8</jats:italic> in the roots of two inbred lines. These results indicate that extended time length of low-Zn stress will enlarge the difference of multiple physiological traits, especially biomass, between Zn-sensitive and Zn-tolerant inbred lines. There were significant genotypic differences of root morphology in response to heterogeneous Zn supply. Compared with split-supply with +Zn/+Zn, the difference of above-ground biomass between Zn-sensitive and Zn-tolerant inbred lines under split-supply with –Zn/+Zn was higher. Under the condition of heterogeneous Zn supply, several <jats:italic>ZmZIP</jats:italic> genes may play important roles in tolerance to low Zn stress, which can provide a basis for further functional characterization.</jats:p>"

A method for the formation of sustainable chains of supplying raw materials to a timber processing enterprise was proposed, taking into consideration uncertainties and risks associated with the purchase of raw materials on the mercantile exchange and the implementation of the circuit of delivery to a warehouse. A dynamic model, which is a problem of stochastic nonlinear programming, the objective function of which is the cost of purchasing raw materials, was developed. The model makes it possible to form a plan for purchasing raw materials on the timber section of the mercantile exchange on a given planning horizon, taking into consideration uncertainties when it comes to the number of daily offers, their volumes, and prices. The risk of cancellation of the concluded contract due to the loss of the quality of raw materials during delivery and non-fulfillment of delivery terms was also taken into consideration. To find a solution to the model, a two-stage circuit, in which the first stage involves a procurement plan that is close to optimal, was proposed. At the second stage, a plan that is closest to the basic one in terms of the volume of purchased raw materials and minimizing the total costs is chosen for each day of implementation of a random flow of applications. The numerical solution at the first stage is found using the heuristic algorithm that uses the branch and bound method and the genetic algorithm at certain steps. At the second stage, the multi-criteria problem of mathematical programming is solved numerically. An example of the formation by a timber processing enterprise in the Far East of a suboptimal procurement plan that ensures an increase in the efficiency and sustainability of economic activity in the long term is considered</jats:p>"

It appears that extreme forms of bullying are deployed to intensify labour controls, including locking workers in, frequent wage cuts, setting moveable targets and carrying out intense observations. The context of this study is surplus value-starved clothing factories in Bangladesh. Global supply chains’ production regimes and the absence of state protections and trade unions enable factory managers to systematically deploy bullying tactics to achieve production targets. Drawing on Burawoy’s works, this article advances the debate of how workplace bullying is impacted by wider structural conditions with managerial strategies of coercion in factories. It is argued here that when the state intervenes in the factory only to protect and preserve capitalists’ interests, explicitly and implicitly, coercive strategies of control turn into extreme bullying on the shopfloor. </jats:p>",

The simulation is done using computer simulation technology (CST-MW). The proposed design is based on two Fire-retardant substrates (FR-4) of relative permittivity (ε) 4.3+j0.025 and 1.53 mm thickness for each one, which is considered a high loss material. The measurement results show good agreement with the simulated results. In addition, the design can be used for harvesting power supply from mobile towers. Finally, the proposed design is compared with two other designs in terms of power conversion efficiency and overall size.</jats:p>"

Research of power supply systems of mining enterprises and modes of their operation is an urgent task, as this type of engineering support of mining works, auxiliary processes and facilities determines competitiveness of an enterprise as a whole. In the course of research, an assessment of operational reliability of power supply of developing ore mining areas at a high-altitude mine of the Tyrnyauz deposit (Kabardino-Balkaria) was performed. It was found that under the existing scheme of separate power supply of 6 kV networks from substations, the full ground fault currents for these networks are respectively: I<jats:sub>030</jats:sub>=17.5 A and I<jats:sub>0116 </jats:sub>=12.2 A and reach the limiting values at which it was possible to disconnect them by disconnectors (the limiting current was 20 A). A formula for total ground fault current in 6 kV underground networks was recommended. It was shown that reliability of power supply in the above mine, as well as the level of danger of electric shock in electrical installations depended largely on the number of singlephase ground faults. On the basis of the theoretical and experimental research, the solutions to improve the operation of electrical networks, taking into account the structure and modes of operation of a highaltitude mine were developed.</jats:p>"

Among the most obvious are everyday decisions about the mode of transport. From related research, it can be seen that the most affected transport mode is public transport, which had the greatest decline. The reason for lesser use of public transport is in complete closure of public transport in some parts of the world. However, where this measure has not been applied, the reason for the reduction is people's fear of infection when using public transport or any shared modes of transportation. The fear stems from the fact that the COVID-19 virus is spreading extremely fast in densely populated rooms. All these changes are affecting the changes in city mobility. Related research shows a decrease of mobility in general and an increase in the use of individual modes of transportation. Distinct changes can be observed in different environments as compared to previous travel behaviour. </jats:p>",

The pulp and paper industry is the single largest consumer of biomass in Sweden, with many large point sources of biogenic CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions that could be captured. This work investigates the biomass supply required for large-scale implementation of BECCS in the pulp and paper industry. Logging residues are considered as a fuel to supply the additional energy demand imposed by the capture plant, and the potential of these residues is evaluated in a case study that includes four pulp and paper mills located in regions of Sweden with different conditions for biomass supply. Two of the mills are located in southern Sweden, where there is strong competition for logging residues from the heating sector, and two of the mills are located in northern Sweden, where the competition is weaker. We show that implementing carbon capture at the four pulp and paper mills using regional logging residues to supply the additional heat demand required by the capture process (the reboiler heat demand) has the potential to capture around 4.6 Mt CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/year. The results also show that the fuel share of the capture cost, i.e., the cost to supply the reboiler heat demand with regional logging residues, is 22–30 €/tCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> captured, where the lower value corresponds to regions with weaker competition for logging residues (in this study, northern Sweden). In regions that have competition for logging residues, the possibility to increase the regional supply of logging residues to fuel the capture process while maintaining mill production output is limited, which in turn limits the possibilities to generate negative emissions via BECCS. In contrast, in regions with a low level of competition and strong availability of logging residues, there is an additional potential for logging residues to cover the additional heat demand required for CCS implementation.</jats:p>"

In this study, the secondary addition of chlorine is employed to investigate the kinetics of chlorine decay, and shock disinfection is applied to investigate the removal efficiency of corrosion bacteria, and the microbial composition of a biofilm on the pipe wall was also clarified. The results show that the residual chlorine content in the secondary chlorination process was directly correlated with the decay rate of residual chlorine and the corrosion rate of the pipe wall. Additionally, the chlorine impact disinfection method could reduce the electrochemical corrosion phenomenon of the pipe wall. When the concentration of chlorine was 3 mg/L, the removal rate of corrosion bacteria was higher in 60 min than in 30 min. Specifically, most of the bacteria were inactivated in 60 min and the biofilm was severely damaged. Shock disinfection could significantly inactivate all microflora in the biofilm; the relative abundances of microflora varied significantly, while the change of microflora at the phylum level was insignificant.

This paper combines Quality Function Deployment (QFD), fuzzy theory and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to guide practical design. After determining five customer requirements (CRs) and 24 design requirements (DRs), QFD links CRs and DRs to determine the most important feasible DRs for improvement of supply chain flexibility. Research results reveal that the most important design requirements can be summarized into four aspects, namely domestic procurement, supply chain member cooperation, supplier supervision, and emergency response construction. Moreover, it is found that long-term strategic partnerships with suppliers and strategic logistics outsourcing are effective strategies.

It incorporates a multi-dimensional approach, encompassing risk identification, assessment, mitigation strategies, and continuous monitoring to address dynamic market challenges.

A comparative analysis of the U.S. and Canadian regulatory environments highlights similarities and differences that shape risk assessment practices, providing a basis for localized implementation strategies. The proposed model aims to mitigate risks such as supply chain disruptions, data breaches, and reputational damage by integrating predictive analytics and scenario planning. It emphasizes the role of advanced tools, such as blockchain for transparency, and artificial intelligence for early warning systems, to enable proactive decision-making. By fostering adaptability, the model supports businesses in navigating uncertainties while maintaining compliance with national and international standards.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. There is an increasing demand for creation and restoration of tidal marshes around the world, as they provide highly valued ecosystem services. Yet, tidal marshes are strongly vulnerable to factors such as sea level rise and declining sediment supply. How fast the restored ecosystem develops, how resilient it is to sea level rise, and how this can be steered by restoration design, are key questions that are typically challenging to assess. In this paper, we apply a biogeomorphic model to a planned tidal marsh restoration by dike breaching. Our modeling approach integrates tidal hydrodynamics, sediment transport and vegetation dynamics, accounting for relevant fine-scale flow-vegetation interactions (less than 1 m2) and their impact on vegetation and landform development at the landscape scale (several km2) and on the long term (several decades). Our model performance is positively evaluated against observations of vegetation and geomorphic development in adjacent tidal marshes. Model scenarios demonstrate that the restored tidal marsh can keep pace with realistic rates of sea level rise and that its resilience is more sensitive to the availability of suspended sediments than to the rate of sea level rise. We further demonstrate that restoration design options can steer marsh resilience, as it affects the rates and spatial patterns of biogeomorphic development. By varying the width of two dike breaches, which serve as tidal inlets to the restored marsh, we show that a larger difference in the width of the two inlets leads to more diversity in restored habitats. This study showcases that biogeomorphic modeling can support management choices in restoration design to optimize tidal marsh development towards sustainable restoration goals.\n                        </jats:p>"

Here we include dissolved nitrogen from river discharge in a global 3-D ocean biogeochemistry model and study the effects on near-coastal and remote-open-ocean biogeochemistry. We find that at a steady state the biogeochemical feedbacks in the marine nitrogen cycle, nitrogen input from biological N2 fixation, and nitrogen loss via denitrification mostly compensate for the imposed yearly addition of 22.8 to 45.6 Tg of riverine nitrogen and limit the impact on global marine productivity to &lt; 2 %. Global experiments that regionally isolate river nutrient input show that the sign and strength of the feedbacks depend on the location of the river discharge and the oxygen status of the receiving marine environment. Marine productivity generally increases in proximity to the nitrogen input, but we also find a decline in productivity in the modeled Bay of Bengal and near the mouth of the Amazon River. While most of the changes are located in shelf and near-coastal oceans, nitrogen supply from the rivers can impact the open ocean, due to feedbacks or knock-on effects.\n                    </jats:p>"

Globar molecular spectroscopic technique -attenuated total reflectance-ATR-FTIR spectroscopy will be used. For this research, feed type CDC Nasser, forage type CDC haymaker, and milling types CDC Arborg and Summit with three consecutive years are studied. There are three treatments for oat samples: Treatment 1, steam pressure processing alone; Treatment 2, adding innovative fibrolytic enzyme; Treatment 3, steam pressure processing plus fibrolytic enzyme. Each treatment combination has three replications. The objectives of this research are to detect the molecular structure spectral features of processed oat endosperm tissues at a molecular and cellular level in relation to chemical profiles, protein and carbohydrate fractions, energy profiles, degradation kinetics, intestinal digestibility, microbial protein production and true nutrient supply of whole oat grains. This research reveals the interactive association between induced molecular structure changes and nutrient properties and true nutrient supply. This research is also to increase economic returns to oat producers and related dairy industries through efficient utilization of feed-type or milling type of oat grains.</jats:p>",

Anaerobic is the most dangerous (growth without oxygen) sulfate-reducing bacteria, which are present in slimy and swamp soils. Bacteria restore sulfate ions to sulfides ions, accelerating corrosion of metal. Life of aerobic bacteria occurs only in the presence of oxygen. Bacteria oxidize sulfur to sulfuric acid, the concentration of which in separate places can reach 10%. Ironobacteria absorb iron in ionic form and excrete it in the form of non-dissolved compounds. Since non-dissolved products are distributed on the metal surface unevenly, the electrochemical heterogeneity of the surface occurs, which accelerates corrosion. Microorganisms formed on the metal surface can cause not only corrosion. They can also increase the concentration of hydrogen sulfide in the environment by increasing the amount of deposits on steel hydraulic structures.\r\nThe greatest danger from the point of view of corrosion is sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), which are widespread in hydraulic environments. Sulfate renewable bacteria belong to the class of anaerobic bacteria, the vital activity of which can be without oxygen. Aerobic bacteria, such as ironbacteria (IB) and sulfur bacteria or thionic (TB), which are present in groundwater with SRB, is viable only in the presence of oxygen. Anaerobic and aerobic bacteria have a common existence environment, and therefore often the development of one species creates favorable conditions for others.</jats:p>"

Reasonable selection of medicines in the treatment of chronic bronchitis is the result of the choice of effective and safe drugs, considering the cost of the components for military health care.\nAim. To perform a pharmacoeconomic analysis of drug supply to the military personnel with chronic bronchitis.\nMaterials and methods. The materials of the study were a database of drugs registered in Ukraine, presented on the official website of the State Institution “State Expert Center” of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine. The study employed “cost – effectiveness” method, which allows comparing the cost of a particular treatment method and its effectiveness.\nResults. The scheme of the pharmacoeconomic analysis method has been offered. According to the results of the previously formed list of drugs for the treatment of military personnel with chronic bronchitis, a further analysis of the proposed range of drugs is conducted using an expert survey. By calculating the efficacy ratio within each presented pharmacotherapeutic group, a 10-item list of the most optimal drugs for the treatment of chronic bronchitis has been compiled.\nConclusions. Pharmacoeconomic analysis of medical supply to the military personnel is a constructive solution in the process of identifying manufacturers as potential suppliers of medicines to cover the needs of the medical service of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Based on the results of the pharmacoeconomic analysis of the drug supply to military personnel with chronic bronchitis, a recommended list of drugs for their treatment has been formed. However, this list can be expanded to include drugs with the highest efficacy – according to the expert assessment. In the future it may become the basis for inclusion of drugs in the clinical protocols of medical care and could be used for the development of cost standards for the relevant nosological forms, which will improve the efficiency and quality of treatment and will provide economic benefits.</jats:p>"

While there are many studies of the adsorption of heavy metals by sediment, few have considered the effects of hydrodynamic conditions. Here, the adsorption of Cu(II) by sediments under different hydrodynamic conditions was studied using a particle entrainment simulator. The sediment samples were obtained from the Poyang Lake basin in China. Models describing pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion kinetics and the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubin Radushkevich adsorption isotherms were used to evaluate the adsorption of Cu(II) by the sediments under different hydrodynamic conditions. The results showed that adsorption equilibrium for Cu(II) by the sediment was attained within 4 hours and increased with increasing shear stress; the kinetics were consistent with pseudo-second-order and Elovich models, indicating that chemical processes were involved in adsorption; the adsorption isotherms could be described by the Langmuir and Freundlich models. Changes in the sediment shear stress had little effect on the maximum adsorption capacity and values ranged from 0.9425 to 1.0634 mg/g. The results indicated that the adsorption sites for Cu(II) in soil were heterogeneous.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this paper is to investigate empirically the effect of information\nsharing and inventory management practice on firms’ performance. To achieve the\nstated objective the study targeted supply chain practices of some companies operating\nin Ethiopia. Data were collected from 170 respondents including employees,\nsuppliers, and distributors of the companies under investigation. Before the analysis\nof data, the accuracy of data entry, the existence of missing values, normality of data\ndistribution and outliers checked and proved the nonexistence of serious issues. The\nspecified objective and proposed hypotheses in this study tested by structural equation\nmodelling (SEM). The result shows information sharing and inventory management\npractices have a direct and significant effect on the firm’s performance. Similarly, the\nhigher share of information leads to better inventory management practice, which in\nturn leads to a greater performance of firms. The study concludes that information\nsharing has both direct and indirect effects on a firm's performance in the supply chain\npractices; whereas inventory management practices have a direct effect on the firm's\nperformance. Generally, the results of the study have major theoretical and practical\nimplications. Theoretically, it offers concrete evidence on the significant effects of\ninformation sharing and inventory management in the supply chain practices on firm’s\nperformance in developing countries; and hence contributes to the scarce body of\nliterature and reduces the gaps of knowledge in the developing countries on the\nspecified area of study. Besides the theoretical implication, practically the study\nallows the companies and industries under the considerations to recognize the\nsignificant effects of information sharing and inventory management practices on\nfirm’s performance and to use this information to develop and enhance culture of\ninformation sharing and usage of sound inventory management techniques in the\nsupply chain practices for the enhancement of organizational performance.</jats:p>",

Thus, this paper aimed to assess risk from catchment level to consumers in the community of Brikama.&#x0D;\nMethods: This study report assessments of risk or hazards from catchment to consumers in Brikama Water Treatment Plant (BWTP), West Coast Region, The Gambia. The various means of data collection used include water quality monitoring, visual field inspection and questionnaire survey to explore data on where the water supply system goes wrong from catchment to consumers, so as to provide an improvement plan.&#x0D;\nResults: Overall, the day-to-day administration of services at BWTP was very impressive. The fencing of all the 17 boreholes at catchment sites has drastically reduced the risk of contamination including treatment systems and distribution lines. There are less risks observed and constant monitoring of the system was ensured. However, at the consumer end, there are some risks with poor practices associated with water handling, storage and hygiene measures at the household level. Some still use some unclean 20-liter containers to store water and indiscriminately kept drinking cups on the floor and unclean surfaces, and 50% lacked WASH knowledge related to water treatment, such as boiling and filtration at households. The overall perception of water storage, sanitation and hygiene practices could be rated moderately good.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The overall findings of this study have shown tremendous achievement in the government's commitment to providing potable water to the people in Brikama Local Government Area. WASH education in the study area is recommended to avoid waterborne disease infections.</jats:p>"

The paper addresses a comprehensive problem in comparison with the classical problem of the wear theory. With regard to the given details, factors that cause a decrease in the operating time were introduced to determine the operating time before electrical wear of the power supply unit. The study employs methods of the fuzzy (uncertain) set theory. The uncertainty of quantities in the fuzzy set theory is set by the membership function, which determines the degree of its fuzziness. In accordance with fuzzy set methods, a membership function is constructed to estimate fuzziness of the function of a shrinking time resource of operating time before wear. In <jats:italic>Mathcad</jats:italic>, the authors have developed a computational module for estimating the fuzzy time (due to inaccuracy of the initial data) subtracted from the total operating time before electrical wear of the berthing power supply unit. To improve the reliability of power supply to seaports and reduce accidents, new technical and organizational measures are being developed. Therefore, the task is formulated to ensure serviceability of the power supply system with due regard to its interactions with various subsystems.</jats:p>",

Interior ocean oxygen concentrations respond to changes in ventilation that supply oxygen and the demand of biogeochemical processes that consume oxygen. A better understanding of their regional importance would improve confidence in Earth System Model projections, which underpin ecosystem risk and vulnerability assessments. Using a hindcast reanalysis simulation, we find that oxygen trends between 1975 and 2014 in low‐oxygen zones along eastern margins are strongly affected by biogeochemical processes that alter oxygen demand, while oxygen‐rich regions of the open ocean are driven by ventilation changes. A similar regional distinction emerges among CMIP6 Earth System Models. Therefore, while biogeochemical functioning is an important source of uncertainty in low‐latitude, low‐oxygen regions, uncertainty in global trends is due to insufficient physical supply changes in Earth System Models, which is confirmed using repeat hydrographic section data in the southern mid‐latitudes.</jats:p>",

The use of activated carbon and traditional P fertilizers to overcome these challenges has proved ineffective; therefore, we sought to find an innovative and effective solution. By heating bone meal–derived organic residues in water in a closed reactor, we synthesized nonporous colloids composed of aromatic and aliphatic structures linked to P groups. X‐ray absorption near edge spectroscopy analysis revealed that the materials contain mostly bioavailable forms of P (i.e., adsorbed P and magnesium‐bearing brushite). The capacity of the materials to adsorb organic contaminants was investigated using benzene and batch isotherm experiments. The adsorption isotherms were fitted to the linearized Freundlich model; isotherm capacity (log<jats:italic>K</jats:italic><jats:sub>F</jats:sub>) values for the materials ranged between 1.6 and 2.8 μg g<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>. These results indicate that the colloidal materials have a high affinity for organic contaminants. This, coupled with their possession of bioavailable P, should make them effective amendments for in situ groundwater bioremediation. Also, the materials’ chemical properties suggest that they are not recalcitrant, implying that they will not become potential contaminants when released into the environment.</jats:p>",

The aim is to extend the literature on labor and global production networks by addressing the underexplored dimension of the everyday practices of work organization and by centering the interdependence of economic and socio‐cultural relations. Taking a feminist social reproduction perspective and drawing on insights from Quijano's coloniality of labor, the article conceptualizes the workplace at the bottom of global supply chains as a site of reproduction of colonial relations. The workplace is both internally fragmented and embedded within the structures of the local and global economy. Through the internal fragmentation, multiple forms of oppression and exploitation are reproduced. Through the external links with the structures of the local and global economy, the complexity of working lives as well as the colonial relations between employers and workers become visible.</jats:p>",

The proposed model is implemented in the GPSS World simulation automation package. Testing the simulation model involved checking its adequacy. Checking the adequacy of the simulation model, which showed the maximum value of the t-statistic of 1.424 with a critical value of 1.85, proved its compliance with the work of a real object.\nAfter completing the adequacy check, the simulation error was estimated, which was 3 % with an allowable 5 %, due to the presence of pseudo-random number generators in the simulation model. Thus, the simulation error is insignificant for this study.\nFor the cargo customs complex, an example of the simulation results is given. Based on the results of simulation modeling, it is possible to determine: the optimal type of the logistics supply chain and the optimal structure of the cargo customs complex. A wide range of tasks that the proposed simulation model can solve is presented. Thus, the developed simulation model will make it possible to analyze and improve the modes of operation of the cargo customs complex.

Using large‐scale longitudinal data to test the proposed model, we find empirical evidence that a supplier's environmental and product performance relate positively to greater customer dependence and improved financial performance across diverse sets of industries. However, the findings also reveal that both demand‐driven and supply‐side uncertainty can weaken the effect. Specifically, the positive effect of environmental performance tends to weaken in the face of supply‐side uncertainty, whereas the positive effect of product performance tends to weaken amid demand‐driven uncertainty. Accordingly, we note important nuances and contingencies for suppliers to consider when considering how investments in these CSR performance dimensions affect exchange dependence.</jats:p>",

Water supply to the City of Mutare is from three sources, Small Bridge Dam, Odzani, and the Pungwe River. The Pungwe source provides better quality water resources equivalent to the combined quantity supplied by the other two. It becomes an important source for the city, but climate change threatens the availability of water resources in the southern African region. Thus, it is imperative to quantitatively assess the impacts of a changing climate on water resources to enable the development of sustainable management alternatives. Using two carbon emission scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, the study assesses the future availability of water resources from the Pungwe River to the City of Mutare using the Pitman hydrological model applied in an uncertainty framework. Available historical streamflow observations at gauging station F14 indicate a Q<jats:sub>95</jats:sub> flow of about 2 Mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/year. Projected future water resources at the end of the 21st century show a slight increase of up to 2.38% under the low carbon emission scenario (RCP4.5) and a decrease of up to 9.73%under the high carbon emission scenario (RCP8.5). These model‐generated results are useful to water managers to plan for catchment management strategies that would ensure continuous urban water supply, and the identification and development of possible future alternative water sources.</jats:p>",

Previous works investigated the effect of money supply on inflation in several countries; however, inconsistent arguments from these studies resulted in the exploration of the correlations between money supply and inflation via a different approach in this work. This study investigates the broad money supply and consumer price index (CPI) using the Markov switching vector autoregressive model. The CPI, with 2010 as its base year, was used as a proxy for Malaysia's inflation. The broad money supply is defined as the sum of money and quasi-money. Other countries use different measurements; therefore, M3 was selected based on the monetary authority measurement of the money supply in this study. The transition probabilities and expected duration of the recession and upturn/normal states were examined using a two-regime switching VAR model. Furthermore, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Johansen cointegration, and intercept adjusted MS-VAR model with the first-order Markov process was also used in this study to estimate the observables variables. The results confirmed significant transition probabilities in the state shifting and an asymmetric economic model representing broad money and inflation correlations in Malaysia.\n\n\nKeywords: Broad Money; Consumer Price Index, Malaysia, Regime Switching, MS-VAR</jats:p>",

Physical vapor deposition (PVD) is a well‐known method for the deposition of nitride hard coatings. The application of pulse technique in power supply of conventional PVD technologies like magnetron sputtering shows a great potential for increasing the durability and lifetime of different tools and components. However, one disadvantage of conventional PVD is the line‐of‐sight characteristic. This is eliminated by means of the convection‐driven transport mechanism in high speed physical vapor deposition (HS‐PVD) technology, based on gas flow sputtering. Herein, the influence of gas flow sputtering with bipolar pulsed direct current (DC) power supply on coating properties and impact resistance of (Cr,Al,Si)N/substrate compound is investigated. Thereby, (Cr,Al,Si)N coatings are deposited onto X3CrNiMo13‐4 by HS‐PVD using continuous DC and bipolar pulsed DC supply. Nanoindentation analyses show an increase in indentation hardness using pulsed DC compared with continuous DC. Moreover, the lowest imprint depth and degree of cohesive and adhesive failures are observed in this case. These release a high potential for pulsed power supply in HS‐PVD, resulting in denser morphology, higher hardness and impact resistance compared with DC.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

As a clean energy source, LNG can nevertheless emit air pollutants, albeit at a lower level than transitional energy sources. An LNG plant capable of producing up to 126 MMTA was successfully developed and simulated in this study. A hybrid life cycle assessment model was developed to examine the social and human health impacts of the LNG supply chain’s environmental air emission formation. The Multiregional Input–Output (MRIO) database, the Aspen HYSYS model, and the LNG Maritime Transportation Emission Quantification Tool are the key sources of information for this extensive novel study. We began our research by grouping environmental emissions sources according to the participation of each stage in the supply chain. The MDEA Sweetening plant, LNG loading (export terminal), and LNG transportation stages were discovered to have the maximum air emissions. The midpoint air emissions data estimated each stage’s CO2-eq, NOx-eq, and PM2.5-eq emissions per unit LNG generated. According to the midpoint analysis results, the LNG loading terminal has the most considerable normalized CO2-eq and NOx-eq emission contribution across all LNG supply chain stages. Furthermore, the most incredible intensity value for normalized PM2.5-eq was recorded in the SRU and TGTU units. Following the midpoint results, the social human health impact findings were calculated using ReCiPe 2016 characterization factors to quantify the daily loss of life associated with the LNG process chain. SRU and TGTU units have the most significant social human health impact, followed by LNG loading (export terminal) with about 7409.0 and 1203.9 (DALY/million Ton LNG produced annually), respectively. Natural gas extraction and NGL recovery and fractionation units are the lowest for social human health consequences.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) has become the best option for supplying electricity to sites remote from the central power system because of its sustainability, environmental friendliness, and its low cost of energy compared to many conventional sources such as diesel generators. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources, there is a need however for an energy storage system (ESS) to store the surplus energy and feed the energy deficit. Most renewable sources used battery storage systems (BSS), a green hydrogen storage system (GHSS), and a diesel generator as a backup for these sources. Batteries are very expensive and have a very short lifetime, and GHSS have a very expensive initial cost and many security issues. In this paper, a system consisting of wind turbines and a photovoltaic (PV) array with a pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) system as the main energy storage to replace the expensive and short lifetime batteries is proposed. The proposed system is built to feed a remote area called Dumah Aljandal in the north of Saudi Arabia. A smart grid is used via a novel demand response strategy (DRS) with a dynamic tariff to reduce the size of the components and it reduces the cost of energy compared to a flat tariff. The use of the PHES with smart DRS reduced the cost of energy by 34.2%, and 41.1% compared to the use of BSS and GHSS as an ESS, respectively. Moreover, the use of 100% green energy sources will avoid the emission of an estimated 2.5 million tons of greenhouse gases every year. The proposed system will use a novel optimization algorithm called the gradually reduced particles of particle swarm optimization (GRP-PSO) algorithm to enhance the exploration and exploitation during the searching iterations. The GRP-PSO reduces the convergence time to 58% compared to the average convergence time of 10 optimization algorithms used for comparison. A sensitivity analysis study is introduced in this paper in which the effect of ±20% change in wind speed and solar irradiance are selected and the system showed a low effect of these resources on the Levelized cost of energy of the HRES. These outstanding results proved the superiority of using a pumped-storage system with a dynamic tariff demand response strategy compared to the other energy storage systems with flat-rate tariffs.</jats:p>"

In addition, the long-term performance of the membrane operation under the fluxes of 60, 70, 80 and 90 L/(m2·h) was also investigated, and kinetic models were established. The experimental results showed that the integrated process had positive impaction of algae, CODMn, UV254 and NH3-N removal, and the removal rates were 95.89 ± 1.52, 76.18 ± 4.38, 72.06 ± 4.72 and 81.31 ± 6.71%, respectively. The CUF process was prone to increase the formation potentials of DBPs. Although ozone could reduce the formation risks of chlorinated trihalomethanes (THMs) to a certain extent, it is ineffective to reduce those of brominated THMs and haloacetic acids (HAA5). However, the CUF–O3–BAC process was an effective technology for the removal of THMs and HAA5 precursors in drinking water treatment. Finally, it was found that the relationship between transmembrane pressure (TMP) and time conformed to the first-order and second-order kinetic models, and the linear fitting coefficients were all above 90%.</jats:p>",

Firstly, the responsive electrical and thermal loads on the demand side are divided into three types according to their types, namely, translatable, transferrable and reducible, and the demand response models are constructed to improve the fineness of the optimization on the demand side. Then, the scenario method is used to solve the uncertainty problem of wind power. Meanwhile, the influence of the energy storage side on system scheduling is considered.

A prerequisite for the operation of hydrogen-fired gas turbines is the availability of sufficient quantities of hydrogen. The combination of electrolysis and renewable power generation is currently considered the most relevant pathway for the large-scale production of CO2-neutral hydrogen. Regarding the fuel supply of hydrogen-fired gas turbines, this pathway is associated with various technical and economic challenges. This applies in particular to configurations in which electrolyzers and hydrogen storage capacities are installed directly at gas turbine sites to avoid hydrogen transport. Considering an exemplary system configuration, this study extends prior model-based investigations by focusing on the economic viability of the on-site fuel supply of hydrogen-fired gas turbines. The impact of various design parameters and operational strategies is analyzed using the levelized cost of hydrogen as the main economic indicator. The study reveals that the investigated on-site hydrogen production is not economically viable within the current (2019) framework of the German energy sector. Assuming the extensive availability of renewable power generation in the long-term, additional investigations indicate that on-site hydrogen production and storage systems for gas turbines could potentially become economically viable if various advantageous conditions are met. These conditions include a sufficient availability of inexpensive renewable power for the operation of electrolyzers as well as a sufficient utilization of on-site hydrogen storage capacities to justify corresponding capital expenditures.</jats:p>",

Using confidential individual‐level data from the National Agricultural Workers Survey (NAWS) for the decade between 2007 and 2016, we employ a difference‐in‐differences econometric model to compare workers in states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 to workers in states that did not. We find that, following the ACA Medicaid expansions, documented agricultural workers experience a 12‐percentage point (24%) increase in the likelihood of having health insurance, which is entirely driven by an increase in the likelihood of having a government‐sponsored health insurance plan. We do not detect a decrease in private (employer‐sponsored or worker‐acquired) health insurance coverage. Further, we find no evidence that the ACA Medicaid expansions led to a decline in farm workers' labor supply; in fact, our results imply that there was a small increase in farm workers' hours. In a number of falsification tests, we also show that the Medicaid expansions do not appear to have an impact on undocumented (unauthorized) farm workers' health care utilization, and there was no increase in Medicaid payments for health services among this group of farm workers who were largely ineligible for Medicaid.</jats:p>",

Method: The convenience sample consisted of 44 family farmers from nine cooperatives and associations located in eight different mesoregions of the state of Paraná that supplied organic food to the PNAE. An online survey was conducted to evaluate the farmers' opinion on possible changes in the cooperatives' revenue and organization; diversification and production increase; difficulties in commercialization; increase in income, and improvement in food consumption after supplying to the PNAE. Results: According to the farmers’ opinion, there was better organization (100%) and an increase in the cooperatives' revenue and production (86.36%), after supplying to the PNAE. 75% of the farmers diversified their crops and 52.3% reported an increase of up to 25% in their family income. In addition, it was reported a better acceptance of the school feeding, diversification in the family's diet, improved self-esteem, closeness between producers and consumers, and the return of family members to the rural property. Conclusion: In the opinion of family farmers, PNAE has been fulfilling its role as a promoter of Food and Nutritional Security in the development of healthy habits, besides contributing to the increase in family income and promoting local sustainable development, following the World Health Organization's agenda.</jats:p>"

The current progress with residential building sector carbon neutrality is slow and, hence, acceleration in action is required. The heat pump (HP) technology was found to be a potential candidate for sustainable development instead of fossil fuel-based oil/gas boilers, but improvement in its coefficient of performance (COP) is essential to compete with the lower gas/oil unit energy cost. The number of studies found in the literature were very limited, with the customized prototype development in the context of Northern Ireland, but without considering the simultaneous impact of heat supply temperature and operating mode of control for performance improvement in different property types. It is evidenced in the literature that the variable speed capacity control approach could improve the annual performance, but the literature has not looked into the compressor efficiencies challenges. In this study, steady state testing with a range of fixed constant heat loads (3–18 KW), done by varying compressor speed and its impact on COP, compressor efficiencies, and inverter losses, was established. The HP performance was measured and evaluated at low (35 °C)-to-medium (45 °C) and high (55 °C) heat supply temperature levels under the controlled laboratory conditions over the experienced ambient temperature. According to the result the COP values varies according to heat supply temperature, ambient temperature conditions, and heating capacity. The HP annual performances with Irish housing stock were evaluated in two modes of control and three case studies (C1, C2, C3) based on the experimentally validated model. The heat load demand in five property types with four age periods were considered in the analysis. The system could meet the required heat load demand for all property types in VSM with different percentage improvements in performance in comparison to FSM depending on the considered case level of the heat supply temperature (C1, C2, C3).</jats:p>"

Compared with bank credit, we find that every member can make more profit under trade credit when only one financing channel is available. When both bank credit and trade credit are available, the retailers’ financing strategy highly depends on the interest rates charged by the creditors. In addition, we also examine the impact of financing channels on emission abatement. It shows that the manufacturer reduces more carbon emissions under trade credit. Interestingly, the emission abatement has nothing to do with trade credit interest rate when retailers only adopt trade credit, whereas it is closely related to trade credit interest rate under dual-channel financing.</jats:p>",

The driving forces behind resilience were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). CSO-PPC was used to evaluate resilience for the 12 farms in the Hongxinglong Administration, and PCA was applied to select the key factors driving their resilience. Results showed that the key factors were per capita water, unit area grain yield, application of fertilizer per unit cultivated area and the proportion of cultivated land, which were closely related to human production and planting area. Overall water resources system resilience had improved by 2011 compared to 2005. Specifically, water resources system resilience grades for the 12 farms were divided into five levels from inferior to superior, i.e. I to V. After six years of development, the resilience of eight farms had improved. Farm Youyi and Farm 853 were upgraded from inferior level II to the best level V. However, according to the data, four farms still had low resilience that had not improved in recent years. Further results showed that the driving forces decreased from 1998 to 2003 and increased from 2003 to 2011.</jats:p>",

A typical commercial VTOL class drone with electric power was selected for analysis. Concepts of power supply supported by photovoltaic cells have been developed. Analysis of the potential change in performance through the use of such support are presented on the basis of the UAV simulation model and the model-based design. The simulation model takes into account not only the flight parameters of the drone, but also the drive system with the power supply system and the assumed variable lighting parameters. Such a multidisciplinary model was used to analyse the functional parameters. The analysis also includes hypothetical changes in the performance parameters of photovoltaic cells and their impact on the change in UAV performance as well as the impact of changes in the airframe geometry on the profitability of using such a solution.</jats:p>",

The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of supply chain integration and agile practices on lead-time reduction at Dubai HealthCare City. An empirical survey has been conducted in which the data were retrieved from 150 respondents and then analyzed using SPSS to examine the model.  The result also showed a positive relationship between supply chain integration and lead-time reduction. Meanwhile, results indicated a positive relationship between agile practices on lead-time reduction. The study recommends promoting companies’ capabilities through flexibility and information sharing to achieve supply chain integration and agile practices such as responsiveness and alertness.</p>",

The strategy was composed of initializing acceptable time slot allocations, reallocating acceptable time slots, matching reference sites, and assessing time slot deviations. A strategy-oriented insertion algorithm for dynamic vehicle routing problems with hard time windows was constructed, thereby showing the proposed strategy achieves a better balance between revenue and distance than the “first come and first served” strategy. Always accepting global optimization result is not significantly better than adopting the result conditionally or based on simulated annealing theory. The distance and revenue gradually increase with the number of reference sites, while revenue/distance ratio decreases. The vehicles are available to serve more attended home delivery orders with a gradual increase in time slot interval, thereby leading to an increase of AHD and total revenue.</p>",

A dynamic programming model is proposed for jointly optimizing the preparation and inventory management of blood components under uncertainty in both the supply of whole blood and the demand for blood components to better meet demand and manage component inventory levels. The combinations of five common methods for preparing blood components with filtration and centrifugation processes are considered, which generate diverse component varieties and volumes while incurring different costs. Moreover, downward substitution among different types of red blood cells is introduced. Subsequently, an approximate dynamic programming method is proposed to solve the problem of coping with its uncertain characteristics. The results of the computational study show that the proposed model and algorithm lead to superior performance compared to the preparation method combinations currently applied in North America, Europe, and China, thus providing a helpful guide on blood component preparation and inventory management in blood banks.</jats:p>",

Pituitary adenomas commonly invade the CS through its medial wall and receive blood supply form medial branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA) (superior and inferior hypophyseal arteries). Some tumors may grow within the CS (e.g. trigeminal schwannomas, hemangiomas). These tumors are fed by all the intracavernous ICA branches. Tumors involving the CS may also displace the neurovascular structures, therefore, a better understanding of intracavernous neurovascular anatomy may reduce the postoperative morbidity associated with approaching CS tumors.

However, in the era of digitalization and globalization many researchers explored the role of digital technologies in improving sustainable performance. However, the literature on the role of collaboration and coordination in a digitally enabled supply chain (SC) to achieve sustainability is still lacking. This study aims to investigate the effect of supply chain collaboration and coordination (SCC), sustainable development strategy (SDS), digital transformation (DIT), and collaborative advantages (COA) on sustainable supply chain firm performance (SSCFP). The conceptual model is based on the relational view (RV), transaction cost economics (TCE), technology, organization and environment (TOE), and resource‐based view (RBV) theories. This study utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze data collected from 361 respondents of the automotive industry in India. The findings show that SCC positively affects SDS and DIT. SDS positively affects DIT, COA, and DIT positively affects SSCFP. DIT fully mediates the relationship between SCC and COA. The study suggests that managers can apply SCC, SDS, and DIT in series to achieve sustainable performance. However, the COA can only be enhanced in the digitalized SC. The study provides empirical evidence to policymakers and practitioners for the synergy between SCC, SDS, DIT, and COA to achieve sustainable performance in the SC's manufacturing firm.</jats:p>",

Low-temperature heat supply systems are the basis of 4th generation district heating systems, since they can significantly reduce heat losses during transportation of the heat carrier to the heat energy consumer and allow the use of heat from renewable sources, for example, heat pumps. The study focuses on analyzing the heat loss of a district heating system by comparing simulation results at a standard flow temperature and at a temperature typical of the 4th generation heat supply schedule. On the basis of the created model, the calculation of heat and hydraulic losses of the low-temperature district heating system was carried out, as well as a comparative analysis in comparison with the standard heat supply system.</jats:p>",

Consequently, deforestation continues to enter the supply chain indirectly from properties that are not monitored. Knowledge gaps and data limitations have made it challenging to close this loophole and achieve meaningful reductions in deforestation. Here we leverage our large property-level supply chain database that links together six years of records from the Animal Transport Guide (GTA), high-resolution satellite data, property boundaries, and land cover data to quantify different types of supply chain connections and characterize cattle production in Mato Grosso. We find that a relatively small number of high-volume suppliers—defined as the top 5% of cattle suppliers in terms of the volume of cattle sold–supplied 50–60% of the total volume purchased by major slaughterhouses. One-fourth of high-volume direct suppliers cleared forest between 2009–2018, and 90% of them also bought from indirect suppliers with deforestation, leading these high-volume direct suppliers to act as funnels for deforestation into the supply chain. Because they serve as important hubs in the supply chain, high-volume suppliers may represent a key starting point to expand the CAs to cover large numbers of indirect suppliers.</jats:p>"

However, few studies have compared the effect of tailwater replenishment at different time intervals on eutrophic surface freshwater. In this study, we investigated the changes of water quality, sediment, and submerged macrophytes in eutrophic water in an outdoor mesocosm in response to different tailwater replenishment time intervals [every 7 days (TW7), 14 days (TW14) and 28 days (TW28)]. An 84-day simulation experiment demonstrated that there were only significant differences in the total nitrogen (TN) concentration of the overlying water, with the lowest mean value occurring in TW28. Nevertheless, the sediment TN was lowest in TW7 with a denitrification rate of 102.9 μmol/m2/h. Tailwater replenishment also increased the nitrogen content and total biomass of Vallisneria spiralis, and TW7 had the highest total biomass of 20.19 g. Additionally, tailwater replenishment also affected plant enzyme activity, causing an increase in superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase, coupled with a decrease in malondialdehyde concentration in leaves. Overall, TW28 can be adopted as a tailwater replenishment strategy to ensure water quality, whereas TW7 can be applied without a strict water quality requirement for TN.</jats:p>",

A cooling fan flow rate can be predicted by its P-Q curve, which shows a relationship between a pressure rise at a fan (ΔP) and a supply flow rate (Q). However, in high-density packaging electronic equipment, the fan performance is affected by the mounting components around the fans, and the accurate prediction of the supply flow rate becomes difficult. This paper tried to do flow visualization around a small axial cooling fan’s impellers when the obstruction was mounted in front of the fan through CFD analysis. A relationship between the supply flow rate by the fan and the flow pattern around the impellers was investigated while changing the distance between the test fan and the obstruction. Through this study, the following results can be obtained. The fan’s flow is stable in the rotating stall region and the higher flow rate operating points regardless of whether or without the obstruction. At the lower flow rate conditions, the formation of a complex unsteady flow is reproduced. As the flow rate decreases, the flow’s separation point becomes closer to the leading edge of the impeller. In the case of obstruction, the change of the flow pattern causes a larger attack angle. As a result, fan performance is degraded.</jats:p>",

Due to the increasing demand for aquaculture products, the demand for protein sources for fish feed is also increased accordingly. Black soldier fly larvae is identified as one of the main protein sources that can be used in fish feed. Such larvae can be grown using different types of organic materials, such as food waste, agriculture waste, etc. As Malaysia is the second-largest palm oil producer in the world, therefore, a large number of agricultural wastes, also known as palm-based biomass (e.g., empty fruit bunches, mesocarp fibre, decanter cake, etc.) are generated annually. Based on the current industry practise, palm-based biomass can be converted into value-added products. However, using palm-based biomass as feedback to grow black soldier fly larvae is a relatively recent discovery. Thus, a viable supply chain model has yet to be established. In this work, a mathematical optimisation model is developed via commercial optimisation software (Lingo v. 16) to synthesise an optimum black soldier fly-based aquaculture feed supply chain that utilised palm–based biomass as the feedstock. Based on the optimised result, the annual operating cost of the aquaculture feed supply chain is estimated as RM 5.2 million.</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to quantify, in an integrated conceptual framework, the effect of N nutrition on potted grapevine growth and storage over 2 consecutive years. The consequences of using destructive measurements were investigated using a hierarchical Bayesian model. The rate and duration of leaf growth were both positively impacted by the chlorophyll content of the leaves, but they were negatively impacted by the initial carbohydrate measurements, raising a distortion in the estimation of initial reserves. The C production per unit of global radiation depended on the leaf area dynamics. The allocation of dry matter mainly relied on the phenological stage. The present study highlights the importance of using appropriate statistical methods to overcome uncertainties due to destructive measurements. The genericity of the statistical approach presented may encourage its implementation in other agronomy studies. Based on our results, a simple conceptual framework of grapevine pluriannual growth under various N supplies was built. This provides a relevant basis for a future model of C and N balance and responses to N fertilization in grapevine.</jats:p>",

However, extensive studies have to go into the feasibility evaluation for third generation biomass utilization prior to upscaling the process to commercial level. Other than comprehensive technical evaluation such as experimental studies to understand the microalgae productivity, economic evaluation of the utilization of third-generation biomass is also critical specifically in the perspective of supply chain. Therefore, the objective of this review is to lay out an overall picture to the readers the various option of approaches or methods utilized in feasibility evaluation of the microalgae-based supply chain. The outcome of the review paper indicated that approximately 58% of the papers reviewed opted for mathematical modeling with optimization whereas the remaining 42% opted for mathematical modeling without optimization.</jats:p>",

Investigation of the influence of higher harmonics of current on current distribution, voltage and power losses in the supply systems of crane trolleys and development of a calculation method for practical use. Methodology. The analytical method and the results of the modeling method were used for research. Results. Analytical relationships have been obtained that make it possible to determine the current distribution, voltage and power losses in the systems of induction feeding of crane trolleys, taking into account the composition and amplitude of the higher harmonics of the current. Originality. For the first time, analytical dependences are obtained that take into account the effect of changing the trolley parameters on the frequency in the feed systems. Numerical values have been determined for the most commonly used induction feed systems for cranes. It is shown that with an increase in the cross-section of the feed bar there is a decrease in the main, and especially additional, losses. Practical value. Theoretical relationships have been obtained that can be used to calculate the optimization of induction feed systems in the presence of higher harmonic currents arising in power systems during operation of crane semiconductor controlled electric drives.</jats:p>"

No intuito de identificar o molusco e avaliar os riscos e as potencialidades associados à segurança hídrica do reservatório, foram coletados 49 exemplares de moluscos límnicos em 4 pontos da represa. As coletas foram realizadas no dia 28/01/2019 seguindo as orientações do protocolo estabelecido pelo Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz). Os animais foram enviados ao laboratório de malacologia da Fiocruz, localizada no Rio de Janeiro, para identificação da espécie do molusco e presença de formas larvais de trematódeos. Para a pesquisa de presença de helmintos, os animais foram expostos a períodos de luz e escuro e dissecação anatômica. Dos 49 exemplares, quatro morreram antes do ensaio, foram analisados 45 moluscos, sendo estes identificados como pertencentes ao gênero Pomacea sp. Não foram observadas formas larvais de trematódeos de importância médica e veterinária. Com relação a segurança hídrica, os gastrópodes identificados podem funcionar como bioindicadores de qualidade da água, quando relacionados a concentração de matéria orgânica presente em corpos hídricos, sendo essa informação de grande importância para o processo de tratamento de água,  e para o plano de uso de múltiplos de reservatórios utilizados para abastecimento público.</jats:p>"

The experimental results show that the water softening performance per unit area of mesh cathode is better than that of a plate cathode. In addition, the softening amount per unit area of the mesh cathode can be further increased when the high-frequency (HF) power supply is applied. When the HF power supply is applied, the softening amount per unit area is 158.58 g/m2·h−1 more than when the direct current power supply is applied. In order to explore the growth mechanism of calcium carbonate, micro-analysis technology and high-speed bubble photography technology are used. The results show that the bubbles escape along the longitudinal direction of the electrode plate, and the main growth direction of calcium carbonate growth is consistent with the escape direction of the bubble; that is, the bubbles grow along the longitudinal direction of the electrode plate. The special structure of the diamond-shaped mesh cathode facilitates the growth of calcium carbonate crystals.</jats:p>",

Establishing a logistics management information system is an important means for Chinese companies to improve their logistics efficiency. This is the prerequisite for modern companies to gain a competitive advantage in the management of logistics companies. Therefore, organizations must adapt to different needs, fierce competition, and rapid strategic changes. This is a powerful supplement to the nature of logistics companies. The logistics management information system has continuously experienced the processes of MRP, MRP II, and ERP. This article aims to study how to use computers in logistics management to create an ERP system-based enterprise logistics information management system. This article puts forward the development significance of logistics information management system, uses ERP system to analyze complex logistics business in detail, and designs the overall framework, specific functions, and data model of the system in detail. The experimental results of this paper show that the ERP system has important application value in the logistics information management system of supply chain enterprises, and it can effectively increase the value of customer satisfaction by 86.7%.</jats:p>",

Lean Six Sigma (LSS), a continuous improvement approach, aims to drive efficiencies and standardisation in processes, and while well established in the manufacturing and supply chain industries, also has relevance in healthcare supply chain management. This study outlines the application of LSS tools and techniques within the supply chain of an Operating Room (OR) setting in a private hospital in Dublin, Ireland. A pre-/post-intervention design was employed following the Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control (DMAIC) framework and applying LSS methodology to redesign the current process for stock management both within the OR storage area and within a pilot OR suite, through collaborative, inclusive, and participatory engagement with staff. A set of improvements were implemented to standardise and streamline the stock management in both areas. The main outcomes from the improvements implemented were an overall reduction in the value of stock held within the operating theatre by 17.7%, a reduction in the value of stock going out of date by 91.7%, and a reduction in the time spent by clinical staff preparing stock required for procedures by 45%, all demonstrating the effectiveness of LSS in healthcare supply chain management.</jats:p>"

Studies suggested that cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) is expressed in bone tissue and it plays a positive role in osteogenesis. However, whether CB2 could enhance bone formation and blood supply in GC-induced ONFH remains unknown. In this study, we focused on the effect of CB2 in GC-induced ONFH and possible mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. By using GC-induced ONFH rat model, rat-bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to address the interaction of CB2 in vitro and in vivo, we evaluate the osteogenic and angiogenic effect variation and possible mechanisms. Micro-CT, histological staining, angiography, calcein labeling, Alizarin red staining (ARS), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, TUNEL staining, migration assay, scratch assay, and tube formation were applied in this study. Our results showed that selective activation of CB2 alleviates GC-induced ONFH. The activation of CB2 strengthened the osteogenic activity of BMSCs under the influence of GCs by promotion of GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, CB2 promoted HUVECs migration and tube-forming capacities. Our findings indicated that CB2 may serve as a rational new treatment strategy against GC-induced ONFH by osteogenesis activation and maintenance of blood supply.</jats:p>"

In this study, we present a modular simulation concept that allows the planning of decentralised energy systems for buildings and building blocks. In comparison to related studies, we use a simulation model for energy planning with a high time-resolution from the perspective of the energy system planner. In this study, we address the challenges of the grid connection in combination with an increasing number of electric vehicles (EV) in the future. The here developed model is applied for an innovative building block in Germany with a photovoltaic (PV) system, a combined heat and power (CHP) unit, battery storage and electric vehicles. The results of the simulation are validated with real-life data to illustrate the practical relevance and show that our simulation model is able to support the planning of decentralised energy systems. We demonstrate that without anticipating future electric vehicle charging, the system configurations could be sub-optimal if complete self-sufficiency is the objective: in our case study, the rate of self-sufficiency of the net-zero energy building will be lowered from 100% to 91% if considering electric vehicles. Furthermore, our simulation shows that a peak minimising operation strategy with a battery can prevent grid overloads caused by EV charging in the future. Simulating different battery operation strategies can further help to implement the most useful strategy, without interruption of the current operation.</jats:p>"

The study examines whether OPIs affect the adoption of EAA for SCM in SMEs within Capricorn District Municipality. The paper exploits the original data set of 310 SMEs, targeting predominantly both SMEs’ owners and managers to run linear regression models with the dependent variable “actual adoption of EAA” and independent variable “OPIs”. A novel piece of authenticity for the models is the incorporation of OPIs within the SCM activities and whether there were any, collaborative influences affecting the adoption of EAA.

It is considered that IA is treated with the subgroup “D04A A – Antihistamines for topical application”, which has only 5 drugs (including release forms); among them 80 % of medicines are foreign, 60 % are produced in the form of a gel. It is very insufficient because of the fact that there are consequences of insect bites during the local therapy of children since constant scratching of the bite sites is a threat of infection of wounds and delay their healing.Conclusions.

Hence, the aim of the present work is to design a self-sufficient system for a one-family house by coupling a solar photovoltaic array and an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). The first step is the selection of the photovoltaic panel by using PV-SYST 7.0 software. Then, the hydrogen production system is calculated by coupling the electrolyzer and photovoltaic panel current–potential curves. A fuel cell is selected to use the hydrogen produced when solar energy is not available. Finally, the hydrogen storage tank is also estimated to store hydrogen for a design basis of four consecutive cloudy days according to the hydrogen consumption of the fuel cell. The whole system is designed by a simple procedure for a specific location in Ciudad Real (Spain) for January, which is known as the coldest month of the year. The simple procedure described in this work could be used elsewhere and demonstrated that the hydrogen production at low scale is a suitable technology to use renewable energy for self-energy supporting in a residential application without any connection to the grid.</jats:p>"

Existing studies have adopted either static or dynamic approaches to assess the resilience of water supply systems without combining the two. Previous literature mostly establishes rigid quantitative metrics for resilience assessment, often without depicting the dynamics and adaptability of system resilience. For example, these studies usually fail to provide a critical point for identifying system resilience. To accurately describe the dynamics and adaptability of water supply system resilience under uncertain scenarios, in this study, we constructed a comprehensive framework based on the qualitative assessment of the input parameters, combining static and dynamic assessment, with the latter playing a dominant role based on the system perspective of pressure–state–influence–response. Taking Qingdao as a case study, we combined this framework with the system resilience theory, and statically assessed the five types of capitals and three attributes of resilience with the capital portfolio approach (CPA). Then, we dynamically assessed the resilience of urban water supply systems and identified critical points with the dynamic socio-technical model coupled with system resilience and the fitting analysis method. The results are as follows: (1) the static assessment results demonstrate an imbalanced development in the levels of the five types of capitals (financial capital, management efficiency, infrastructure, available water resources, and adaptation) and three attributes (robustness, recoverability, and adaptability) in the water supply systems of Qingdao. (2) The dynamic assessment results show that the current resilience trajectory of the water supply systems in Qingdao is that of a city in transition. (3) The fitting analysis shows that robustness (RB) has a linear relationship with resilience, recoverability (RE) has a non-linear relationship with resilience, and the critical points are RB = 0.70 and RE = 1.20. The research findings provide a reference for studying resilience mechanisms, internal attribute relationships, and resilience enhancement measures of urban water supply systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In developing countries, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set by the United Nations and the expectations expressed by modern local populations call for universal water access through individual connections (IC), to be achieved by 2030. An ambitious target such as this presents the challenge of how best to achieve the goal of funding high-quality but expensive water supply systems, to serve populations with low incomes. This raises the question of the assessment of the relevant households’ willingness to pay (WTP) for improved water service in rural areas, in particular in the context of developing countries. This paper examines this issue using a case study in Tunisia. As with other developing countries, Tunisia faces difficult challenges: the increasing demand for water and the inherent cost that is involved must be met whilst climate change is likely to increase the pressure on already stressed resources. </jats:p><jats:p> The approach applied in this paper is to assess the households’ WTP using a contingent valuation (CV) method in a dedicated field household survey in Central Tunisia. The particular governorate in which the survey was conducted was facing at the time of this study high social expectations, in particular, coming under increasing demand from inhabitants of rural communities to be individually connected to water supplies in the same way as their urban counterparts who were served by SONEDE, the national utility company. </jats:p><jats:p> The results of the survey reveal that non-SONEDE-piped households were not willing to pay the amount required in order to have an individual connection (the average bid was USD 443 whereas the expected contribution is above USD 800). It was found that a household’s WTP for an individual connection had a direct relationship with its trust in the current water management model, alternative modes of supply, and its socio-economic characteristics. However, if already connected, households would be willing to pay more than their current water expenses, although the amount they were willing to pay was still lower than the sustainable water cost enabling long-term maintenance of the system. </jats:p><jats:p> SONEDE-piped households stated a clear WTP the amount required to keep water services for the future (average bid of USD 14 to add to their current quarterly water bill of USD 14). Based on these results, this paper concludes by highlighting several policy implications. </jats:p>",

However historically, access to good quality placements has been a barrier to increasing pre-registration training numbers. This article focuses on work carried out by Health Education England (HEE) to gain insights on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on capacity. Using a pragmatic, embedded mixed-methods approach, insights were gathered using an online workshop, crowdsourcing, open for two weeks in the summer of 2020. AHP placement stakeholders could vote, share ideas or comment. Descriptive data were extracted, and comments made were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Participants (N = 1,800) made over 8,500 comments. The themes identified included: diversity of placement opportunity, improved placement coordination, a more joined-up system, supervision models and educator capacity. Alongside considering the challenges to placement capacity, several areas of innovative practice owing to the pandemic were highlighted. Generated insights have shaped the aims and objectives of the Health Education (HEE) pre-registration AHP student practice learning programme for 2020/2021 and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the delivery of AHP placements. In the absence of face-to-face activities, crowdsourcing provided an online data collection tool offering stakeholders an opportunity to engage with the placement capacity agenda and share learning. Findings have shaped the HEE approach to short-term placement recovery and long-term growth.</jats:p>"

However, in some boreholes, a start-up duration of several months is required to reach the required removal capacity, leading to significant water losses. Moreover, in specific industrial cases, no exogenous biomass under the form of backwash water or activated sludge can be added to accelerate the process, and different approaches are seldom considered in the literature. With the aim of saving water, start-up strategies coupling water temperature increase and substrate dosing were studied to accelerate the installation of biological activities in a pilot plant fed with borehole water. These set-ups enabled a substantial acceleration of nitrification but no improvement of manganese oxidation in the experimental conditions, although the experiments showed no clear negative influence of nitrification, through nitrite accumulation, on biological manganese oxidation. To further save energy and reduce water loss, outlet water recirculation at a rate of 75% during the start-up phase was validated. The proposed start-up strategy enabled the complete installation of active biofilms with a mean start-up time reduction of 36% and water use reduction of 84% compared to the reference natural conditions.</jats:p>",

Mitigation of these threats is dependent on the ability to predict variations in NARW occurrence. North of the Mid-Atlantic Bight, the distribution of NARWs is influenced by their prey, mainly copepods of the genus Calanus. We review factors that promote suitable foraging habitat from areas where NARWs have been observed feeding. We then synthesize our findings within a conceptual framework in which availability (i.e. shallow prey depth), supply, and aggregation of prey occur together to facilitate suitable foraging habitat. By definition, the depth of prey on the shelf is constrained to ≤200 m and other mechanisms may occur locally that further enhance prey availability. Enhanced production of prey occurs in coastal currents, which transport the copepods to NARW foraging areas. Prey concentrating mechanisms are not well-characterized. Information gaps that impede rapid and dynamic prediction of suitable foraging habitat include limited data on the spatial and temporal variation of prey and environmental conditions at local scales (i.e. 0.1–1 km), motility of prey, and diving behaviour of NARWs.</jats:p>",

It was hypothesized that the reasons behind this fact relate to C:N:P stoichiometric modifications in these species that impair the conversion rates of accumulated nutrients in the stems, which could be attenuated by supplying silicon (Si) to the crops. Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of water deficit in sugarcane and energy cane ratoons in the presence and absence of Si, in the C:N:P stoichiometry of stems, in the use efficiency of these nutrients and in the accumulation of dry matter in stems. Two experiments were carried out, using sugarcane (<jats:italic>Saccharum officinarum</jats:italic>) and energy cane (<jats:italic>S. spontaneum</jats:italic>), cultivated in pots filled with a Typic Quartzipisamment. The treatments for both experiments were arranged in a factorial scheme 2 × 2, without (70% of the soil’s water retention capacity) and with (30% of the capacity) water deficit, without and with the application of Si via fertirrigation, associated with foliar pulverization, both at a concentration of 2.5 mmol L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, arranged in randomized blocks. The reduction in dry matter production of stems in both species caused by water deficit was due to modifications of the C, N and P stoichiometric homeostasis, but the benefit of Si in these plants when increasing dry matter production was not a reflection of the change in homeostasis, thus it may be involved in other mechanisms that remain unknown and should be further studied.</jats:p>"

Recent climate change and vegetation greening have important implications for global terrestrial hydrological cycles and other\necosystem functions, raising concerns about the watershed water supply\ncapacity for large water diversion projects. To address this\nemerging concern, we built a hybrid model based on the Coupled Carbon and\nWater (CCW) and Water Supply Stress Index (WaSSI) models and conducted a\ncase study on the upper Han River basin (UHRB) in Central China that serves as the water source area to the middle route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). Significant vegetation greening occurred in the\nUHRB during 2001–2018, largely driven by the widespread afforestation in the\nregion, with the normalized difference vegetation index increasing at a rate\nof 0.5±0.1 % yr−1 (p&lt;0.05) but with no significant trends in climate during the same period (albeit with large interannual\nvariability). Annual water yield greatly decreased, and vegetation greening\nalone induced a significant decrease in water yield of 3.2±1.0 mm yr−1 (p&lt;0.05). Vegetation greening could potentially reduce\nthe annual water supply by 7.3 km3 on average, accounting for 77 % of\nthe intended annual water diversion volume of the SNWDP. Although vegetation greening can bring enormous ecosystem goods and services (e.g., carbon\nsequestration and water quality improvement), it could aggravate the\nseverity of hydrological drought. Our analysis indicated that vegetation\ngreening in the UHRB reduced about a quarter of water yield on average during drought periods. Given the future warming and drying climate is likely to\ncontinue to raise evaporative demand and exert stress on water availability,\nthe potential water yield decline induced by vegetation greening revealed by\nour study needs to be taken into account in the water resources management over the UHRB while reaping other benefits of forest protection and\necological restoration.\n                    </jats:p>"

For the dissipation inequalities associated with the Lyapunov function of each subsystem, it is assumed that the supply functions, which characterize the decay rate and ISS/iISS gains of the subsystems, are nonlinear. The change in the value of Lyapunov functions at switching instants is described by a sum of growth and gain functions, which are also nonlinear. Using the notion of average dwell-time (ADT) to limit the number of switching instants on an interval, and the notion of average activation time (AAT) to limit the activation time for unstable systems, a formula relating ADT and AAT is derived to guarantee ISS/iISS of the switched system. Case studies of switched systems with saturating dynamics and switched bilinear systems are included for illustration of the results.</jats:p>",

Foodborne illness remains prevalent throughout Pakistan because of the lack of informed risks and safe handling practices of the food preparers and handlers at each food chain point. It causes food spoilage that results in substantial economic losses to both producers (farmers) and consumers. Therefore, this article aimed to review the microbial load of meat, dairy, and seafood products and how the microbial load/population's shelf life and food quality can be affected.&#x0D;\nMethodology: During this experimental study, a total 127 samples were collected directly from different industries and included. Total bacterial count (TBC), total coliform count (TCC), fecal coliform count (FCC) and detection of Salmonella were done to check the quality of foods of animal origin collected from the different food industries from 2019 to 2020 and Pakistan standard (P.S.) of food quality was used to compare the results.&#x0D;\nResults: Among 127 analyzed samples, 27 (34.29%) samples were found contaminated with four bacterial parameters, TBC (6.35%), TCC (19%), and FCC (8.89%). At the same time, Salmonella spp were found absent in all of the samples analyzed. Among seven perishable food commodities, the higher percentage of unsatisfactory samples were observed in the chicken meat (1.62%) and beef meat samples (1.5%), while fresh milk was highly contaminated (0.9%) as compared to the powder milk (0.42%), followed by yogurt (0.26%). Shrimp (0.26%) and fish items (0.2%) showed the least percentage of unsatisfactory samples.&#x0D;\nConclusion: The results suggest that a significant quality difference is observed in the food items sold in the central region of Karachi, further representing a vulnerability to human health in terms of bacteriological hazards. Our findings suggest that safety measures should be taken seriously to stay away from possible uncertainties.</jats:p>"

This control mode provides an effective solution to high‐voltage power supply with wide‐range loads such as the traveling wave tube (TWT) power supply. Shortages in the LLC resonant converter with multiplier at light load are analyzed and a burst FM control strategy is proposed accordingly. The principle of the LLC resonant converter with multiplier under this control mode is then analyzed in detail. A ripple control strategy and zero voltage switching (ZVS) method are proposed, where the controller is implemented by digital signal processing (DSP). The prototype of a TWT power supply based on the burst FM control mode is completed accordingly. In the burst FM control mode applied in this study, ZVS is realized from light load to full load, and the efficiency at light load is improved by 7% comparing with conventional FM mode. The voltage ripple at light load is reduced by 5 V comparing with conventional burst mode.

The research methodological approach was the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) framework, which relied on data collected from 80 respondents proportionally representing impacted groups of fisheries business players in the West Java Province. The results showed that fisheries business players and the government had exercised some supply chain innovative adaptations, some of which can be considered potential adaptation strategies that will improve resilience and ensure the industry’s sustainability when similar pandemic crises occur in the future. These are (i) ensuring access to domestic and international supply chains, (ii) connecting fishery production centers with processors to reduce damage to fresh fish, (iii) creating added value using optimizing existing temporary fish storages, and (iv) promoting and delivering products through digital platform or e-commerce.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we propose a Water Governance Complexity Framework to address the complexity of water governance. Through a literature review, rapid surveys, and 79 semi-structured interviews, we propose how this framework may be operationalized using different proxies and by applying it to the case of the water supply system for domestic use in Oaxaca, Mexico. In places such as the rural communities of Oaxaca, where the state plays a partially absent role in the water supply, we found legal pluralism and diverse formal and informal stakeholders in a multi-level structure. At the local level, four modes of governance were identified, resulting from seven institutional change trajectories. These trajectories result from linear (alignment) and non-linear (resistance and adaptation) interactions between local, state, and national institutions over different periods. We provide a pragmatic framework to understand complexity through the organization and historical configurations of water governance that may be applied globally, providing a necessary starting point and solid foundation for the creation of new water policies and law reforms or transitions to the polycentric governance model to ensure the human right to water and sanitation.</jats:p>"

Here we analyze the response of a salt-marsh system to changes in sediment availability and show that, contrary to what would have been expected, marsh dynamics in the vertical plane can be insensitive to large sediment supply. We integrate sedimentological, geochronological, paleoecological, geophysical, and chemical analyses of salt-marsh sediments accumulated over the past six centuries in the Southern Venice Lagoon (Italy), and suggest that a time lag exists between enhanced river-fed clastic sediment input and its signature in the salt-marsh succession. This time lag is likely caused by the stocking of the sediment along the margins of pre-existing marshes, which started to significantly expand horizontally – rather than accrete vertically – when sediment input increased. When sediment input drastically decreased, wind waves re-suspended the river-fed deposits and distributed them over the marsh platform, eventually allowing for vertical accretion. Understanding the response of salt-marsh systems to changes in sediment supply has important implications for the management of tidal landscapes and the prediction of their evolution under the effects of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Our results highlight that the study of ultra-recent sedimentary successions needs to be carried out on the basis of a deep understanding of specific depositional dynamics.</jats:p>"

Firstly, an evaluation index system and grade standards for a regional WRCC were constructed. Then, a method for determining the connection number was proposed, which considered the micro motion between the connection number components in the system structure. Finally, an evaluation model based on set pair analysis (SPA) and partial connection number (PCN) that used subtraction set pair potential (SPP) to identify vulnerability factors was built, and identification results were compared with the total partial connection number (TPCN). The model was applied to Huaibei City, Anhui Province, China. The results showed that: the WRCC grade value was between 2 and 3 which was poor; the support and regulation subsystem grade value was between 2 and 3, and the pressure subsystem grade value was between 1 and 2. SPP identified that the support force and regulation force subsystem were the vulnerable subsystems. Eight indexes, including water resources per capita, rate of ecological water consumption and density of population, were the main indicators causing the poor WRCC, which were in good agreement with the local measured data. In addition, the SPP and TPCN were compared to further verify rationality of the connection number determination method and reliability of the identification results. The model established in this paper has strong applicability and can also be used for the dynamic evaluation of other resources, including the environment and ecological carrying capacity. The results in this study provide a scientific basis for water resources management and decision-making.</jats:p>",

Therefore, mobile emergency power source (MEPS) are a promising and feasible way to deal with extreme weather and reduce economic losses. However, the current urban power grid and transportation network are closely coupled, and the congested traffic hinders the rapid configuration of MEPSs. Therefore, this paper proposes an MEPS configuration scheme considering real-time traffic conditions. Firstly, the dynamic road traffic index (DRTI) is defined, which can fully describe the dynamic characteristics of traffic. The wavelet neural network (WNN) is used to predict the traffic flow. Then, combined with the knowledge of graph theory, an A-Star algorithm (AS) is used to determine the optimal path. Secondly, the optimal installation location of MEPSs is determined by forward–backward sweep method in distribution network. Finally, the feasibility, accuracy, and time cost of the proposed method are verified by numerical simulations, which can meet the requirements of online application.</jats:p>"

There is no general model for prehospital emergency care in traditional accessibility evaluation, and its supply-demand characteristics have also been ignored. Based on the three-step floating catchment area (3SFCA) model, the supply-demand three-step floating catchment area (SD3SFCA) model is proposed in this paper, which can express the difference between supply and demand of prehospital emergency medical services and accurately simulate unified dispatching of emergency centers. The unified dispatching behavior of emergency centers is simulated based on the potential service capacity of emergency stations with a supply-demand difference. The supply capacity of different emergency facilities is quantified from the perspective of infrastructure and technical quality. The needs of typical population densities are taken into account and adjusted by the weighting index. The validity of the model is verified, with the prehospital emergency medical service in the West Coast New District of Qingdao as an example. The results show that the model can effectively measure the accessibility level of prehospital emergency services and truly reflect the characteristics of supply and demand. Compared with previous models, the model has been significantly improved, which can provide an important reference for optimizing the allocation of prehospital emergency resources.</jats:p>",

The method sets burst thresholds in three dimensions according to different moments at a specific monitoring point, and achieves burst identification based on a classification model. First, three data features, namely, absolute pressure value, predicted deviation value obtained by pressure variation value, of historical pressure at each time step are scored based on the Western Electric Company rules. The scores represent different abnormalities. Then, the scores corresponding to the three features are used as input of the decision tree classification model. The trained model is used for detecting burst events. Results show that this method achieves 99.56% detection accuracy, indicating that it is effective for burst detection. The proposed method outperformed the single-feature-based method and provides good results in water distribution systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;An aerator is a device that utilized to produce dissolved oxygen in water through a diffusion process. Generally, the aerators employed by farmers are operated manually by an operator. The design and utilization of a smart device such as the Zelio Smart Relay is one of the objectives of this article. With the use of smart relays, it is expected that the presence of operator can be eliminated and able to reduce operational cost. The type of aerator discussed in this article is a dual turbine aerator. Each turbine has 6 blades. In order to have the smart relay to operate properly, at least 2 (two) sensors are needed as inputs, namely the light intensity and the temperature sensor. Furthermore, dissolved oxygen levels in water are categorized as high (30 mg / L) if the light intensity is higher than 100,000 lux and the temperature lower than 35&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; C. It shows in the results that the implementation of aerator has the capabilty to increase dissolved oxygen from 8 mg / L - 14.4 mg / L in 45 minutes, therefore the quantity and the quality of dissolved oxygen required by shrimp farming can be fulfilled properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BAHASA INDONESIA ABSTRACT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aerator&lt;/em&gt; adalah salah satu alat bantu yang berfungsi untuk memproduksi oksigen terlarut dalam air melalui proses difusi. Sampai saat ini, aerator yang dimanfaatkan oleh para petani pada umumnya masih bersifat manual dengan cara dioperasikan dan dikendalikan oleh tanaga operator (manusia). Perancangan dan pemanfaatan teknologi cerdas seperti &lt;em&gt;Zelio Smart Relay&lt;/em&gt; merupakan salah satu bahasan pada artikel ini. Dengan adanya pemanfaatan &lt;em&gt;smart relay&lt;/em&gt; tersebut diharapkan pekerjaan operator pada pertanian tambak udang dapat dipermudah dan mampu menekan biaya operasional. Jenis aerator yang dibahas pada artikel ini adalah aerator turbine ganda yang memiliki 6 buah sudu di tiap tiap kincirnya. Agar sistem kendali yang dirancang pada smart relay beroperasi dengan baik, maka diperlukan sedikitnya 2 (dua) buah sensor yaitu sensor intensitas cahaya dan sensor suhu yang terukur pada kolam (air). Selanjutnya kadar oksigen terlarut dalam air dikategorikan tinggi (30 mg/L) apabila intensitas cahaya &amp;gt; 100.000 lux dan untuk suhu &amp;lt; 35&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; C. Dari hasil penerapan aerator di kolam dapat diketahui bahwa aerator dengan penambahan &lt;em&gt;Zelio Smart Relay &lt;/em&gt;ini dapat bekerja sesuai dengan perancangan, yaitu dapat meningkatkan oksigen terlarut dari 8 mg/L – 14.4 mg/L dalam 45 menit, dengan demikian kuantitas oksigen terlarut yang dibutuhkan oleh pertanian udang dapat dipenuhi dengan baik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Beyond the financial sector, the use of blockchain in supply chain traceability is extremely important, although the tradeoffs between implementation difficulties and attainable effect are uncertain. Six components of blockchain-based technologies in the food supply chain were examined in this research using a technology elvaluation methodology that differentiates between six distinct components of a technology: technique, knowledge, organization, innovation, environment and product. The research aims to offer fresh crucial insights into how blockchain-based technologies may be applied in the food supply chain, as well as to further the debate on blockchain-based technologies' social and environmental implications. The findings show that blockchain is not a stand-alone technology, but rather one component in a larger system of technologies. While blockchain-based technologies are anticipated to have a wide range of effects, only a few are directly related to the blockchain: Change management and external pressure, Complexity of integrating different systems, Lack of knowledge and expertise, high investment are the impediment and constraints affecting full adoption of block chain based technologies. More study is required to establish if blockchain-based technologies enhance the sustainability of agricultural supply chains as anticipated.

In the present study, the water resources carrying capacity of the Tarim River Basin was evaluated using a multi-dimensional perspective of natural, social and economic factors based on a variable fuzzy evaluation model for the 2018 hydroclimatic conditions. Evaluation model results rated Aksu, Kizilsu, Kashi and Hotan districts as grade 2, where current use and overexploitation of water resources have reached a relatively high level combined with a limited water resources carrying capacity. Bazhou district, where the water resources carrying capacity is relatively higher, was evaluated and rated as grade 1 by the model. It is urgent to put forward some strategies in order to protect and improve the water resources carrying capacity in the Tarim River Basin, which include promoting more efficient utilization of water conservation schemes, strengthening the long-term investment in environmental protection, improving the ratio of industrial wastewater treatment and reducing the industrial water quota. The results of the present study are aimed to be a beneficial guide in the planning and management of the Tarim River Basin water resources and possibly for other similar river basins.</jats:p>",

This study develops an integrated model to assess solar photovoltaic potentials and their cost competitiveness throughout 2020 to 2060 considering multiple spatiotemporal factors. We find that the cost competitiveness of solar power allows for pairing with storage capacity to supply 7.2 PWh of grid-compatible electricity, meeting 43.2% of China’s demand in 2060 at a price lower than 2.5 US cents/kWh.</jats:p>",

Seepage wells have been widely used, whilst the groundwater and river-level variations caused by seepage wells are still unclear, and numerical models are rarely verified due to the lack of in-situ observational data, which may lead to results that are quite different from the actual conditions. To address those limitations, a large-scale pumping test was carried out near the Yellow River valley in China and a coupled seepage–pipe flow model was established using the exchange yield between the aquifer and pipe as the coupling key in this research. The coupled model was evaluated with in-situ measurement. The field observation showed that both the river and groundwater had a positive response to the pumping of the seepage wells. The simulation results indicated that our model can well estimate the pumping rate and drawdown with root-mean-square deviations of 158.235 m3/d and 0.766 m, respectively. Further, it is also found that the groundwater showed the obvious characteristics of three-dimensional flow under the influence of seepage wells and the maximum drawdown should be less than 15 m to ensure exploitation efficiency. These findings provide important information that can guide the design and construction of seepage wells to improve the rational exploitation of groundwater.</jats:p>",

To reveal the influence of IS on SC performance, this paper firstly carries out a theoretical analysis on the influencing factors of IS, SC integration and SC performance, and builds a theoretical model of the IS’s impacting on SC performance. Next, valid index data were obtained by investigating typical manufacturing enterprises in Yangtze River Delta region of China. Then, according to the dynamics system flow of IS influence on SC performance, the proposed theoretical model would be modeled from system dynamics and simulated by Vensim PLE software. The results show that IS among manufacturing SC nodes enhances the SC performance via SC integration; when SC integration is suitable for IS, SC performance will be improved as long as the IS amount is greater than zero; however, excessive IS would reduce the quality and weaken the amount of IS; overall, the degree of IS and SC integration are the key to better SC performance. This implies that how to improve IS among SC partners is a very important thing in manufacturing SC management. And, it also enlightens that enterprise managers should pay attention to establish a high-level trust relationship with SC partners, achieve high-quality IS with a wider range, and then promote the SC system more integrated to improve its operational performance.</jats:p>",

The platform has a well-known brand that can influence consumers’ purchase decisions, and it provides good-quality products with high prices, while supplier from other channels provides cheaper products but possibly with low quality, and there may even be some serious quality problems, sometimes leading to serious problems such as “free-riding” behavior by the retailer and reducing the profits of the supply chain members. First, we study the decisions of platform and retailer under centralized decision (CD) scenario, decentralized decision (DD) scenario, cost sharing contract (CS) scenario, and minimum order quantity contract (QC) scenario. Second, we found that channel conflicts have a negative impact on supply chain members under DD scenario; however, CS and QC scenarios can make the optimal empowerment level of platform the same as CD scenario and encourage retailer to order more products from platform. Finally, the improvement effect in QC and CS scenarios is affected by the substitutability of the two products, the coefficient of empowerment cost, and the reaction coefficient of product price on goodwill. Furthermore, we found that under QC scenario, only within an appropriate range can the platform and the retailer achieve a win-win situation.</jats:p>",

Their essential difference on speed, overregulation, static error is established. A method of optimization according to the criterion of current circuit speed is proposed, which allows to realize its transient characteristic during a finite number of switching intervals of the pulse-width converter. The synthesis of a digital current loop controller is performed, it allows to realize its transient characteristic without over-regulation during a finite number of switching intervals. The results obtained are based on the transfer function of a pulse-width converter, which is a link in the current loop. It is obtained for the case of deep pulse-width modulation based on the statistical linearization of piecewise-linear modulation characteristics of the channels of the pulse-width converter model. The modulation characteristics are obtained as a result of the expansion of the latitude-modular voltage for multiple values of the control coordinate in the Walsh-Fourier series. The number of Walsh functions taken into account depends on the approximation error and the cutoff frequency of the system. References 11, figures 3.</jats:p>",

Herein, glutinous‐rice‐inspired adhesive organohydrogels are developed by introducing amylopectin into a copolymer network through a “one‐pot” crosslinking procedure in a glycerol–water mixed solvent containing potassium chloride as the conductive ingredient. The organohydrogels exhibit excellent transparency (&gt;90%), conductivity, stretchability, tensile strength, adhesiveness, anti‐freezing property, and moisture retention ability. The wearable strain sensor assembled from the organohydrogels achieves a wide working range, high sensitivity (gauge factor: 8.82), low response time, and excellent reversibility, and properly responds in harsh‐temperature conditions and long‐time storage (90 days). The strain sensor is further integrated with a Bluetooth transmitter and receiver for fabricating wireless wearable sensors. Notably, a sandwich‐structured capacitive pressure sensor with organohydrogels containing reliefs as electrodes records a new gauge factor of 9.43 kPa<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and achieves a wide response range, low detection limit, and outstanding reversibility. Furthermore, detachable and durable batteries and all‐in‐one supercapacitors are also fabricated utilizing the organohydrogels as electrolytes.

We sampled 29 plots with different fire recurrences (from 0 to 4 fires over the past decades) and time since the last fire (up to 35 years; hereafter TSLF) in Southeast Spain, to assess the effect of fire recurrence and TSLF on 25 ecosystem attributes, five related ecosystem services (biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, disturbance regulation, food production, and supporting services), plus the synergies and trade-offs between them. High fire recurrence (number of fires) and TSLF interacted to determine ecosystem services but did not affect the synergies and trade-offs between them. Fire recurrence reduced many ecosystem functions and ecosystem multifunctionality. However, this effect dampened, and even became positive, for biodiversity conservation and food production services provided enough (&gt; 20 years) time to recover. The combined effects of fire recurrence and TSLF, however, reduced carbon sequestration and had no overall effects on supporting services. Disturbance regulation, in turn, diminished drastically with the first fire, with no effect of further fires or their interaction with TSLF. Our results show which ecosystem services will suffer more from an increase in fire recurrence, and where restoration and management efforts should focus to maximize the provision of those services more demanded by stakeholders.</jats:p>",

Then, we build profit functions and develop three joint pricing and corporate environmental responsibility-level decision models for centralized decision (Scenario CD), retailer Stackelberg game (Scenario RS), and manufacturer Stackelberg game (Scenario MS). Furthermore, we determine the optimal decision policies by solving developed models, and conduct sensitivity analysis of significant factors. Finally, we use a revenue-sharing contract to realize supply chain coordination and find coordination conditions for Scenario RS and MS, and further show the impacts of revenue-sharing rate and investment cost sensitivity on the conditions using numerical studies. We find that optimal joint decision policies can be affected by significant factors to a varying degree. In certain conditions, the revenue-sharing contract can coordinate online-to-offline supply chains considering corporate environmental responsibility and lateral inventory transshipment.

Therefore, this paper proposed a two-step intelligent control method known as ISOM-SAIA to solve the problem of the 24 h control and regulation of green/flexible EV energy supply stations, including four subsystems such as a photovoltaic subsystem, an energy storage subsystem, an EV charging subsystem and an EV battery changing subsystem. The proposed control method has two main innovations and contributions. One is that it reduces the computational burden by dividing the multi-dimensional mixed-integer programming problem of simultaneously optimizing the 24 h operation modes and outputs of four subsystems into two sequential tasks: the classification of data-driven operation modes and the rolling optimization of operational outputs. The other is that proper carbon transaction costs and carbon emission constraints are considered to help save costs and reduce carbon emissions. The simulation analysis conducted in this paper indicates that the proposed two-step intelligent control method can help green/flexible EV energy supply stations to optimally allocate energy flows between four subsystems, effectively respond to peak shaving and valley filling of power grid, save energy costs and reduce carbon emissions.</jats:p>"

Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have many difficulties to overcome these barriers and successfully implement this integration. Moreover, solutions for larger enterprises do not necessarily fit MSMEs, which reinforces the need to investigate the topic further. Within this context, the goals of this paper are: (i) to identify the main barriers and enablers to integrate I4.0 and sustainability in supply chains of MSMEs and (ii) to analyze the influence among these barriers and enablers, identifying the most prominent ones. A convergent parallel multimethod approach is adopted, first embracing a scoping review to identify main barriers, enablers, and associated categories. Then, conducting a panel of experts with 25 specialists in two rounds to refine and classify the identified barriers and enablers towards the perspective of MSMEs. Finally, two focus group discussions are added using the fuzzy logic and DEMATEL methods to obtain the inter-relationship of barriers and enablers for MSMEs. Research findings reveal eight barriers, eight enablers, and their respective cause-effect relationship, which are expected to help MSMEs managers and decision-makers better understand and implement the integration between I4.0 and sustainability in their supply chains.

The form of phosphorus in sediments was analyzed using field sampling. The environmental conditions with pH values of 4.0, 7.0 and 10.0 were simulated indoors to estimate the effects of pH on phosphorus release from sediments and the content change of various forms of phosphorus was studied. The results showed that in Wuliangsuhai Lake, Ca-P accounted for 54.3%, which was the largest portion of the TP. Phosphorus release was favored under acidic and alkaline conditions, and the alkaline condition was more favorable. The proportion of Fe/Mn-P and Fe/Al-P in the TP decreased with an increase in the pH, while the proportion of Ca-P in the TP increased with an increase in the pH. Under the alkaline condition (pH = 10), Ca-P in the sediment increased significantly, with an increase of 22.5%. However, Fe/Mn-P and Fe/Al-P decreased significantly, with drops of 37.3% and 44.9%, respectively. Under the acidic condition (pH = 4), Fe/Mn-P and Fe/Al-P in the sediment increased significantly, and the increases were 63.1% and 37.1%, respectively. However, Ca-P decreased significantly, with a drop of 39.2%. In general, low pH promoted the release of Ca-P, and a high pH promoted the release of Fe/Mn-P and Fe/Al-P. Wuliangsuhai Lake water is characterized by weak alkaline characteristics throughout the year, and biological available phosphorus accounts for 13.3%–20.9% of the TP, with Fe/Mn-P being the dominant form. This study revealed that the risk of phosphorus release from sediments to the overlying water was greater under alkaline conditions.</jats:p>",

For this purpose, cold‐storage management is important to avoid or mitigate the quality decay of fresh products stored in refrigerated systems. This paper explores the benefits of a two‐stage stochastic programming model for product quality through the selection of producers and the management of cold storage to mitigate deterioration and guarantee the maintenance of quality. A case study with real data from an agribusiness company is presented in the case study to illustrate and assess the suitability of the stochastic approach. Uncertainty regarding the conversion rate of fresh apples into the final dehydrated product and the purchase cost of the apples in the system are represented through scenarios generated from historical data. Recourse actions include the purchase of additional fruit and renting of additional cold stores to meet the demand. Based on the different scenarios, the value of the stochastic solution shows that modeling and solving the proposed stochastic model minimizes costs by an average of around 6.4%. In addition, the expected value of perfect information demonstrates that using a proactive strategy could reduce costs by up to 9%. These results ensure the applicability of this model in practice before and during the harvesting season for planning and replanning as uncertainty is revealed under a rolling horizon.</jats:p>",

This study considers an uncertain optimization of dynamic supply networks with risk preference and order delivery disruption. Taking the subjective utility of downstream enterprises as a reference point for the utility measurement of order delivery disruption and risk preference, this study constructs a biobjective optimization model with the goal of maximizing the downstream firm’s subjective utility and minimizing the manufacturer’s cost. The influence of each parameter in the downstream firm’s subjective utility function on the integrated optimization was analysed. The research found that the uncertain optimization model with the risk preference of downstream firms for order delivery disruption better controls the actual manufacturer’s order allocation and distribution problems when considering the downstream firms’ behaviour preference characteristics under bounded rationality. When allocating orders, manufacturers should consider that changes in order delivery disruption will cause changes in the subjective utility of downstream enterprises. In the process of multiperiod cooperation between manufacturers and downstream firms, they can obtain downstream firm risk preferences through repeated investigations.</jats:p>",
