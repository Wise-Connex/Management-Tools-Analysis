Increasing the manganese concentration from 1.0�M to 275�M reduced vegetative growth and grain yield in both cultivars, the reduction being greater for Bragg than for Lee. The reduction in grain yield at high manganese levels resulted mainly from a reduced individual seed weight and a lower number of pods, with a slight reduction in the number of fertile nodes. There was no effect of high manganese supply on oil and protein levels or on the germination percentage of harvested seed. Manganese deficiency reduced vegetative growth, advanced flower initiation and pod formation, and decreased the grain yields of both cultivars. The reduced seed yield was mainly due to a reduction in the number of pods per plant and the individual seed weight. Manganese deficiency also reduced the concentration of oil in the seeds, but there was no effect on seed protein level or on the germination percentage cf harvested seed. Seed manganese concentration increased with the supply of the nutrient, but no difference in concentration was found between the two cultivars.</jats:p>"

Home production of alcoholic beverages and consumption of surrogate alcohol showed some increase. </jats:p><jats:p> The strike affected different population groups in different ways. The frequency of arrests of homeless alcoholics was reduced to a lesser degree than was that of socially less isolated drinkers.

During the period of flowering and seed development, the swards were irrigated as required to prevent moisture stress. Watering was then continued to keep the burrs and seeds moist for a further 5 months. Depending on the strain, seed yields reached a peak between 74 days and 86 days after the onset of flowering (late August-early September). Then followed a sudden and marked decline in both the amount and number of seeds present in the four strains. By the end of February less than 20% of the seeds produced were still present in the soil. Seed germination accounted for less than 50% of the seed losses. The remainder (unrecovered seed) was presumably lost as a result of attack by pathogenic microorganisms in the soil. The results suggest that it may be difficult to obtain maximum seed yields in swards of subterranean clover. Even a relatively small (3 weeks) decrease or increase in the period for which moisture is available, compared with the optimum, can lead to markedly reduced seed yields.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>1. Circulating concentrations of glucose, propionate, lactate and pyruvate, and net exchange of these compounds across the liver and gut, were measured in lactating and non-lactating dairy cows (a) in the normal fed state, (b) before, during and after intravenous infusion of an aqueous solution of glucose, propionate or lactate (lactating cows only) in fed animals, and (c) before and during 6 days of food deprivation. 2. In the normal fed state, gut output of propionate, hepatic output of glucose and hepatic uptake of lactate were all higher in the lactating group. There was a net uptake of pyruvate across the liver in the lactating cows and a net output in the non-lactating cows. In the lactating cows there was a net uptake of lactate and pyruvate by the splanchnic bed (i.e. gut and liver combined). 3. In the lactating cows, the glucose and propionate infusions had the following effects: decrease in net hepatic uptake of lactate; a switch in pyruvate exchange across the liver from uptake to output; suppression of uptake of lactate and pyruvate by the splanchnic bed; increase in the magnitude of the liver (propionate uptake)/(glucose output) ratio. Lactate infusion did not affect hepatic propionate uptake. 4. Food deprivation increased hepatic extraction of lactate and pyruvate and decreased the liver (propionate uptake)/(glucose output) ratio in both groups. 5. It is concluded that mechanisms exist to ensure an inverse relationship between the availability to the cow of glucose or propionate and utilization by the splanchnic bed of endogenously derived lactate and pyruvate.</jats:p>",

However, at harvest the bean seeds from plants given most nitrate contained slightly more total N, as the enhanced nitrate uptake outweighed the reduction in fixation.</jats:p>",

The value of the membrane potential of 100–140 mV (minus inside) was calculated from the data of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>distribution across the valinomycin‐treated cell membrane. The treatment of cells with protono‐phoreous uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation during the exposure of transforming DNA to competent cells led to inhibition of the initial stages of genetic transformation without a detectable effect on the intracellular ATP concentration. The effects of uncouplers on the genetic transformation correlated with their effects on the value of the membrane potential. The dissipation of  by K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> and H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> fluxes catalyzed by a mixture of valinomycin and nigericin led to the inhibition of the intial stages of transformation. The inhibitory effect of valinomycin was potentiated by nigericin at low concentration and vice versa. The same efficiency of genetic transformation in the presence of either phosphate or arsenate was observed in a modified Spizizen's medium. Genetic transformation in arsenate‐containing medium preceded despite the decrease of the ATP level in the cell population. This pattern of inhibitory effects supports the concept of  being involved in the process of DNA transport in the initial stages of genetic transformation.</jats:p>",
