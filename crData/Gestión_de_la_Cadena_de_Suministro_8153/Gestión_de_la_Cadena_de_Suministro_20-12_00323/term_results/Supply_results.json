      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the theories that have dominated supply chain management (SCM) take a reductionist and static view on the supply chain and its management, promoting a global hunt for cheap labor and resources. As a result, supply chains tend to be operated without much concern for their broader contextual environment. This perspective overlooks that supply chains have become both vulnerable and harmful systems. Recent and ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political‐economic and planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article reinterprets the supply chain as a social–ecological system and leaves behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary vision of “dancing the supply chain.” A panarchy is a structure of adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of time, space, and meaning. It represents the world’s complexities more effectively than reductionist and static theories ever could, providing the basis for transformative SCM.</jats:p>",

Functioning supply chains are a critical factor in providing disaster relief and humanitarian aid to people in need. Therefore, the humanitarian sector has developed organizations, processes, procedures, and tools that support the specific situation facing this sector, which is in several ways different from a commercial setting. This chapter discusses some challenges of humanitarian operations and supply chain management (HumOSCM) for humanitarian assistance, provides an overview, and lays out some good practices and recent developments of HumOSCM. Better scholarship and practice of HumOSCM will contribute to solving grand challenges as conveyed in the Sustainable Development Goals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper communicates an idea that supply chain management is an underlying imperative to organisational resiliency within a healthcare setting. Too often organisations seem to accept the obvious as proof and emotional response leads management to believe perceived regularity and commonality is routine. Instead of looking past gut feelings, leaders instead sometimes allow emotionally driven reactivity to drive decision making despite data and other information guiding organisational requirements in other directions than the way a leader feels. Healthcare supply chain practices and process inefficiencies have been routinely discussed through an industry-specific lens. But how often has supply chain management been examined as a catalyst for organisational resilience? Well studied (and well documented) is the idea that the status quo, among healthcare business operations, is no longer affordable or tenable. By design, then, this work challenges the status quo and expounds upon the impact of incorporating multifaceted, multidisciplinary feedback among a variety of stakeholders. Change is necessary and supply chain professionals are going to have to assert themselves, in an effort to be heard, concerning improvement amid accepted operational practices and processes. Contemporary healthcare organisations are entities within an interconnected, interoperable, complex global environment; contemporary supply chains need to be thought of less as chains and more as webs of interoperable processes amid matrixed departments, sections and sub-entities throughout a healthcare environment. There remains a pervasive need, in many instances, to re-examine existent theory related to supply chain management, operations planning and contingency mitigation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The management of working conditions in global supply chains has become a pressing issue in supply chain research and practice. In the absence of effective public labor regulation, most of the focus to date has been on supplier auditing and compliance with codes of conduct. The question of how workers themselves can be part of the decent work governance architecture in a post‐Fordist era has received far less attention. Grounded in industrial democracy, this article proposes the concept of <jats:italic>worker‐driven supply chain governance</jats:italic>—the democratic participation of workers and their representatives in supply chain governance systems at both the transnational and workplace levels. It develops a sensitizing framework for understanding how buyer companies can foster decent work through enabling democratic participation of workers in their supply chains through trade unions and other representative structures. In doing so, this article demonstrates the potential of supply chain management scholarship to expand its reach through studying the role of worker representation in supply chain governance.</jats:p>",

In many instances, it has even become imperative for buyer firms to support and prepare their supply bases for uncertain economic and market environments, socially and environmentally conscious customers, advances in digital technologies, and increasing competition. Yet, research that approaches supplier development with the objective to advance all these dimensions in an integrated fashion is scarce. This study fills this void by exploring how a buyer firm may address these emerging challenges in its supply base. Specifically, an in-depth case study of LG Electronics explores how the firm designs and operates multidimensional supplier development activities to foster the stability and sustainability of its supply base while enhancing its core suppliers’ competitive capabilities. This chapter illustrates how supplier development can be taken to the next level, presents implications for managerial practice, and outlines promising future research avenues.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The flower industry today is a fairly dynamic international industry. Proof of this is the significant growth rates achieved in recent years in this area. Thus transportation of perishable goods is one of the most difficult types of delivery, and transportation of flowers is even more difficult. Because it is necessary not only to strictly adhere to the temperature regime, but also to preserve the appearance of such a demanding cargo. Conducted analysis of the flower industry has shown that market demand is stagnant, while supply is in surplus. In part, this is due to the fact that flowers are highly correlated with income, not being essential commodities. Although on the other hand, consumer demand is becoming more demanding and differentiated. The main factors influencing the market of floriculture products were identified and studied. It was noted that the market of floriculture products in Ukraine is relatively small and young, but promising and growing rapidly. In addition, it is one of the most complex and time-consuming, due to its features. First of all, the floriculture market is represented by a significant number of participants that have different basic and current resources, goals for the market, needs, and so on. Studies have shown that the floriculture industry can suffer huge losses, mainly due to the lack of proper infrastructure for storage and transportation, as well as due to the lack of control over the conditions of supply. Lack of visibility in supply chains leads to quality problems, which leads to product loss, product returns, rising costs, and time delays. In addition, changing consumer demands, an active lifestyle and an open economy are forcing manufacturers and suppliers to produce higher quality goods and constantly look for ways to optimize costs. The proposed conceptual model of floriculture supply chain management will make it possible to form a new infrastructure that will unite all the subjects of the floriculture market into a single system. Thus, we can say that the priority areas of infrastructure development of the floriculture market should be determined in terms of a systematic approach and consist in the interaction of elements of production, intermediary, floristic, design, marketing, financial, information and agricultural components. Each part of the chain must perform its function effectively in order to maintain the optimal conditions of the environment in which the products of floriculture are located, during its supply from the manufacturers to the final consumers. To this end, a combination of innovative technologies that help to manage the supply of floriculture products in real time through the supply chain was proposed. Therefore, in order to satisfy consumers, it is necessary to form an effective supply chain for floriculture products, all parts of which must work in a whole, so that end consumers can get high quality products.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The logistics outsourcing concept is to address the feasibility of using its own capabilities and sources of supply to perform certain logistics functions that the company can entrust to an external partner. However, in the current context of rapid change, it is important to make a quick and efficient decision on sources of supply: regardless of the sourcing model of the company. That is, what is the usual supply strategy for the company. Security (reliability and stability) of supplies is at the first place. Therefore, a quick decision on the optimal source of supply is the optimal solution. More precisely is the optimal combination of the use of internal resources of the company and the resources of external suppliers. Multisourcing is a type of outsourcing used by many companies in conditions of frequent changes. Unlike traditional outsourcing, the multisourcing model involves the use of several different vendors for the same product at different times. The decision depends on the level of security. For example, with multiple sources, a company can choose the best supplier for a particular task. By outsourcing certain  operations, a company can perform critical tasks on its own. These actions can achieve optimization of operating costs. However, when deciding on multisourcing, it is important to assess the risks. It is important to estimate the cost of supply according to different options. You should compare the results of calculations and compare with the risks. These actions can ensure security of supply. So, the proposed economic and mathematical model is able to help to make the right decision of the rational choice of supply channel from several alternatives and, as a consequence, to achieve the following main goals: improving the quality of supply management; reduction of the logistics cycle; reduction of supply costs; increase the reliability of supply</jats:p>"

The development of such technologies requires modeling and systematic calculations of variable modes of joint operation of local heat-consuming sys-tems. Currently used methods for calculating such operating modes of heat exchangers usually use constant parameters of heat exchangers. Such methods are not applicable in cases for large changes in temperatures and flow rates. Therefore, the calculation of variable modes of tied heat exchangers is usually performed by the method of successive approximations and is very time-consuming, which complicates the construction of a control system. In the present work, a fairly simple engineering technique is proposed for calculating the operating modes of heating stations of heat supply systems with associated heat supply. The basis of this technique is the use of previously derived analytical formulas that describe the change in the parameters of heat exchangers for various schemes of heating stations and temperature graphs of central regulation. The developed method allows the calculation of variable operating modes of the heat supply system without resorting to the method of successive approximations. The efficiency of the proposed methodology was tested on the operational data of the central heating station in the Kalinin district of Novosibirsk.</jats:p>",

The creation of social value is  highly dependent upon the construction industry supply chain which can been described as  fragmented, adversarial and wasteful. Supply chain collaboration has been improving in recent  times with increased trust and communication helping to successfully deliver project  requirements, including the creation of social value. However, progression in construction  supply chain collaboration was made pre Covid-19, the consequential UK Government  enforced lockdown, and resulting recession. As we are now in the immediate aftermath of the  initial impacts of the pandemic, this paper aims to understand if the lockdown and proceeding  recession has resulted in any supply chain procurement behaviour changes of Quantity  Surveying professionals, and how such changes may impact upon social value creation. Semi  structured interviews were conducted with seventeen main contractor Quantity Surveyors and  the results analysed using narrative analysis. The results revealed that whilst there is a lack of  supply chain collaboration generally, progress has been made in building trust and  communication amongst the supply chain to help create social value. However, changes in  supply chain management behaviours post pandemic now risk undermining social value  creation in the construction industry.</jats:p>"

This study aims to assess the perception of the citizens of the city of São Mateus, southeast Brazil, concerning the water supplied by the local WSS, and investigating the availability of other alternative sources. A survey was given to a sample of local consumers, and the results suggest that most consumers do not have a good opinion regarding the water quality, highlighting flavor, color, and intermittent supply as the main issues, especially during periods of drought. These conditions are mainly associated with the increase of the total dissolved solids in the raw water. Using private water wells is highlighted as an available alternative source for multiple domestic uses; nevertheless, this alternative may cause some concern if the exploitation of the resource is made without control.</jats:p>",

As the global textile market is interconnected, this outbreak has a global impact due to travel restrictions and raw materials shortages. This study highlights the imminent impact of COVID-19 on the TAFM industry supply chain, focusing on root-cause analysis and statistical data on consumption of textile goods, both locally and globally. There has not been any academic research on TAFM supply chain disruption. This paper has fulfilled this research gap. Our research is a two-fold study. The first part reviews the overall impact of the pandemic on the TAFM industry and conducts a text analysis on the statements collected from business reports, academic journals, market researchers’ opinions, manufacturers’ statements and business journals, in order to identify the most frequently used terms associated with supply chain disruption. The second part is a case study on a ready-made garment (RMG) industry in Bangladesh, which showed that the supply chain disruption due to COVID-19 would increase the production cost. This is alarming for garment manufacturers and exporters, as the worldwide apparel consumption is also projected to reduce during and after the pandemic. Lastly, this study forecasts the takeaways of the TAFM industry from this global pandemic and recommends a mathematical model to tackle any similar situation in future.</jats:p>"

However, firms may approach social sustainability in varying ways such as investments in employee welfare or philanthropy. Little is known about how supply chain managers consider these individual dimensions when making sourcing decisions. Therefore, this research decomposes social sustainability into dimensions of employee welfare and philanthropy to determine their effects on supplier selection. Vignette‐based experiments in a transportation context test a priori hypotheses derived from signaling theory, and post hoc qualitative insights reveal deeper understanding. Results show buyers have significant preferences to select, trust, and collaborate with suppliers who have desirable levels of employee welfare, philanthropy, and pricing. However, these findings are tempered by differential effect sizes and suggest that the practical significance of hypothesized relationships vary. These findings help refine our understanding of social sustainability conceptualizations and evolving supplier selection criteria, as well as offer timely insights for suppliers, buyers, and policymakers amidst surging demand for social sustainability.</jats:p>",

In order to fulfill CPO demand as well as increasing of CPO sales, a research to analyse the supply chain flow of CPO was conducted. This research was conducted in ABC company, which is a privately owned business entity engaged in oil palm plantations located in South Tapanuli Regency, Indonesia. Analysis of supply chain had been done by using Food Supply Chain Network (FSCN) to define the integration of key business processes provided by original suppliers that provide products, services, and information from end users to customers and other stakeholders. Result of this research clearly defined the supply chain process with a clear flow of material, information and finance. The key process of CPO supply chain is the distribution of raw materials of CPO, namely fresh fruit bunches (FFB) which were collected from privately owned oil palm plantations and nearby community gardens, then processed in mills, deliver to storage tank, and export to customers. Analysis of this case study provided a clear description of CPO supply chain and may let further researchers to easily examine the potential risks at each stages and actors of CPO supply chain.</jats:p>",

While it may be debated if Huawei is a pawn in a trade war or national security risks, it reinforces the importance of knowing one’s ecosystem. This article summarizes a panel discussion at the RSA2020 cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, titled \"How to Reduce Supply Chain Risk: Lessons from Efforts to Block Huawei\" was moderated by Craig Spiezle, founder of Agelight Advisory and Research Group, with panelists Katie Arrington, cyber information security officer of acquisitions for the U.S. Department of Defense; Donald Andy Purdy, chief security officer of Huawei Technologies USA; Bruce Schneier, security researcher and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School; and Kathryn Waldron, a fellow at R Street Institute.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As is known, the problem of determining economically justified volumes of supplies in the theory and practice of logistics management plays a key role in ensuring the efficient operation of both individual enterprises and supply chains. Logistics, which is the science of effective management of material, information and financial flows in the field of production and circulation, is closely related to such sections of operations research as mathematical programming, inventory management theory, schedule theory, queuing theory and more. Many tasks of logistics are directly related to the optimal management of stocks of raw materials, semi-finished and finished products, as well as the construction of an optimal schedule for delivery of finished products to points of consumption with the participation of trunk transport. Thus, since the issues of optimal inventory management are of paramount importance in logistics, it means the importance of inventory theory in the design and operation of various logistics systems. The article is devoted to substantiation of expediency and efficiency of additional costs of a  supply firm for  advertisement  with  the  aim to  its profit  increasing on the fixed planning horizon under supposition  that  the expected demand at point of destination may be controlled by firm.  For this problem solving the modification of classical Wilson’s model from inventory control theory is used to maximize the total profit of firm for sailing the good, taking into account ordering, delivery and storage of good costs on the planning horizon and additional cost for advertisement of good. It is assumed that buying/sailing prices of good are known, as well as daily expenses for storage of good at warehouse. It is supposed also that demand for the good is an increasing function of advertisement costs. The case of linear dependence of demand on advertisement cost is studied in details. For this particular case the optimal value of ordering party of good and optimal value of cost for advertisement are found in evident form. It is shown also that above optimization model may be generalized for the case of several kinds of good. Restrictions on the capacity of the warehouse for storage of goods and restrictions on the financial resources available to the company allocated for advertising activities are taken into account. A convex optimization problem is obtained, which can be solved numerically using the Excel application package.</jats:p>",

Even though standard economic frameworks suggest that markets and not policy makers should decide winners and losers, we urge to accelerate renewable energy competitiveness, proposing that by limiting the number of renewable technologies where resources are allocated to at government level, we reduce the time within which renewables will achieve technological price parity with fossil fuels. In turn, by analyzing the energy demand and supply curves, the study suggests that this action will also mediate the relation between quantity and price, shifting only the supply curve, leaving the demand curve unaffected. It continues by proposing the <ns4:italic>standardization of a unique renewable energy supply chain</ns4:italic> model, later defined as the SURESC model.  For such, a deep analysis on existing green technologies will be performed proposing the implementation of a hydrogen through ammonia economy via ammonia for power as key factor for success.

In order to quantify the effect when DGs access TPSS, this study proposes a method for evaluating the power supply capability and quality of TPSS which considers the access of DGs. First, the method fully considers the randomness and uncertainty of the power provided by DGs and that consumed by electrical locomotives. A comprehensive model of TPSS with the access of DGs is built by means of the stochastic model, and then the index system for evaluating the power supply capability and quality of TPSS is formulated. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation is applied to calculate the probabilistic load flow to obtain the evaluation indices. The proposed method is verified by simulating a typical TPSS in a remote mountain area. The results show that the method can quantify the power supply capability and quality of the system after the access of DGs. It can provide an intuitive conception of the power supply condition for design and operation personnel.</jats:p>",

They contribute to the occurrence of risks which have direct impacts on human life. Thus need a risk management to mitigate such impacts. One way to do so is by using Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) model for mapping the activities of blood chain. Thus, it can facilitate the identification of risk events and risk agents. Further risk events and risk agents are processed using House of Risk (HOR). While the aim of HOR1 is to identify priority of the risk events, the HOR2 arranges necessary mitigation strategies. Moreover, in this work, there are 9 risk agents chosen from HOR1 and 8 preventive actions for the mitigation. Additionally, this research develop a monitoring system that may assist to monitor the occurring risks.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a mathematical model of one-way surge tank with impedance is established based on the characteristic line method. The pressure-reducing penetration formula of the one-way surge tank including impedance loss and the calculation formula of make-up water flow are deduced. Based on these formulas, the influence of impedance hole diameter ratio (ratio of impedance hole of one-way surge tank to diameter of water pipeline) on the water hammer protection effect is analyzed, and the reasonable value range of impedance hole diameter ratio is given. The correctness of the theoretical analysis results is verified by an engineering example. The results show that the pressure and flow relationship derived from the formula are consistent with the numerical simulation results. The penetration pressure drop of the one-way surge tank is inversely proportional to the impedance size. When the impedance hole diameter ratio is less than 0.2, the penetration pressure drop will cause serious negative pressure. The make-up water flow is proportional to the size of the impedance hole, and the make-up water volume should be reduced while ensuring that the pipeline has no negative pressure.</jats:p>",

First, it provides an overview of current knowledge of groundwater resources, highlighting the rapid transformation in the way groundwater data and information is collected and shared outside of traditional official channels. Next, the chapter discusses the domestic political implications of groundwater overuse for food security and food price stability, and the additional challenges created when aquifers, or the rivers which feed them, are transboundary in nature. While the chapter recognizes the possibilities for technology to provide new data and information for groundwater decision making, it also acknowledges that groundwater governance and management is problematic worldwide. The chapter thus ends not with a vague call for “better” groundwater governance, policy, and management, but rather explores options for reducing the negative impacts of continued overuse.</p>",

This research used SEM to obtain accurate analysis and descriptive results to overview phenomena from society under study. The analysis using SEM shows that halal factors do not significantly affect consumer decisions in buying chicken. However, it was found that there was an increase in consumers in online shopping, which could create new strategies in marketing strategies.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Population growth and increasing the utilization of fossil fuels have increased carbon emissions and the global warming phenomenon with detrimental impacts on the human life and the environment. Therefore, finding a sustainable substitution for fossil fuels becomes a great challenge for all societies from all over the world. Renewable energies such as biofuels are the appropriate alternative to decrease environmental concerns.<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> This study develops a multi-objective multi-period multi-echelon biofuel supply chain (BSC) from switch grass regarding economic, environmental and social aspects of the sustainability. For considering the environmental aspect, four carbon policies are taken into account; namely the carbon cap, the carbon tax, the carbon trade and the carbon offset. The fuzzy interactive programming method is implemented to solve the multi-objective model and the fuzzy best-worst method (FMWM) is applied for weighting social objective components.<jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: To illustrate the applicability of the model, an actual case study in Iran is considered. It is revealed that different solutions are obtained for the location of switch grass resources, preprocessing centers, and bio-refineries under different carbon policies. Numerical results also demonstrate that biofuel production and transportation activities have a great share in carbon emissions and BSC costs. Applying the carbon cap policy in the proposed case study decreases the carbon emission over 14% in comparison to the basic situation. Moreover, implementing the carbon trade policy increases the total BSC profit about 11% in comparison to the basic situation. The carbon offset policy plays a significant role in improving social considerations compared with other policies. Overall, since three aspects of sustainability have appropriate values under the carbon trade policy, it can be concluded that this policy is the most appropriate policy.<jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The proposed model can aid policy makers and governments to optimize the profitability of the BSC, the carbon emission reduction, and the social consideration, simultaneously.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Construction supply chains are characterised by lack of trust and poor collaboration due to the short-term, project-based organisational structure of the construction industry. The lack of collaboration and trust among construction supply chain stakeholders affects the transparency and exchange of information, as well as the efficiency of the supply chain. Existing literature has shown that collaboration problems can be overcome through better integration, partnering and contractual governance. The latter requires some form of compatibility analysis and matching between the stakeholder profile and the appropriate contract type. This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that will assist General Contractors in dealing with the complicated relationships and risks in construction supply chains through effective contracting. The methodology employed for the purposes of our analysis is based on constructive literature review, qualitative correlation of existing research and combination of concepts drawn from the fields of construction supply chain management and stakeholder analysis. The construction supply chain is viewed as a network of stakeholders organised around a General Contractor. Borrowing principles and tools from Stakeholder Analysis, a matching mechanism is developed with the aim to facilitate General Contractors in determining the suitable contract type for different profiles of construction supply chain stakeholders. The main conclusion of this paper is that stakeholder theory and contractual management can be effectively used to tackle opportunism and its negative impacts on construction supply chains.</jats:p>"

As a potential agro-industry, the tobacco products industry requires a supply of raw materials that must meet quantity, quality and continuity. The complexity of the tobacco supply chain network and the rapidly changing world business dynamics, pose risks in its business processes. An optimal supply chain risk mitigation or risk management strategy needs for the resilience of the tobacco supply chain in the disruption. The purpose of this study is to analyze the level of risk priority and also to formulate a risk mitigation strategy for the tobacco supply chain through a business process model approach. The method of analysis is the Delphy method and the House of Risk (HoR). The business process adopted from the SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model. The results showed: the priority level of tobacco supply chain risk is: economic uncertainty, tobacco is not available at the farm level, the location of tobacco raw materials is far from production activities, product prices have risen due to customs and product demand has increased sharply. Supply chain risk of mitigation strategies includes: increasing the flow of information in the tobacco supply chain, managing the stock/supply of tobacco raw materials and processed products, evaluating distributor selection, establishing partnerships with tobacco farmers, implementing a marketing mix strategy (product, price, location, promotion), increasing coordination with relevant governments, and management of information systems and technology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organisations are challenged with executing innovation for sustainable development within the context of their operations and value networks—networks which are increasingly fuelled by mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As), and which accounted for USD 4 trillion in global deal value in 2019. While outcomes from M&amp;As may produce mixed results, merger synergies fundamentally change the environmental, social and governance (ESG) footprint of an organisation and its product-supply chain. These compounding challenges of innovation for sustainability and ESG product-supply chain due diligence are not adequately explored in the operations management literature or practically considered during M&amp;As. In this article, we consider those factors that determine “how innovative is the deal?” and explore how environmental supply chain innovation for sustainability might inform M&amp;As. A case study approach is adopted, drawing upon an exemplar deal within the global food product-supply chain for ingredient production, where high M&amp;A deal-interest and ESG sustainability considerations exist. The theoretical lens is the resource-based view (RBV) of the firm. A deal analysis framework, integrating key concepts from strategic environmental supply chain management and the M&amp;A process literature, is defined. These findings suggest that product design and technology selection factors represent sources of M&amp;A value creation when exploring an innovation for sustainability deal thesis. The implication for firms with ambitious environmental agendas or motives is that the M&amp;A process needs to be reconfigured, such that product design and technology selection, currently secondary factors, are considered primary drivers. Together, these drivers form substantive strategic considerations and new merger motives of both theoretical and practical relevance, informing a new perspective of operations sustainability targeted M&amp;A.</jats:p>"

However, paid family leave is the only policy support for working caregivers to date, which helps to balance their work and care responsibilities. I analyze the data from the 1998-2014 Health and Retirement Study to examine 1) how paid leave policies affect labor market outcomes for workers in need of caring for a spouse/partner or an older parent/-in-law and 2) how the effects differ by gender. Paid leave policy is distinguished between employer-provided leave and state government-provided leave. Using the first-difference approach, I compare the short-term and long-term changes in the extensive and intensive margins of labor with and without access to paid leave policies when a health deterioration of the older family member occurs. My preliminary results show that, without paid leave policy, the health event of a spouse/partner or an older parent/-in-law affects women’s labor supply but not men’s. Paid leave provided by an employer increases the labor supply for both women and men, with the more noticeable long-term effects for men. State paid family leave increases women’s wage and salary both in the short run and in the long run. My findings underline the importance of paid leave policy for retaining the workers in need of providing care for a family member, particularly for women.</jats:p>",

Both tactical and strategic aspects in the supply chain design are addressed by optimizing the maritime routing of a heterogeneous fleet of ships, truck connections, and the locations of the satellite terminals. The objective is to minimize the overall cost, including operation and investment costs for the selected time horizon. The model is expressed as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, applying a multi-period formulation to determine optimal storage sizes and inventory at the satellite terminals. Two case studies illustrate the model, where optimal LNG supply chains for a region with sparsely distributed island (without land transports) and a coastal region at a gulf (with both sea and land transports) are designed. The model is demonstrated to be a flexible tool suited for the initial design and feasibility analysis of small-scale LNG supply chains.</jats:p>"

The present production is able to meet only 20 per cent of the present requirement. The major pulses grown in the state are gram, arhar, greengram, lentil, blackgram and pea. A study conducted with the objective of analysing the supply demand gap of pulses in Assam, it was found that there was huge gap in requirement and supply of most of the pulses except black gram and pea and the deficit continues upto 2025, as well. The government has been trying to increase the pulses production with increase area and enhanced yield through various schemes namely NFSM-Pulse. Bringing more pulse area under irrigation, adoption of recommended production technology is expected to increase the yield that might help in bridging the demand supply gap. As blackgram was found to be surplus, the people of Assam should gradually replace lentil with blackgram as dal. Establishment of mini dal processing plant might attract the youth to grow and process pulse and thereby increase the employment opportunity and enhanced production in the state.</jats:p>",

Disruptions in international supply chains were widely reported as governments imposed containment measures (lockdowns) to halt the spread of the disease. At the same time, demand declined as households and firms scaled back spending. This paper attempts to disentangle the supply and demand channels in trade by quantifying the causal effect of supply spillovers from lockdowns. We utilize a novel dataset of daily bilateral seaborne trade, and design a shift-share identification strategy that leverages geography-induced cargo delivery lags to track the transmission of supply disruptions across space. We find strong but short-lived supply spillovers of lockdowns through international trade. Moreover, the evidence is suggestive of the downstream propagation of countries’ lockdowns through global supply chains.</jats:p>",

We developed an APD model in the form of an option contract, where the model and evaluation include the flexibility for the upstream firm to decide whether to provide a discount for an advance purchase at its own discretion. Applying the model to a Fortune 100 company, a leader in the Fast Mover Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry, showed that under certain conditions, and with suitably chosen contract parameters, management of decentralized control via APD contracts can lead to system-wide efficiency, and the individual decision makers pursue their own best interests, ensuring a win-win condition.</jats:p>"

Analyzes were carried out for deliveries to a sawmill in northern Poland, which supplies pine sawlogs and long wood assortments. The distance of deliveries on public and forest roads was determined, as well as transport work for each type of road and the total value. The transport work was defined as a multiplication of driven kilometers with the load and the weight of the load in ton kilometers. Data on the transport distance were obtained on the basis of information from the driver, and the parameters of the transported pine sawlogs from the delivery note. Based on the collected data over a period of 12 months, the transport work was determined for selected courses. The total transport work for the 1509 analyzed deliveries was 3,447,486 ton-kilometers (tkm). The average transport work for one course amounted to 2286 tkm and was characterized by a high variability SD = 1207. The minimum value of the transport work was recorded at the level of 83 tkm, and the maximum as much as 7803 tkm. The median of the analyzed deliveries was 2220 tkm, while the first quartile Q1 = 1358, and the third quartile Q3 = 2997. With very similar cargo volumes (m3) and cargo weight (kg) the transport distance and the total number of deliveries have a significant effect on the transport work performed with the transport of timber. Purchase of wood in seven forest districts located up to 50 km from the sawmill accounts for 30.1% of the analyzed deliveries (1509), resulting in only transport work at the level of 476,104 tkm, which is only 13.8% of the total transport work of all deliveries.</jats:p>"

As Croatian academic production to a large extent depends on subsidies, the paper is based on the analyses of data from seven years of subventions, which the Croatian Ministry of Sciences and Education allocates to national academic publish­ers, regardless if they are academic institutions or privately owned publish­ers. Conducted analyses provide detailed insight into the model of supply-side academic publishing and into national academic publishing in general. The topics – academic publishing and system of subsidies – have rarely been addressed in recent research. Thus, this paper offers new insights for researchers (e.g. providing knowledge about the scale and structure of academic publishing), provides evaluation possibilities for policymakers (e.g. to design the tools for monitoring and improving the system of public subsidies), and provide comparable perspective for national academic pub­lishing in the context of European academic publishing setting.</jats:p>"

The data come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), which collects information about the care of each child during his first three years and the care provided to household members during a woman’s 50s. The NLSY79 data show that women’s labor supply drops around the time a child is born and then rises, with over 50 percent working by time their children reach age 2. In addition, these data show that during their 50s, about 9 percent of women provide care to someone living in their household and that these female caregivers spend about 40 hours per week providing care. Time spent in caregiving may affect time in the labor force, and hence the ability to invest in a career and accumulate work experience and wage growth.</jats:p>",

This helps for supply chain industries in forecasting and managing the supply and demand of essential stocks for the future. Data is analyzed using prediction algorithms to check the actual and predicted values. The clustering algorithm along with rolling mean is used for half-yearly data of 2019 and 2020 to identify the sales of different categories of essential commodities.

The current world is facing an ongoing climate change along with other human-induced environmental changes. Most research has focused on the impact of increasing temperature as a major driving force for climate change, but other factors may have important impacts on plant traits and pollination too and these effects may vary between different seasons. In addition, it is likely that the effects of multiple environmental factors, such as increasing temperature, water stress, and nitrogen enrichment are not independent. Therefore, we tested the impact of three key factors – season, water, and nitrogen supply – on plant traits, pollination, and seed production in<jats:italic>Sinapis alba</jats:italic>(Brassicaceae). Plants were grown in three seasons with two levels of water and nitrogen supply in a factorial design. We collected data on multiple vegetative and floral traits and assessed the response of pollinators in the field. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of growing conditions on seed set in plants exposed to pollinators and in hand-pollinated plants. Our results show that water stress impaired vegetative growth, decreased flower production, reduced visitation by pollinators and seed set, while nitrogen availability played an important role in nectar production. Seasonality modulated the effect of water and nitrogen availability on vegetative and floral traits and strongly affected flowering phenology and flower production. We demonstrated that changes in water and nitrogen availability alter plant vegetative and floral traits, which impacts flower visitation and consequently plant reproduction. We conclude that ongoing environmental changes such as altered precipitation regimes and nitrogen enrichment may thus affect plant-pollinator interactions with negative consequences for the reproduction of wild plants and insect-pollinated crops.</jats:p>"

We study the outcomes of planning for density in established suburbs over a twenty-year period using a large site-level dataset on dwelling stock, planning regulations, and prices, in 19 planned densification areas (activity centres) comprising 25,775 sites in Brisbane, Australia. Planning rules in these areas were repeatedly relaxed to allow for higher density; a policy change that should have observable price effects. To study the effect of zoning, we create a variable for each site called zoned capacity, which is the estimated number of additional dwellings able to be built under the planning code. Only 2% of the zoned capacity was taken up in any five-year study interval. Zoned capacity doubled over the whole twenty-year study period (going from 0.9x total dwellings to 1.4x), however despite these changes, 78% of sites with zoned capacity in the first period remained undeveloped. Higher rates of new housing supply are robustly related to higher prices despite demand arguably seeing a similar increase across locations. Our zoned capacity variable has no relationship to price across numerous regression models and is robust to various data selection choices. It could be that planning is not a binding constraint on new housing in Brisbane—yet price growth over our study period is comparable to other Australian cities. This evidence suggests that private housing markets will not rapidly supply new housing and cause significant price reductions, even if the planning system allows it.</p>"

We examine optimal decisions under five scenarios to explore how the strategic cooperation between two manufacturers at the upstream horizontal level or with the retailer at the vertical level affects product pricing decisions and the performance of two supply chains? The results reveal that decisions for cooperation with competing manufacturers and opening an online channel are correlated. In the absence of an online channel, cooperation with their respective retailer can lead to a higher supply chain profit. However, if a manufacturer opens an online channel, then cooperation with competing manufacturers can lead to a higher supply chain profit. Under the vertical integration, total supply chain profit might be lower compared to a scenario where members in each supply chain remain independent.

Even so, technical challenges associated with TL measurement have led some to question their utility as a biomarker of aging. Several pre-analytical factors influence TL assessment via qPCR including tissue source, sample storage, and DNA extraction method. Additional work has investigated how conditions within the PCR run (e.g. mastermix reagents) influences precision and reproducibility of TL measurements. However, the impact of power supply remains unclear. Momentary fluctuations in power supply can affect the functioning of high-performance electronics, including real-time thermocylers. These fluctuations can be mitigated by using an uninterruptible power source (UPS), an electronic apparatus capable of supplying constant, uninterrupted voltage to high-performance electronics. The current study investigated how using a UPS influenced TL assessment via qPCR. Standard deviation and coefficient of variation across replicates were compared for samples assessed with or without the use of a UPS. Samples run with a UPS had significantly lower standard deviation (p&amp;lt;0.001) and coefficient of variation (p=0.002) than those run without a UPS. Notably, neither the efficiency of exponential amplification (p=0.674) nor the standard curve R2 (p=0.638) varied as a function of UPS status. Thus, UPS status decreases variability within sample replicates while maintaining the overall quality of the qPCR assay. *The work presented was supported by the Telomere Research Network, an NIH-sponsored working-group recently established to coordinate best practices for measuring telomere length in population-based research.</jats:p>",

How can it make the radical shifts in approach that are needed? This paper highlights the reality that the management of water, and the ways in which water flows are directed, reflects social relations of power, not just between human groups, but also between humankind and the non-human world. Drawing on in-depth ethnographic research with indigenous communities and other water users in river catchments around the world, it considers alternate cultural worldviews that encourage more sustainable beliefs and practices, and asks how larger societies might make imaginative use of these in contemporary and future engagements with water. In a thought experiment intended to reposition human–non-human relations, it proposes a concept of ‘re-imagined communities’ advocating more collaborative forms of conviviality – living together – with other species. Opening the door to ideas about pan-species democracy, it calls for decision-making processes in which a wide range of expertise is brought together to exchange knowledge, with an explicit and practical remit to ‘speak for’ and promote the needs and interests of the non-human inhabitants of the ecosystems on which all living kinds depend.</jats:p>",

Governments had to purchase vital health products swiftly whilst ensuring smooth and accountable management of ongoing contracts to continue providing public services to the citizens. Certain critical public services and infrastructure industries have a unique responsibility to continue operations even during these unprecedented times. Infrastructure development and public procurement, therefore, are at the frontline of the wider governmental response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This paper identifies needed procurement strategies that guarantees sustainability and ensures efficient economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper being an exploratory study reviews the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world’s economy and Nigeria in particular. The study also reviews theories associated with the subject matter and concludes that greater collaboration between governments andindustries will be needed to ensure minimum disruption in global supply chains that ensures effective economic recovery.

This study aims at reviewing the main topics and the most recent approaches from the academic literature in its analysis of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices developed by these intermediaries. The work has been structured around six recurring themes in most of the studies carried out: the new intermediaries that operate on the Internet; the role of travel agencies and tour operators in tourism sustainability; the influence of the size of the company; CSR as a disruptive innovation in this sector; the potential of the sustainable tourism supply chain; and the motivations and attitudes of the managers of these businesses when they engage with responsibility. This last topic is developed in greater detail since it is closely linked to the previous ones and dictates, in most cases, the meaning and function of the sustainable performance. The conclusions show how tourism intermediaries have only just begun to develop CSR policies, and those that are committed to their implementation mostly opt for actions aimed at the environment.</jats:p>"

This complexity is due to the continuous changes taking place, particularly in ensuring the quality of food products throughout the entire supply chain, from growing, procurement of resources, production, and management of stock, to distribution to the final consumers. For that, food supply chain markets have become more highly developed in the use of modern technologies, and have begun to implement them in their logistical systems to satisfy their customers’ needs. The main objectives of this review are to identify the different technological implementations in different phases of the food supply chain processes and point out the key factors for using technologies to improve the characteristics of the perishable food supply chain. A total number of 137 articles were analyzed in this research to achieve these review objectives. Some of the various technologies found in different phases of the food supply chain were radio frequency identification (RFID), the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, three-dimensional printing (3DP), autonomous vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These technologies were found in different phases of the food supply chain and improved the efficiency of supplying perishable foods. The review identified different characteristics of the perishable food supply chain. The main finding indicated that technological implementation enhances the efficiency and sustainability of the food supply chains and helps to retain perishable food characteristics.</jats:p>"

In order of their survival SMEs need to produce more, at a lower cost, in less time, and with a few defects. They form the most significant group of manufacturing firms and give supports to large companies in many supply chains. In addition, SMEs contribute greatly to entrepreneurship, gross domestic product (GDP) and employment. Despite the fact that micro, small and medium sized enterprises have very important role in business networks, they still have many problems with using supply chain management (SCM) practices. In this research my purpose was to find the best SCM practices as a strategic method to improve SMEs’ performance. First, I give information in general about SCM and the SMEs, then highlight main characteristics of small firms compared to large ones and the reasons why it is essential and efficient to use SCM practices. The article is based on secondary data, using several analysis, surveys, books, journals and my personal experiences collected in this sector. I conclude the research by summarizing my recommendations in connection with SCM practices, the opportunities and barriers.&#x0D;\nJEL code: M11</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Adaptive mutations are often associated with a fitness cost. These costs can be compensated for through the acquisition of additional mutations, or the adaptations can be lost through reversion in settings where they are no longer favored. While the dynamics of adaptation, reversion and compensation have been central features in several studies of microbial evolution, few studies have attempted to resolve the population genetics underlying how and when either compensation or reversion occur. Specifically, questions remain regarding how certain actors—the evolution of mutators and whether compensatory mutations alleviate costs fully or partially— may influence evolutionary dynamics of compensation and reversion. In this study, we attempt to explain findings from an experimental evolution study by utilizing computational and theoretical approaches towards a more refined understanding of how mutation rate and the fitness effects of compensatory mutations influence evolutionary dynamics. We find that high mutation rates increase the probability of reversion towards the wild type when compensation is only partial. However, the existence of even a single fully compensatory mutation is associated with a dramatically decreased probability of reversion to the wild type. These findings help to explain specific findings from experimental evolution, where compensation was observed in non-mutator strains, but reversion (sometimes with compensation) was observed in mutator strains, indicating that real-world compensatory mutations are often unable to fully alleviate the costs associated with resistance. Our findings emphasize the potential role of the supply and quality of mutations in crafting the evolution of antibiotic resistance, and more generally highlight the importance of population genetic context for explaining findings from experimental evolution.</jats:p>"

Therefore, researching and proposing a model to locate distribution centers, contributing to cost reduction of the fruit and vegetable supply chain is a crucial issue in Vietnam today. Therefore, using many survey methods such as in-depth interview, focus groups, face-to-face to collect a total of 439 samples in Vinh Long province, as well as secondary data from new articles, studies, research articles, other authentic sources directing the administration of provincial statistical management and yearbooks for analyzing the sweet potato supply chain in Vinh Long province of the Mekong Delta region. First, this study used mixed-integer linear programming and compromised programming based on IBM CPLEX Optimizer to choose a distribution center when trading-off between cost and transport time. Secondly, Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) for decision support based on excel software from the results of experts’ answering to increase the objectivity for determining the location of the Distribution Center as well as in accordance with both the actual situation and the comprehensive development of local socio-economy. The contribution of proposing the mathematical model is to choose a suitable place for saving costs and reducing transport times. In additon, this approach method could be applied to other Vietnamese agri-fresh products for upgrading the competitiveness, compared with other countries' agricultural products in terms of price and quality so far.</jats:p>"

The chain is interdependent sequentially and cooperate in the control, management and improvement of the flow of products, money and information from the upstream side to the downstream side. The POSC consists of palm oil seed growers, farmers, traders, CPO factory, refinery factory, distributor/retailers, and consumers. The first party in the chain is the palm oil seed or seedling growers. These growers have a very important role for palm oil farmers because the quality of the seeds determines the quality of further fruits. The aims of this study are to evaluate the feasibility study of growing the seedlings, and measure the sensitivity of the factors to the profitability. By using modified Hayami method for the supply chain, the added value obtained is Rp5.950.227.861 which is 34,73% of the sales.

Therefore, increasing labour market participation is considered an important labour market policy objective because it can counteract shortages of labour supply due to the aging population. The scope for increasing labour force participation is not limited to certain groups of people. It also has a spatial dimension. This paper therefore analyses the regional differences in the labour market participation of men and women of different age groups at the level of German district regions. In particular, we examine regional imbalances in the regional variation of labour force participation. Further relations to regional variables are examined using multiple regressions. The results of the analysis could be interpreted according to the so-called discouragement hypothesis which suggests that unfavourable regional labour market conditions have a negative impact on regional labour force participation. For the regional wage level, only a minimal, mostly positive correlation with the labour force participation can be established, which can be interpreted by the mutually compensating effects of wages. The regional qualification level shows a positive correlation with the participation of middle-aged and older people in the labour market. Finally, further evidence highlights the importance of full-time childcare facilities for the labour force participation of women and, increasingly, men.</jats:p>"

W tym celu podano wybrane definicje łańcuchów dostaw i logistyki, które posłużyły do identyfikacji systemowych współzależności i relacji między tymi kategoriami. We wstępie przedstawiono genezę i wojskowe korzenie pojęcia logistyki, która dopiero z czasem na gruncie gospodarki rynkowej zaczęła funkcjonować w strukturze rozmaitych łańcuchów dostaw. Dalej szeroko zostały omówione najbardziej popularne w literaturze definicje łańcuchów dostaw oscylujące wokół jego tradycyjnych ujęć funkcjonalno-organizacyjnych. Wskazano także na miejsce klasycznych procesów logistycznych, takich jak transport, magazynowanie i opakowania w kształtowaniu funkcjonalności łańcuchów dostaw. Usługowa logistyka pełni funkcję swoistego spoiwa łączącego poszczególne ogniwa łańcucha dostaw, gwarantując jego spójność i funkcjonalną ciągłość. Przedmiotem szczególnych analiz była dyskusja wokół podażowej lub popytowej natury łańcucha dostaw. Z punktu widzenia pryncypiów gospodarki rynkowej dominującym wyznacznikiem łańcucha dostaw powinna być jego funkcja ssąca, obrazująca prymat popytu rynkowego nad wtórną podażą rynkową. To pierwotne potrzeby klientów, czyli popyt rynkowy determinują celowość istnienia określonego łańcucha dostaw. Niestety dominujący w literaturze łańcuch dostaw jednoznacznie preferuje stronę podażową, co stanowi pewnego rodzaju antytezę gospodarki rynkowej. Z uwagi na liczne kontrowersje wokół tytułowego pojęcia „łańcuch dostaw” przeanalizowano takie jego aspekty logistyczne jak: rynkowe relacje popyt – podaż, struktura sieciowa i łańcuchowa, różnorodność asortymentowa, rozległość przestrzenna oraz generowane przez niego efekty synergiczne. Na zakończenie zbadano związki semantyczno-mnogościowe między pojęciem logistyki i łańcucha dostaw. Celem pracy był dwugłos autorów w kwestii tak bardzo dyskusyjnej i chyba nigdy niezamkniętej, jak relacje między podejściem logistycznym a pragmatyką łańcuchów dostaw. Do zbadania tego problemu posłużono się metodą przeglądu i krytyczną analizą literatury, rekapitulując w zakończeniu uwagi i wnioski płynące z przeprowadzonych badań.</jats:p>",

It is established that low-power solid fuel boilers with various types of combustion devices depending on the characteristics of the burned fuel and the accepted level of service are used in heat supply systems of premises, buildings and structures: from simple furnaces with manual maintenance to automated combustion devices of complex design. Mostly pre-prepared high-quality fuel is used for combustion: fuel pellets, briquettes, high-quality coal, the high cost of which significantly increases operating costs. In order to reduce capital and operating costs, it is advisable to introduce relatively inexpensive models of low-power heating boilers with an acceptable level of mechanization of combustion technology of cheap fuel, including local, with minimal costs for its preparation. The design of a heating water boiler with a semi-mechanical furnace and a technological scheme of combustion is proposed, which combines the processes of drying, gasification and combustion of fuel in a shaft with a clamping grate and combustion of coke in a layer on a moving grate. It is noted that the periodic supply of fuel in the furnace with a moving grate is maintained the stability of the combustion process in the combustion chamber, in the period between cleaning of ash and slag, without significant changes in the composition of above-layer gases. Due to the smooth movement of the next portion of hot coke from the fuel shaft to the combustion chamber on the rotating grate, conditions are created to maintain the uniformity of the boiler with the normative indicators. A reduction in harmful emissions in the exhaust gases was achieved during the combustion of the reaction fuel by passing a secondary blast of air through a collector and directing it to the combustion zone of light substances at the outlet of the clamping grate. Analytical equations for determining the size of the combustion zone according to the regime and design parameters of the combustion process are given. The efficiency of application of the combined (shaft-layer) technological scheme in low-power boilers was tested during testing of combustion of different quality coal in a semi-mechanical furnace with a rotating grate in the electric coal boiler with a heat output of 50 kW for railway carriages.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the data from the distribution companies and regulatory bodies are analysed to identify the inefficiencies existing in the electricity distribution to the agriculture consumers of the state of Gujarat in India. The primary causes for the inefficiencies in the system are absence of effective monitoring and correct and reliable data on the usage of electricity by agricultural consumers, and the technical loses of electricity on account of low Power Factor and poor voltage regulation. The paper proposes a comprehensive solution to address the identified problems by way of installing a Metering Reactive Compensation Unit (MRCU) independent of consumers’ energy meters. MRCU will contain capacitors for reactive compensation, relay and switching unit, metering unit for current, voltage, Kilowatt, KVARH and KWH, and LORA based communication module for 24x7 data capture. The data captured at the cloud level will be analysed by a head end software system for real time reports and corrective actions. The estimated monetary benefits from installing MRCUs for entire Gujarat’s agricultural consumers is estimated to be Rs 1500 Crore in a year, apart from an estimated energy saving of close to 2000 MUs per year.</jats:p>"

The fuzzy failure mode and effect analysis (fuzzy FMEA) approach is utilized to assess the relative importance of 45 risks. Based on the findings of the study, risks response and treatments are proposed for each sustainability-related supply chain risks. The findings show generally three most important risks are low OER (oil extraction rate), FFB (fresh fruit bunch) looting, un-fulfill palm oil mill capacity, respectively. Finally, integrated sustainable supply chain risk management approaches need to implement by the management of palm oil industry.                                                                                          </jats:p>"

However, the high-impact and low-probability natural disasters (i.e., windstorm, typhoon, and flood) come more frequent because of the climate change in the recent years, which may sequentially cause devastating damages to the infrastructure of power systems. The aim of this paper is mainly to explore and review the resilience of power grid system during the disaster and the power supply management strategies to recover the power grid. Firstly, the category of natural disasters and different influences on power grid are discussed. Then, the definition of power grid resilience is explored and the supply management strategies copying with disasters are introduced, such as microgrids and distributed generation systems. Specially, the electric vehicles (EVs) equipped with large-capacity battery pack in the transportation network can also be considered as the distributed power sources with mobility. Thus, the conceptual frameworks of integrating large-scale EVs into the power grid to fasten restoration of the power systems in the pre-disaster/post-disaster are emphatically investigated in this paper. Finally, the opportunities and challenges in further research on employing EVs for emergency power supply in the extreme weather events are also discussed.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we propose a design of a smart hybrid power supply system that mixes the output power of three sources of electricity which are solar panel, battery tank and the power grid. The system prioritizes the use of each source according to its availability and its environmental impact. The solar panel has the highest priority while the power grid has the lowest priority.

The objective of this project is to present a model that allows reducing the level of risk in supply chains using aggregate planning tools and decision analysis. The decision analysis model designed based on uncertainty will serve as a general plan for operations and will establish the parameters within which it would facilitate the performance of the supply chains of Pymes, allowing to improve capacity distributions. Therefore, it is important to execute the aggregate plans in a very broad scope of the chain, as proposed in the model proposed and applied in a Pyme company, with adequate and promising results.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>Traditionally, early warning systems for food safety are based on monitoring targeted food safety hazards. Therefore, food safety risks are generally detected only when the problems have developed too far to allow preventive measures. Successful early warning systems should identify signals that precede the development of a food safety risk. Moreover, such signals could be identified in factors from domains adjacent to the food supply chain, so-called drivers of change and other indicators. In this study, we show for the first time, using the dairy supply chain as an application case, that such drivers and indicators may indeed represent signals that precede the detection of a food safety risk. Using dynamic unsupervised anomaly detection models, anomalies were detected in indicator data expected by domain experts to impact the development of food safety risks in milk. Detrended cross-correlation analysis was used to demonstrate that anomalies in various indicators preceded reports of contaminated milk. Lag times of more than 12 months were observed. Similar results were observed for the 6 largest milk-producing countries in Europe (i.e., Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom). Additionally, a Bayesian network was used to identify the food safety hazards associated with an anomaly for the Netherlands. These results suggest that severe changes in domains adjacent to the food supply chain may trigger the development of food safety problems that become visible many months later. Awareness of such relationships will provide the opportunity for food producers or inspectors to take timely measures to prevent food safety problems. A fully automated system for data collection, processing, analysis and warning, such as that presented in this study, may further support the uptake of such an approach.</jats:p>"

In this respect, any process improvement could add value with a high impact against the terminal productivity. The traditional grain port operation technologies can no longer be used because the maritime business in particular requires new operating rules embedded by the integrated logistics variables, that ensure a shorter delivering time and an enhanced safety framework for cargo operation. Under these circumstances, the processes’ automation using modern technologies of supply, internal transportation, storage and forwarding of cargo flow, permanently monitored with an accurate control of operations, have determined the modern silo functional model. Moreover, the specific operations in the terminal are not only performed by automated processes, but there are many interventions and activities dependent on the human factor. This paper comes with an element of novelty, depicting the most relevant subprocesses carried out in the process of receiving grains in the terminal, in case of road shipment by truck. The authors have developed a model on this scenario, under a logical and generally valid flow sequences, that can be used by both those who want to update the terminal effectiveness and those who forth seek to benefit from a modern terminal functionality, valuing the processes and subprocesses improvement potential, in order to increase the quality of actions taken and the labour productivity, by eliminating port operation congestion and ultimately increasing the operational profit.</jats:p>",

This research aimed to understand the extent of views within a group of industry professionals on objectives, themes and definitions of urban water security. Using 22 semi-structured interviews with participants from Queensland, Australia, we found that, for the group, the priorities for urban water security are water quality and human health, quantity of supply to meet efficient demand, and reliability and resilience of supply systems. We also found diverse views on the importance of sustainability, water-related hazards, environment and ecosystem health, affordability and risk to water security in the urban context. We conclude that there is agreement within the water service provider group on priority needs, and suggest there is potential for community and service providers to agree on urban water security needs. The research findings support operationalisation of security concepts, highlight potential barriers to achieving urban water security, and provide insights for further engagement with urban water stakeholders.</jats:p>",

The results of the analysis of regional differences show that China's water-use efficiency is relatively low. Only Beijing, Shanghai, and Fujian have water-use efficiency higher than 0.8, whereas most other provinces and cities have an efficiency of 0.3–0.8. The eastern region demonstrates a higher water-resource utilization efficiency than the central and western regions. The analysis of the influencing factors of regional differences in water-use efficiency found that per capita water resources, per capita domestic water use, and the proportion of primary and secondary industries all have a negative impact on the efficiency of water use, and per capita GDP has a positive impact on the efficiency of water use.

To achieve the objective, this study created the research model, and the research hypotheses came from prior research. The questionnaire was sent to Korean FDI firms, and the collected data were analyzed by various analytical methods such as a factor analysis, a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, structural equation modeling (SEM) and a moderated regression analysis. The results are as follows. First, orientation for SCM has a positive effect on collaboration for SCM. Global SCM is regarded as an essential part in the era in which a value chain is globalized, and as a result, it is globally performed in the procurement of raw materials, production of goods and sales of final goods. To perform global SCM, staff of manufacturers should have recognition of SCM from the internal viewpoint of a firm, they should create strategy and structure for SCM from the whole viewpoint of a firm, and they should disseminate it to suppliers and customers. Second, collaboration for SCM has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The key factors are collaboration with international logistics service providers as well as inter-departmental collaboration. The collaboration is based on attaining efficiency and effectiveness, and as a result, firms achieve superior supply chain performance.</jats:p>"

However, the concentration of chlorine should be limited to acceptable levels. The upper boundary of the range is set for preventing the occurrence of a disinfectant by-product, which is harmful to human health. The lower boundary of the range is set for controlling the growth of microorganisms as well as reducing the injection mass. As such, an optimization model was applied to solve the water quality issue in a WDS. However, in a WDS, chlorine decays and varies with time and space, affected by pipe material, temperature, pH value, and chlorine injection, etc. Therefore, in this paper, an improved fuzzy chance-constrained optimization model was proposed to optimize chlorine injection and location to maintain chlorine in a WDS distributed uniformly. The proposed model was applied to two WDSs to analyze the effect of reliability level and preference parameters on chlorine injection and location. The results indicated that the injection mass increased with the increase in preference parameter. The results also indicated that more booster stations can lower the injection mass, and two booster stations were suitable for WDS in Case 2. The method proposed can be applied to decide how and where to inject chlorine in a WDS under uncertainty, and can help managers determine whether an optimistic or pessimistic attitude should be taken under various reliability levels.</jats:p>",

To do this, it is possible to use the phenomenon of nuclear quadrupole resonance. The device for exact measurement of temperature in the range from 0° C to +200 °C is offered. Using the LabView graphic programming package, a virtual model of an automatic thermometer based on nuclear quadrupole resonance in КClO3 was built. The temperature sensor is a superregenerative spectrometer with automatic monitoring of the center of the absorption line of the thermometric substance, consisting of the actual superregenerator, bandpass filter, comparator, DC amplifier and modulating voltage generator. The circuit that switches the supergenerator to the mode of continuous generation and output of information on the display contains a single vibrator, a buffer stage, a microcontroller and an indicator. From the output of the superregenerator, the absorption signal is fed to the bandpass filter, and then to the comparator. After the comparator, a voltage equal to the input voltage difference is amplified by a DC amplifier. This signal controls the resonant absorption frequency through the feedback circuit. The frequency of the sensor polling is determined by a single vibrator, the oscillations of which are synchronized with the clock generator. Measuring uncertainty in the range above changes from 0.02 K to 0.002 K It has been shown that either a manual frequency measurement method or a regenerative mode must be used to reduce the measurement uncertainty up to 0.002 K in the range. This improved automatic device is more complex, because of requirements of special measures to eliminate parasitic amplitude modulation. To increase the temperature range and precision, it is possible to find other thermometric substance, such as Сu2O crystals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Data are the foundation of the supply chain. However, the modern data stream in a supply chain is based on trust of the actors therein. Blockchain, a form of distributed ledger technology, eliminates the trust requirement of sharing supply chain data and allows each user to maintain an accurate, current copy of the ledger, without fear of data corruption or manipulation by bad actors. This paper reviews the application of blockchain to the management of transaction data in the supply chain. An overview of current blockchain technology will be discussed as well as advantages and disadvantages of the technology when applied to the supply chain. Current uses and research of the blockchain in supply chains will be discussed. There are three basic types of materials that are being explored in supply chain management using blockchain technology. The first is information-based materials and products. The most natural starting place for the blockchain is to replace the documentation and financial instruments. The second is fungible or commodity type materials. These goods are those delivered and consumed automatically, such as energy. The last are luxury, or crucial materials. These are items that are expensive or important enough that the costs of using advanced tracking technology makes economic sense.</jats:p>"

The study reviewed both theoretical and empirical literature and then proposed the research methodology that addressed the gaps identified in literature as well as to validate the statistical hypotheses. The study preferred this method because it allows an in-depth study of the subject. The target population was all the 187 parastatals in Kenya. Questionnaires were administered to collect qualitative and quantitative data from a sample of 127 heads of procurement, who were selected using simple random sampling, from the four strata. After data collection, quantitative data was coded using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 22. Data was analyzed through descriptive statistical methods such as means, standard deviation, frequencies and percentage. Inferential analyses were used in relation to correlation analysis and regression analysis to test the relationship between the four explanatory variables and the explained variable.Results and conclusion: The results of regression analysis revealed there is a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and the independent variable. R square value of 0.647 means that 64.7% of the corresponding variation in performance of parastatals in Kenya can be explained or predicted by (management strategy, monitoring and evaluation, shareholder management and conflict resolution) which indicated that the model fitted the study data. The results of regression analysis revealed that there was a significant positive relationship between dependent variable and independent variable at (β = 0.647), p=0.000 &lt;0.05).Based on the study findings, the study concludes that performance of parastatals can be improved by management strategy, monitoring and evaluation, shareholder management and conflict resolution. First, in regard to management strategy, the regression coefficients of the study show that it has a significant influence on performance of parastatals.Unique contribution to theory, policy and practice: The study recommended that public institutions should embrace contract administration so as to improve performance and further researches should to be carried out in other public institutions to find out if the same results can be obtained.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Much of the existing literature on the social aspects of sustainability in the supply chain has focused on dyadic buyer-supplier relationships. However, supply chains are much more extensive, featuring multi-tiered systems consisting of many interconnected sequential and parallel dyadic relationships; therefore, a more expansive and holistic approach to exploring the management and integration of social sustainability standards across the extended supply chain is desirable. This research attempts to help fill this void and considers the extent to which a series of sequential upstream and downstream supply chain partners, rather than only a focal organization’s immediate suppliers and buyers, influence the formulation process of the social aspects of a sustainability strategy and the deployment of associated practices across the extended supply chain. Findings in the literature indicate that, inter alia, sustainability efforts in the supply chain are likely to be guided by stakeholders’ sustainability desires/requirements, the geographical location of buyers and suppliers and the associated sustainability enforcement regulations and cultural norms, and the volume of trade between the buyer and supplier. This paper uses the results gleaned from a review of the literature to propose a conceptual framework for selection of sustainability strategy across the multi-tiered supply chain. Finally, we introduce a conceptual approach to the process of implementing and deploying the social aspects of sustainability strategies and practices across the supply chain using an integrated social-sustainability information management system (ISIMS).</jats:p>"

Infrastructures in water supply and sanitation alone are expected to require USD 6.7 trillion by 2050. These infrastructures must provide investment justifications when seeking funding from disbursement sources, in competition with other services (such as health, education, transport, elderly care etc.). We present a review that identifies monetary valuation gaps in regional and global cost benefit analysis (CBA) guidelines that underpin investment justifications. Case studies of Scandinavian appraisal reports written according to these guidelines indicate an alarmingly low use of monetary valuation on socioeconomic and environmental impacts caused by water sector projects. The findings suggest a need for broader and more accessible recommendations for water sector specific valuation methods. The need to develop a more accessible CBA framework for water infrastructure project managers is theoretically discussed, with emphasis on utilising monetary valuation methods and secondary source data. We identify valuation methods fragmentally discussed in the guidelines that should be adapted and applied, in time and cost-efficient ways, to water infrastructure projects.</jats:p>",

In order to study the FO process, brackish water was used as a feed solution, drawn using three types of solution (fructose, sucrose, and fructose/sucrose mixture, each with 3 M concentration). The maximum water flux (5.75 L/m2 h) was achieved using 3 M sucrose. The cross-linked membrane restrained the ions in the feed with a rejection factor value close to 100%. The water quality parameters were evaluated for the physical, chemical, and biological criteria, such as pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), heavy metals, and Escherichia coli content. The water quality parameters for the FO-processed water met that set by the World Health Organization for drinking water.

Much of the global supply chain relies on China, Germany, and the United States for manufacturing and distribution; this fragile system is subject to failure. Climactic changes in demand and rapid shortages in necessities are the results of the pandemic’s disruption. The recovery forecast for the ongoing pandemic is uncertain and, therefore, any recovery effort will need to be adaptable to build the supply chain resiliency. A wide adoption of flexible smart automated technologies in the manufacturing sector are helping to build robust supply chains and assisting in recovery. In this work, a brief discussion of these smart manufacturing technologies is presented, along with a list of potential supply chain issues and corresponding solutions.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in Riyadh (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) using the non-repeated random sampling technique. Ad hoc developed questionnaires were administered by means of face-to-face interviews or online via web software Sphinx (Python Documentation Generator). The relative importance of prevalence and the mean evaluation of effectiveness were determined for all studied marketing tools and for all groups of respondents (pharmaceutical sales representatives, community pharmacists, consumers, and the entire sample). Based on the results obtained, studied promotional techniques were ranked for prevalence and effectiveness. ANOVA and Scheffé test were used for determining the inter-group differences in average values of prevalence and in mean evaluation of effectiveness, while inter-individual differences were assessed by computing the coefficient of variation. Research findings showed that, according to all respondents, the most effective promotion technique was digital marketing, how- ever, all respondents considered digital marketing to be the least prevalent promotion technique. According to consumers and to the common opinion of all respondents, the most prevalent promotion technique in community pharmacies was merchandising, but, according to consumers, pharmaceutical sales representatives and common opinion of all respondents, the strength of impact of merchandising on consumers’ purchasing decisions (perceived effectiveness) was the least. The results of the present research contribute to the theory of pharmaceutical marketing; they may be useful to regulatory policy specialists, providing the better un- derstanding of which promotion techniques are commonly used in the retail pharmaceutical market; they can help pharmaceutical companies to focus on the most effective promotion methods, identifying which of promotion techniques are perceived as the most effective for marketing communication and having the strongest impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions.</jats:p>",

In recent years, the food traceability mechanism has become one of the emerging blockchain applications in order to improve the anti-counterfeiting area’s quality. Many food manufacturing systems have a low level of readability, scalability, and data accuracy. Similarly, this process is complicated in the supply chain and needs a lot of time for processing. The blockchain system creates a new ontology in the traceability system supply chain to deal with these issues. In this paper, a blockchain machine learning-based food traceability system (BMLFTS) is proposed in order to combine the new extension in blockchain, Machine Learning technology (ML), and fuzzy logic traceability system that is based on the shelf life management system for manipulating perishable food. The blockchain technology in the proposed system has been developed in order to address light-weight, evaporation, warehouse transactions, or shipping time. The blockchain data flow is designed to show the extension of ML at the level of food traceability. Finally, reliable and accurate data are used in a supply chain to improve shelf life.</jats:p>"

Yet it is still not clear-cut what drives the state rescaling in terms of land governance and by what ways. After dissecting the evolving policies and practices of construction land supply in China with the focus on the roles of state, we draw two main conclusions. First, the policy trajectory of construction land supply entails a complicated reconfiguration of state functions, which is driven by three interwoven relations: land–capital relation, peasant–state relation and rural–urban relation. Second, state rescaling in terms of the governance of construction land provision works via four important approaches: limited decentralism, horizontal integralism, local experimentalism and political mobilisationism. By reviewing the institutional arrangements of construction land provision and the state rescaling process behind them, this article offers a nuanced perspective to the state (re)building that goes beyond the simplified (vertical or horizontal) transition of state functions.</jats:p>"

As a specific case of analysis, the horticultural supply chain, originating in Spain and ending with the European consumer, is analyzed, taking as a reference the marketing companies at origin (mainly social economy companies, i.e.; cooperatives). In addition, a survey of marketing companies is conducted to possibly determine which explicit cooperative growth strategies may include horizontal and vertical collaboration relationships with other members of the chain. The aim is to analyze with whom the cooperative collaborates within the supply chain and the key points of such collaboration. A model analyzing the influence of collaboration on company performance is also considered. The results reveal that, in recent years, aspects related to quality and health have been surpassed and replaced by the concept of sustainability within a framework of collaboration with customers. In any case, it becomes evident that there is a need to expand collaboration within the chain by incorporating the supplier of the supplier, with the aim of making the chain more profitable.</jats:p>"

The experiment was designed as split-plot based on randomized complete blocks with three replications. Treatments were four different levels of deficit irrigation as the main plots and three fertilization treatments were applied as sub-plots. Results showed a significant effect (P ≤ 0.01) of water stress and fertilizer on CWSI during different stages of sunflower growth. Changes in fertilizer amount and type resulted in a change in lower (dTLL) and upper (dTUL) limits of canopy-air temperature difference. A combination of chemical fertilizer with biofertilizer could help to decrease CWSI. From computer vision analysis, the normalized difference red blue index (NDRBI) had a strong linear relationship with RWC and CWSI for sunflowers (R2 of 0.87 and 0.93, respectively) and the normalized difference green blue index (NDGBI) had a linear relationship with seed yield (R2 = 0.79). Therefore, analysis of digital RGB images and CWSI were efficient, non-destructive and low-cost methods to assess crop water status for sunflowers under different irrigation and fertilizer treatments.</jats:p>",

In this context, this study has two main aims. The first is to offer an up-to-date literature review of the ways in which sustainability is pursued in diverse settings, based on the sector, the geographical area, and the level of adoption of digital technologies of a company. The second aim is to identify the research gaps in this field, and to suggest directions for future investigations. The results of the structured literature review reveal that, although developed and developing countries tend to focus on different types of sustainable interventions, three factors are consistently considered to be crucial for the success of a sustainable initiative in global supply chains. These factors are the collaboration along the supply chain, the commitment of the top management, and the presence of environmentally-oriented policies or regulations. These three factors complicate the decision-making process that is needed to implement sustainable practices. Therefore, we suggest ways in which to design future research that better capture the real challenges of making environmentally conscious decisions, leveraging on the concepts of the Intertwined Supply Network (ISN) and the cognitive frame.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The work is devoted to the topical problem of increasing the efficiency of cleaning process of gases in packed-type scrubbers in order to reduce emissions of harmful substances and solid impurities into the atmosphere and improve the technical and economic indicators of wet gas cleaning systems. For this, a triangular cross-cut packing has been developed. Due to the size of the holes and their specific shape, the triangular packing provides longer contact of the packaging with water, which reduces water consumption. The packing is made of alloy steel AISI 316, so it can be used even in the most aggressive environment. In the work, the efficiency of cleaning with a scrubber with this packing is experimentally determined. The tests were performed at an ambient temperature of 23 °C. Several measurements were made for each type of packing, in a typical scrubber design. To conduct these industrial tests, a thermohygrometer-carbon dioxide gas analyzerAZ-7797 was used with high-precision NDIR (infrared) sensor, automatic background calibration (W/ABC), and compensation for deviations during long-term operation. The concentration measurement range is 0-9999 ppm with an error of ± 5 %. The gases were cooled in two stages. At first, they were cooled with ammonia water from 750 to 80 °C. Then they were fed to a primary gas refrigerator (basic type) of direct action, where its temperature were falled to 15 °C. Carbon dioxide concentration was measured after the first stage of cooling, after the final cooling, and after the cleaning process. The comparison is carried out with the most effective types of packing for wet gas cleaning today – chordal wood and Raschig rings. It is shown that the developed triangular packing with cross-shaped notches during the purification of coke oven gas from carbon dioxide improves the purification by 25 % in comparison with the wooden chord one, and by 15 % - with Raschig rings. This allows us to recommend it for widespread implementation.</jats:p>"

However, the majority of existing approaches dealing with this research area have ignored the important factor of decision makers’ preferences. The main objective of this article is to provide consistent DEA models that allow for efficiency analysis in order to determine the optimal allocation of resources according to these preferences. We propose three cases that are inspired from the geometric decomposition of preference attributions: (1) horizontal attribution, which is when decision makers treat each supply chain as a single non-detachable entity; (2) vertical attribution, which is when decision makers consider supply chains detachable and (3) combined attribution, which is when decision makers concurrently assign weights to the supply chain and to its members. Based on this suggested decomposition, new DEA models are developed, and an illustrative example is applied. The obtained results are relevant and show that DEA is capable of easily incorporating the preferences of decision-makers without resorting to weight restrictions on inputs or outputs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study supply chains where multiple suppliers sell to multiple retailers through a wholesale market. In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price that retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers’ influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power) and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers’ and retailers’ decisions. When taking into account retailers’ buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: As the number of retailers increases, each retailer’s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains and show that although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Charles Corbett, operations management. </jats:p>",

Firstly, the authors constructed a quality risk identification framework for IM MSC, and a hierarchical evaluation index system (EIS) based on the factors affecting quality risks. Besides, the features and attributes of four dimensions of quality risks were specified, and the corresponding intuitive triangular fuzzy numbers were given. Next, an evaluation model was established for the quality risks of IM MSC based on backpropagation neural network (BPNN). After the evaluation of quality risks, a contract model was designed for the quality risk control in IM MSC. The proposed EIS and models were proved effective through experiments.</jats:p>",

In addition, suppliers are required to be able to meet demand for supply and keep it in balance with market demand so that market prices remain stable. The most basic problem is that the order or request process carried out by marine fish cultivators is still placing orders directly at that location. In addition, the fish supply may not be sufficient. Of course, this will take a lot of time during the order or request process between marine fish cultivators and suppliers. Another problem with suppliers is that when they are ready to harvest the fish industry, they must also be able to provide it to all parties who need a supply of fish. The purpose of this research is to design and build a web-based supply and demand system for marine aquaculture products, which is expected to encourage the supply and demand process for marine aquaculture products. The method used to analyze needs / needs in this study is structured analysis to obtain design results based on user needs.             Keywords: information systems; results of marine fish farming; supply and demand system.  Abstrak: Informasi tentang ketersediaan bibit budidaya ikan laut sangat penting bagi pelaku pembudidaya ikan laut, karena ketersediaan mempengaruhi harga dan keberlangsungan operasi yang sedang berlangsung yang membutuhkan pasokan ikan laut. Selain itu, pemasok dituntut untuk dapat memenuhi permintaan penawaran dan menjaganya tetap seimbang dengan permintaan pasar agar harga pasar tetap stabil. Permasalahan yang paling mendasar adalah proses order atau request yang dilakukan oleh pembudidaya ikan laut masih melakukan order langsung ditempatkan di lokasi tersebut. Selain itu, pasokan ikan mungkin tidak mencukupi. Tentunya hal ini akan menyita banyak waktu saat proses pemesanan atau request antara pelaku pembudidaya ikan laut dan supplier. Masalah lain dengan pemasok adalah ketika mereka siap memanen industri ikan, mereka juga harus bisa menyediakannya kepada semua pihak yang membutuhkan pasokan ikan. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah merancang dan membangun sistem supply and demand produk budidaya ikan laut berbasis web, yang diharapkan dapat mendorong proses supply and demand produk budidaya ikan laut.

Using data for a sample of roughly one hundred Italian main cities observed over 40 years, we first estimate housing supply elasticities at the city level, measured as the correlation between the changes in the housing stock and in the house prices. Second, we show that differences in the elasticity of housing supply may determine the extent to which a demand shock translates into more intense employment growth or more expensive houses. To address endogeneity of housing supply elasticity, we exploit a synthetic measure of physical constraints to residential development as instrumental variable. We find that an exogenous increase in labor demand determines a rise of employment and house prices; however, in cities with a less elastic housing supply, the impact on economic growth is significantly lessened while the effects on house prices are larger.</jats:p>",

Generally there is a positive correlation between the burden and informatics research efforts for diseases in China. We think it is not contradictory that informatics research should be focused on the greatest burden of diseases or where it can have the most impact.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For high-speed rail with high energy consumption, the recovery and utilization of regenerative braking energy is essential to improve the energy consumption of high-speed rail. As a technical link, the energy bidirectional feed inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) system can realize the regenerative braking energy recovery of the contactless traction power supply system. Furthermore, considering that the braking energy of the high-speed rail is the largest when entering the station during the whole line operation, the braking section of the station is mainly considered. This paper proposes a preset control method for segmented power supply of the energy bidirectional feed ICPT system considering regenerative braking energy recovery. By establishing the steady-state mathematical model of the bidirectional ICPT system, the influence of the internal phase-shift angles φ1 and φ2 and the external phase-shift angle γ on the operating state of the system is analyzed. To realize system synchronization under the operation of EMUs, a train braking model is established through force analysis, and a power preset controller is designed to realize the synchronous control of the power flow of the bilateral system. According to the braking process of the train entering the station, the switching control method of the segment coil under the different conditions of the single train entering the station and the multitrain entering the station is proposed to ensure the reliability and flexibility of the train power supply. The simulation results of the 350 kW ICPT system simulation model show that the system can operate stably when the power transmission simulation is switched, and the transmission efficiency can reach 89%, which proves the feasibility of the control method. Energy-saving estimates show that a single train can recover about 200–300 kWh of electric energy during single braking. The comparison with the measured data verifies the accuracy of the modeling in this paper.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the reasons for the current global environmental crisis is the intense anthropogenic impact on water bodies, which results in their depletion and pollution. The source of the negative impact is, in particular, insufficiently treated wastewater from industrial enterprises. Depending on the technological processes used, toxicants can enter the water bodies along with the effluents, which pose a serious threat to them. The aim of the work is to consider the features of water supply and wastewater disposal of enterprises that make up the industrial hub of the city of Tambov. The work used methods of analysis of technical documentation and statistical reporting characterizing the qualitative and quantitative composition of wastewater. Water supply of the considered enterprises is carried out from the city water supply network and own artesian wells. All enterprises do not have full-fledged treatment facilities capable of carrying out a full cycle of wastewater treatment with bringing them to a standard clean state. The use of galvanic technologies in production requires preliminary cleaning at local treatment facilities. Then the wastewater goes to the city wastewater treatment plant, where it is processed together with the municipal wastewater. Normally clean and storm water flows directly into the surface water body. The largest enterprise of the industrial hub pumps its industrial effluents into deep aquifers. Over the entire period of its operation, over 52 million m3 of liquid toxic waste was injected. As a result, a zone of contaminated groundwater was formed under the enterprise and adjacent territories. In them, the excess of the maximum permissible concentrations for a number of parameters is constantly noted. Thus, this enterprise is a source of powerful, direct negative impact on groundwater and, indirectly, on surface water. This led to the emergence of a zone of sustainable environmental risk.</jats:p>"

Communities in the Eastern Coachella Valley (ECV), Riverside County, California, USA have raised concerns regarding bulk drinking water from water vending machines (WVMs) found in public vendors. To address concerns, we conducted microbiological contamination assessments of drinking water from WVMs in the ECV using heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), the presence of total coliforms using IDEXX technology, and real-time PCR (qPCR). We also measured temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, and free chlorine concentration. Twenty-five WVMs were sampled by using positively charged NanoCeram® filters in the field. Results indicated 32% of WVMs had total coliforms, and 21% had HPC above Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements. Through qPCR, we found 81% of WVMs had Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter jejuni, 76% had Enterococcus faecalis, and 90% had Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Results indicated most WVM samples we collected contained genetic material of pathogenic microorganisms and therefore, did not meet EPA drinking water standards. There is an urgency to enforce WVM maintenance through drain flushing, spigot cleaning, rust removal, filter replacement, and limits to physico-chemical parameters.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 180 countries around the globe causing severe business disruptions. Lockdown in many countries has led to panic buying and shortages of food, medicines, personal protective equipment, raw materials, basic goods, etc. As a result, while some businesses have benefited from this sudden spike in demand, many have already collapsed and many others are on the brink unless and until rescued by governments or private investors. In particular, the food sector, which relies heavily on global supply chains to meet the demands of local consumers, is working around the clock to maintain an adequate flow of food products to feed the nations. Countries that have taken strict measures such as full lockdown, however, are struggling to balance their demand and supply as in-country and cross-border supply has been severely affected. Stock-outs were much more common in the early phase of the crisis due to panic buying that influenced the vertical supply chain. To meet the changing food demand, grocery retailers have started working more closely with local farmers for the essential supply of food items, thus realising the benefits of short food supply chains. This paper attempts to explore the way the food sector is dealing with the current unprecedented situation and proposes some potential risk-mitigating pathways.</jats:p>"

By incorporating blockchain technology into supply chain integration capabilities, the firms are be able to work collaboratively with each other to enhance the supply chain integration and simultaneously reduce the carbon emission in a supply chain. This paper presents a conceptual framework to understand the role of blockchain in a low carbon supply chain management. Applying the Socio-Technical Theory and Resource-Based View, the research propositions between blockchain, supply chain integration capability and carbon emission are proposed in the research framework. The results indicate that the blockchain technology may be viewed as a strategic management approach to enhance supply chain integration and reduce the carbon emissions. In addition, it may be adopted as an operational tool to track carbon footprint, streamline processes and improve efficiency of carbon management to minimize the overall emissions in supply chains. The paper contributes to the blockchain literature and its applications in low carbon supply chain management and provides recommendation for future research.</jats:p>"

Initial supply is likely to be limited, and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile of 1 million doses in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.</jats:p>"

This article is an attempt to address manifest research gaps in this area, using the food retail environment as a practical case.Research purpose: To investigate the nexus between supply chain risk management and operational performance in the food retail industry in Zimbabwe.Motivation for the study: The food retail industry in Zimbabwe faces numerous supply chain risks, as most of the products sold are imported. It is essential to understand how the management of these supply chain risks impacts the operational performance of firms.Research approach, design and method: The study employed a quantitative survey design, using a sample of 227 food retail firm managers and supply chain professionals based in Harare. The collected data were analysed using structural equation modelling.Main findings: The results of the study showed significant positive relationships between supply chain risk management and risk information sharing and risk analysis and assessment. Further significant positive relationships were observed between risk analysis and assessment and risk-sharing mechanisms. In turn, risk-sharing mechanisms significantly predicted operational performance. However, no significant direct relationship was observed between supply chain risk management and operational performance.Practical/managerial implications: The study demonstrates that the operational performance of food retailing firms can be improved significantly through the institutionalisation of the mediating variables (risk information sharing, risk analysis and assessment, risk-sharing mechanisms) considered in this study. Management in the food retail industry may use the results of this study as a problem-solving framework for addressing operational constraints.Contributions/value-add: The study provides information that aids in the understanding of supply chain risk management, risk information sharing, risk analysis and assessment, risk-sharing mechanisms and operational performance, as well as the connection between them in a food retail context.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Extreme weather is known to cause failure bunching in electrical transmission systems. However, protection systems can also contribute to the worsening of the system state through various failure modes—spontaneous, missing or unwanted operation. The latter two types of failures only occur when an initial failure has happened, and thus are more likely to happen when the probability of failure of transmission lines is high, such as in an extreme weather scenario. This causes an exacerbation of failure bunching effects, increasing the risk of blackouts, or High Impact Low Probability (HILP) events. This paper describes a method to model transmission line failure rates, considering both protection system reliability and extreme weather exposure. A case study is presented using the IEEE 24 bus Reliability Test System (RTS) test system. The case study, using both an approximate method as well as a time-series approach to calculate reliability indices, demonstrates both a compact generalization of including protection system failures in reliability analysis, as well as the interaction between weather exposure and protection system failures and its impact on power system reliability indices. The results show that the inclusion of protection system failures can have a large impact on the estimated occurrence of higher order contingencies for adjacent lines, especially for lines with correlated weather exposure.</jats:p>"

The present study carries out a descriptive review of existing publications in these three sectors in relation to the sustainability of the Supply Chain in its 4.0 adaptation as an update in matters that are in constant evolution. Among the results obtained, Lean practices are common to the three sectors, as well as different technologies focused on sustainability. Furthermore, the results show that the automotive sector is the one that makes the greatest contribution in this sense through collaborative programs that can be very useful to the other two sectors, thus benefiting from the consequent applicable advantages.

Application of exponential and normal distribution laws, and Weibull's law.\nFindings. In a comprehensive assessment of the problem of electromagnetic compatibility and the development of multicriteria parameters of energy efficiency of power supply systems of industrial enterprises, it is most appropriate to use the reliability of the elements that are mathematically described by the Weibull distribution. At the same time, the results of modeling of typical electrical modes and variations of substitution schemes of enterprises showed the sensitivity of reliability indicators to changes in power system capacity.\nOriginality.  New theoretical foundations for research in modern power supply systems with increasing nonlinear load capacity have developed the scientific basis for analysis and synthesis of energy processes in multiphase electrical systems and propose methods of correction taking into account the complex action of sources of electromagnetic interference. And also to offer methods of estimation of their influence on reliability and efficiency of work of the basic electrotechnological equipment.\nPractical value.  The possibility of applying the obtained results to assess the reliability of power supply systems with powerful nonlinear loads is substantiated. The necessary accuracy and reliability of the decision at the levels of random events, quantities and processes is provided. The mathematical apparatus for the analysis of the main indicators of reliability in the presence of non-sinusoidal voltage is given. Conclusions are made on the adequacy of the calculation results at different stages of electricity distribution. It is shown that the simultaneous optimization of reliability and voltage quality are components of a complex scientific problem of ensuring energy efficiency of electrical networks in the implementation of decentralized models of the energy system.</jats:p>"

Store shelves were replenished as stockpiling behaviour subsided and as supply chain actors expanded operating hours, increased staff, simplified the product range and found alternative suppliers. This rapid recovery was facilitated by policy decisions to reduce border waiting times, to streamline certification procedures and to relax regulations on trade in food. Importantly, policymakers have so far mostly avoided a repeat of the mistakes of the 2007–2008 food price crisis, which was greatly exacerbated by export bans. Some bottlenecks remain, and there may be new supply risks as Covid‐19 spreads in Latin America. Overall, the biggest risk to food security is not food availability, but consumers’ loss of income. Safety nets and food assistance are essential to avoid an increase in hunger, especially in developing countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climatic and other extreme events threaten the globalized economy, which relies on increasingly complex and specialized supply-chain networks. Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firms—a measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms.</jats:p>"

Traditional Chinese agri-food supply chain management introduces a contract mechanism and a trust mechanism to manage the uncertainty of the agri-food quasi-organization. However, it is almost impossible to improve the efficiency of transactions and maintain agri-food supply chain stability in the case of asymmetric information. Nowadays, blockchain, Internet of Things technology and big data drive the agri-food supply chain into a vast smart network which would break the information constraints. This paper analyzes the coupling between blockchain-based digital system and the agri-food supply chain.

Aim: to analyze the home kits of elderly patients in terms of composition and storage. Methods. The author’s questionnaire containing 11 questions was compiled. A survey was conducted on 106 patients older than 65 years; the questionnaire was filled by respondents with a help of researchers during personal visit with an examination of “first-aid kits”. Results. First-aid kits contained on average 16 types of drugs; Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs prevailed (76.50%) in solid dosage forms, mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and antispasmodics, antihypertensive drugs, etc. Elderly patients most often used home medicine kits in responsible self-medication with high blood pressure, headache, and cardiac disorders, joint pain, digestive disorders. Expired medicines found in 30.2% of respondents accounted for 7.20% of the total number of medicines in first-aid kits, of which 83.44% were OTC drugs and 16.56% were prescription drugs. 58.57% of disposable syringes were expired. Violation of storage conditions was found in first-aid kits in 32.08% of respondents in 4.82% of drugs, of which 78.87% in non- prescription drugs. Conclusion. Violations of the shelf life and storage conditions of medicines and syringes in home first-aid kits were revealed. It is necessary to improve the skills of pharmacy employees in relation to pharmaceutical counseling of geriatric patients to ensure proper practice of storing and disposing of medicines. It is recommended to reduce the number of tablets and capsules of OTC drugs in the package. It is advisable to apply warning labels on the packaging of disposable syringes «before use, check the integrity of the package» and «after the expiration date, use is not allowed». Increasing the knowledge of geriatric patients about the proper practice of storing home first aid kits will help to improve the effectiveness and safety of pharmacotherapy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the construction materials still go to landfill after structures are demolished. This causes issues in human health, ecosystem preservation, and excessive resource consumption compared to RL options. Hence, recovering material value through reverse logistics (RL) is important to lessen the environmental and social burden. Embodying RL practices into strategic level decisions derives long-term and sustainable advantages. Although the most common RL option in construction seems to be recycling, it requires an additional energy and material intensive process. Therefore, recycling should be the last preference among other RL options. The hypothesis of this study is that alternative RL strategies provide more environmental benefits than recycling, the most common RL method, and traditional landfilling. The hypothesis was tested through assessment of the environmental impact of RL options in the construction sector. A life cycle assessment (LCA) with ReCipe2016 Midpoint and Endpoint assessment method was conducted for a bridge construction supply chain. Different end-of-life scenarios such as reuse, remanufacture, recycle, and landfill scenarios were assessed using SimaPro software. This paper addresses a key knowledge gap on the environmental impact of reverse logistics strategies from a construction supply chain perspective. The research results reveal that “reuse” strategy has the least environmental impact, remanufacturing has a lesser impact on the environment than other options, recycling has the second highest environmental impact, with landfill assessed as the least environmentally friendly end-of-life option. Consequently, this paper emphasizes the importance of informed strategic supply chain decisions for reverse logistics to obtain the best outcome from environmentally friendly practices. Since there is no relevant previous research conducted to examine the environmental impact of different reverse logistics options from a construction supply chain perspective, the findings of this study provide crucial input in RL decision making and can extend to contributing to practice. Industry stakeholders, especially the government agencies and regulatory bodies, should encourage practitioners to adopt the most effective RL approaches, including reuse and remanufacturing, rather than focusing only on material recycling. The motivation of supportive designs for more environmentally friendly RL options from the researchers, designers, architects, and planners are required in this process.</jats:p>"

For this, a single case study was conducted in Kashmir, India using qualitative approaches. Data collection was carried out using semi-structured interviews, observations, cashmere retailer websites and documentary evidence. Due to the impact of mechanization and lack of industry standards, the research findings indicate deteriorating socio-economic conditions of the artisans; especially, women spinners and weavers. Mechanization promotes economic sustainability for the manufacturers and retailers which helps them strengthen their market base. However, with this, artisan communities are rendered jobless who are dependent on their manual skills for sustenance as they have limited alternate revenue generation options. Moreover, the lack of motivation among the artisans to use institutional support further escalates sustainability concerns in the traditional craft industry.</jats:p>"

This study suggests a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that addresses the integration of e-commerce with a multi-echelon closed-loop supply chain with a multi-period planning time horizon by considering dual channels in manufacturing, and recovery facilities. To validate the model, we obtain optimal decision variables and examine the robustness and applicability of the model, and comprehensive computational experiments are performed. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is carried out to illustrate the efficacy of e-commerce integration by considering the two channels in the closed-loop supply chain. Accordingly, the total cost of the dual-channel CLSC decreases with an increase in customer demand via online retailers, the returned end of life (EOL) products, recycling ratio, and recovery ratio.

In this respect, prior results suggested that the specific layout utilizing an (HDPE–LDPE) compound short-penstock (where the (HDPE) sub-short-penstock is attached to the main steel pipe and the (LDPE) sub-short-penstock corresponds to the short-penstock dead-end side) provided significant attenuation of pressure magnitude. Concurrently, recent studies concluded that the (HDPE–LDPE) compound short-section-based inline strategy provided substantial attenuation of pressure magnitude. However, these strategies illustrated a drawback relying on the expansion of the period of pressure wave oscillations. Accordingly, this study assessed and compared the capacities of the compound technique concerning the trade-off between the magnitude-attenuation and the period-expansion of pressure wave oscillations. The findings of these analyses showed that the (HDPE–LDPE) compound short-penstock particular setup of the branching strategy allowed the best trade-off between the attenuation of magnitude and the period expansion of pressure wave oscillations. Furthermore, results showed the competitiveness of the latter upgrading strategy as compared to the (HDPE) or (LDPE) main pipe-based renewed hydraulic systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the key factors in providing a crisis-resistant form of performing laboratory classes in universities in distance mode is educational computer programs in the form of virtual laboratory works. Such software provides students to get proper practical experience working with technological equipment in absence of direct contact with the teacher and real laboratory units. They are also an alternative to real physical laboratory units and can be used by students in event of physical wear and tear of laboratory equipment or its complete absence. The article presents an educational computer program designed for laboratory works on five virtual laboratory units to the discipline “Heat supply of forest enterprises” for students to master materials on the following topics: “Determination of fuel humidity”; “Determination of the yield of volatile substances and coke”; “Determination of fuel ash content”; “Determination of the heat of combustion of solid fuel”; “Analysis of flue gases”. The authors showed the principle of performing all virtual laboratory works on the example of one laboratory work, identified the advantages of presented computer program and indicated high significance and efficiency of its use. The developed program is successfully used by students of Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science and Technology, allows you to hold laboratory works in distance mode and reduce the time for their implementation by accelerating the simulated processes.<jats:bold> </jats:bold></jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of underfloor heating systems is an effective way to achieve thermal comfort for users in energy-efficient buildings. There are two kinds of such systems: traditional and dry-assembled. The first type is researched more deeply than the second one. The paper presents theoretical studies of the thermotechnical parameters of a water underfloor dry-assembled heating system. The design of the underfloor dry-assembled heating system, considered in the work, consists of a heat insulation (expanded polystyrene), on which the pipes of the heating system are located, in contact with an aluminum heat distribution plate. The system is covered with floor finishing. The calculation for a stationary operating mode of the floor heating system was carried out on the basis of a system of equations for momentum and energy. The model was validated using the results of experimental studies. The calculation results cause some overestimation of the experimental data, possibly, beecause of deviations in thermotechnical characteristics of materials. But the simulation model correctly estimates the behaviour of the system at change of its parameters. The paper concludes that this configuration of the underfloor heating system can be used in heating systems for residential and non-residential premises. The aluminum heat distribution plate significantly affects the heat transfer processes in the system. Due to the plate, the heat flux is made uniform in the plane of the floor surface, which has a positive effect on heat distribution and reduces thermal tension in the finish coating. The use of ceramic tiles increases the overall heat exchange efficiency of the system with the room air. An increase in the thickness of the expanded polystyrene board increases the value of the heat flux from the surface of the heated floor. An increase in the flow rate and temperature of the heat carrier also cause an increase in the density of heat flux from the floor surface.</jats:p>"

In DCSC, one manufacturer manages the online channel and distributes the product to one independent retailer. Disruptions are all activities that disrupt the supply chain activities so that the supply chain cannot operate normally. Another major aspect to be considered in DCSC is the customer shift in preferences because with adding an online channel, the online channel has several advantages. This paper’s objective is to investigate the effect of supply chain disruption on demand in the online and offline channels. The customer knows beforehand that there is a disruption in the supply chain before even try to purchase the product in DCSC, therefore it will affect the customer preferences that will also affect the channel demand. From a numerical example, it is shown that the retail channel is suffering more than the online channel. The greater the probability of disruption and the proportion of disruption, the demand on the offline channel will decrease.</jats:p>",

Although anecdotal market size claims exist, few quantitative studies have estimated the potential market size or discussed the impact of CLT on lumber supply. This paper presents a method to quantify CLT markets and lumber supplies based on data for the Northwest US. The western US was chosen for its early adoption of CLT combined with a long history of commercial timber construction. Structural designs of archetype buildings were combined with projected multifamily residential and commercial building construction to estimate the demand for CLT. These figures were reduced to account for assumptions that address market penetration and population density. In the case study for the Northwest, the total potential market is less than the existing CLT production in western North America. Thus, the demand region was expanded to include the US and Canada west of the Rocky Mountains, resulting in an estimated demand of 800,000 m3/yr by 2030. A regional lumber supply study suggests that the lumber supply will support the existing CLT industry, which utilizes approximately 2% of the selected lumber classifications, with an unknown impact on lumber cost and production.</jats:p>"

The United States(US), one of the biggest oil consumers in the world, has created regulations to manage ethanol production and con-sumption for the last half century. Though these regulations have created new opportunities, they have also added newburdens to the obligated parties. It is thus key for the government, the obligated parties, and related businesses to studythe impact of the policies on the SPSC. We develop a two-stage stochastic programming model, General Model (GM),which incorporates Renewable Fuel Standard 2 (RFS2), Tax Credits, Tariffs, and Blend Wall (BW) to study the policyimpact on the SPSC using cellulosic ethanol. The model, as any other general model available in the literature, makesit highly impractical to study the policy impact due to the model’s computational complexity. We use the GM to derivea Lean Model (LM) to study the impact by running computational experiments more efficiently and consequently byarriving at robust managerial insights much faster. We present a case study of the policy impact on the SPSC in theState of Nebraska using the LM in the accompanying part II (Ghahremanlou and Kubiak 2020).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Waste management in Kenya’s urban centers is becoming a momentous task considering the country’s desire for a middle income industrial economy. The National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) is concerned with the growing rate of waste generation that does not match the rate of collection. Among the industrial sectors that are poised to play a significant role in realization of the middle income industrial status is the textile sector. However, this is a sector that contributes to high volumes of waste generation in Kenya. Yet, it is envisaged that adoption of waste-sensitive procurement could be the panacea to waste management in the sector. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the effect of procurement performance practices on waste management in textile firms in Nairobi City County. This study was grounded on the positivist research paradigm in adopting the ex-post facto research design, to interrogate the direct effects of the three procurement practices on waste management. Cochran’s ample size formula was used to decide on a sample size of 142 employees. Stratified and simple random sampling techniques were used to draw the required sample of employees from the respective textile firms. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire comprising of four sections in line with the four constructs under study. Multiple regressions analyses were run to test the postulations made. The study confirmed that textile firms under investigation were not emphasizing more on waste prevention and minimization when procuring materials. This was deemed to be serious considering that supplierprequalification, invitation to tender, and contract structure were all found to be significant and positive predictors of waste management in the textile firm’s context. The conclusions made from the study findings were that; textile firms in Nairobi City County were facing the challenge of waste management due to their laxity in emphasizing waste-sensitive procurement practices. The firms however stand to gain by leveraging upon supplier pre-qualification, invitation of bids, and contract structure that are centric to waste generation. The findings of this study contribute to the theory and practice of waste management by showing that, waste is best managed at the procurement stage. This therefore implies that textile and waste management stakeholders have the onus of coming up with waste management parameters which, supplier pre-qualification, invitation to tender, and contract structure processes should aim at. Future studies should take into account other procurement practices that can be engaged to prevent and minimize waste. Moreover, there may be need to expand the geographical scope of the firms in order to boost external validity</jats:p>",

Thus, we introduced an Ensemble Kalman Filter (ENKF) into a two-layer confined groundwater model based on the interactive operation between the MATLAB and GMS to investigate the capability of ENKF under complex conditions and obtain a relatively new forecasting method. ENKF was employed to assimilate and forecast groundwater levels, and invert the hydraulic conductivity (K) of the heterogeneous study area, where the initial values of K were obtained by using trial-and-error based on the two-period groundwater levels. After comparing the efficiencies in forecasting groundwater levels among ENKF, the modified model, and the initial model, four major conclusions could be drawn. ENKF converged fast when forecasting groundwater levels and the accuracy was high. Various convergent results would be represented by ENKF when K in different layers was observed in the same error. ENKF performed better than the initial simulation when monitored data subjected to a certain range of interferences. Forecasting accuracy in the middle of the study area could be enhanced by the large improvement degree of K through ENKF. Therefore, this analytical method could be a theoretical reference for groundwater resources management in coastal areas.</jats:p>",

The role of surface water resources in providing agriculture in the province is especially significant. An imbalance has been established between the socio-economic development of&#x0D;\nthe province and the use of water &#x0D;\n esources. The cities (Guiyang, Anshun and Liupanshui), located on the watersheds&#x0D;\nof the Yangtze and Zhujiang rivers, have the greatest water deficit.&#x0D;\nIn addition, the mountainous relief in combination with the development of karst creates a complex picture of abnormal conditions for the replenishment of water resources due to atmospheric precipitation. The mosaic nature of natural&#x0D;\nconditions against the background of seasonal climatic conditions requires an integrated management of water resources, taking into account the spatial regional features of the province, the development of hydrological and water zoning of the province, taking into account the peculiarities of the formation of runoff in small catchments.</jats:p>",

One of the strategies for preventing the overuses of safe water resources for agriculture is to increase agricultural productivity by reducing the amount of irrigation water with a slight reduction or even maintaining the yields. Rice production in the northern region of Iran which is strategically and economically very important, requires irrigation management changing with traditional irrigation methods (flood irrigation). This study was conducted in the 2017–2018 crop season to investigate the effect of different irrigation management on water consumption, rice yield and water productivity in paddy field of Babolsar, Mazandaran, Iran. The experiment was performed in the field in a randomized complete block design with three replicates and four treatments in 12 plots. The treatments were TI (Traditional/flood Irrigation), and AI1, AI3 and AI5 (Alternative Irrigation one, three and five days after the disappearance of water from the soil surface, respectively). The number of yield components and the water productivity indexes were determined. The results of this study showed a significant difference (at 1% level) between irrigation treatments in terms of yield components including tiller number, Panicle length, filling percentage, and water productivity, but they did not have any significant effect on plant height and grain yield. The applied irrigation water for TI, AI1, AI3, and AI5 treatments was measured to be 7,940, 4,910, 4,090 and 3,290 m3/ha, respectively. The maximum yield (6.11 ton/ha) belonged to TI treatment and after that with the value of 6.02 ton/ha belonged to AI5 treatment with the least application of water. Rice water productivities for TI, AI1, AI3, and AI5 treatments were calculated to be 0.82, 1.05, 1.38 and 1.83 kg/m3, respectively. Therefore, alternate irrigation five days after the disappearance of surface water (AI5) was accepted to be the best irrigation practices among the other different irrigation management due to 56.07% reduction in water use and only 1.47% reduction in grain yield compared to control treatment.</jats:p>",

In combination with the Sobol sensitivity analysis method, the contribution degree of the parameterized external conditions as well as the relationship with the water quality were examined, which indicated that TP and TN are primarily related to the external input water quality and flow, while Chl-a is related to inflow (36.42%), TP (26.65%), wind speed (25.89%), temperature (8.38%), thus demonstrating that the governance of Chl-a is more difficult. In general, the accuracy and interpretability of MARS machine learning are more in line with the actual situation, and the use of the Sobol method can save computer calculation time. The results of this research can provide a certain scientific basis for future intelligent management of lake environments.</jats:p>",

These are all by-products of world-class manufacturing which have promoted systematic organizational and supply chain efficiencies. However, under economic shocks that are sustained over longer periods of time (e.g., Covid-19 Pandemic) and that affect supply chains from a variety of disruptions, a supply chain that is not prepared or adaptable may be broken or at a minimum weigh down the organization. Therefore, the ability to manage and control risk is a key aspect of effective supply chain management. However, the literature on pandemic risk mitigation is nascent. Thus, this paper offers a review of the extant literature, provides a strategic mitigation model covering five dimensions: leadership, preparedness, digitalization, resilience, and pivoting. These dimensions are designed to help organizations in the future to be more adaptive to events such as global pandemics and other large-scale disruptions and discuss implications for future research.</jats:p>",

However, the conversion of solar energy depends on the availability and conditions of sunlight. In sunny conditions, the PV system can serve large loads while charging the battery to the maximum. While in cloudy weather conditions or at night, the PV system serves the load and without charge of the battery. The battery will discharge the stored energy until it runs out, and the supply to the load will be cut off before the desired time. Therefore, research on the PV system loading management system is needed to increase the amount of electricity from solar energy and maintain the continuity of electricity supply to the load. The load power management strategy follows the conditions of sunny, cloudy, rainy, or night time by considering the remaining capacity of the battery that can be used. Load installations are designed to consist of low, medium, and high load installations. Simulation results show that the use of PV loading management strategies can increase the operating time of the PV system. When the remaining less than 10% battery capacity and PLN supply is available, the supply will be switched to PLN. The remaining 10% of PV battery capacity could be used to maintain electricity supply to a low load if the PLN supply interrupted. Thus, the use of a loading management strategy will increase the electricity supply from renewable energy and improve the sustainability of electricity supply.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The number of dependencies present in the modern systems makes the process truly complicated and the findings, when available, are difficult to interpret and understand. The increasing trend to subcontract large parts of a programme or project hides some of those dependencies and other details under a huge number of contracts and other legal documentation which, in some cases, obliges the auditor to become a real documentation archaeologist in search of the holy grail. The required security controls span across those documents and the responsibility of one or the other party in the supply chain within a complex programme is not always obvious. The mission is clear, however, and the auditor needs to ensure that the processes, controls and safeguards are in place as originally designed, regardless of the added complexity. In this paper, the authors will introduce the concept of cyber audits, explain some of the factors that contribute to the complexity of the projects in the space sector along the supply chain, and describe tools that can assist in the audit process, before concluding with some recommendations to be taken into account to facilitate the process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We integrate the results of a social network survey and a forecast information sharing experiment to examine the roles of trust and trustworthiness in impacting high-ranking executives’ decisions in supply chain interactions. The members of our executive sample have, on average, 17 years of work experience. A significant portion of them holds positions at the C-level in world-leading organizations that span a wide range of industries. By examining the roles of trust and trustworthiness in the decision making of high-ranking executives, we find strong external validation for as well as demonstrate how these nonpecuniary, behavioral factors impact the outcomes of business interactions. We employ a multimethod research design that allows us to investigate the extent to which the executives’ trust beliefs toward a relevant network of exchange partners (which we define as their “network trust”) impact their trust behaviors when engaging in business interactions with members of this network. We determine the conditions pertaining to the executives’ professional experiences that strengthen or weaken the impact of network trust on the executives’ trust behaviors in supply chain interactions. For example, executives with more diverse professional experiences rely more on network trust to shape their trust behaviors. Conversely, executives with prior positive trust experiences rely less on network trust in their trusting behaviors. We quantify that improved trust and trustworthiness can yield up to 41%, 6%, and 5% gain in the expected profit of the supplier, the retailer, and the supply chain. Our results offer tangible implications for how organizations can better leverage executives’ knowledge about how much to rely on network trust in business interactions to achieve better outcomes. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management. </jats:p>",

The extension and evolution of different supply topologies for these systems has resulted in significant and various forms of distortions in network voltage and current in all ERPS, the connected power system, and adjacent consumers. During the last years, numerous studies have been offered to investigate various aspects of PQs in a specific supplying topology. Variation in the supply structure of the ERPS and different types of locomotives has propelled the observation of different PQ phenomena. This versatility and development have led to confront considerable types of two-way interactive interfaces as well as reliability and PQ problems in ERPS. In addition, the lack of standards explicitly dedicated to ERPS has added to the ambiguity and complexity of this issue. In this paper, an extensive review of PQ distortions and phenomena in different configurations of ERPS is proposed and a systematic classification is presented. More than 140 scientific papers and publications are studied and categorized which can provide a fast review and a perfect perspective on the status of PQ indexes for researchers and experts.</jats:p>"

Across the globe, reverse osmosis (RO) has become the key method used to desalinate seawater. Due to the high energy requirements of RO desalination, the need to reduce the energy load has become a pertinent area of research. Microbial desalination cells (MDCs) are an emergent technology that show great promise when integrated into the RO desalination process. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of the energy utilized in RO desalination could be eliminated by using MDCs as a pretreatment process. In this study, the integration of various MDC types into the pretreatment process for RO desalination were compared and explored. Existing MDC integration setups were briefly explained. Research was split into possible configurations for the integration. This includes optimization of key parameters such as anodic inoculum, feed inlet ratios and accompanying pretreatment processes. The limitations and challenges faced in the integration were investigated and the required future studies aligned with subject was deliberated.</jats:p>",

Technical objects are understood as a mobile, energy-intensive vehicle, such as an aircraft, a surface or submarine vessel, or a railway locomotive with strong magnetic fields. The aim of the work is to create a simple and intuitive tool for mathematical modeling of the magnetic field vector at an arbitrarily specified observation point. The task is being solved in order to improve the accuracy of magnetic measurements on board, in particular, in navigation problems. On-board DC networks are considered, to which the approach of mathematical modeling is applied. The disadvantages of commercial programs of a similar purpose are noted. The binding of the objects under consideration to the general coordinate system is described. An analytical algorithm for calculating the magnetic field vector from the on-board cable network with a pronounced 3D trajectory is shown. Examples of visualization of the simulation results are given. An algorithm for calculating the induction vector based on the Biot-Savard law is considered. The algorithm for the analytical solution of the problem is described in detail. A specific power cable of the on-board network is considered. The cable is given by a set of straight conductors with current. The ways of future improvement of the created product with the transition from one observation point to the field map in a given three-dimensional zone of arbitrary position, volume and orientation are outlined. The obtained result is considered as an element of the procedure for achieving electromagnetic compatibility of energy-intensive and highly sensitive subsystems of a modern complex technical object.</jats:p>"

The aim of the article is to develop procedures for translating practical questions about the choice of optimal routes of the heat supply system into mathematical problems of multi-criteria optimization and the study of these problems taking into account a large number of different parameters of the system and their connections.Results and conclusions. A mathematical description is compiled of the route choosing problem for the heat supply system based on the methods of system analysis. As optimized criteria, the integrated parameters are discussed describing the main characteristics of the systems under consideration. Unification of the problem where some of the criteria must be minimized and the other one maximized is carried out by replacing the minimized criteria with inverse values. Using the example of the modeling problems the procedures are shown for finding optimal solutions. The visibility of such procedures is provided by the use of a quadratic (Euclidean) norm instead of the traditional summation of weight coefficients. The importance of correct scaling and choice of weight factors is shown in the study of the discussed multi-criteria optimization problem.</jats:p>",

To buy a smart product, people mostly care about that smart product’s energy consumption and the price. There is always a tug-of-war between the price of the product and the energy consumption of that product. An energy-efficient smart production system is described in this study where the production is variable, and in the out-of-control state, it produces defective products. For prevention of the out-of-control state, preventive maintenance and restoration are used within the smart production system. The rework policy helps to profit from the defective products, and the warranty policy helps to motivate the users. This model applies an improved strategy to the production process and develops a new product that needs to be marketed. Finally, this model plays a vital role in creating smart products with moderate energy consumption at a minimal cost. The mathematical model is a non-linear profit maximization problem that is solved both analytically and numerically. The classical optimization technique founds optimum solutions. Different numerical examples and sensitivity analysis with graphs are used to validate the mathematical model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The input part of the high-voltage test power supply is usually composed of switching devices; however, the pulse-type periodic interference caused by the switching devices makes the monitoring of the test power supply partial discharge more difficult. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-efficiency and distortion-free linear power supply based on piecewise-linearization with all N-type transistor. Under the same DC input, multiple power transistors are connected to different taps of the same transformer. By controlling the period of linear conduction of each power transistor in turn, we ensure that the power transistor works on the linear side (biased towards saturation) to reduce its conduction voltage drop and the output realizes sinusoidal piecewise linearization, so that the converter can greatly improve the system efficiency. After that, from the perspective of the lowest sum of the transistor loss, an optimization method for the design of the multi-winding transformer ratio at each stage is proposed. Finally, a power supply prototype based on four-piece linear converter with an output voltage of 220 V was built. The experimental efficiency reaches 87.03%, and, additionally, if the linear amplification is divided into more sections, the efficiency can be further improved.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Background. Digital twins have advanced fast in various industries, but are just emerging in postharvest supply chains. A digital twin is a virtual representation of fresh horticultural produce. This twin is linked to the real-world product by sensors supplying data of the environmental conditions near the target fruit or vegetable. Statistical and data-driven twins quantify how fresh-produce quality loss occurs by grasping patterns in the data. Physics-based twins provide an augmented insight into the underlying physical, biochemical, microbiological and physiological processes, enabling to explain also why this quality loss occurs.Scope and Approach. We identify what the key advantages are of digital twins and how the fresh-produce supply chain can benefit from them in the future. Key Findings and Conclusions. A digital twin has a huge potential to help horticultural produce to tell its history as it drifts along throughout its postharvest life. The reason is that each shipment is subject to a unique and unpredictable set of temperature and gas atmosphere conditions from farm to consumer. Digital twins help to identify the resulting, largely uncharted, postharvest evolution of food quality. The benefit of digital twins particularly comes forward for perishable species and at low airflow rates. Digital twins provide actionable data for exporters, retailers, and consumers, such as the remaining shelf life for each shipment, on which logistics decisions and marketing strategies can be based. The twins also help diagnose and predict potential problems in supply chains that will reduce food quality and induce food loss. Twins can even suggest preventive shipment-tailored measures to reduce retail and household food losses.</p>"

First, the performance of these algorithms was assessed by seven benchmark functions having 2–30 dimensions. Next, they were compared for optimization of the complex problem of four-reservoir and 10-reservoir systems operation. Furthermore, the results of these algorithms were compared with nine other metaheuristic algorithms. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the appropriate values of the algorithms’ parameters. The statistical indices coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), normalized MSE (NMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Willmott’s index of agreement (d) were used to compare the algorithms’ performance. The results showed that MSA was the superior algorithm for solving all benchmark functions in terms of obtaining the optimal value and saving CPU usage. ICA and HS were ranked next. When the dimensions of the problem were increased, the performance of ICA and HS dropped but MSA has still performed extremely well. In addition, the minimum CPU usage and the best solutions for the optimal operation of the four-reservoir system were obtained by MSA, with values of 269.7 seconds and 308.83, which are very close to the global optimum solution. Corresponding values for ICA were 486.73 seconds and 306.47 and for HS were 638.61 seconds and 264.61, which ranked them next. Similar results were observed for the 10-reservoir system; the CPU time and optimal value obtained by MSA were 722.5 seconds and 1,195.58 while for ICA they were 1,421.62 seconds and 1,136.22 and for HS they were 1,963.41 seconds and 1,060.76. The R2 and RMSE values achieved by MSA were 0.951 and 0.528 for the four-reservoir system and 0.985 and 0.521 for the 10-reservoir system, which demonstrated the outstanding performance of this algorithm in the optimal operation of multi-reservoir systems. In a general comparison, it was concluded that among the 12 algorithms investigated, MSA was the best, and it is recommended as a robust and promising tool in the optimal operation of multi-reservoir systems.</jats:p>",

This indicates that a unit increase in the Strategic E-procurement would result in 70.4% increase in the performance of Devolved systems of government in Kenya this implied that there   is   a strong positive relationship   between Strategic E-procurement  and  performance  of  Devolved systems of government in  Kenya .&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice and policy:  Based on the findings, the study recommends that devolved systems of government should adopted e-procurement system and automate all procurement operation procedures to enhance smooth work flow and hence improve efficiency the study further  recommends that  Devolved systems of government should adopt e-procurement for various uses such as in the standardization of services for representation in the catalog, sourcing goods and services globally, as way of reducing costs in areas such tendering processes, payment and contract management. But management should be aware and cautious that e-procurement is capital intensive in terms of acquisition and laying down the required infrastructure and highly perishable. Thus the study recommends that strategic e-procurement practice should be implemented within the legal framework of public procurement acts and regulations because it moderate has positive correlation with the performance of Devolved systems of government in Kenya. The findings are in harmony with technology acceptance model which suggest that emerging technologies cannot improve organizational effectiveness and performance if the change has not been accepted by the users. Therefore first it’s crucial for the users to accept the new technology (e-procurement) so as to reduce administrative costs, possible broadening of suppliers’ base, and easy access to preferred goods. In conclusion technology acceptance model can be used by future scholars.</jats:p>"

The results of a study devoted to the solvency of electricity consumers - individuals are revealed by comparing the level of average income in the regions of the Russian Federation and the conditional maximum amount of electricity that can be paid for from these incomes. It has been established that despite the opportunities for timely payment, there remains a low payment discipline for a number of consumers, which is reflected in the growth of receivables and, as a result, leads to cash gaps. During the review of the dynamics of debt, the scope of cash gaps was determined, which in 2018 amounted to more than 169 billion rubles. Power supply companies attract loans for timely settlements, what entails additional costs and worsens financial results. The impact of the identified factors on the main indicators of power supply companies being last resort providers of electricity in Russia, including the power supply company under study, was assessed. The results obtained will be further used to develop methods for the diagnostic analysis of critical risk zones, which determine the financial stability of the power supply company being a single purchaser and last resort provider of the 2nd non-price zone.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes a novel failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) model based on hybrid multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM), which adopts neutrosophic set theory into the proposed model. A developed neutrosophic Best Worst method (NBWM) is used to evaluate the weights of risk factors and determine their importance. Secondly, the neutrosophic Weight Aggregated Sum Product Assessments (NWASPAS) method is utilized to calculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN) of the failure modes. The proposed model improves the shortcomings of traditional FMEA and improves the practical applicability and effectiveness of the Best Worst method (BWM) and Weight Aggregated Sum Product Assessments (WASPAS) methods. In addition, this study uses neutrosophic logic to reflect the true judgments of experts in the assessment, which considers authenticity, deviation, and uncertainty to obtain more reliable information. Finally, an empirical case study from an SMPS company headquartered in Taiwan demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed model. In addition, by comparing with two other FMEA models, the results show that the proposed model can more clearly reflect the true and effective risks in the assessment. The results can effectively help power supply manufacturers to assess risk factors and determine key failure modes.</jats:p>"

A typical monetary policy is regarded as the stabilizing policy and it is responsible to safeguard an economy in the emergence of any negative shock from the external world. Pakistan's economy has been vulnerable to oil price fluctuations and it has often faced the long run negative impact, for instance the negative effects of 2008 commodity crises which were mainly because of the abrupt rise in oil prices. The monetary policy of Pakistan usually follows the tight policy stance as a response to such adverse supply shocks but the question always remain, how effective is it in mitigating those negative effects? In this regard, the present study has explored the effectiveness of monetary policy stance in Pakistan. In order to achieve the underline objective, this study has used the Shutdown Methodology in Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) models on the quarterly data from 1992 to 2016. The results from the underline model have revealed that the monetary policy of Pakistan has a limited effectiveness on its main target variables of economic output and general price level.</jats:p>"

The study aims to compare and analyze the financial viability of selected crops viz., paddy and cotton under organic and conventional farming and the analysis of different supply chains involved in the marketing of organic and conventional food products. The present study was carried out in Jangaon district, which is very well known in the organic farming sector of Telangana state. For the study during the period of 2019-20, ten organic and ten conventional farmers had been selected for each selected crop using a simple random sampling technique. Thus, the sample consists of 20 organic farmers and 20 conventional farmers. The data collected from respondents were analysed using the cost concepts, budgeting technique and Acharya’s approach according to the objectives. The results indicated that the cost of cultivation of conventional crops are more than organic crops due to the increased usage of expensive chemicals in conventional farming. The farmers realize a high premium price for their organic produce and also high net returns, thus have higher financial viability in organic farming. The supply chain of organic produce involving Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) has high efficiency because it offers the producers a major share in consumer’s rupee and establishes a direct link between the producer and consumer. The study has revealed that organic farming gives better income to the farmers, if marketing linkages are established and they can fetch a better price for organic products than conventional products.</jats:p>"

However, there continue to be many factors supporting the development of LNG liquefaction capacity in Canada, including the desire to supply the world with responsibly sourced, cost-effective, and relatively clean fuel, and it is expected that a number of projects will ultimately proceed.\r\nThe supply and transportation of LNG from such projects once they become operational will engage the body of maritime laws governing the operation of ships in Canadian waters and, where relevant, Canada’s export laws. Other requirements may additionally apply by virtue of the contractual arrangements typically entered into in connection with such activities.

This study investigated the monitoring of hydrological drought in a future period to examine the impact of climate change on the discharging flow of the Zard River basin in Iran. Zard River is an important supplier of fresh and agricultural water in a vast area of Khuzestan province in Iran. A continuous rainfall-runoff model based on Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) algorithm was applied to simulate the discharge flow under 10 scenarios (obtained from LARS-WG.6 software) of future climate change. Then, the Stream-flow Drought Index (SDI) and the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) were calculated for each climate change scenario for the future period (2041–2060). The results of the meteorological drought assessment showed that near normal and moderate droughts had higher proportions among other drought conditions. Moreover, the hydrological drought assessment showed the occurrence of two new droughts (severe and extreme) conditions for the future period (2041–2060) that has never happened in the past (1997–2016).</jats:p>",

Data analysis, risk assessment technologies and decision support systems enable companies to adapt to modern challenges.In the process of globalization, a consumer has the priority due to which quality of service and timely delivery of the required products determine the competition among the companies. All participants of the supply process, including logistics service providers, have traditionally focused on optimizing process management and minimizing supply chain costs [1]. The determining factor of supply efficiency from the perspective of procurement and logistics is the uninterrupted supply of raw materials and semi-finished goods that depends on the selection of a reliable supplier, as well as the continuous improvement of the quality of materials and the reliability of the customer-supplier relationship. The purpose of this article is to analyze use of blockchain technology to improve reliability of supply chains, whereas the rationale behind the management of business processes and the contractual obligation between the parties are verified cryptographically, using a smart contract.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In traditional ecological scheduling, a single monthly or daily model will lead to the incomplete transmission of ecological information or increase the complexity of solving problems. Therefore, a multi-timescale nested model (MTNM) is proposed. Although the MTNM can express the daily flow process of environmental flow, the quadratic nested calculation method cannot obtain the optimal solution for the daily scheduling scheme. Targeting the problem that long and short-term objectives cannot obtain the optimal solution at the same time, this paper proposes a multi-timescale integrated model (MTIM) which considers the monthly, 10-day, and daily scale. The model is applied to the Liujiaxia reservoir. The scheduling results show that, compared with the MTNM, the MTIM can better meet the multi-objective demand. In a wet year, when both models can guarantee water supply and ecological demand, the MTIM increases electricity generation by 0.91%. In a dry year, electricity generation can still be increased by 4.35% without sacrificing the ecological and water supply benefits of the lower reaches. In different typical years, the MTIM can improve the contradictory relationship between multi-objective by improving the utilization efficiency of water. The results can improve the decision support for the operation process of other reservoirs with ecological needs.</jats:p>"

We are analyzing stock prices and information from financial reports to examine the impact of the pandemic on stock price volatility and profits of companies in the food supply chain. We use a data set of 71 major listed companies in the food value chain from stock indices in the US, Japan, and Europe. We calculate the annualized volatility per sector, screen the contents of the reports for stated effects of the pandemic on profits, and analyze stock price reactions in four different phases of the pandemic. The results show that stock markets have reacted with an increased price volatility. Manufacturers of fertilizers and agrochemicals as well as food distributors show particularly high volatilities in their stock prices. Low price volatility was observed in the stocks of food retailers. This pattern is also reflected in the profits of companies published in financial reports. Our regression analyses indicate that stocks of more profitable companies exhibited higher cumulative returns during the outbreak. In the phases thereafter, riskier stocks received higher discounts on returns. EconLit citations: G01, G12, E44, Q01.</jats:p>",

However, there are few scientific studies on this topic that have focussed on loss control performance in developing countries. With the intention to expand the limited scientific framework investigating the management of water losses in economic scarcity scenarios, this paper provides an overview of which practices directed to water loss control are being conducted in a Brazilian region. Data were collected from 42 water utilities and show there is a direct relationship between the utilities' performances and the number of water loss practices adopted. The divergences in the number of practices applied by the water utilities may be influenced by technical–operational, planning and management factors. The paper brings greater robustness to the loss management debates in regions with economic scarcity, being able to support the action of utilities operating in similar scenarios.</jats:p>",

The results demonstrate that BCM reduces vulnerability and mitigates the impact of supply chain disruptions on operational performance. The study highlights BCM’s contribution to such important components of supply chain resilience as visibility, collaboration and agility. In addition to demonstrating the impact of BCM on supply chain resilience, the paper explains the role of top management in the BCM process, and provides a list of measures that organisations can take to protect themselves from external threats. This is the first study to use statistical analysis to provide empirical validation in this field, while employing a clear definition of BCM in line with international best practices.</jats:p>"

In houses built in accordance with modern domestic regulatory requirements for the thermal resistance of enclosing structures, the actual thermal resistance of walls and windows coincides with the standard. However, nodes of elements of external enclosing structures with increased values of heat loss were found. Insulation of the junction points allows increasing the thermal resistance of the external enclosing structures. In order to increase the energy efficiency of a building, the design of the insulation of the junction of the ceiling in the technical attic has been proposed, which is protected by a patent for a useful model. The linear heat transfer coefficients of the junction point of the ceiling in the attic are analyzed. It was revealed that such information was not indicated in the regulatory documents. Reducing heat loss is achieved by arranging additional layers of insulation in the form of aerogel slabs at the junction of the ceiling to the external enclosing structures. The analysis of the energy efficiency of the proposed design of the junction unit of the attic floor as a \"cold bridge\" was carried out according to the results of mathematical modeling in the DAMWERK software package. Based on the simulation results, the temperature distribution in the junction of the ceiling in the technical attic was established. The linear heat transfer coefficient of the recommended junction point of the ceiling in the technical attic has been determined, the value of which should be taken into account when developing the Energy Efficiency section. The results obtained confirm the feasibility of introducing the proposed structural design of the floor abutment unit in the technical attic, which will improve the energy efficiency of the building's thermal insulation envelope.</jats:p>"

Based on the fuzzy modeling method, it was shown that the maximum amount of budget revenues from the export duty of Russian natural gas from the main gas-bearing regions can almost double. At the same time, the minimum volume in the same case remains virtually unchanged, remaining within 10%. The use of fuzzy modeling in innovation management in the supply chains of Russian natural gas is caused by high volatility in the global commodity markets, both for the underlying asset (in this case, natural gas) and for derivative financial instruments (derivatives). Based on the simplex optimization method, innovation management schemes have been developed in the supply chains of Russian natural gas, taking into account the regional structure of its production. The differences in the economic efficiency of the export duty for the Russian budget between the supply of pipeline natural gas and liquefied natural gas are shown. The author’s methods presented in the article can be used as additional innovative tools for making strategic and operational management decisions by industry leaders and public authorities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electricity supply offers significant and immense benefits to human society, and it is instrumental in driving economic growth, increased standard of living and technological developments. Its sustainable supply and consumption is related to many ecological discussions, and thus, present emphasis on renewable sources, such as solar and hydro. In Nigeria, however, challenges associated with electricity generation, transmission, distribution and consumption have not been adequately tackled. Poor electricity supply has adversely impacted the economy resulting to poor production, higher prices of goods and services, closure of industries, and loss of competitive advantage of Nigerian businesses. Conversely, energy-inefficient and non-conservation consumption behaviour of Nigerian electricity consumers contributes to the electricity demand - demand gap. Energy-efficiency and conservation is a sustainable tool for efficient power system. The paper show that the use of mostly post-paid and unmetered billing system is implicated in energy-inefficient consumption. The paper advocates for deployment of pre-paid meters to every electricity consumer; fiscal management, enforcement of energy saving policies such as use of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL); and emphasis on renewable energy (hydro and solar) sources, for electricity generation.</jats:p>"

In this context, this paper aims to explore the relationship between green supply chain management practices and three different performance aspects, namely, supply chain, green (environmental) and business performance, and controlling for environmental dynamism. Field research was conducted through a structured questionnaire contacted to 134 executives of firms in the agri-food sector in Greece. The results reveal that information sharing, logistics networking and transportation are the most powerful factors that impact sustainable, business and supply chain performance. In addition, green packaging is related to financial and social performance aspects. Interestingly, green warehousing and logistics emissions failed to establish any relationship with performance outcomes. The conclusions and recommendations drawn in the present study are expected to provide meaningful guidance for the supply chain decision-making process, as logistics managers are becoming increasingly aware of exploiting all available resources, knowhow and competitive advantages for attaining sustainable performance.</jats:p>"

It’s a world known fact that Pakistan is an agricultural country; however, the irrigation traditional methods used here are a major reason to decrease the yield per drop. Moreover, certain considerations like barriers to technical adaptation, farming system practices for enhancing water productivity, integrated land and water management, water logging and reclaiming irrigated lands needs to be implemented to fulfill the sufficient water supply for agricultural lands. Protection of water sources, wastewater reuse, low-cost water supply and treatment systems, impacts of farming practices, climate change effects and efficiency of water transport and distribution systems are the key points needs to execute to overcome the water scarcity problem for agriculture sector.

The model enables us to study the impact by running computational experiments more efficiently and consequently by arriving at robust managerial insights much faster. In this paper, we present a case study of the policy impact on the SPSC in the State of Nebraska using the model. The case study uses available real-life data. The study shows that increasing RFS2 does not impact the amount of ethanol blended with gasoline but it might lead to bankruptcy of the refineries. We recommend that the government consider increasing the BW because of its positive economic, environmental and social impacts. For the same reason, we recommend that the tax credit for blending the US produced ethanol with gasoline be at least 0:189 $/gal and the tariff for imported ethanol be at least 1:501 $/gal. These also make the State independent from foreign ethanol thereby enhancing its energy security. Finally, the change in policy impacts the SPSC itself, most importantly it influences the strategic decisions, however setting up a bio-refinery at York county and a blending site at Douglas county emerge as the most robust location decisions against the policy change in the study.</jats:p>"

The quantitative and qualitative composition of the microflora of premises depends on their functional purpose, design features, operating conditions, climate, and other factors, among which the method of ventilation is essential. The moisturizers in air conditioning system are hazardous, which provide bacteria and fungi with water necessary for their life and reproduction. In addition, contaminants accumulated in ventilation systems operate as a substrate for feeding microorganisms. Multi-story administrative, public and residential buildings, industrial buildings, and other places of mass concentration are areas of increased aerobiological risk of infection. In case of improper operation, air conditioning and ventilation systems can be sources of microorganisms in any room. Transmission of infectious aerosol over long distances occurs in rooms with poor ventilation, and a key factor for the outbreak of infection is the direction of airflows. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations and international agencies to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 indoors recommend limiting the operation of exhaust ventilation and recirculation systems. However, there is still insufficient data to clarify the role of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in spreading infection. Risk assessment and decision-making on the choice of air conditioning systems should be dynamic and based on the scale of the pandemic and the verification of the characteristics of HVAC systems and their effectiveness.</jats:p>"

The measurements showed that the heat transfer in circulation pipes is quite complex due to continuous fluctuations in water temperature at the supply of this loop. As it turned out, the application of the classical method of energy balancing and the readings from heat meters gave inaccurate results in this case. The main aim of this study was to develop a different approach to solving the problem of determination of heat losses. The method presented in this article is based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and measurement results as the input data.

Aviation safety is an important component of the concept of general national security, the system of personal security, ecological and public safety and transport safety from external and internal threats. Maintaining an acceptable level of national aviation safety is a priority for the industry. The aviation transport is a part of the transport complex of Ukraine, which is an important component in the structure of the national economy and a link between all components of economic security to ensure the basic conditions of life and development of the state and society. The assessment of economic, technological, safety, social and ecological hazards is an integral part of all the logical blocks of the structural and functional scheme of strategic management of aviation safety in terms of sustainable development of the national economy. The task of the article is to determine and substantiate the main indicators of economic and technological development, safety, social and environmental components of air transport and assess their level. In the article the authors propose and present the dynamics in the period from 2010 to 2020 of 29 indicators of sustainable development of air transport of Ukraine, such us share of aviation transport in the gross value added (transport and communications); level of investment in aviation transport; level of export services of air transport; level of import services of aviation transport; level of shadowing of aviation transport; coefficient of manufacturability of aviation transport; capital utilization coefficient; level of shadow capital load; level of use of passenger capacity of aircraft and helicopters; level of renewal of fixed assets; cargo transport capacity of GDP by aviation transport; passenger transport capacity of GDP by aviation transport; average distance of cargo aviation transportation; average distance of passenger aviation transportation; ratio of domestic and international aviation transportation; catastrophes,  accidents, serious coefficients  for regular commercial/irregular commercial/non-commercial flights and execution of aviation works/training flights; level of wages in the production of aviation transport; level of employment in air transport; coefficient of population mobility; level of official GVA created by shadow wages; level of shadow employment; level of CO2 emissions of aviation transport of Ukraine to GDP; level of emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere; level of environmental costs of aviation transport. Authors determine their threshold and optimal values. Indicators are given in groups in the above areas. Indicators are divided into stimulants (indicators that contribute to the sustainable development of air transport and the national economy) and disincentives (indicators that hinder the sustainable development of air transport and the national economy).

Including the housing and communal complex and the construction industry – for example, a scientific and methodological concept has been created for the implementation of passive monitoring to assess the state of heat supply systems, under the conditions of the initial action, on material flows in them of electromagnetic fields. It has been established that an effective form of reagent-free water preparation in electromagnetic fields is technogenic – the nature of material flows due to the electromagnetic dissociation of their micro particles and the formation of active complexes (due to the interaction between them) is determined. It has been established that as a result of passive monitoring, the systematization and formalization of its data should be carried out taking into account three aspects: engineering - technological, engineering – microbiological and organizational – managerial decisions. It is shown that the passive monitoring system is an obligatory subordinate component of environmental management in the industrial sphere – heat and power facilities of water and steam heat supply systems of an innovative direction. The analysis of the content of the point of view of Ukrainian and foreign scientists, monographs is carried out and joint conclusions are made in the conditions of the illuminated literary material under the following headings: the main economic, environmental and regulatory aspects of nature management; the formation of the biosphere in the conditions of transformation of its individual components; methods of environmental management and environmental policy and the like. In these conditions, the formation of an effective economic mechanism for environmental management is of priority; on the central issue of integral management, it requires clarification – formalization of parameters should be considered effective, which make it possible to clarify a compromise between economic development and environmental safety. It is the economic and environmental analysis of the components of technological processes that makes it possible to establish the limiting factors of development in the system (action – state – improvement) and to determine individual patterns (tendencies) in order to overcome them. The theoretical principles of magnetized water are presented in the works, and the priority level is confirmed by the receipt of three patents of Ukraine for useful action and one copyright certificate for intellectual property, and received support at domestic and foreign conferences. The proposed levers improve integral control in the process of modernizing the technology of non-reagent water treatment (use of electromagnetic fields) at heat and power facilities of rich operating industries and make it impossible to process environmental pollution and save energy costs with effective continuous planning of new facilities. Therefore, through the analysis of the general environmental situation, the technical state of the initial data systems, it is possible to confirm the developed classification and formalization of passive monitoring data, on the use of theoretical foundations in practice – the regulations for industrial implementation, is the basis of the concept of sustainable development.</jats:p>"

As a result, complete and timely combustion of fuel and good use of the air available in the engine cylinders can be achieved only with very high-quality mixing. The use of biofuels in modern diesel engines causes a number of problems associated with changes in the parameters of fuel supply and mixing. All types of fuel have different characteristics: density, viscosity, lubricating properties, self-ignition temperature, compressibility and. in this regard, the laws of fuel supply: spraying, combustion, will be different.\nThe viscosity of biofuels is higher than that of diesel fuel. For this reason, its capacity through small holes in the nozzle of the nozzle (dh= 0.25...0.40 mm) lower than diesel fuel. Due to the small diameter of the holes in the nozzle nozzles and the increased viscosity of biofuels, the nozzle holes are quickly coked. At the same time, the shape and direction of the jet initially changes, and then the hole is completely coked and the fuel supply stops. Thus, for high-quality operation of the diesel engine on biofuels, it is necessary to modernize the design of the mixing and fuel supply system. This problem can be solved by using systems with separate combustion chambers, i.e. using vortex chamber mixing.\nIn the vortex chamber, 60-80% of the fuel burns, the pressure increases and the burning torches of the fuel flow at high speed into the main over-piston plane of the combustion chamber, where there is a significant supply of air that is not used during the combustion of the charge in this chamber. At the same time, oxygen from the air is well used, and the operation of the diesel engine becomes more efficient at relatively low values of the excess air coefficient at the nominal mode and less toxicity of exhaust gases than for single-chamber diesels.</jats:p>",

Must δ13C was lower in the irrigated N0 and N60 vines, whereas irrigation treatments did not differ under the N120 rate. The relative weight of irrigation and fertilisation effect on leaf δ13C varied across samplings: N application accounted for a higher proportion of leaf δ13C variance during the early stages of berry growth, whereas irrigation induced higher variance of leaf δ13C after veraison. The weight of the irrigation effect on cane δ13C was higher from that of fertilisation.Discrimination mechanisms against 13C in grapevine could be mediated by both N fertilisation and irrigation. The well-documented explanation of δ13C variation based on isotopic effects during CO2 diffusion through leaf stomata and carboxylation driven by water conditions may not apply to all cases, since additional discriminating processes against 13C associated with CO2 transfer from the intercellular spaces to the carboxylation sites may be affected by nitrogen supply.The study provides evidence for the first time that carbon isotope composition of leaf blades, canes and berry must is modulated by nitrogen supply. Interpretations of carbon isotope natural abundance in field grown grapevine tissues should therefore consider both water and nitrogen availability.</jats:p>"

This reservoir is in Minas Gerais, Brazil, and covers an area of approximately 143 km2 across seven municipalities. The dissolved iron (DFe) presented the highest percentage of standards violations (31.7% to 80.5%), most frequently in the reservoir tributaries. The Mann–Kendall tests indicated that the monitoring stations showed an increasing trend of 78.5% N–NH4+ and 64.1% DFe. During the evaluated period, the reservoir waters were classified as excellent (1.2%), good (61.3%), acceptable (29.5%), and poor (8.0%) according to the WQI for the proposed use. The poorest quality classes were more frequent in the tributaries, especially in the year 2009. The WQI seasonal assessment indicated a worsening during the rainy season in 57% of the stations, as a result of external material transport to the water bodies. The CCME WQI, in conjunction with temporal statistical analysis, contributed to the interpretation of the monitoring data, generating important information for reservoir water quality management.</jats:p>",

Climate change, population growth, and urbanization have only exacerbated this crisis. For the Caribbean, climate change through the impact of increasing temperatures and rainfall variability has resulted in more frequent and intense episodes of disasters including droughts and floods which have impaired the quantity and quality of freshwater supplies. Using Caribbean-specific climate forecasting, it is shown that rainfall totals in Kingston, Jamaica, are expected to reduce by 2030 and 2050 under two RCPs. In addition, the timing of the primary rainy season is expected to shift, potentially impacting water supply security. Analysis of the potential of rainwater harvesting (RWH) to augment supply and enhance water supply resilience shows that in two communities studied in Kingston, it can contribute up to 7% of total water supply. Household storage requirements are about 1 m3 per household, which is feasible. RWH offers the potential to contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation measures at a household level. Policy, incentives, and increased awareness about the potential of RWH to meet non-potable household demand in Kingston must be improved, as well as efforts to reduce the currently unreasonably high levels of non-revenue water in order to move towards an integrated, sustainable, and climate-resilient urban water supply strategy for the city.</jats:p>"

It recodes all the processes involved in the distribution of specific products until transported to final customers. Blockchain (BC) technology is a decentralized network that records all the transactions in real-time and is used in many areas such as cryptocurrency. In this paper, we work on an ESC system that records all the transactions based on BC technology using a drug supply chain system as a case study. The recording of the transactions consists of three main stages. First, all the parties of the ESC system are represented in the BC network as clients with unique identities. Second, all the information related to a specific drug is recorded inside the transaction and each transaction has its own signature. Finally, all the transactions of the drug from the manufacture to the patient are recorded inside a block with a unique identity for each block. These steps inside the BC are performed based on security cryptography mechanisms, such as rivest-shamir-adleman (RSA) and secure hash algorithm SHA. The results illustrate that the proposed approach protects the drugs from counterfeiting, ensures the reliability, and provides a real-time tracking system for the transactions that have occurred among ESC parties.</jats:p>"

This communication focuses on the Kanchan arsenic filter (KAF), presented in the early 2000s and widely assessed during the past decade. The KAF contains iron nails as the Fe0 source and is primarily designed to remove As from polluted tube well waters. Recent independent works assessing their performance have all reported on a high degree of variability in efficiency depending mostly on the following factors: (1) the current operating conditions, (2) the design, and (3) the groundwater chemistry. This communication shows that the major problems of the KAF are two-fold: (1) a design mistake as the Fe0 units disturb the operation and functionality of the biosand filter, and (2) the use of poorly characterized iron nails of unknown reactivity. This assertion is supported by the evidence that the very successful community filter designed by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay works with iron nails and has been efficient for many years. Replacing iron nails by more reactive Fe0 materials (e.g., iron fillings and steel wool) should be tested in a new generation KAF. It is concluded that a methodological or systematic approach in introducing and monitoring the efficiency of KAF should be used to test and disseminate the next generation KAF worldwide. Moreover, better characterization of the Fe0 materials including their intrinsic reactivity is required.</jats:p>"

Uncertainty arises from the lack of transparent access to manufacturer capabilities, the inability to auto-discover service providers who are best capable for a given job request, and the dependence on human word-of-mouth trust network relationships that exist in the manufacturing supply chain. This uncertainty slows down the pace of product development lifecycles from a viewpoint of inefficient forms of supplier assessment, vetting, selection, and compliance, leading to a trust tax tacked onto the final price of products. In times of global crisis such as the coronavirus disease pandemic, this uncertainty also leads to inefficient forms of gathering information on manufacturing capability, available capacity, and registered licenses and assessing compliance. This technical note outlines solution pathways that can help ease the search and discovery process of connecting clients and manufacturing service providers through digitally enabled technologies.</jats:p>",

Inter-country differences in initial exposure, cultural/environmental factors, reporting requirements and stringency of mitigation strategies were incorporated. Asymptomatic patients and super-spreaders were also factored into our model. Using these data, our model estimated 65.8% of cases as asymptomatic; symptomatic and asymptomatic people were estimated to infect 2.12 and 5.83 other people, respectively. An estimated 9.55% of cases were super-spreaders with a 2.11-fold higher transmission rate than average. Our model estimated a mean maximum infection rate of 0.927 cases/day (inter-country range, 0.63–1.41) without mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies with a stringency index value of ≥60% were estimated to be required to reduce the reproduction ratio below 1. It was predicted that cases over the next 2 months would differ between countries, with certain countries likely to experience an accelerated accumulation of cases.

Ensuring transparency, integrity, and availability is the primary requirement for establishing a proper supply chain network. Blockchain is a distributed structure of immutable records that are chained together to form blocks. It provides a guarantee of storing the data correctly and reliably. Smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts containing the terms of the agreement between the entities involved, provide utility for automation of reputation calculation with the transactions. Reputation systems allow participants to rate each other, thus building trust through reputation. The present reputation systems have bounded scrutiny and lack granularity; hence they are not ideal for supply chains. In this work, we propose a reliable supply chain framework using blockchain and smart contracts. It uses a consortium blockchain network to trace communication between the participants and to calculate reputation scores dynamically. Rewards and penalties are assigned to the participants of the supply chain network based on the food product quality involved in the trade. The network participants have defined roles and the access permissions govern who can access the ledger. An immutable ledger stores all the transactions occurring in the network. Any change in one block will reflect in the consecutive blocks, which ensures the data is reliable and secure. The proposed system is implemented using Hyperledger Composer. The proposed framework is evaluated in terms of throughput and latency for varying asset size and batch size using the benchmarking tool Caliper. Results show that the security and reliability provided by the proposed framework justify the overheads in contrast to a trading model that does not include a blockchain network.</jats:p>",

Due to the lack of biological factor evaluation in water quality evaluation at present, the conventional pollution index evaluation system was used to evaluate water quality and the correlation between the evaluation indexes and the concentration of cyanobacteria was studied. After determining the correlation, a novel calculation method using the cyanobacteria pollution index was determined by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the eutrophication index and nitrogen phosphorus index of the water body were high. Biological pollution in reservoirs cannot be ignored. The correlation between eutrophication index and cyanobacteria concentration was weak (Pearson correlation = 0.242). For the reservoir, it was necessary to establish a special cyanobacteria pollution index. Five variables were used for the cyanobacteria pollution index calculation by the PCA method. The total variance of the two main components was 77.107%, which reflected most of the data information. In the reservoirs of other areas, similar parameters can also be selected to calculate the cyanobacteria pollution index. This research provides a reference for the biological factor evaluation of similar reservoirs in the world.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a review of the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus considering the environmental impacts generated by humans' reliance on water, energy, and food for their subsistence. Our review assesses the WEF with respect to the agricultural, industrial, and urban sectors and their use of water, energy, and food. The multi-sectorial assessment addresses options for improved management that avoids or mitigates adverse impacts in the agricultural, industrial, and urban sectors. Activities such as the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the agricultural sector, for instance, cause water, air, and soil pollution, which leads to social calamities and environmental degradation. Therefore, examining the effects of mismanagement in one sector on other sectors from the perspective of the WEF nexus is necessary for improved resource management and environmental protection. A literature review revealed that factors or practices of resources use influence sectors differently and with varying degrees of effectiveness in reducing the environmental damage caused by resources use. Improved social awareness on resource consumption, the use of renewable energy, improved energy efficiency, the reduction of food waste, improved animal husbandry, and other factors involved in the WEF nexus are herein examined. This paper's analysis demonstrates that every action and manner of resource use in one sector also affects other sectors and their resources use, thus calling for a unified analysis of the WE nexus.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Adequacy of liquidity is very important for Islamic banks to carry out their main functions as Islamic financial intermediaries and provide financing for the real sector. However, many Islamic banks are proven to have a shock in providing liquidity due to the weak capital structure of the bank. While cash-waqf funds can be a potential source of capital for sharia banks if managed as capital investments in sharia banks with a mudharabah or musyrakah contract. Therefore, using the autoregressive multivariate threshold simulation model approach, this study attempts to analyze the dynamic interaction between the monetary policy regime, cash-capital capital ventures, Islamic bank liquidity and inflation in East Java. The participation of waqf funds on Islamic bank capital is simulated at 1%, 5% and 10% with two regimens of threshold models, namely a tightening monetary policy regime and a monetary policy easing regime. The data in this study were obtained from Statistik Perbankan Syariah (SFS) published by the OJK and BI with the observation period of 2014.M1 - 2018.M6. The results show that the inclusion of waqf funds in Islamic bank capital is able to reduce the length of the period and the sharia bank liquidity shock both in high interest rate policy regime and low interest rate regime.</jats:p>"

A successful “European Green Deal” would have the up-to-now underestimated geopolitical advantage of making the European Union less dependent on Russian hydrocarbons. In this article, we illustrate Russian power-politics and its geopolitical implications by analyzing the illustrative case of the North Caucasus, which has been traditionally a strategic region for Russia. The present article describes and analyses the impact of Russian intervention in the North Caucasian secessionist conflict since 1991 and its importance in terms of natural resources, especially hydrocarbons. The geopolitical power secured by Russia in the North Caucasian conflict has important implications for European Union’s energy supply security and could be regarded as a strong argument in favor of the “European Green Deal”.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study was conducted in three (3) States of the North-Central Nigeria to investigate households’ labor supply to health shocks in urban north-central of Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to select 900 households from 18 Council Wards across the three (3) States of north-central of Nigeria covering a period of five (5) months (March to July, 2019). The study found that labor supply was an important response to illness as households increased their labor supply in response to illness shocks. The results showed that 14% of men and 21% of women employed in the study areas missed at least one day of work due to unanticipated illness. Also, women in the labor force missed work due to illness or caregiving duties in 6.2% of weeks and 3.2% of weeks for men. Men and women work more in order to increase their take-home pay and compensate for the lost income due to absence from work of another household members. The findings further showed that men were 7.8% points more likely to work in weeks in which another worker in the household is unexpectedly ill. The men worked an average of 0.385 more days (P = 0.13) and 4.9 more hours as the result of the illness of a fellow worker in the household. It was also disclosed that the overall labor supply response (P = 0.17) was driven by males in households with less assets and education. The regression estimates showed that males in wealthier households were less likely to increase labor supply when another worker in the household was unexpectedly ill. A one (1) standard deviation increase in assets was associated with 0.313 fewer days worked by man in response to an illness shock (P = 0.17) and fewer hours (P = 0.15) implying that wealthier households had fungible savings that they can access to smoothen consumption after short-run shocks. The study also found that total household earnings fell by N91.00 and N72.00 when men and women, respectively, missed work because of illness. The estimated labor hour’s responses showed a larger drop of 32 hours for male illness and 18 hours for female. It was concluded that despite the increase in labor supply from other males in the household, total household income and labor supply decreased when a household member was unexpectedly ill. The study recommended health insurance policies by the government towards a reduction of illness burden for the households in the study area.</jats:p>"

As experience in the construction of the first geothermal power plants operating along the Kalina cycle shows, the efficiency of heat use increases sharply due to the utilization of the heat of low-potential energy sources. As such, energy sources use ground, in particular, geothermal water. In regions where there are enough geothermal sources, power plants based on the Kalina cycle can be used. The generated heat and electricity can be used for agro-industrial complexes. This is possible, as theoretical studies show, for enterprises in the field of crop production, animal husbandry and processing of agricultural products.

In everyday life we can see the importance of water for all living things, as well as human beings who also need water very much. In Jorong Dalam Nagari Barulak Tanah Datar, the need for clean water is difficult to obtain. This is because the position of this area is in the highlands. During the summer in the highlands it is very difficult to find a source of clean water, so that to meet these water needs, people get it by buying. The solution to overcome this problem is to apply science and technology in the form of a hydram pump that utilizes water pressure from a reservoir from a spring. Then the water is pumped through a pipeline to the divider tank at an elevated area. Clean water supply using a hydram pump is able to distribute water by 18.43 liters/min. So that the performance of a hydram pump continuously (within 24 hours) can supply of water as much as 26.54 m3/day. Applying appropriate technology in the form of a hydram pump as an effort to optimize the supply of clean water from the lowlands to the highlands so that it can address the water needs in the Nagari Barulak community. Utilizing the potential of existing water resources has an impact on increasing activities and reducing public funding for buying clean water.</jats:p>"

The study identifies FSCM and supply chain management’s basic definitions and focuses on a systematic literature review. None of the identified previously proposed definitions of FSCM has comprehensively covered all the significant operational issues in FSCM. Thus, the study further undertook the mapping of identified definitions with six key focusses in FSCM identified through the literature survey. This study systematically proposes a comprehensive definition of FSCM. Findings suggested that “Quality management” includes safety and traceability of the food product and “Sustainable Management,” including proper waste management as the most critical focus in FSCM. This study proposes a comprehensive FSCM definition comprising key managerial that focuses on the food supply chain (FSC). The literature survey is done with 160 selected papers and has subjectivity in mapping and analysis. This definition seems essential for theory building, as none of the available definitions has included all the dominant characteristics of FSCM. A comprehensive definition of FSCM would act as a reference point for supply chain-based research on the food sector. </jats:p>",

Under this background, this paper explored the evolution, spatial difference, and coordination development of the regional innovation system in the period of 2007 to 2017 from the demand and supply perspective. We found that, during the study period, the development level of the innovation demand subsystem (IDS) and innovation supply subsystem (ISS), as well as their coordinated development, all showed an increasing trend. The development gap of IDS and the coordinated development among cities in YREB was quite balanced, while there existed a large gap among cities in YREB in the development of ISS. The development of IDS was better than the development of ISS in most of the cities of YREB, indicating that the innovation development of cities in YREB needs supply-side structural reform urgently. Most cities in YREB were at the moderately or slightly uncoordinated development phase, and Shanghai was the only city with coordinated development between IDS and ISS. This paper enriches the regional innovation system from a new perspective, the demand and supply perspective, as well as providing suggestions for the coordinated development of the regional innovation system in YREB.</jats:p>"

The MFT biosynthetic gene cluster is commonly found in mycobacteria, including <jats:italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</jats:italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Since the MFT molecule is highly interesting for basic research and could even serve as a potential drug target, large-scale production of the molecule is highly desired. However, conventional shake flask cultivations failed to produce enough MFT for further biochemical characterization like kinetic studies and structure elucidation, and a more comprehensive study of cultivation parameters is urgently needed. Being a redox cofactor, it can be hypothesized that the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) is a critical parameter for MFT formation. Using the non-pathogenic strain <jats:italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</jats:italic> mc<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> 155, shake flask experiments with online measurement of the oxygen uptake and the carbon dioxide formation, were conducted under different levels of oxygen supply. Using liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry, a 4–8 times increase of MFT production was identified under oxygen-limited conditions, in both complex and mineral medium. Moreover, the level of oxygen supply modulates not only the overall MFT formation but also the length of the glycosidic chain. Finally, all results were scaled up into a 7 L stirred tank reactor to elucidate the kinetics of MFT formation. Ultimately, this study enables the production of high amounts of these redox cofactors, to perform further investigations into the role and importance of MFTs.</jats:p>"

Institutional performance seems to have a positive and significant effect on external green practices, however, affect negatively to internal practices. Leadership pressure also has a negative effect on external green collaborations. Both internal and external factors also seem to have a positive and significant effect on both organizational and economic performance. As expected, economic performance seems to affect organizational performance, moreover, external Green Collaboration also affect Internal Green Practices, positively. Organizations and decision-makers of the food industry are provided with detailed insight into implementing a green supply chain, from multiple perspectives of the organization, which may help the decision-makers in formulating the strategies. It is a novel attempt to assess the organizational and economic performance of the food industry in Pakistan, using a modified version of the Ahmed &amp; Najmi model, as it shed light for the first time on how institutions and leadership can influence the performance of the food industry through green practices.</jats:p>"

To tackle these problems, a method by using a smooth weighted round-robin scheduling based on backpressure flow control (BF-SWRR) is proposed. The method is developed based on a model for message queues and real-time streaming computing. By using telemetry data flow as input data sources, the fields of data sources are segmented into different sets by using a distributed model of stream computing parallel processing. Moreover, the round-robin (RR) scheduling method for the distributed server is improved. The parallelism, memory occupancy, and system delay are tested by taking a high-speed train section of a certain line as an example. The result showed that the BF-SWRR method for clusters can control the delay to within 1 s. When the parallelism of distributed clusters is set to 8, occupancy rates of the CPU and memory can be decreased by about 15%. In this way, the overall load of the cluster during stream computing is more balanced.</jats:p>"

Good planning is based on a good prediction of what is going to happen to prepare a company, a department, and their environments for certain future developments and their intermediate states. In this context, resources are allocated to these future states in the most efficient way, given a certain set of resource conditions. Although market volatility demands the high adaptability of companies’ operations, dynamic planning is still not widespread. As a result, the alignment of planning processes with potential scenarios is not given, leading to a lack of solution preparation in the long term, suboptimal decision-making in the medium term, and corrective measures in the short term, with higher costs and a lower service level. Therefore, the aim of this research is to propose a predictive approach that will help managers develop sales and operations planning (S&amp;OP) with higher accuracy and stability. For this purpose, a methodology combining demand scenarios, statistical analysis of the demand, forecasting techniques, random number generation, and system dynamics was developed. The goal of this predictive S&amp;OP is to predict the supply chain system’s behavior to generate plans that prevent potential inefficiencies, thereby avoiding corrective measures. In addition, to assess the methodology, the model is applied in the software Vensim, for an automotive producer´s supply chain, to compare the predictive S&amp;OP model with a classical approach. The results show that the proposed predictive approach can increase a manufacturer’s efficiency by increasing its adaptability through the identification of potential inefficiencies and can also be used to prepare solutions.</jats:p>"

Simulation studies to determine the protective effectiveness of the filter respirator on the testers were performed according to the procedure for determining the penetration coefficient of test aerosol – sodium chloride, as the ratio of the submask concentration of test aerosol to the ambient concentration formed in a special chamber that meets the requirements of DSTU EN 13274. Determination of the amount of air supplied by the air purification unit to the submask space and assessment of the value of positive pressure inside the mask was performed according to the procedure described in DSTU EN 12941: 2004. As a result of simulated laboratory tests to determine the protective effectiveness of filter respirators with forced air supply to the testers, it was found that the average result of the protection factor of the test samples ranged from 99.93 to 99.97, which meets the requirements of DSTU EN 12941: 2004. In addition, it was found that the amount of air treated by the fan of the air purification device for clean filters is 165 and 215 dm3/min for operating modes “Normal” and “Turbo”, while for the polluted filters it is reduced to 131 and 185 dm3/min, respectively. During the study, the compliance of the value of excess pressure in the submask space with the requirements of DSTU EN 12941: 2004, which should not exceed 2.5 mbar, was confirmed. It is also determined that the stability of the technical parameters of the air purification device is maintained in the specified range when charging the “Dinogy Li-Pol 11000mAh 14.8V 4S 25C” brand battery not less than 12 V to ensure the current value of not less than 1.6 A.

The greater challenge is to know how the two constructs affects organization’s sustainability and performance. This study aims to investigate the relationship between stakeholder pressure (SP), sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), corporate sustainability performance (CSP) &amp; financial performance (FP). For this we proposed a theoretical framework, modifying Wolf (2014) model, to incorporate the mediating role of sustainable SCM. Stakeholder pressure is captured by environment issues, and social supply chain issues. Sustainable SCM was measured by waste reduction (WR), green purchasing (GP) and social supply chain standards (SSCS). Empirical validity was established by conducting a survey using close ended questionnaire. Data was collected from 310 employees and analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and structured equation modeling. Findings shows that environmental issues have significant effect on CSP, FP &amp; SSCM, sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) except green purchasing (GP) has significant effect on CSP, FP hence green purchasing has insignificant results. Social supply chain issues have not a significant effect on CSP, FP and waste reduction (WR). There is a mediating effect of SSCM on environmental issues leads to CSP &amp; FP, but not on supply chain issues. This study will add to the existing knowledge of sustainability in by different firms of a developing country like Pakistan. This will also help in understanding that how stakeholder’s pressure effects the reputation of organizations in result firms mount their strategies and tactics, and can better understand that what measures they should take for environmental and social standards by focusing on employee safety, suppliers’ engagement, and safety programs.</jats:p>"

Therefore, part of the financial burden placed on the government by way of subsidizing the fossil fuel purchase and delivery to the settlements of the Arctic regions. Through the example the Tsypnavolok settlement, which is located in one of such regions, wind power plants using for heat supply are shown to be considered as a measure to reduce the government financial burdens. For Tsypnavolok the cost of power produced by the wind power plant revealed by calculations is amount to 67.02 USD/Gcal. This is not so many as the average heat tariff (67.9 USD/Gcal). At such heat supply indexes, wind power plants are not only to reduce the government financial burdens, but also to bring an extra income.</jats:p>",

SCM has been widely covered in many industrial areas and, in line with other burgeoning sectors such as Tourism, an industry focus provides the opportunity to look in-depth at the context-based factors that affect SCM. Developments in digital distribution and rapid technological innovations have resulted in an increased focus on Digital Supply Chains (DSCs), which bring about significant changes to how consumers, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers interact, affecting supply chain design and processes. Through a systematic review of the Videogames Industry Supply Chain Management literature, which serves as a pertinent contextual example of a DSC, we look at how supply chains are affected by structural, market and technological change, such as increased platformisation, disintermediation and the proliferation of digital distribution. We distil these findings into a new research agenda, which identifies themes in line with extant DSC research, provides a series of relevant practice recommendations and identifies opportunities for future research.</jats:p>",

The procedure consists of replacing the circular section with a polygonal configuration of twelve (12) sections. The study of the model was divided into five different versions according to the variants of technical modifications of the water intake funnel; this configuration was tested on a hydraulic model in the laboratory of hydroelectric power plants of the Moscow State University of Environmental Engineering. The use of the polygonal section weir can greatly simplify the formwork of the structure, also the free entry funnel increases the discharge coefficient by 20%, without exposing the head of the weir to the risk of cavitation. In the event of submersion, the adopted design can ensure the crossing of an estimated relative flow with a probability of P = 0.01%, which means reducing the height of the dam by 0.68 m, and thus making the hydraulic structure more efficient economically and more reliable. The experimental model was produced on a 1:60 scale of the prototype, which guarantees self-simulation of the hydraulic phenomena of the Djedra dam, and its final design is judged to be hydraulically satisfactory and recommended for construction.</jats:p>",

Inadequacy of capital has been identified as one of the constraints faced by youth farmers. This research work aimed to analyse credit demand and supply markets among youth farmers. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive, multiple regression and Z-test. Most credits were sourced through informal souces by the youth farmers. Personal savings(65%), RoSCAs (52.5%) and Money lender(50.8%) respectively are from the informal sources while LAPO (42%) and even commercial bank (15%) which is the least are obtained from formal sources. Further, the study showed that 50% of the respondents demanded credit to the tune of N2, 000,000 while most of the credit supplied(45.83%) was only less than N100.000. The multiple regression results showed an R2 value of 0.65. The study identified the potential credit demanded by the farmers to be at the range of N1, 000,001-2,000,000. Furthermore, the study identified age, marital status, level of education, interest rate and credit awareness as the major determinants of the volume of actual credit supplied by youth farmers. The test for significant difference shows that there is significant difference in the amount of credit sourced and required by the youth farmers by 1%. The study recommends that the interest rate charged on credit facilities should be reduced to motivate the youth farming in the study area to source for credit</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Implementation of state problems in the field of public health protection is impossible without the participation of phar- maceutical specialists, which requires a comprehensive assessment of existing practices in the field of health and social work from the consumers’ view. The purpose of the research is to study the expectations, preferences and consumers satisfaction with the level of participation of pharmacists in maintaining and improving the public health. Materials and methods. The assessment of consumer expectations and preferences was based on the analysis of the survey results using standard methods of statistical analysis (two-sample student test, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test with a significance level of p&lt;0.05, Friedman’s rank analysis of variance) in the software products Statistica 10 and Microsoft Excel. Results. Analysis of consumer expectations and their satisfaction regarding the participation of pharmacists in public health has allowed to define the portrait of the most competent and at the same time demanding visitor pharmacies. It’s a woman 36-50 years old with higher education that has got children up to 18 years and/or older relatives (friends), and/or with chronic diseases and receiving multiple medications on a regular basis. With increasing age, the number of chronic diseases and, consequently, the number of necessary medications, consumer expectations are also increase. The public reaction to the participation of pharmacists in public health protection is mostly positive, however the pharmaceutical specialist is more widely perceived in society as an expert on medicines, rather than on healthcare in general. For all consumers of pharmaceutical services, the most significant characteristic is the level of pharmacists’ professional compe- tence. Regular consumers of pharmacy services express a higher willingness to follow the pharmacists’ recommendations to pre- serve and promote health (such as healthy diet, physical activity, solving problems associated with quitting smoking). At the same time, consumers without any health problems are less motivated to receive health-saving recommendations from a pharmacist. Conclusion: The modern society is aware of the significant role of pharmacists in the implementation of health-saving technologies, although the range of their professional tasks rarely goes further than the sphere of medicines supply. This fact requires the phar- macy manager to focus on monitoring the compliance of specialists ‘ competencies with consumer expectations. The greatest interest in receiving health-saving recommendations from pharmacists is shown by older patients having chronic dis- eases and taking medicines on a regular basis, while the involvement of other categories of pharmacy’s visitors in preventive con- sultations remains low. This circumstance indicates the potential for strengthening the preventive component of pharmaceutical counseling, which will allow visitors to form a deeper understanding of pharmacists as full participants in the healthcare system.</jats:p>",

The approach to implementation of parallel operation of LED luminaire powered by two sources of power is presented. It is simple, cheap and highly reliable as compared to the existing solutions. Based on this approach, four diagrams are developed which are applicable correspondingly to lighting applications and characteristics of photovoltaic modules and power consumers. The first and the second diagrams contain minimal quantity of transformers, but a number of operational constraints shall be taken into account when using them. The third diagram contains standard transformers and implies minimal number of various constraints, which makes it an optimal solution for the low-power lighting system being designed. The fourth diagram is expensive due to utilisation of equipment with automatic maximum power point tracking (the MPPT technology); it provides maximum possible energy efficiency of the lighting systems but the advantages of the MPPT technology apply only to high-power systems.\nIt is preferable to use such objects where lighting is mostly required during daytime as consumers of such systems (shopping malls, underground passages, storage facilities, poultry farms, etc.). A positive aspect is increase in reliability of consumer power supply since power supply of LED luminaires will be also provided by an additional source.\nThe proposed approach leads to reduction of power consumption for LED lighting, saving of fossil energy sources and therefore to ecologisation of the environment.</jats:p>",

The cost of coal mining and economical and environmentally sustainable usage of mined coal could be optimized by efficient management of coal supply chain. This paper provides a mathematical model for improving coal supply chain sustainability including the cost of exergy destruction (entropy). In the proposed method, exergy analysis is used to formulate the model considering not only economic costs but also destructed exergy cost, while genetic algorithm is applied to efficiently solve the proposed model. In order to validate the proposed methodology, some numerical examples of coal supply chains are presented and discussed to show the usability of the proposed exergetic coal supply chain model and claim its benefits over the existing models. According to the results, the proposed method provides 17.6% saving in the consumed exergy by accepting 2.7% more economic costs. The presented model can be used to improve the sustainability of coal supply chain for either designing new projects or upgrading existing processes.</jats:p>",

Analytically, the situation invites a perspective that links practical/on-the-ground responses by commercial actors in the politics of technological competition between superpowers, i.e. a discussion that bridges the gap between policy and process. This article therefore approaches management of supply chain disruption in terms of a key security issue motivating recent changes to the trade environment: the protection of intellectual property. After reviewing critical policy developments and trade statistics, we draw upon data on IP-intensive industries from global patent offices, trade classifications for products made by these IP-intensive industries, and concordance data on patent classifications to illustrate the centrality of IP to extended supply chains. With these key relationships in mind, we outline specific opportunities that intellectual property licensing provides for managing supply chain linkages between the United States and China in the current geopolitical environment. Viewing intellectual property as both a driver of and a solution to trade difficulties highlights the sorts of cross-jurisdictional nuances that can better inform policy and business decisions alike in the broader international trade regime.</jats:p>",

Mathematical models comprising two manufacturers and a single retailer are developed to capture the impact of bundling policy and advertisement strategy under three power-balance structures, namely Manufacturer Stackelberg, Retailer Stackelberg and Vertical Nash. Following game theory models and numerical examples, the study found that the total profit of the supply chain is undifferentiated under the manufacturer Stackelberg and Vertical Nash case in the manufacturer bundling and retailer bundling strategies. However, total supply chain profit under manufacturer bundling strongly dominates under retailer bundling in Retailer Stackelberg and Vertical Nash, and remains valid under multiple settings of market size, price elasticity and advertising elasticity. It is also found that manufacturer bundling is significantly affected by advertising effort compared to retailer bundling. The study contributes to the literature interfacing supply chain and marketing by studying bundling policy and advertising strategy simultaneously for homogenous products, under various power-balance structures and price competition.</jats:p>",

Of these, more than 90% reside in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Asia-Pacific LMICs rural populations are more impoverished and have poorer access to medical care, placing them at greater risk of poor health outcomes.

Rural background showed strong association with both rural preference and actual work in most studies. There was a paucity in literature on the effect of rural pathway in medical education such as rural-oriented curricula, rural clerkships and internship; however, when combined with other educational and regulatory interventions, they were effective. An additional area, atop of the WHO categories was identified, relating to health system factors, such as governance, health service organization and financing. Studies generally were of low quality—frequently overlooking potential confounding variables, such as respondents’ demographic characteristics and career stage—and 39% did not clearly define ‘rural’.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This review is consistent with, and extends, most of the existing evidence on effective strategies to recruit and retain rural doctors while specifically informing the range of evidence within the Asia-Pacific LMIC context. Evidence, though confined to 12 countries, is drawn from 20 years’ research about a wide range of factors that can be targeted to strengthen strategies to increase rural medical workforce supply in Asia-Pacific LMICs. Multi-faceted approaches were evident, including selecting more students into medical school with a rural background, increasing public-funded universities, in combination with rural-focused education and rural scholarships, workplace and rural living support and ensuring an appropriately financed rural health system. The review identifies the need for more studies in a broader range of Asia-Pacific countries, which expand on all strategy areas, define rural clearly, use multivariate analyses, and test how various strategies relate to doctor’s career stages.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

Several public transportation modes are available in Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) such as buses, heavy rails, vans, boats, taxis, and trains while in some areas have fewer modes of public transport available. The disparity of public transport service negatively impacts social equity. This study aims to identify the gaps between public transport supply and demand and to demonstrate introduced indicators to assess the public transport performance incorporating transport capacity and equilibrium access aspects. Supply index was used to evaluate the level of service, and the demand index was applied to estimate travel needs. Furthermore, the Lorenz curves and the Gini coefficients were used to measure the equity of public transport. The results highlight that more than half of the BMR population is living in low-supply high-demand areas for public transportation. Moreover, the equitable access analysis has identified that the high-income population has better access to public transport than the low-income population. The results suggest that public transport gaps and equity indicate the inclusiveness of public transportation, as well as to the areas where to improve the public transport service. Thus, the methodology used in this study can be applied to another city or region similar to BMR.</jats:p>"

The influence of the changes in the electromagnetic nozzle’s adjustable geometric clearances on the injected fuel and the dephasing of this process in relation to the moment of transmission of the control pulse are examined.

In addition, the effects of land use and land cover (LULC) alteration with climate change on streamflow and sediment yield have been evaluated in the Dez river basin in the southwest of Iran. Five General Circulation Models (GCMs) based on two scenarios, Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 for the near period (2021–2040) are considered. Hydrological simulation is performed using the Soil and Water assessment tool (SWAT) with good performance in the calibration (1990 to 2010) and validation (2010 to 2017) periods. The precipitation and temperature projected show a major upward trend related to the base period. The results showed that climate change increases the runoff and sediments. In addition, results projected that garden crop yields would increase while agricultural crop yields would decrease. In addition, AET will face a slight decline of about 2%–6%. Combined LULC and climate change scenarios showed that with amplification of orchards areas, sediment load would decrease.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the supply chain management concept became “greener” with the development, among other practices, of reverse logistics programs. Both external pressures and internal factors, such as reducing costs and increasing operational performance, are motivating companies to pay more attention to the reverse flow. Unfortunately, there are still many boundaries that hinder the implementation of reverse logistics. Some of these obstacles include additional costs, the desire for deep collaboration with suppliers and customers, and the belief of some managers that are managing reverse flow that it is not worth the trouble. On the contrary, those who have assimilated its importance and advantages are interested in new and innovative tools that could contribute to more effective and efficient results, including the role of RFID technology.</jats:p>"

We consider that these studies can form the basis for the development of methods for calculating and designing geothermal ventilation systems for climate conditions of Ukraine. The analysis of literature sources showed that now there are quite a lot of studies devoted to the issues of geothermal ventilation. The results of such heat exchanger modeling with various geometric data and which operate in their authentic soils under various hydraulic regimes and that are located at different depths are widely presented. However, these studies do not allow obtaining generalized patterns of heat transfer during the operation of the heat exchangers and the influence of the geometric parameters of the heat exchanger on the operation of the geothermal ventilation system as a whole. Much attention is paid to the issues of modelling the operation of such heat exchangers and the distinctive features of each of these models. Also important are the results of experimental studies carried out on our own experimental bench and with the help of which the numerical model was validated. To conduct experimental research on the operation of the geothermal ventilation system at the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine an experimental stand was created. This stand is designed to study thermophysical processes during the operation of a geothermal ventilation system elements. The results of these studies are the basis for the development of a method for determining the optimal diameter of the earth-to-air heat exchanger under operating conditions for soil in Kyiv, Ukraine.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is currently a discussion going on in the scientific community about using digital twins and modeling to manage risks in the supply chains. This need for constructing digital twins is caused by the low reliability and stability of supply chains due to the faults in their operation. These faults are a result of risks in the supply chains which can be consolidated into two types. The first type is operational risks. These are the current risks of the supply chain itself caused by an uncer-tainty of supply and demand as well as by an obstructed flow of information along the supply chain. The second type is critical risks caused by force majeure. These risks disrupt the normal operation of the supply chain and critically reduce the most important performance indicators of the company such as annual income and profits. Risks happen due to natural or man-made causes such as fires and floods in the distribution centers or at production facilities, legal disputes with sup-pliers, strikes, terrorist attacks on logistics facilities and others. Dynamic simulation and analytical optimization are two dominant technologies for managing risks of the supply chains, which helps to increase their reliability and stability if failures occur. Through optimizing and simulating of the supply chains, companies can generate new information about the impact of failure and influence the supply chain and its performance by looking at various scenarios that simulate the locations of failures, the duration and recovery policies. An analysis of the literary sources shows that there is no single approach to build the concept for a supply chain digital twin. This article gives an overview of the literature according to this problem and offers the author's point of view on the concept for a supply chain digital twin.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a changing world, phytoplankton communities face a large variety of challenges including altered light regimes. These alterations are caused by more pronounced stratification due to rising temperatures, enhanced eutrophication, and browning of lakes. Community responses toward these effects can emerge as alterations in physiology, biomass, biochemical composition, or diversity. In this study, we addressed the combined effects of changes in light and nutrient conditions on community responses. In particular, we investigated how light intensity and variability under two nutrient conditions influence (1) fast responses such as adjustments in photosynthesis, (2) intermediate responses such as pigment adaptation and (3) slow responses such as changes in community biomass and species composition. Therefore, we exposed communities consisting of five phytoplankton species belonging to different taxonomic groups to two constant and two variable light intensity treatments combined with two levels of phosphorus supply. The tested phytoplankton communities exhibited increased fast reactions of photosynthetic processes to light variability and light intensity. The adjustment of their light harvesting mechanisms via community pigment composition was not affected by light intensity, variability, or nutrient supply. However, pigment specific effects of light intensity, light variability, and nutrient supply on the proportion of the respective pigments were detected. Biomass was positively affected by higher light intensity and nutrient concentrations while the direction of the effect of variability was modulated by light intensity. Light variability had a negative impact on biomass at low, but a positive impact at high light intensity. The effects on community composition were species specific. Generally, the proportion of green algae was higher under high light intensity, whereas the cyanobacterium performed better under low light conditions. In addition to that, the diatom and the cryptophyte performed better with high nutrient supply while the green algae as well as the cyanobacterium performed better at low nutrient conditions. This shows that light intensity, light variability, and nutrient supply interactively affect communities. Furthermore, the responses are highly species and pigment specific, thus to clarify the effects of climate change a deeper understanding of the effects of light variability and species interactions within communities is important.</jats:p>"

The paper concentrates on performance benefits of adding energy storage system with the wind generator in order to regulate the electric power delivered into the power grid. Compared with other means of energy storage, the flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is the best choice to solve power quality problems. In this paper, a FESS associated to a variable speed wind generation (VSWG) is investigated by presenting two control strategies applied to the storage system equipped with an induction machine; both techniques are studied and developed and consist of a field control (FOC) and a Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study a coin supply chain problem in the context of improving efficiency. While most consumer products are distributed in one direction, coins are recirculated and reused through the economy. The Federal Reserve System (FRS), the central banking system of the United States, plays a crucial role in managing the U.S. coin supply chain (CSC). It spends a significant fraction of its annual budget on operating the U.S. CSC in order to provide banking services to depository institutions (DIs) and the public. The objective of this study is to provide a near‐optimal or an optimal operating policy that minimizes the total cost of producing, supplying, and managing coin inventory in the U.S. CSC. The study demonstrates a modeling approach that not only can be applied for effectively and efficiently managing the coin supply in the United States, but also for managing similar coin supply chains around the world. The extensive tools and insights developed in this study may prove to be beneficial to the Federal Reserve’s Cash Product Office (CPO) that manages the distribution of the nation’s coin inventory. Managing demand uncertainty and streamlining its processes to be more adaptable to changes in demand are critical for the CPO to reduce supply chain costs. The robust optimization framework and the resulting insights presented in this study could potentially help the CPO to manage shifts in coin demand and achieve its cost reduction goals. </jats:p>",

Taking customer value into account in the dual-channel supply chain, this paper constructs separate and unified pricing of the direct sales channel and online retail platform’s distribution channel, and discusses each pricing model under a decentralized decision scenario and centralized decision scenario respectively. The results show that the total profit of a supply chain under the centralized decision scenario is better than the decentralized decision scenario in different ways, and the customer value of the two channels is also higher. Compared with the unified pricing of the two channels, the profit of the manufacturer is larger while the profit of the online retail platform is smaller under the separate pricing of the two channels. Moreover, the benefit of value-added services remains important to maximize the profit of the online retail platform and the customer value at the same time. Whether it is under separate pricing or unified pricing of the two channels, the antinomies effect always exists between the customer value and the profit per unit product. In order to further improve each party’s profit in the dual-channel supply chain under the decentralized decision scenario, it is necessary to improve the customer perception of profit as much as possible, and reduce the customer perception of loss as much as possible.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Union (EU) is confronted with too low a share of inland rail freight transport. The implementation of two-sided online exchanges for rail-road freight transport could increase this share. However, such exchanges focusing on the EU market are mainly designed for single modes of transport. Their matching of supply and demand for multimodal services, especially including rail, is still in its infancy. This paper applies a maturity growth framework to speed up the implementation of such multimodal online exchanges. The framework integrates insights from industrial organization theory, platform economy theory, and maturity growth theory. Online exchanges, summarized in a new taxonomy, are compared to study their practices on matching supply with demand on the exchange, especially for multimodal services. Data is collected from case studies, exchange websites and semi-structured interviews. The analysis shows the emergence of new market actors and business models, including digital freight forwarders. These offer a variety of transport mode solutions for EU inland and EU related global freight transport. Maturity in matching supply and demand appears to result from clear objectives to provide benefits to the exchange participants, notably by digitizing the data for transaction completion and providing real time support for operational issues. In this context of rising online exchanges, especially in road and global multimodal transport (air, ocean, and road), the competition to capture a fragmented freight market seems to steadily increase. A similar maturity analysis of exchanges could not be found.</jats:p>"

One of the problems is the lack of qualified specialists in this field. To solve this problem, the training course \"Renewable Energy Sources\" was created at the Odessa Polytechnic University for the specialization \"Engineering of smart electrical systems\". For the course, a laboratory stand \"Vetroenergetika\" was developed. The stand simulates the operation of a wind generator and displays the main electrical and mechanical performance indicators. It is also provided for the output of these values to the computer using the microcontroller and the platform. With a computer, all the main dependencies are built in real time to monitor the state of the wind generator. Also, a laboratory workshop on the topic \"Wind power\" was prepared, which, at the moment, included four laboratory works, namely: the study of the external characteristics of the wind generator when the electrical load changes, the study of the dependence of the change in power on the wind speed, the study of the dependence of the change in power on the angle of attack wind flow for two different types of wind generators and a study of the dependence of the speed on the electrical load. The plan of the experiments and the results obtained during the laboratory tests of the stand are described in detail. Each of the above dependencies has practical applications in the production and operation of wind turbines. The authors do not consider the list of possible researches complete and it will be replenished as the stand and laboratory workshop develop. Also, the proposed teaching methodology can by no means be considered the only and complete one.</jats:p>",

The research shows that farmers’ income, farmers’ policy awareness, farmland scale, loan experience, risk compensation system, legal perfection and policy stability have a positive impact on the willingness of loan officers to issue mortgage loans for farmland management rights. Factors such as farmers’ age and education level have a negative impact on the willingness to supply. In addition, by comparing the stability of the regression model before and after the addition of risk compensation system, legal perfection degree and policy stability degree, it is concluded that the policy variables have a great influence on the decision-making of financial institutions.</jats:p>",

But the cost of operating traditional food traceability supply chain system is high. The enterprise on the chain are not willing to participate, and the data on the chain is easy to falsified, which leads to the existence of food traceability and the lack of consumers’ willingness to buy for it. Based on this, solving the high cost in the technical point has become a feasible meaning. Introducing blockchain technology into food safety traceability can improve brand reputation, maintain market and consumer confidence, improve supply chain management, accelerate product and reduce liability risk. In this paper, from the compatibility of block technology and food traceability supply chain, it is concluded that the introduction of blockchain technology will reduce the transaction cost, quality cost, time cost, activity cost, and supply chain traceability additional cost in the food supply chain cost. By comparing with the application cost of block chain technology, this paper explores the cost control mechanism of food traceability supply chain based on block chain, so as to promote the development of food traceability supply chain. The application of blockchain technology in food traceability supply chain will improve the food traceability supply chain system.</jats:p>",

In this regard, the development of mathematical models that allow of optimization and reliable control of the drying process is relevant. A large set of physical and physicochemical phenomena accompanying drying, as well as their mutual influence on each other, gives rise to numerous uncertainties in the mathematical description of this process. The modeling process becomes more complicated under conditions of combined energy supply, for example, convective and microwave energy supply. In this article, based on the laws of chemical kinetics, the authors propose the original approach to modeling the drying process, which, together with experimental studies, allows obtaining a reliable mathematical model that can be used as the basis for optimizing and controlling this process. During the mathematical modeling of drying, it was proposed to apply new process parameters: the degree of drying (the share of removed moisture) and the degree of absorbed energy (the ratio of the amount of energy absorbed by the product at a given moment to the amount of energy absorbed by the product during the entire process). The expediency of characterizing the kinetics of drying by the dependence of the degree of drying on the degree of absorbed energy is demonstrated. The scientific hypothesis was substantiated and confirmed: the generalized characteristic, the kinetics of drying - the dependence of the degree of drying on the degree of energy absorbed by the product, does not depend on the parameters characterizing the drying mode. The proposed model makes it possible to determine the ratio of the components of convective and microwave energy flows when moisture is removed from the material, which can be used as the basis for optimization and reliable control of the process.</jats:p>",

The inherent advantages of AM technology are successfully drafted and exploited by the different organization across the globe. During the time of pandemic i.e. COVID-19, 3D printing has come to rescue and has been used for manufacturing critical medical supplies. 3D printing has been used in manufacturing some of the critical items like ventilators valves, face shields, swabs, oxygen valves, hand sanitizer holders, 3-DP lung models, etc. The main reason for its success has been the ability of 3D printing to print locally by using digital designs and thus reducing the number of supply chain actors. Also, the ability of 3D printing to manufacture/print complex geometrical designs locally is the main reason for its successful adoption during COVID-19. In this paper, we have discussed how AM has come to the forefront in fighting this pandemic. Various AM techniques have played a critical role in bridging the supply chain gap in the medical industry and locally printing critical devices. There were certain apprehensions before the pandemic along with slow adoption but this pandemic has also increased the adoption of AM due to its ability to overcome the demand created by COVID-19. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it examined the trade balance for rice; examined price volatility; estimated supply response coefficients and the determinants of supply response of rice producers in Nigeria. Data were collected from secondary sources and covered the period 1972 to 2017. Data analyses were achieved using descriptive and inferential statistics.  Results indicated a negative trade balance (x = - N20/kg) between imported rice and domestic rice. Price volatility result showed that volatility in agricultural markets was high, with that of imported rice being higher than domestic rice, then maize. Supply response coefficients for rice indicated that production output, price of maize and annual rainfall statistically and significantly influenced supply of rice while domestic price of local rice, price of imported rice and government expenditure on agriculture were not significant. All the series were stationary in the first difference and there was linear combination or long-run equilibrium relationship among the co-integrated variables. There were price adjustments between short-run to long-run equilibrium and the error correction coefficient was -0.209. Further results showed that the price and probably favoured quality of imported rice constrained domestic production and negatively impacted rice exports from Nigeria. This indicates a potentially significant impediment to the expansion of rice production in Nigeria. Government must put in place guaranteed minimum price for rice, and be ready to act as buyer of last resort, as incentives for the farmers, to sustainably increase production and the country to attain self-sufficiency in the short-run. Government and non-governmental institutions should provide improved production inputs and modern processing facilities to enhance the competitiveness of local rice against imported rice, both in terms of quality and price.</jats:p>"

The technique acted to control the rotation speed of the pumping system, aiming mainly at increasing energy efficiency. Fuzzy, neural and neuro-fuzzy controllers were tested in an experimental setup to compare their performances in a transient regime, a permanent regime, and with respect to disturbances applied to the system. To evaluate the efficiency of the system, a demand variation curve was emulated for different operating conditions. The results demonstrate that the neuro-fuzzy controller (NFC) presented a significant increase in pumping system efficiency and a reduction in specific energy consumption of up to 79.7% when compared to the other controllers. Target pressures were kept close to the set-point values with low hydraulic transients and maintained satisfactory stability (error &amp;lt;8%) under severe situations of demand variation. It is concluded that the NFC presented superior results when compared with the other analyzed controllers.</jats:p>",

Arguments for stimulus usually presume demand-side shortfalls; arguments for tax cuts or structural reform look to the supply side. Resolving the question requires models with both mechanisms, and empirical tests to tell them apart. We develop a small open economy model, where a country is subject to deleveraging shocks that impose binding credit constraints on households and/or firms. These financial crisis events leave distinct statistical signatures in the time series record that divide sharply between each type of shock. Empirical analysis reveals a clear picture: after financial crises the dominant pattern is that imports contract, exports hold steady or even rise, and the real exchange rate depreciates. History shows financial crises are predominantly a negative shock to demand. (JEL F14, F31, F41, G01, N10, N20, N70) </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the construction industry supply chain management (SCM) is a vital tool in controlling business processes in a defined and a systematic way to improve quality, time management and increase profit. Effective supply chain management has become a potentially valuable method of securing and improving competitive advantage and organizational performance since competition no longer between organizations, but between global organizations and among supply chains. This paper aims to investigate the impact of supply chain management practices on competitive advantage and organizational performance in the construction industry, Sri Lanka, due to the lack of application of supply chain management practices to determine the organizational performance in the competitive environment. Further, this study focuses five SCM practices: strategic supplier partnership, customer relationship, level of information sharing, quality of information sharing, and postponement to investigate what supply chain management is, how it works in increase competitive advantage and what are its dynamics. Six hypotheses were developed based on the constructed conceptual framework derived from the supply chain management literature. The data were collected over the survey technique by randomly administering structured questionnaires from 198 respondents of construction management teams and different sub-contractors. First Multiple regression analysis was performed to explore the impact of five supply chain management practices on competitive advantage and organizational performance in the construction industry and the analysis was carried out the factor analysis to explore the significance of supply chain management dimensions. The results of the regression analysis indicated that all SCM variables have a positive impact on competitive advantages and organizational performance of the construction industry in Sri Lanka. Moreover, it suggested that the strategic supplier partnership was the most significant SCM variable which determines the competitive advantage and level of information sharing variable was the less significant variable towards competitive advantage. The results of this study provide new insights to the construction companies to better understand the significant role that SCM variables play in respect to the competitive advantages and organizational performance in Sri Lanka. The study has outlined to examine the five SCM variables in construction industry. Hence future study can be outlined to further examine the impact of SCM on competitive advantages in other industries. Moreover, the future study can be outlined to further examine the impact of SCM variables in different dimensions especially including customer perspective in respect to human variables. Besides, this study was based on the limited large-scale construction companies operated in Sri Lanka and ignore the small and medium scale supermarkets.</jats:p>"

This contribution proposes the synthesis of a biorefinery supply network for a case study of the European Union (EU-27) under several scenarios based on a mathematical programming approach. Several biomass and waste sources, such as grains, waste oils, and lignocellulosics, are proposed to be utilized, and various biofuels including first, second, and third generations are produced such as bioethanol, green gasoline, biodiesel, Fischer Tropsch (FT) diesel, and hydrogen. The aim of this study is to evaluate the capabilities of EU-27 countries to be able to meet the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) target regarding the share of renewable energy in the transport sector by 2030 in each Member State while not compromising the current production of food. A generic mathematical model has been developed for the multi-period optimization of a biorefinery supply network with the objective of maximizing sustainability profit. The solutions obtained show that biomass and waste are promising raw materials to reach and go beyond the EU’s renewable energy target in the transport sector for the year 2030. However, some countries would need to provide additional subsidies for their companies to achieve at least a non-negative economic performance of biofuel production.</jats:p>"

This paper examines the key factors affecting cost performance in Thai construction projects, specifically at the pre-construction and construction phases. A questionnaire survey is used to gather data for the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis used in this study. The EFA technique extracted the key factors affecting construction cost, while the SEM revealed the interactions and causal relationships between those key factors. The EFA results confirm seven key factors: three at the pre-construction phase: lack of coordination, design management, and unclear client requirements; and four at the construction phase, including site management, resources, labour capability and contract-related. The SEM results confirm strong relationships, directly and indirectly, between the three key factors at the pre-construction phase. Good coordination between stakeholders result in less design errors and clear client requirements. The influences that the three factors at the pre-construction phase have on the four factors at the construction phase are also supported. The result highlights that unclear client requirements cause poor site management and cost overrun, which may lead to breach of contracts. Construction companies can use this study results to better plan for cost improvement by focusing on the identified pre-construction factors, as they could lead to good cost management during the construction phase.</jats:p>"

The study aims to investigate the relationships among the macroeconomic variables money supply, real income, price level and interest rate for the period 1998–2014 in the case of India, a period when India adopted the multiple-indicator approach as its monetary policy strategy. The study uses the vector autoregression (VAR) model to examine the dynamic relationships among the variables. The Granger causality test via the VAR framework suggests that four pairs of causality exist; in particular, bidirectional causality exists between money supply and price level. Interest rate Granger-causes both real income and price level, and money supply Granger-causes the rate of interest. However, the study could not find any causal relationship between real income and money supply in either direction. The findings that money supply causes the interest rate and the interest rate causes real output are in line with the Keynesian theory, which argues that money supply affects output through the nominal interest rate. Finally, the results also support the arguments made in favour of a policy move from the multiple-indicator approach to the inflation targeting framework in India. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRAK Air Tidak Berhasil (NRW) adalah isu serius dan boleh mengancam sekuriti air di Sabah. Isu ini bukan sahaja dialami oleh Sabah tetapi juga di peringkat dunia. Ia merupakan petunjuk kepada ketidakcekapan pemain-pemain dalam industri air terawat untuk diagihkan kepada golongan sasar secara sah. Walaupun terdapat komitmen untuk melaksanakan pengurangan NRW kekurangan bajet dan keadaan paip yang telah usang menjadi cabaran dan halangan utama. Kebocoran paip, kecurian air dan meter yang mengakibatkan kadar NRW di Sabah kekal melebihi 50 peratus dan antara yang tertinggi di Malaysia. Terdapat beberapa usaha yang telah dijalankan tetapi impaknya adalah terlalu kecil di mana jumlah pengurangan tahunan NRW antara tahun 2005 hingga 2018 sekitar 0.35 peratus. Jumlah ini amat rendah dan ia telah membuka ruang kepada kehilangan pendapatan sehingga jutaan ringgit. Berdasarkan data rinci komponen bekalan air yang diperoleh daripada Jabatan Bekalan Air Negeri Sabah (JBANS), jumlah kerugian akibat NRW antara 2015 hingga 2017 sekitar RM657 juta. Jumlah ini agak besar dan kerugian ini boleh menyiapkan satu loji rawatan air yang baharu. Oleh itu, komitmen yang berterusan perlu disemai bukan setakat dalam kalangan pekerja JBANS, tetapi komuniti pengguna air dan juga penglibatan persekutuan untuk bantuan modal bagi menjayakan program pengurangan NRW. Sasaran 31 peratus masih jauh untuk digapai, tetapi sekiranya komitmen berterusan dapat dilaksanakan sudah pasti ancaman NRW terhadap keselamatan air dapat diminimumkan.\n \nABSTRACT Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is a serious issue and could threaten water security in Sabah. This issue is not only experienced by Sabah but also at the world level. It is an indicator of the inefficiency of the water industry players to be distributed to the target group. Although there is a commitment to implement NRW reduction, however the budget deficiency and the obsolete pipe conditions are major challenges and obstacles. Leakage, water theft and meters are obsolete resulting in NRW in Sabah remained above 50 per cent and among the highest in Malaysia. There are some businesses that have been carried-out but the impact is too small where the total annual reduction of NRW between 2005 to 2018 around 0.35 per cent. This percentage is very low and it has opened the door to the loss of income up to millions of ringgits. Based on detailed water supply data obtained from Jabatan Bekalan Air Negeri Sabah (JBANS), the total loss due to NRW between 2015 to 2017 is around RM657 million. This amount is quite large as it can be used to set up a new water treatment plant. Therefore, the ongoing commitment needs to be instilled not only among JBANS employees, but also the community of water users as well as federal involvement for capital assistance to make the NRW reduction program a success. The target of 31 per cent is still a long way to go, but if it been implemented consistently, NRW's threat to water security will be minimized. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Robustness of a supply network highly depends on its structure. Although structural design methods have been proposed to create supply networks with optimal robustness, a real-life supply network can be quite different from these optimal structural designs. Meanwhile, real cases such as Thailand floods and Tohoku earthquake demonstrate the vulnerability of supply networks in real life. Obviously, it is urgent to enhance the robustness of existing real-life supply networks. Thus, in this paper, a supply network reconfiguration method based on adaptive variable neighborhood search (AVNS) is proposed to enhance the structural robustness of supply networks facing both random and target disruptions. Firstly, a supply network model considering the heterogeneous roles of entities is introduced. Based on the model, two robustness metrics, Rr and Rt, are proposed to describe the tolerance of supply networks facing random and target disruptions, respectively. Then, the problem of reconfiguration-based supply network robustness enhancement is described. To solve the problem effectively and efficiently, a new heuristic based on general variable neighborhood search, namely, AVNS, is proposed. Finally, a case study based on three real-life supply networks is presented to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed robustness enhancing method.</jats:p>",

Adequate electricity supply is a vital input for the economic growth and in a range of key industries. Unfortunately, the electricity sector in Iraq has been an unsustainable fiscal burden on successive Iraqi governments yet it has not been able to meet the growing demand. Iraq’s electricity sector and government’s decision makers should look for a long-term solutions and strategies to meet the current and future demand, by taking important steps towards fostering a reliable, affordable, and sustainable electricity system in the years and decades to come. Also, Iraqi government and ministry of electricity in particular should understand that electricity is basic service and right of Iraqis, and many nations have overcome this kind of problem decades ago. Overcoming this problem will help refueling Iraqi economy and enable it to stand on its feet again. Renewable energy resources, and solar in particular could be part of the solution.

However, the burning of coal produces dangerous gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. One alternative to decrease these emissions is biomass co-firing. To establish biomass as a viable option, the optimization of the biomass supply chain (BSC) is essential. Although most of the research conducted has focused on optimization models, the purpose of this paper is to incorporate machine-learning (ML) algorithms into a stochastic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to select potential storage depot locations and improve the solution in two ways: by decreasing the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden. We consider the level of moisture and level of ash in the biomass from each parcel location, the average expected biomass yield, and the distance from each parcel to the closest power plant. The training labels (whether a potential depot location is beneficial or not) are obtained through the stochastic MILP model. Multiple ML algorithms are applied to a case study in the northeast area of the United States: Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network. After applying the hybrid methodology combining ML and optimization, it is found that the MLP outperforms the other algorithms in terms of selecting potential depots that decrease the total cost of the BSC and the computational burden of the stochastic MILP model. The LR and the DT also perform well in terms of decreasing total cost.</jats:p>"

But the use of a conventional reclosing scheme results in an outage time which is much larger than the actual fault duration. This is due to the use of fixed dead times in conventional reclosing schemes. This unnecessary outage results in increased consumption of stored energy of energy storage system causing considerable losses. This paper proposes an empirical mode decomposition based adaptive reclosing technique which can sense the exact instant of fault clearance and modify the prefixed dead time to an adaptive value. Within half cycle time period after fault clearance reclosing command can be issued for the breaker. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified in a modified IEEE 13 bus distribution network model considering a battery energy storage system and hybrid distributed generators. The simulation and modelling of the various fault cases in the microgrid structure are done using EMTDC/PSCAD software.</jats:p>",

There are a rectifier-link boost derived DC-DC battery charging circuit and a 4-switch push-pull power inverter (DC-AC) circuit, which are controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) signals. A changeover relay based transfer switch controls the power flow towards the utility loads. During off-grid situations, loads are fed power by the proposed system and during on-grid situations, battery is charged by an AC-link rectifier-fed boost converter. Charging phenomenon of the battery is controlled by a relay switched protection circuit. Laboratory experiments are carried out extensively for different loads. Power quality assessments along with back-up durations are recorded and analyzed. In addition, a cost allocation affirms the economic feasibility of the proposed framework in case of reasonable consumer applications.

Besides, the study was also conducted to determine whether road conditions and secondary tasks are associated with the participants’ response time. The results showed that response times generally increased as a function of road segments as well as exposure to secondary tasks. In terms of road segments, longer response times were observed for the more demanding off-ramp and curvy road sections when compared with expressway driving. Furthermore, for the secondary tasks, the participants took a longer duration to respond to the tactile stimulus, particularly for the difficult n-back task.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Water supply system has played a significant role in the growth, development and wellbeing of cities. Until now, meeting the need of city residents in terms of availability, reliability, and access to a good quality water supply is a major challenge facing many denizens of the 21st Century due to unprecedented urban growth and urbanization rates. This study is out to examine the current issues and challenges to water supply systems in Limbe. The study adopted the mix method approach which involves triangulation of quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection. Primary data were obtained from field observations, interviews and the administration of 383 questionnaires to households and stakeholders. Secondary data were obtained from relevant official documents, published and unpublished sources relevant to water supply systems. Satellite imageries and ArcGIS were used to describe the pattern of growth in built-up areas between 1986 and 2019. Data from the questionnaire were entered using Epi Data Version 3.1, analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Science Standard version 21.0 and Microsoft Excel and presented in the form of tables, figures, plates and maps. Findings revealed that, although the water supply accessibility by utilities has improved significantly, the reliability, distribution, flow frequency, supply, price and quality are still low. The inaccessibility and unreliability in the water supply have turned most households to alternative sources with poor quality. Unsustain urbanization and urban growth are occurring through infills in city remaining open spaces and ‘out spill’ and expansion at the outskirt without a concurrent increase, upgrading or extension of water supply infrastructural systems resulting to congestion, conflict over allocation, long-distance trekking to source water, deterioration of basic social services, pollution, inaccessibility amongst to ensure efficient water supply systems and sustainable urban water management. The paper, therefore, calls for the rehabilitation and renovation of dilapidated water supply structures, extension and upgrading basic services, limit urbanization and urban growth, encourage the construction and use of alternative water sources, community participation amongst others for sustainable urban water supply management.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Magnesium hydride (MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) is a promising solid-state hydrogen source with high storage capacity (7.6 wt%). Although it is recently established that MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> has potential applications in medicine because it sustainably supplies hydrogen gas (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>), the biological functions of MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in plants have not been observed yet. Also, the slow reaction kinetics restricts its practical applications. In this report, MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (98% purity; 0.5–25 μm size) was firstly used as a hydrogen generation source for postharvest preservation of flowers. Compared with the direct hydrolysis of MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in water, the efficiency of hydrogen production from MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> hydrolysis could be greatly improved when the citrate buffer solution is introduced. These results were further confirmed in the flower vase experiment by showing higher efficiency in increasing the production and the residence time of H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in solution, compared with hydrogen-rich water. Mimicking the response of hydrogen-rich water and sodium hydrosulfide (a hydrogen sulfide donor), subsequent experiments discovered that MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-citrate buffer solution not only stimulated hydrogen sulfide (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S) synthesis but also significantly prolonged the vase life of cut carnation flowers. Meanwhile, redox homeostasis was reestablished, and the increased transcripts of representative senescence-associated genes, including <jats:italic>DcbGal</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>DcGST1</jats:italic>, were partly abolished. By contrast, the discussed responses were obviously blocked by the inhibition of endogenous H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S with hypotaurine, an H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S scavenger. These results clearly revealed that MgH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>-supplying H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> could prolong the vase life of cut carnation flowers via H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>S signaling, and our results, therefore, open a new window for the possible application of hydrogen-releasing materials in agriculture.</jats:p>"

Healthcare systems are complex and there are many things that need to know about types of hospital operation systems, patient care, insurance, healthcare providers, and legal issues. This study aimed at examining the relationship between perceived service quality, customer satisfaction, and behavioural intentions in the context of the hospital in Sabah, Malaysia. Information from 208 respondents was used through questionnaires for the purposed of statistical data analysis using SmartPLS. The result showed only tangibles and empathy supports behavioural intentions in relation to the retail pharmacy within Malaysia. This study tested relationships of tangibles, assurance, and empathy with customer satisfaction respectively were shown to be significantly positive as well. A positive relationship between customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions was also observed in this study. As for the mediation analysis, the outcome indicated that tangibles, assurance, and empathy respectively have an indirect relationship with behavioural intentions mediated by customer satisfaction. Additional findings also showed that, while the direct effects of empathy on behavioural intentions were significant, the indirect impact was noted to be greater for behavioural intentions in connection with customer satisfaction as mediation. The result also showed that relative to other perceived service quality, empathy has the most impact on customer satisfaction as well as behavioural intentions respectively. The findings from this study significant to this industry which contribute to policymakers, service providers, and other stakeholders.</jats:p>"

The analyses is based on the economic, societal and environmental aspects, being the major reasons to align the Government strategy, define policies and reproduce the EU directives. The analyses do not reflect on the pandemic and financial crisis because the author considers that these factors are outside of the energy system and have not been steady along the period in study, thereby it can mislead the conclusions. This study relies mostly on non-empirical research, in which the research adopted both inductive and deductive reasoning to theorize logical assumptions about the Portuguese energy market. Building on reflection and personal observation on the field, the researchers carried out this article by gathering relevant data (i.e., statistics) through critical studies, systematic review of literature and meta-analysis on the theme. Therefore, the methodology used is based mainly on qualitative exploration of secondary sources and data, out of which one will pull out insights. The novelty of the study is to take in consider-ation all the above factors and produce results that are more adequate to reality, as all of them are interconnected and by changing one of them it will be changes in the remain. The open literature mainly focusses on the economic, the energetic, the social or the environmental aspects and neglects the others. One can conclude that there is economic advantage on efficiently distributing and consuming NG. Also, the impact of NG on a society welfare is positive. Last, the NG brings flexibility to the grid, which is more and more important in the perspective and ambition to increase the share of intermittent renewable energies.</jats:p>",

We identify importing countries that could potentially be affected by the imposed export bans using a measure of their import dependency during the pre‐pandemic period to illustrate our results on global trade maps.

Hence, improving network infrastructure is something that must be done to meet the changing times. Of course, in the context of improving network infrastructure, investment costs are one of few significant factors. Each telecommunications company must continue to innovate, so that network infrastructure can be improved with lower investment costs. In this study, we propose infrastructure sharing model of its power supply in order to reduce capital expenditure for Mobile Network initial investment. It is expected that the proposed model can be useful as a new business scheme for tower providers and operators for business development in the field of telecommunications infrastructure, particularly in accelerating the growth of BTS devices in Indonesia.

In this study, a double‐layer DC/AC TPSS with renewable integration is proposed to address these challenges and to improve system performance. The proposed topology breaks the limit of back‐to‐back structure and enables more flexible free energy flow. A top‐down system design method is proposed in this study. Firstly, the characteristics of the proposed TPSS for integration with renewable power are described and compared with the traditional back‐to‐back topology. Secondly, a DC droop controller and a AC droop controller are designed for DC layer grid and AC layer grid, respectively, to control the power flow in each layer. The traditional AC droop control is based on the inductive transmission impedance, but the resistance of traction transmission line cannot be ignored. Thus, a modified droop control strategy with the consideration of line resistance is also proposed in this study. Subsequently, the voltage control strategy for the single modular multilevel converter is designed to track the reference signal from the upper droop controller. Finally, a general double‐layer DC/AC TPSS is designed from bottom to top, and the simulation results confirm that the proposed TPSS with renewable integration is capable of delivering desirable performance.</jats:p>",

The separation of heating and air mixing into three zones ensured a decrease in the content of nitrogen oxides in the generated air down to 4 ppm. It was found that an increase in pressure in the combustion chamber leads to an increase in the completeness of hydrogen combustion and has practically no effect on the formation of nitrogen oxides. It is shown that nitrogen molecules directly enter the combustion zone with intensive oxidation, and to reduce the formation of nitrogen oxides, air must be supplied at a distance of at least 3 cooling zones in the combustion chamber.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Although acknowledged to be a simplification, the rate of sediment supply is usually assumed to be constant in sequence stratigraphic interpretations of clastic shelf systems. The simplified assumption taken in this work is that sediment supply can be represented by sine curves linked to climate changes driven by Milankovitch cycles. Three orders of sediment supply sine curves (amplitude and frequency scaled to order) are convolved with three orders of Milankovitch-forced eustatic sea-level sine curves and a constant rate of subsidence to generate curves for the ratio of rate of accommodation development to rate of sediment supply (δ A /δ S ). The relative-sea-level curve is then held constant whilst sediment supply is systematically changed from being constant to being cyclical across the three orders of Milankovitch frequencies and being in-phase, and out-of-phase with the eustatic cycles by 90°, 180°, and 270°. For each scenario, stratal architecture is then represented for sixty consecutive parasequences (fifth-order, regressive–transgressive shelf transit cycles) by converting the δ A /δ S curves into pseudo thickness / sandstone fraction plots (TSF plots). Constant sediment supply, in-phase sediment supply, and 180°-out-of-phase sediment supply produce symmetrical stratal geometries with equal periods of progradation, aggradation, and retrogradation. When sediment-supply cycles are 90°-out-of-phase (supply peak occurs later than sea-level peak), stratal geometries are asymmetrical with progradational architectures being dominant. When sediment-supply cycles are 270°-out-of-phase (supply peak occurs earlier than sea-level peak), stratal geometries are also asymmetrical but retrogradational architectures are dominant. These patterns are reproduced at all three orders of stratigraphic hierarchy (parasequence, sequence, and composite sequence). Comparison of these synthetic stratal geometries to real-world stratal geometries from Triassic to Neogene rocks across both the fifth-order (parasequence) and fourth-order (sequence) of stratal hierarchies suggests a consistently occurring asymmetrical, progradation-dominant motif. This indicates that 90°-out-of-phase sediment supply (supply peak occurs later than sea-level peak) may be a common occurrence through geological time. The work also corroborates the findings of earlier workers and suggests that sequence stratigraphic surfaces can change nature along depositional strike due to out-of-phase sediment supply and can thus also be diachronous. This work conceptually illustrates that Milankovitch climate-change-induced sinusoidal-sediment-supply cycles, out-of-phase with sinusoidal eustatic-sea-level cycles, may produce commonly observed asymmetrical stratal architectures and should be considered when invoking causal mechanisms for stratal architectures on clastic shelves.</jats:p>",

Thus, the focus of this research paper is to recognize the direct and indirect effects of environmental drivers on the green supply chain practices. Quantitative data regarding corporate environmental drivers and green supply chain practices were collected from 12 manufacturing companies in India. Path analysis was performed through structural equation modeling technique to identify the significant environmental drivers. Further, the direct and indirect effects of the environmental drivers were determined by decomposing the structural equations. The results obtained demonstrated that regulatory pressure, customer pressure, socio-cultural pressure and competitor pressure affect green supply chain practices at varying levels of significance at different stages of the supply chain process. The result of this study invites necessary attention of the managers to undertake an analysis of the effect of potential environmental drivers on the functioning of green supply chain practices in their firms.</jats:p>",

The dynamic single‐phase traction load and intermittent renewable generation bring double frequency oscillation and large deviation problems to the DC link voltage. Special design considerations and control schemes are proposed for the MMC to stabilise DC link voltage by controlling the total number of total inserted modules. The proposed control scheme resolves the voltage oscillation issue caused by single‐phase load and reduces the DC link voltage deviation under 10 MW step change.

Besides adding insights into channels of potential corruption or rent‐seeking, the research identifies potential stages of bureaucratic holdups related to the supply chain and can prove useful in the formulation of a more effective corruption‐control policy. We use data for about 150 nations over the period 2000–2018 and the econometric methodology controls for potential reverse feedback from corruption to logistics. Our results show that an improvement in overall logistics performance reduces cross‐country corruption, with individual dimensions of logistics having a differential corruption‐reducing impact. The main policy implication is that governmental efforts to reduce supply chain bottlenecks will have positive spillovers in terms of reduced corruption.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managing water resources requires the optimum operation of dam reservoirs. To satisfy the downstream water demand in the operational optimization of Boostan dam reservoir, the improved whale optimization algorithm (IWOA) performance was compared in the present study with that of its constituents (i.e., the whale optimization and differential evolution) based on GAMS nonlinear programming results. The model evaluative indicators and an objective function were used to select the optimal algorithm. The findings suggested that IWOA resulted in the lowest computational duration and fastest convergence rate compared to the other algorithms. Additionally, the average water demand and discharge volume of IWOA were 3.21 × 106 m3 and 3.03 × 106 m3, respectively. In contrast, the other algorithms yielded lower water release volumes. IWOA enhanced the WOA performance by 21.7% through reducing the variation coefficient by 78% in optimizing the objective function. The water demand was therefore more effectively satisfied by the IWOA compared to the other algorithms. Furthermore, the IWOA resulted in a lower amount of errors. The hybrid algorithm performance increased in terms of all the evaluative indicators. Developing multicriteria decision-making models using TOPSIS and the Shannon entropy also suggested the IWOA excels the other algorithms in optimizing the reservoir operational problem.</jats:p>",

Sothe efficiency level of port has an impact on the performance of supply chain operations. Chittagong port is the principal seaport of Bangladesh and it provides a major gateway to the outside world. The cost of doing business is increasing as a result of the inefficiency in the main seaport of the country. In this paper, an effort has been taken to examine the efficiency of Chittagong Port and the causal factors of inefficiency. The impact of inefficiency at Chittagong port on the supply chain of Bangladesh has also been identified. To do this, at first a relationship has been built between port efficiency and supply chain in respect of Bangladesh.&#x0D;\nRelevant data has been gathered through extensive review of the literature, field surveys, interacting with top management of different business entities such as shipping agency, freight forwarder, logistics companies, exporter, importer as well as Government regulatory and monitoring bodies using both the structured and unstructured questionnaires.&#x0D;\nThe study has revealed that theinefficiency at Chittagong port causes serious consequences on the supply chain of exporter and importer and lead to loss and disruption of trade and ultimately incur extra costs and time.

We provide the estimates for Lockdown 1.0 and Lockdown 2.0, from 25 March to 3 May 2020, when india had the highest stringency measures in the world. To get an extensive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labour market, we carry out an in-depth analysis of labour supply shocks by employment status, industry level and occupation. The workers impacted are those who work in a non-essential industry and are not able to work from home. To identify jobs that cannot be done from home, we use a novel approach and construct an occupation-based Remote Labour Index (RLI) for India. Using the PLFS (2017–2018) we find that 116.18 million (25% of the total employed) and 78.93 million (17% of total employed) workers were affected during Lockdown 1.0 and Lockdown 2.0, respectively. The expected monthly wage and income loss to workers is estimated to be Rs. 864.5 billion (2017–2018 prices). Further, the reduction of Gross Value Added (2012–2012 prices) is estimated at 14% compared to a no-COVID scenario. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification Codes: E01, J21, J22, J24, J33, J38 </jats:p>",

To enhance their sustainability in the economy, the SMEs require serious empirical research in order to elicit the constraints with the goal of developing proactive remedial frameworks so that their existence may be promoted. Amongst the numerous challenges that constrain the working of SMEs is inadequate financing, thus the derivative of the overall goal of this study. The study location was Meru town. The descriptive research design was used. As per the Meru county government records, 160 SMEs are permitted and have been in operation for not less than 3 years. From every SME, one respondent was used. Census was adopted as the study design informed by the small population and the ease of reaching the respondents. A questionnaire was used to collect data through a drop-pick method which was done in three days’ time. Data analysis was through descriptive methods. Data analysis was assisted by SPSS version 22 by subjection to regression analysis to establish the existence of relatedness between the dependent and independent variables. Presentation of results was done through tables. Regression analysis results indicated that the loaning procedure had a significant effect on credit accessibility among SMEs in Meru Town.

To analyze the materials of heat supply schemes for large cities of Russia, to consider the impact of an increase in the number of boiler houses in cities when planning the development and modernization of heat supply sources. To develop a methodology for choosing the structure of thermal generation in cities, which is distinguished by the use of an additional criterion for energy efficiency and a system of taken into account restrictions on the energy balances of the region. The weakening of attention to the overall energy efficiency of the aggregates of heat generation sources is shown, an additional reserve for increasing the energy efficiency of heat supply of cities is identified. METHODS. When solving this problem, methods of comparative analysis of the heat supply schemes of large cities of the Russian Federation over the past 7-10 years is used. RESULTS. The article describes the relevance of the topic, created a methodological base aimed at increasing the energy efficiency of heat supply systems in the city. A criterion is proposed that takes into account the different efficiency of sources and structural effects that are realized when choosing the composition of working heat sources for the prospective of urban development. The basic provisions, the relations used, the features of the developed methodology are given. A conclusion is drawn on the appropriateness and effectiveness of these proposals when testing this method. CONCLUSION. The developed method for choosing the structure of thermal generation was tested in the analysis of schemes of large cities of the Russian Federation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of non-centralised water supply in remote settlements is currently the only possible option. Monitoring the wa-ter quality of such supply sources is a complicated task in such areas, especially when there are active karst processes and difficult groundwater conditions. The application of deterministic analytical models of water supply under the risk of dis-turbance to groundwater dynamics is not efficient. Significant quantitative and even qualitative changes in groundwater conditions may take place between the calculated points, and the underestimation of these changes in expectation-driven computation models may result in serious geoecological issues. This research studied and justifies the use of adaptive dy-namic hydrogeological control in an area of non-centralised water supply based on the identification of key zones of geo-dynamic karst monitoring and the electrical express-monitoring of water resources. The identification of key zones is based on an integrated analysis of available groundwater information that describes changes in groundwater hydrodynamic condi-tions at the time of the karst forecast. The development of karst-suffusion processes is accompanied by more intense dy-namic changes in local areas of geologic environment compared to the general variation in intensity. Information about the occurrence of destructive groundwater processes by means of selective geodynamic monitoring may thus be obtained much earlier than with environmental geodynamics monitoring as a whole. The experimental hydrogeological control of an area of non-centralised water supply was conducted on the right bank of the Oka River in Nizhny Novgorod region, a locality with an active manifestation of karst processes. Structure and algorithms of space-time processing of hydrogeological con-trol data developed by authors have been used. The approach based on multifrequency vertical electrical sounding (MFVES) method has shown good correspondence with direct borehole observation when measuring depth of the first aq-uifer. Zones of unsafe water use have been revealed. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and the need for further regular observations of destructive groundwater processes by means of selective hydrogeodynamic monitoring.</jats:p>"

Construction as a male-dominated industry becomes a  barrier for women to join the workforce. The increase in the need for workforces is  proportional to the growth in construction development. The needs cannot only be provided  by male workers. Women's participation in the construction industry will contribute to the  shortage of human capital demand. The aim of this research is to find the factors that impede  women to pursue their careers in the construction industry. 21 factors are gathered from an  extensive literature review. After conducting expert interviews, the factors are developed into  a questionnaire and distributed to women who are already in the workforce. The analysis  based on the Relative Important Index shows that the most influential barrier to women in  construction is the lack of worksite security. The factor analysis found five critical barriers to  women’s careers in the construction industry. Developing these barriers to a framework gives  a broader perspective about the sources of each critical barrier. Internal as well as external  elements including worksite, organization, and the industry itself have been the cause that  prevents women to pursue their careers in the construction industry.</jats:p>"

Under these conditions, the issue of forming the human resources of pharmaceutical support systems acquires not only important professional significance, but also acquires socio-economic content for the effective development of the macroeconomic complex of countries as a whole.\r\nThe aim. Carrying out a comparative analysis of the process of forming the human resources of pharmaceutical supply systems in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, the countries of cooperation of the Independent States (CIS) and the European Region countries (ER) of the World Health Organization (WHO).\r\nMaterials and methods. The indicators of the total number of graduates-pharmacists, as well as indicators of the number per 100 thousand population in Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, the CIS and ER of WHO during 2000–2013 were studied. These indicators are presented on the European Health Information Portal. (“Information and facts”). The authors used historical, information-analytical, analytical-comparative, systemic, logical, hypothetical-deductive and generalizations, as well as mathematical-statistical research methods.\r\nResults. It is established that during 2000–2013 in Ukraine there was a significant increase in the number of graduates of pharmacists from 2.61 to 14.49 people per 100 thousand people. It is proved that Ukraine had the highest rates (%) of changes in these indicators, compared to other countries. Thus, the average value of the growth rate (%) of this indicator in Ukraine was 15.0 %, in Belarus and the CIS countries – 9.0 %, in Poland – 3.0 %, and in the ER of WHO – 4.0 %. It should be noted that in Ukraine, Belarus and Poland there was an unstable nature of changes in the number of graduates of pharmacists, per 100 thousand of us. According to the comparative analysis, it was found that the average value of the analyzed indicator in Ukraine was 5.8 times higher than in Belarus and 2.3 times higher than in Poland. In addition, the corresponding data of Ukraine were 3.1 and 2.6 times higher than similar indicators calculated in the CIS and ER of WHO countries. It is also noteworthy that the decline in Ukraine was characterized only by one year (2010), and amounted to 3.0 %.\r\nConclusions. Against the background of a systematic increase in the number of graduates-pharmacists who received diplomas in higher educational institutions of Ukraine, it is promising to analyze the dynamics of changes in the number of specialists who are actively engaged in professional activities in the pharmaceutical system. Confirming the status of a pharmaceutical country, in our opinion, Ukraine should form a socially oriented profile of the human resources potential of the health care system among the ER countries of WHO.</jats:p>"

Equally considered is the composition of the aviation groups, the total number of aircraft on the line by month, as well as statistics concerning repair and irrevocable losses. Based on materials from Moscow and St. Petersburg archives, statistical data are presented that characterize the entire process of the air bridge. Reports of the Civil Air Fleet, the Special Northern aviation group, and Leningrad airport, provide generalized data on the results of transport aviation activities in the autumn of 1941, including the number and composition of evacuated skilled workers and members of the civilian population from Leningrad. The analysis revealed the daily volume of goods delivered to the city, including the total amount of food, equipment, weapons, and devices received.

As a solution, many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have introduced housing policies aimed at providing affordable houses to low-to-medium income families. Over recent years, several affordable housing policies have been introduced in both Australia and New Zealand, including public housing initiatives, rental subsidies, accommodation supplements, state housing programmes and the provision of social housing. New Zealand launched the KiwiBuild programme in 2018 to increase housing affordability. Unfortunately, in 2019, KiwiBuild was unable to deliver its targeted primary objectives set by the Government. This study features a comparative analysis, primarily focusing on comparing and contrasting affordable housing policies in Australia and New Zealand. Subsequently, it discusses the reasons why the KiwiBuild programme failed. It makes recommendations based on policies used in Australia with a view to improving affordable housing policies in New Zealand. This research contributes and adds to the existing body of knowledge about affordable housing policies in both Australia and New Zealand. The recommendations will be helpful for future researchers who wish to develop workable policies to assist with affordable housing-related issues in New Zealand.</jats:p>"

Creative industries are a particular case where non‐monetary incentives are widely observed. These are also industries where moonlighting commonly occurs because artistic or creative activity is generally low paid, such that workers have to balance their chosen pursuit with another job to make ends meet. In this paper we propose a labour supply model that accounts for the psychic income derived from creative work, monetary remuneration and heterogeneity between occupations in a multiple job‐holding context. The model is estimated using three‐stage least squares, allowing us to control for simultaneity bias due to the constraint of time and the tendency for multiple job‐holdings. We estimate the model using data from a survey of Australian book authors. The use of a proxy for psychic income, measured as the disparity between an author’s monetary compensation and a shadow price of labour, enables us to gauge the effects of non‐pecuniary benefits on the labour supply decisions of this type of creative worker.</jats:p>",

There are several potentials including peat water, drilled well water, and Barumun river water that crosses the village. The condition of peat water that does not comply with quality standards for water that is fit for consumption has a brownish color, high acidity, and the organic matter contained in peat water is high enough to cause an odor. The well water has a salty taste (high salt content) so that what has the potential is Barumun river water even though it has a cloudy color. The method used to purify cloudy river water is through the processes of coagulation (deposition), filtration (filtering), absorption (absorption), and adsorption (ion exchange). This water purifier is made using 2 tubes filled with silica sand, MGS, activated carbon, and zeolite sand so that the water produced is clear and fit for consumption and can be utilized by the surrounding community. The results obtained from this water purification are water that does not have a smell, taste, and is clear in color so that it is suitable for use by the surrounding community</jats:p>"

The long-term relationship not being robust, we opted for the short-term dynamics with the causality test in the sense of Granger to support this question. The results indicated the existence of a one-way causality from economic growth to financial development. This result is in line with the Demand following hypothesis, given the country’s economic and financial landscape, which presents a less deep financial system. Consequently, choices of growth policies (increase in knowledge, infrastructure, pleasant business climate, structural reforms, etc.) should be adopted to enhance and develop the Congolese financial system. However, we recognize that once growth is restored and becomes sustainable, financial development could lead to sustained and resilient economic growth.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The deterioration of water supply networks leads to frequent accidents, such as pipe failure, which result in water service interruptions. Depending on the type of accident, a large-scale water service interruption can occur. Therefore, an emergency interconnection plan has been established to prevent interruptions in water service. However, most emergency interconnection plans only consider whether water can be supplied to the region of water service interruption. The area that can actually supply water, emergency water supply area (EWSA), and the possible time required to supply water, emergency water supply time (EWST) are not usually considered. Furthermore, in cases wherein the adjacent local governments or adjacent water supply blocks have insufficient water for the region of water service interruption, it is a good practice to increase the possible water supply time by the reducing the water supply rate (WSR) in order to minimize the damage from the water service interruption. In this study, a method is suggested to determine the proper WSR required to minimize the damage when the amount of emergency water is insufficient. Since it is a case where the amount of emergency water is not sufficient, A-PDA is used to simulate EWSA and EWSA for each WSR. The simulation results are subsequently converted into the customer satisfaction index for each WSR. Through this procedure, the proper WSR can be determined, thereby improving both customer satisfaction and water supply time. Finally, this method is applied to a real water supply network to verify its applicability.</jats:p>",

To this end, this paper investigates how close optimal solutions from simple EAs can approach the global optimal for water distribution system (WDS) design problems through an experiment with the number of decision variables ranging from 21 to 3,400. Three simple EAs are considered: the standard differential evolution, the standard genetic algorithm and the creeping genetic algorithm (CGA). The CGA consistently identifies optimal solutions with deviations lower than 50% to the global optimal, even for the WDS with 3,400 decision variables, but the performance of the other two EAs is heavily case study dependent. Results obtained build knowledge regarding these simple EAs’ ability in handling WDS design problems with different sizes. We must acknowledge that these results are conditioned on the WDSs and the parameterization strategies used, and future studies should focus on generalizing the findings obtained in this paper.</jats:p>",

The proposed concept integrates offshore wind power, onsite gas turbines and an energy storage system based on fuel cell and electrolyzer stacks. It is expected to be an effective option to decarbonize the offshore petroleum sector as it allows a more extensive exploitation of the offshore wind resource by means of energy storage. To ascertain its potential, an integrated model was developed. The integrated model allows to simulate the process and electric grid performances. The inclusion of both domains provides a comprehensive picture of a given design operational performance. The feasibility of the proposed concept was first investigated through a parametric analysis where an understanding of its potential and limitations was gained. A rigorous optimization was then implemented to identify the designs resulting in the best performances and ultimately to obtain a comprehensive picture of the suitability of the concept. It is shown that a well-designed system can reduce carbon emissions compared, not only to a standard concept based on gas turbines (almost 1,300 kt less CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions, making up for a relative 36% reduction), but also to the integration of a wind farm alone (more than 70 kt less CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions, making up for a relative 3% reduction, but complying with grid dynamics requirements). Moreover, the energy storage system brings benefits to the electric grid stability and allows the integration of large wind power capacity without overpassing the 2% maximum frequency variation (as it is the case without energy storage). Not least, the optimization showed that the definition of an optimal design is a complex task, with little margin to further gains in terms of carbon emissions, likely due to technological limitations.</jats:p>"

Although the handling of this epidemic has entered a \"new normal\", the availability of stocks of electronics, automotive, pharmaceuticals, food, and others is running low and out of control, so supply chain management is needed. The purpose of this article is to try to see the extent of the transformation in supply and demand in Indonesia. With this in-depth literature, the supply chain model is likely to transform globally, given that many companies are confused about management being unable to cope with drastic changes in the market. The demand patterns over the past period indicate a shift from offline to online storefronts. Even though it has now entered a transition to a new normal and shopping outlets are slowly opening up, online shopping or demand patterns are predicted to last a long time. Therefore, supply chain actors, especially farmers, logistics entrepreneurs, and shipping services, inevitably have to be able to quickly adapt to changing patterns in Indonesia. There is an imbalance between the demand and supply sides. Food supply chains tend to be unique in comparison to the supply chains of other products and services.</jats:p>",

Using stakeholder theory and the relational view, we distinguish between two main drivers: stakeholder pressures (i.e., from regulatory agencies, buying firms, and nongovernmental organizations) and relational mechanisms offered by multinational companies (MNCs) (i.e., lean trainings and relational capital). We used a multi‐method research design to study how these drivers uniquely influence supplier responsibility in an emerging‐country context. An in‐depth case study with Philips Lighting and 10 of its Chinese suppliers reveals causal inferences that link stakeholder and relational drivers with each responsibility dimension (environmental vs. social). Audit and survey data from Philips Lighting's 134 Chinese suppliers, complemented with four archival databases, bolster these inferences. Overall, the results show that supplier environmental responsibility can be fostered through both stakeholder pressures and relational drivers; whereas, supplier social responsibility is much harder to address. The integrated methods offer a fuller, more comprehensive understanding of the specifics of supplier responsibility in China and also provide recommendations for MNCs that seek to improve it.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The general objective of this work is to analyze the quality factors of the supply chain service in the western regional direction of the company Cervezas Cuauhtémoc Moctezuma - Heineken México. The analysis was framed in a model proposed by Gohain, Thambiah and Hong (2018) which measures six dimensions of service quality: the object, the process, the infrastructure, the interaction, the environment and social responsibility. A survey was applied as an instrument to collect the responses of active providers in the western region of Mexico. The results were estimated by using STATA 14 to evaluate the relationship between the proposed factors. The results highlight that the quality of the supply chain is influenced by the quality criteria of the product, the process and the interaction. In this way, this research contributes with relevant information that allows them to make quick and practical decisions to use those responsible for the company's supply chain, as well as other economic sectors.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern power supply and lighting systems of cities are complex electrical systems of an automated type, in which the processes in individual power supply systems and city lighting systems are interconnected and interdependent. Therefore, the search for efficient technologies for the transmission of electrical energy in them is an extremely difficult task. The real state of the power supply and lighting systems in cities today is characterized by low operating efficiency, largely due to the low quality of electrical energy and insufficient compensation of reactive power in them. The mutual influence of power supply and lighting systems in cities, as well as the presence of significant voltage deviations and the overflow of additional reactive power in the networks, causes an increase in voltage and power losses in them, as well as a decrease in the efficiency of networks and connected consumers, in general. Unfortunately, the existing methods and technical means based on them cannot fully solve this problem. The research carried out made it possible to clarify the nature of the processes in the power supply systems and the sanitation of cities and to determine the methods and technical means based on the Smart Grid concept. They are based on the use of phase-shifting booster transformers with an electronic control system. Their use made it possible to provide the possibility of complex control of the voltage modes of active and reactive power with the possibility of installation at any point in the network and centralized control from a single centre. The calculations show that the use of the developed methods and technical means provides an opportunity to reduce power losses in networks by 10–15% and energy costs for consumers by 50–75%.</jats:p>"

Desta forma, o objetivo geral deste trabalho foi melhorar a acuracidade da transferência de saldo no abastecimento da linha de produção de uma empresa do setor automobilístico. Para isso, a metodologia utilizada foi baseada na aplicação do roadmap DMAIC, desenvolvendo as etapas: define, measure, analyse, improve e control. Definiu-se que a área da administração de materiais que mais tem impacto nas ordens pendentes é o método de abastecimento por sequenciamento, desta forma, selecionou-se a célula de sequenciamento que mostrou maior variabilidade de processos. No período de medição, ocorreram 258 ordens pendentes, pela célula de maior impacto, representando aproximadamente R$ 17.000,00 em horas homens investidas em análises de divergências. Analisando as causas, para reduzir as situações de ordens pendentes, propôs-se realizar mudanças no fluxo do processo, implementar um quadro de gestão da informação e criar um método de sequenciamento dos cartões de identificação.  Após o controle da melhoria, conclui-se que as ocorrências de ordens pendentes reduziram. Porém, ainda é necessário ampliar a aplicação das melhorias em todo método de abastecimento sequenciado, procurando reduzir ainda mais as ocorrências.</jats:p>"

On this basis, the influences of government subsidies, customer composition ratio and carbon sensitivity on the owner’s optimal decision are analyzed. The results show that, with the increase of government subsidies for the contractor emission reduction costs, the proportion of carbon emission-sensitive consumers and the carbon sensitivity of consumers will increase, and the market demand will be increased, which will not only improve the profits of owners and contractors, but also the contractors’ emission reduction efforts.

The 3-level, 3-factor Box–Behnken design was applied to the preparation of chitosan to investigate effects of factors such as the HCl solution concentration, protein removal time and deacetylation time on the degree of deacetylation (%DD). Scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography were employed to examine the chitosan structure, as well as pH titration and antibacterial testing of the chitosan solution. Results revealed that as-p chitosan comprises specific functional groups, with almost no impurities. Its average molecular weight was ∼225,000 g/mol, and %DD was ∼89.7%. The chitosan/PVA composite was prepared and investigated for the adsorption of nitrate and phosphate ions in water. Experimental results revealed that the adsorption capacity of a chitosan/PVA (1:2) composite is better than that of chitosan. Accordingly, the theoretical maximum adsorption capacities of nitrate and phosphate ions on chitosan were 122.0 mg/g and 344.8 mg/g, respectively. The corresponding values on the chitosan/PVA (1:2) composite were 135.1 mg/g and 384.6 mg/g. Adsorption kinetics data at 25 °C were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order model (R2 &amp;gt; 0.998). These results revealed that crab shell chitosan and the chitosan/PVA (1:2) composite can be used for the adsorption of nitrates and phosphates in aqueous solutions.</jats:p>",

The article deals with the history of the emergence of intelligent transport systems in the world. We have investigated the prerequisites and promising directions for developing the global market of intelligent transport systems: traffic management, road safety, and supervision; cargo management; automotive telematics; parking management; automated vehicles. The main players in the field of business in this market have been identified. It is systematized for the adaptation of countries that are developing due to the features of the European ITS architecture, the US ITS architecture, the Japanese national ITS architecture, which are designed to improve the lives of citizens. Variants of using information and navigation systems in the framework of European projects on the example of cities are proposed. In the example of the European Union, the stages of implementation of the ITS architecture are considered, and how this affects the congestion of roads in large cities. The creation of a unified architecture of ITS allows you to control: the level of transport safety in transport and road traffic; energy consumption and environmental impact; networks of logistics systems for passenger service and cargo handling; management of transport, road construction, and repair works, parking places, collection of road tolls, equipment for improving personal services of road users. We have substantiated the necessity of using an integrated approach to improve the digitalization and intellectualization of transport systems, taking into account their advantages and disadvantages, has been substantiated. Conceptual approaches to the digitization of transport are generalized, closely related to logistics IT systems and the network of local roads. The theoretical basis of the level of intellectualization of the Ukrainian transport systems in comparison with foreign ones has been studied, the expediency of the possibility of developing this sphere in Ukraine with the implementation of the project \"Transparent infrastructure\" has been proved. The organizational and economic principles of the use of intelligent transport systems of the countries of the world for solving a wide range of problems have been determined: transmission of information in real-time for travelers, namely, traffic schedules, information on delays; entrance fee for the passage of vehicles to the area of the city; accident management; an electronic collection of duties. The legislative framework and the National Transport Strategy of Ukraine for the period up to 2030 are considered. The real results of the development of transport systems that are already being implemented in Ukrainian cities are displayed. A network of \"smart roads\" will be built in Ukraine. To implement this task, high-quality fiber-optic communications are needed, which will pass along the roads, which will allow the introduction of intelligent transport systems. The use of the world's leading experience in the implementation of intelligent transport systems is strategic for Ukraine, determines its competitiveness in the world market, and meets the requirements of integrating the national transport network into the Trans-European transport network.</jats:p>"

Besides the increase access to education, the quality of graduate reflected by their academic performance is worrying (Ridzuan, Yunus, Abdullah, Bakar, Azlan &amp; Ramlan 2018). Paloș, Maricuţoiu and Coste (2019), noticed that a large number of enrolled student graduates with poor grades or fail to graduate. In an attempt to retain and capture market share with the increase in study options, higher education all over the world are constantly struggling to provide a distinctive learning experience necessary to improve their students' performance (McGillicuddy &amp; McGloin 2018). Considering the increasingly competitive and dynamic education environment, higher education can no longer ignore the needs and factors required to enhance student performance. Poor student performance in higher education institution has been a major source of concern for decision makers in the educational sector. Lai (2015), posits that the poor student performance can be attributed to the student-related factors such as attendance classes, score in high school, competence in quantitative subject and preparation to exam or tests. Moreover, Glew, Ramjan, Salas, Raper Creed and Salamonson (2019) state that poor attitude to the subject, lack of innovative teaching techniques, inadequate materials and inadequate funding to support the students negatively impact the performance of student. In addition, most prior research on performance has been done at high school or colleges, rather than at university level (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2017). While, studies on student performance in developed countries are well documented, little attention has been dedicated in less developed countries such as South Africa (Ngoma et al., 2017). Given the difference between culture in developed and less developed counties, this study focused on investigating the antecedents of student performance in South Africa.\n\n\nKeywords: Student royalty, student satisfaction, student motivation, student performance</jats:p>",

The daily precipitation values at 22 stations in the TP were found to conform to the model, and theoretical and measured frequencies were consistent. According to the spatial distribution of the maximum precipitation value, the extreme values of Shigatse and Lhasa showed large fluctuations, and the probability of record-breaking precipitation events was low. In the western part of Nagqu, the probability of extreme precipitation was relatively low, and that of record-breaking precipitation was relatively high. The peak values of extreme precipitation in the flood season in the TP generally exhibited a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest, and the extreme value of the flood season that reappeared in the southeast region was approximately twice that of the northwest region. The maximum rainfall in most areas will exceed 20 mm in the next 5–10 years, and the maximum rainfall in Shigatse will reach 52.7 mm. After 15 years of recurrence in various regions, the peak rainfall in the flood season has become low. Most of the regions in the model have different responses to ENSO and Indian Ocean monsoon indices with external forcing factors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facing competition from manufacturers' online direct channels, how retailers make sales channel decisions to increase consumer stickiness has become the core concern of the industry and academia. Empirical research showed that delivery lead time is a key factor that affects consumers' preference for online channels. To analyze the impact of consumer delivery time preference on channel selection and pricing strategy of retailers, consumer delivery lead time preference function was improved from a linear function to an exponential function and consumer demand under the mixed dual-channel supply chain of manufacturer and retailer was derived. Then, the Stackelberg game models under different channel strategies of retailer were established and solved. Results show that consumer preference for delivery lead time has four implications on the channel decision of retailers under manufacturer encroachment in the dual-channel supply chain. First, the dual retail channels strategy is the optimal choice for retailers, and the profit margins that a retailer obtains from dual retail channels supply chain and single online retail channel supply chain will increase as consumers' delivery lead time preference coefficient increases. Second, the optimal pricing of online retail channel and offline retail channel is positively related to consumers' delivery lead time preference coefficient. By contrast, the optimal pricing of online direct channel is negatively related to consumers' delivery lead time preference coefficient. Third, the optimal pricing of online retail channel is higher than that of offline retail and online direct channels. Fourth, a retailer and a manufacturer can adopt a compensation-based whole price contract to address the conflict brought about by the optimal channel choice of the retailer. This study introduces consumer delivery lead time preference into retailer channel decision making and provides a theoretical reference for retailer's mixed channel construction in practice.</jats:p>",

This study sought to explore how multiple uses of water, in this case community gardening as a productive use combined with domestic uses influence sustainability of communally-managed rural water supply systems. Using the independent samples t-test, it was noted that community gardening positively influences sustainability. The test was done on institutional, technical, social and financial factors of sustainability. Results showed that there were statistically significant differences in sustainability performance between water points used for multiple uses and those used for domestic uses only. However, it was also noted that using drinking water sources for multiple uses increases the frequency of water use conflicts and water point breakdowns, which negatively impact on sustainability. This means that where water sources are used for multiple uses additional management skills and resources may be required for the water points to be sustained. The study concluded that using domestic water sources for productive purposes enhances sustainability of water supply facilities; however, consideration has to be given about the relative importance and scale of the type of productive activity to be implemented.</jats:p>",

However, a large number of RSC‐MLIs have not yet reached to the application level because of the absence of modularity, unequal load‐sharing among DC sources and the absence of switching redundancies. On the other hand, multilevel dc‐link (MLDCL) and switched series parallel sources (SSPS) RSC‐MLI topologies are modular structures with adequate switching redundancies and can be an alternative to conventional cascaded H‐bridge (CHB) for grid‐connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive comparison among CHB, MLDCL and SSPS topologies has been carried out for grid connected PV application. Based on the outcome, an asymmetric 11 kV three‐phase 11‐level SSPS RSC‐MLI is chosen. In this combination, a common non‐linear sliding mode controller (SMC) is developed for generating maximum PV power from asymmetric single‐stage PV sources by linearizing the non‐linear PV system using an effective feedback linearization scheme. The PV power extracted is delivered to the grid by controlling SSPS RSC‐MLI using another SMC. The performance of the system under wide variations of insolation levels is verified in MATLAB and further validated in hardware‐in‐the‐loop OPAL‐RT controller.</jats:p>",

This study focuses on the removal of ammonium from aqueous solution by batch adsorption experiments using biochar derived from a combination of various wood chips (spruce, pine, and fir). Adsorption characteristics of ammonium onto biochar were evaluated as a function of biochar dosages, initial concentrations of ammonium, contact time and pH. Results demonstrated that ammonium removal increased with the increase of biochar dosage. The percentage of ammonium removal reached a value of 80% at a biochar dosage of 100 g/L. Ammonium removal decreased by 15% with the increase of initial ammonium concentration by 50 mg/L. The optimum pH for ammonium removal was considered in the range from 6 to 8. Ammonium removal reached its stable value within 3 days. The maximum adsorption capacity of ammonium was 0.96 mg/g for 80 mg/L of initial ammonium concentration. The adsorption isotherm followed both the Langmuir and Freundich models for ammonium adsorption onto biochar. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy results indicated the presence of amine, amide and nitrile functional groups on the surface of biochar which could contribute to the adsorption of ammonium onto biochar. Thus, biochar derived from various wood chips showed the potential to remove ammonium from aqueous solution.</jats:p>",

The Mann-Kendall technique and range of variability approach (RVA) were used to quantitatively evaluate the hydrologic alteration due to Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in Dongting Lake. Results indicate the following. (1) The average annual water levels at Chenglingji station showed increasing trends (p &amp;lt; 0.05), while that at Nanzui station showed a decreasing trend (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The turning year occurred in 2003, which reflects the significant effects of the TGR on the water level regime. (2) The highly altered parameters were 1-, 3-, and 7-day minimum water levels both at Chenglingji and Yangliutan, and in October both at Nanzui and Yangliutan, with the degree of hydrologic alteration being larger than 80%. However, 1-, 3-, 7-, and 30-day maximum water levels at three stations had relatively small alteration, with the degree of hydrologic alteration being smaller than 41%. (3) The hydrologic alteration degrees at Chenglingji, Nanzui and Yangliutan station were all moderate, with changes of 50, 46 and 49%, respectively. (4) Water level regimes at Dongting Lake were mainly jointly affected by reservoir operation, land utilization change and river channelization. These changes in water level regimes have a negative impact on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. This study provides a scientific reference for the protection of lake ecosystems under hydrologic alteration.</jats:p>",

To this end, a quantitative-qualitative empirical study was performed together with in-depth interviews of key stakeholders. Official registry sources were also used to complement the data. The results show a fragmented network of micro-SMEs that are functionally isolated from the rest of the tourism supply and display an intuitive and poor market-oriented behavior due to the inadequate management of their client portfolio.

The port-Hamiltonian structure in open-loop is used to design a passivity-based controller with proportional-integral gains (PI-PBC) in order to develop the control strategy. The main advantage of using passivity-based controllers corresponds to the possibility of guaranteeing asymptotic stability by transforming the trajectory tracking problem into a regulation control one. In addition to the PI-PBC, a linear load estimator is employed based on an integral formulation to determine the value of the equivalent conductance in the load, which reduces the number of current sensors. Numerical validations demonstrate that the sinusoidal voltage provided by the VSI to the load has a tracking error lower than $1~\\%$, with harmonic distortions lower than $2.6~\\%$, both for voltage and currents in the load. All the simulations were conducted in MATLAB/Simulink using the SimPowerSystems library version 2017a.</jats:p>"

They have garnered significant attention due to their feature of creating secure private and public networks in a decentralized manner. The traditional FSC fails to meet the customer requirements of quality, safety, reliability, transparency, and traceability. This paper proposes a novel 3‐stage methodology using principal component analysis (PCA), total iterative structural modeling (TISM), and Matrice d'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquée à un Classement (MICMAC) analysis to develop an integrated BC with the food supply chain (FSC). The existing literature was surveyed and industry experts' opinion was gathered and various critical success factors (CSF) were identified which are associated with FSC and BC. The data collected from experts were then evaluated for data consistency and dimension reduction through PCA. The dimensionally reduced data set was analyzed by TISM and MICMAC analysis. TISM and MICMAC analysis categorizes the enabler factors according to their hierarchical level and is used to label or distinguish between dependence and driving power. The integrated methodology found nine CSFs, namely, transparent system, fraud detect, inventory management with tracking, scalability, secure system, cost reduction, safe and quality food, customer satisfaction, and government regulations, which are the main drivers for the FSC business. The paper integrates information technology, Blockchain, with operation management, supply chain. The proposed model overcomes the limitation associated with FSC and will motivate the academia and industry to adopt and achieve efficient and effective goals in this field of FSC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The public debt of South Asian countries has witnessed a continuous increase from the last three decades which has badly affected the household private consumption expenditures. High public debt can lead to steep losses for banks, both domestic and international, undermines the stability of financial systems in both the crisis-hit country and others. This can hit economic growth as well as private consumption. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of public debt on private consumption in South Asian countries i.e. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Besides public debt, the impact of some other important macroeconomic, fiscal, and monetary variables like lending interest rate, public spending and money supply have also been examined. For this purpose, 31 years of panel data from 1990 to 2020 of South Asian countries have been taken. The study has used a variety of econometric techniques like Robust Least Square Regression, Panel Cointegration, Error Correction Model (ECM), Wald test, and Panel Fully Modified Least Squares (FMOLS) approach to examine the short-run and long-run relationship among the variables. The results of Robust Least Square Regression indicate that public debt discourages private consumption. The lending interest rate also badly affected private consumption. The other variables like public spending and money supply have a favorable impact on private consumption. The results of the Kao Residual Panel Cointegration Test and the Johansen Fisher Panel Cointegration Test indicate that there exists a long run relationship among the variables. The results of the ECM and Wald Test reveal that a long run and short-run causality is running from independent variables to the dependent variable respectively. The study recommends that by using monetary and fiscal policies effectively the private consumption and economic growth can be stimulated in the economy.

The study used centrifugation and a sand funnel method to determine the SWCCs of pure sandy soils with different particle sizes and sandy soils mixed with different extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) analogs. The sensitivity of correlated parameters for SWCCs obtained using a van Genuchten (VG) model was analyzed by single-factor perturbation analysis. The results show the following. (1) Fine sand has the strongest water retention ability. (2) The more polysaccharide there is in the media, the stronger its water-holding capacity. Polysaccharide not only has its strong water-holding capacity, but also changes the structure of medium to increase water-holding capacity. The humic acid and protein components had little effect on the hydrodynamic properties of fine sandy soil. (3) Sensitivity analyses revealed that the saturated water content, θs, greatly affected the ability of solute transport to reach equilibrium concentrations. Therefore, it is essential to define the range of media particles and component content, and ensure the accuracy of VG model parameters in the practical application of soil media affected by biological activity.</jats:p>",

The consequences may involve water loss and service interruptions, compromised water quality, infrastructure disruptions, and loss of revenue. Thus, creating failure assessment models is quite crucial to sustain water distribution networks (WDNs) and to optimize maintenance spending. This research paper aims at developing an assessment framework for water systems, as well as modeling the failure phenomena toward sustainable management of underground infrastructure. The city of El Pedregal in Peru was chosen to exemplify the methodology of the research due to the rapid pace of urbanization and growing economic activities in the region, which make water infrastructure even more critical. The framework is based on the application of modeling techniques stemming from statistical regression analysis (RA) and 3D schematic representation. First, the influential factors that lead to the deterioration of the WDNs are determined. Second, the RA technique is leveraged to evaluate and model the failure rate through consecutive simulation operations and a 3D surface plot. Finally, the efficacy of the model is investigated using different performance metrics, in conjunction with a residual analysis scheme. The validation results revealed the robustness of the model with R‐squared (R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) and the sum of squares error (SSE) of 0.9767 and 0.0008, respectively. The developed model is a predictive tool that can be used by municipal engineers as a preemptive measure against future pipeline bursts or leaks.</jats:p>",

These spotted zebras deserve the attention of both the scientific community and policymakers being ambiguous solutions. On the one hand, the hybrid systems allow broadening the access to the water supply service in face of the challenge to manage, maintain and adapt large infrastructures in a time of increasing climate change impacts, water-supply demand and drinking water scarcity. On the other hand, by embodying informal artefacts and unregulated behaviours to use natural resources, the hybrid systems enhance the vulnerability and precariousness of the population that is normally not reached by the formal public infrastructure. The paper presents findings of research conducted in Queimados, in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area. Our study suggests that grassroots solutions, albeit being an opportunity when integrated, represent a threat when standing alone, and it is critical to further discuss ways to promote such integration within a structured institutional public framework. Conclusions stress the need to rethink the grassroots engagement within socio-technical transition emphasizing the nexus between political culture, civic education and infrastructural solutions.</jats:p>",

Из-за локализации негативных экологических факторов в портовом регионе особое значение приобретают проблемы обеспечения экологической безопасности и устойчивого развития. Одним из эффективных методов снижения техногенного воздействия на экологию является замещение ископаемых видов топлива возобновляемыми источниками энергии, обеспечивающими электроэнергию для портовых операций и берегового питания морских судов.

Due to the localization of negative environmental factors in the port region, problems of ensuring environmental safety and sustainable development are of particular importance. One of the effective methods to reduce the technogenic impact on the environment is the replacement of fossil fuels with renewable energy sources that provide electricity for port operations and onshore power supply of ships. However, estuarine ports have limited territories and a reduced potential of renewable resources, in particular wind energy, due to the remoteness from coastal marine territories. The article examines the use of renewable energy sources for power supply using the example of the Kaliningrad Sea Trade Port. An assessment of the potential of solar and wind energy is given. The analysis of the power supply system of the port was carried out and recommendations were given for the implementation of distributed generation systems based on renewable energy sources.</jats:p>",

The significance of this problem is actualized not only by the extreme exacerbation of relations in the “nature-society” system, which necessitated an urgent need to improve the effectiveness of state environmental policy, including such a tool as information sup- port, but also by unprecedented changes in the media space.  The transition from traditional to new media that took place in the 1990s, the further global spread of the Internet, and the digitization of communication messages led to fundamental changes in the media sphere. The Internet has connected many of its users - individuals, organizations, media into a single, open communication network, creating an unlimited number of connections, reducing the distance between network participants, destroying spatial and temporal restrictions. A new level of communications has emerged that has changed not only consumers' access to information, but also their interaction with it. The media have become an effective tool for the purposeful construction of social orders by building correct relations and relations with the public for the authorities, which fully applies to the environmental sphere, for which the successful solution of the problems of ensuring a safe living environment is largely determined by public opinion, the support of the population for the implemented environmental policy ...

The method chosen in this paper for building reverse logistics is to add additional functions to the existing forward logistics. This process can be regarded as adding reverse edges to the original directed edges in an FSN. Due to the limitation of funds and the demand for reverse flow, we suppose that a limited number of reverse edges can be built in a CLSN. To determine the transformation schemes with excellent robustness against malicious attacks, this paper proposes a multi-population evolutionary algorithm with novel operators to optimize the robustness of the CLSN, and this algorithm is abbreviated as MPEA-RSN. Then, both the generated and realistic SNs are taken as examples to validate the effectiveness of MPEA-RSN. The simulation results show that the index R, introduced to evaluate the robustness of CLSNs, can be improved by more than 95%, and this indicates that (1) the different schemes for adding reverse routes to an FSN can lead to different robustness values, and (2) the robustness of the transformed CLSN to malicious attacks can be significantly improved after optimization by MPEA-RSN. When an FSN is to be transformed into a CLSN, this paper can provide a frame of reference for building a CLSN that is robust to malicious attacks from a network structural perspective.</jats:p>"

PAA doses of 5, 10, and 25 mg/L were effective for adult mussel control at the low water temperatures tested (4 °C). Results from this study indicate that PAA and EarthTec QZ may be an alternative to prechlorination.</jats:p>",

Sustainable agriculture is a delicate equilibrium to increase crop production and preserve economic stability while reducing the use of scarce natural resources and the negative effects of the environment. The use of renewable energy systems for sustainable agriculture, therefore, needs to be promoted. This paper is a state of art on the numerous update and feasible technologies of renewable energy applications in the agricultural sectors. It also discusses the significance of renewable energy as environmentally clean technologies and the most reliable energy source. This study covers different types of renewable energy sources like solar systems, biomass energy, and hydropower. Such forms of renewables have been proven to be suitable options in agriculture, and in particular for remote rural areas.</jats:p>",

The study was conducted through the collection of secondary data and primary data. The primary data was collected through a preliminary survey, a standardized questionnaire survey of various components of stakeholder’s namely (a) manufacturers and exporters, (b) commission agents/brokers, (c) traders, and(d) artisans. The present study revealed that 58% of manufactures and exporters and 86.38% of craftsmen agreed that the raw material procurement chain starts from the farmer’s field to Middleman then Commission agents and goes to the Craftsman. The majority of stakeholders responded that the middleman is the most important in the supply chain of the wood procurement process. The survey indicated that there is 0-5% incremental cost in every stage of the raw material procurement process and the approximately total incremental cost of wood is between 5-10% due to the existing supply chain. The data analysis related to a sequence of most demanding wood species for wood carving work indicated that 60% of commission agents/brokers responded for the sequence of Mango&gt;Shisham&gt;Poplar&gt;Other, whereas 56.50% manufacturers and others. 83.33% commission agents/brokers, 85.71% manufacturers, and exporters, 97.87% traders, 98.26% craftsman responded negatively to the existence of imported wood species in the Saharanpur wood market.</jats:p>"

The inefficiencies of this inflexibility caused by disconnects in supply and demand chains have become especially evident. We present a vision for a digital system—an open online product marketplace—that would enable product designers to rapidly connect with capable producers in meeting urgent customer demands. As such, this digital system would facilitate ordering, orchestration, and fulfillment, as well as continuous improvement of manufacturing-as-a-service systems.

A case study is conducted to PT X, a bottled water company in West Sumatra. The results show the overall closed-loop supply chain performance of PT X is at a fair level. Nine measures in the forward chain are at a good level. In contrast, one measure (i.e., product characteristics) is classified into a poor level. Based on the results, the company needs to conduct improvements related to product characteristics. In terms of the reverse chain, two measures (i.e., material features and supplier commitment) are at a fair level, while four measures are at a good level. The company has to pay more attention to material features and supplier commitment. Improvements to those measures can increase the reverse chain’s performance, which indirectly increases the overall performance of the closed-loop supply chain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake had a significant impact on groundwater levels and quality. In some areas, the groundwater level increased significantly due to the release of groundwater from upstream mountainous regions. Conversely, the groundwater level in other areas greatly decreased due to the creation of new fracture networks by the earthquake. There were also significant changes in certain groundwater quality variables. In this study, we used clustering based SOM (self-organizing maps) analysis to improve the understanding of earthquake effects on groundwater quality. We were especially interested in effects on groundwater used for drinking purposes and in nitrate concentration. For this purpose, we studied groundwater nitrate (NO3− + NO2−–N) concentrations for the period 2012–2017. Nitrate concentration changes were classified into seven typical SOM clusters. The clusters were distributed in three representative geographical regions: a high concentration region (&gt;4 mg/L), a low concentration region (&lt;1.6 mg/L) with minimal anthropogenic loading area, and an intermediate concentration region (2–4 mg/L). Depending on these regions, the nitrate concentration changes just before and after the earthquake had both increasing and decreasing trends between 2015–2017. This points to complex physiographical relationships for release of stored upstream groundwater, promotion of infiltration of shallow soil water/groundwater, and nitrate concentration as affected by earthquakes. We present an analysis of these complex relationships and a discussion of causes of nitrate concentration changes due to earthquakes.</jats:p>"

It reached the depth of 5060 m and bottomed within the Upper Triassic Mohilla Fm. Following the increase of groundwater exploitation, the Cl- concentrations increased and ionic ratios changed indicating inflow of Ca2+-Cl- brines, the origins of which were hitherto unknown. Data from the new MJ1 borehole revealed that rock porosities decrease with depth. Lowermost values of about 3% were interpreted from logs in Lower Jurassic and Triassic strata. The highest shut-in pressures were measured in the Upper Jurassic sequence raising the water much higher than the ground surface. Along the drilled section, there is a continuous downward increase in Cl- concentrations in the range of 12-186 g Cl-/l and a very clear stratification of brines. Data from the MJ1 borehole and from other exploration wells indicate that in the subsurface of the area, there are two definite source brines: Triassic brine and the Late Tertiary (so-called) Rift brine. Brines encountered in Jurassic and Cretaceous beds represent ancient mixtures of the two source brines involving various water-rock chemical transformations. Evidence of very high pressures in deep boreholes Devora 2A, Rosh Pinna 1, and MJ1 revealed the existence of a mechanism in which the deep brines are “piston-driven” upwards and possibly also laterally. The ongoing salinization of groundwater in the area is due to the inflow of the Late Tertiary Ca2+-Cl- Rift brines and not that of the Jurassic or Triassic brines. The hydrogeological and hydrochemical data from borehole MJ1 is of major importance for the management of groundwater resources in the Central Jordan Rift Valley and in the adjacent geologically connected areas.</jats:p>",

This study was conducted to design a performance measurement system for food production that combines the halal factors in its business process. Halal means authorized, legal, permitted, and allowed to any object or activity that is used or implemented in Islam. Therefore, designing and measure the performance in this study will use the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) model and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). By using the SCOR model, we will get performance metrics that serve as indicators to observe and maintain the company’s performance. Meanwhile, by using AHP, we will get the importance weight of each metric toward the company’s performance score. The results of this study obtained 15 metrics with 3 halal metrics. The 15 metrics are divided into three performance attributes, which are 5 metrics in the reliability attribute, 9 metrics in the responsiveness attribute, and 1 metric in the cost attribute. The results of the overall performance score is 72.73. Those metrics are useful to maintain and improve the company’s performance.</jats:p>",

The concept includes carrying out ontological data analysis and the formation of the corresponding knowledge bases. The stages of the knowledge management process about the parameters of the calculated power supply models have been decomposed in order to develop tools for their automatic generation in billing systems. Sets of parameters of power supply objects and parameters characterizing the volume of energy consumption, price indicators and parameters for calculating the cost of consumed electricity, which, along with the relations between entities and their functional connections, determine the structure of ontologies, have been determined. For the first time, the definitions of the computational model of power supply are given as a semantic model consisting of a set of basic concepts of the electric power industry, and as a system of knowledge about methods of storing and processing information about the values of energy consumption. An ontology of the process of forming calculation models using the Protégé ontological editor is built. Requirements for the knowledge base of the system for supporting the formation of calculation models in information systems are formulated and the possibility of using data mining technologies with mechanisms for checking the consistency, sufficiency and continuity of knowledge through the use of methods for forming fuzzy rules is substantiated. This makes it possible to substantiate the possibility of applying the principles of fuzzy logic for the automated generation of calculation models of power supply in billing systems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Showrooming has become common practice of consumers in the context of dual-channel retailing. Under different intensities of showrooming, the manufacturer can decide whether to directly retail online (the M-R case) or resell through an e-retailer (the E-R case). Dual-channel supply chain models and dynamic game models are developed and both online selling formats are investigated. The dynamic game process of the supply chain is numerically simulated. The stability of the Nash equilibrium point is investigated by parameter basins for periodical cycles and bifurcation diagrams. The results show that the price adjustment speeds have a larger stability range in the M-R case while the service effort adjustment speed has a larger stability range in the E-R case. The stability of the systems is more sensitive to price adjustment speed than service effort adjustment speed in both supply chain structures. It is found that the systems will enter chaos through a flip bifurcation or a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. The changes in attractors and basins of attraction indicate that both channels can reach the equilibria more easily when they choose a lower speed of retail price adjustment. The effects of showrooming on decision variables are greater in the M-R case than in the E-R case. When the showrooming effect is moderate, the manufacturer should choose the M-R case; when the showrooming effect is sufficiently large or sufficiently small, the manufacturer should choose the E-R case. We propose a wholesale price markdown strategy which can: (i) eliminate the double marginalization and coordinate the supply chain; (ii) effectively control the chaos caused by the overhigh adjustment speed of wholesale price, and restore the system to a stable state; (iii) improve the retailer’s service effort. </jats:p>",

Employing construal level and reactance theory, two studies examine which marketing campaign is most effective in countries where the crime is actually taking place by distinguishing supply (=poachers in Kenya) and demand (=consumers of Chinese traditional medicine in China). Both studies follow a 2 × 2 between‐subject design with an additional control group whereby temporal distance and social distance are manipulated to outline weaknesses of current antipoaching campaigns and identify alternatives that are more effective. Results suggest that economic and identity‐related factors can explain consumers (China) and poachers (Kenya) intentions to purchase traditional Chinese medicine with rhino horn or sell rhino horn. In both countries, marketing campaigns featuring temporal distance were superior to close counterparts; yet, the mediating variables differ for each country. Close temporal distance elicits reactance. Interestingly, poachers do not seem to discriminate between close and far social distance. The findings have lifesaving implications for wildlife, profound practical implications for non‐governmental organizations, and governmental agencies' additional theoretical contributions.</jats:p>",

To further reduce the overall carbon emissions in railway systems, this paper considers to integrate the renewable energy with railway power supply, which however leads to a more complicated system to model, design and control. This paper first investigates its modelling aspect. To reduce the operating capacity of HPQC while addressing the power unbalance, optimal design of the compensation scheme for co‐phase system is formulated as a multi‐objective optimization problem which is then solved by the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm‐II (NSGA‐II). To eliminate the impact of errors arising from imperfect predictions of the loads and renewable power, a hybrid optimal compensation control is proposed, yielding full and optimal compensations. Comprehensive simulation studies, considering three operation modes covering variable traction loads, renewable and regenerative braking power, are conducted. The simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed optimal compensation scheme, achieving an average of more than 20% reduction in HPQC capacity compared to the full compensation scheme. Meanwhile, the power quality requirement is satisfied, even in the presence of real‐time prediction errors.</jats:p>",

Considering the consumer’s double consumption preference and the manufacturer’s green product R&amp;D investment, a differential game model of the green supply chain under the government cost subsidy strategy is constructed. Firstly, the equilibrium points of the system are solved and their stability is discussed and analyzed. Secondly, the dynamic evolution process of Nash equilibrium under the parameters of green degree, green preference coefficient, retail channel preference coefficient, coefficient of the sensitivity of price, and adjustment speed are described by numerical simulation. The results show that the two ways of a system entering chaos are Flip bifurcation and N-S bifurcation, respectively, by 2D bifurcation graph, and it is also verified in 1D bifurcation diagram. When the bifurcation parameters are small, the system maintains Nash equilibrium stability. If the green degree of products is increased, the green preference coefficient will also increase; on the contrary, the retail preference coefficient will decrease. Research and development cost subsidy policy can effectively improve the green degree of products and increase the sales volume of products, so as to improve the profit of supply chain members.</jats:p>",

In this study, the system modelling and mode analysis of HIA‐CCPS is developed in detail. First, a simplified CCPS model is proposed based on the voltage‐behind‐reactance (VBR) model of HIA and the phase base‐value system (PBVS). Second, four different modes of CCPS are derived on conditions of the constant voltage load (CVL) assumption; the symbols and terms in these modes are unified. The equations derived in this study are the basis of the system parameter design and the further research of HIA‐CCPS.</jats:p>",

The development of global agrifood supply chains has been influenced by the interests the agricultural market players, from primary agricultural producers to consumers in marketing niches. The presence of risks drivers at the level of agricultural producers, processing enterprises and other participants in agri-food supply chains necessitates the formation of competitive positioning strategies.  Ukraine relies on imports of milk and dairy products, potatoes, vegetables, fruits, berries and grapes, which can be grown by domestic producers. Such commodities are subjects to the agricultural bargaining in many developed economies. Cooperation between government agencies and associations of agricultural producers helps to reduce the level of uncertainty and risk under the destructive effects of global economic forces. The role of the government in the formation of risk management mechanisms in agribusiness is more noticeable than in other areas, which is reflected by the impact on subsidization mechanism, taxation, the formation of marketing channels of produce movement, leveling the influence of market power of retailers. It is not justified to increase the volume of exports of products that could be used as feed by the domestic farmers. Increasing exports of raw materials does not always contribute to a positive image of the country in the world markets. As an example the supply of organic soybeans to the US market was illustrated. The impact of risks on participants in agrifood supply chains necessitates the involvement of innovative technologies, financial instruments, regulatory government programs, as well as best management practices.</jats:p>",

It is well known that the variability of yields is linked to changes in meteorological conditions. However, little is known about the long-term effects of agronomic management strategies, such as the supply of important nutrients. We analysed the stability of four major European crops grown between 1955 and 2008 at a long-term fertilization experiment located in Germany. Six fertilizer treatments ranged from no fertilization over the omission of individual macronutrients to complete mineral fertilization with all major macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium). Yield stability was estimated for each crop × treatment combination using the relative yield deviation in each year from the corresponding (nonlinear) trend value (relative yield anomalies (RYA)). Stability was lowest for potato, followed by sugar beet and winter wheat and highest for winter rye. Stability was highest when soils had received all nutrients with the standard deviation of RYA being two to three times lower than for unfertilized plots. The omission of nitrogen and potassium was associated with a decrease in yield stability and a decrease in the number of simultaneous positive and negative yield anomalies among treatments. Especially in root crops nutrient supply strongly influenced both annual yield anomalies and changes in anomalies over time. During the second half of the observation period yield stability decreased for sugar beet and increased for winter wheat. Potato yields were more stable during the second period, but only under complete nutrient supply. The critical role of potassium supply for yield stability suggests potential links to changes in the water balance during the last decades. Results demonstrate the need to explicitly consider the response of crops to long-term nutrient supply for understanding and predicting changes in yield stability.</jats:p>",

To overcome the above challenges, FinFET has the advantages of an increase in the operating speed, reduced power consumption, decreased static leakage current is used to realize the majority of the applications by replacing MOSFET. By considering the attractive features of the FinFET, an ALU is designed as an application. In the digital processor, the arithmetic and logical operations are executed using the Arithmetic logic unit (ALU). In this paper, power efficient 8-bit ALU is designed with Full adder (FA) and multiplexers composed of Gate diffusion input (GDI) which gained designer's choice for digital combinational circuit realization at minimum power consumption. The design is simulated using Cadence virtuoso with 20nm technology. Comparative performance analysis is carried out in contrast to the other standard circuits by taking the critical performance metrics such as delay, power, and power delay product (PDP), energy-delay product (EDP) metrics into consideration.</jats:p>",

We examined the response of plants grown in Stout and Arnon culture solution to different periods of flooding at different salinities and verified our results with plants grown in other culture solutions (Hoagland and Yoshida).

CCPP can be calculated by different standards, but none of these consider all of the conditions in drinking water systems where temperatures can reach 100 °C and the water exchanges CO2 with the atmosphere. We provided and demonstrated a procedure for CCPP calculations using the open-source software PHREEQC with the phreeqc.dat database at temperatures relevant for drinking water systems (10–90 °C) and for open systems in equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. CCPP increased by 0.17–1.51 mmol/kg when the temperature was increased from 10 °C to 90 °C and increased by 0.22–2.82 mmol/kg when going from closed to open systems at 10 °C. Thus, CaCO3 precipitation may be underestimated if CCPP is only considered for the lower sample temperature and for closed systems. On the other hand, CCPP10 decreased by 0.006–0.173 mmol/kg when including the ionic species from the German DIN 38404-10 standard in addition to calcium, alkalinity and pH, indicating that all relevant ionic species should be included in CCPP calculations. CCPP values should always be reported with the calculation procedure and temperature to avoid inconsistency in literature.</jats:p>"

This supply chain system assumes information symmetry which implies that all partners share their operational information. First, a mathematical model for the supply chain system total cost is formulated under the integer multipliers coordination mechanism. Then, a recursive algebraic algorithm to derive the optimal inventory replenishment decisions is developed. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using two different numerical examples. Results from the numerical examples indicate that adopting the integer multiplier mechanism will reduce the overall total system cost as compared to using the common cycle time mechanism.</jats:p>"

We demonstrate the importance of bed surface evolution on grain entrainment and hence channel stability. The grain‐size distribution (GSD) of the bed surface coarsened quickly under no feed conditions to develop an armored surface. Armor continued to experience particle exchange but remained intact throughout the experiment, and was relatively insensitive to subsequent sediment supply pulses. Bed surface structures (coarse‐grain clusters, stone cells, and imbrication) developed during the experiments and continued to respond dynamically to sediment pulses. Thresholds of motion estimated by various methods increased during the experiment and fluctuated in response to changes in sediment supply, though they were poorly predicted either by surface grain‐size changes or by surface structure. This reinforces the idea that the threshold for motion is not constant in poorly sorted gravel‐bed streams, and it confirms that the critical Shields number in transport models represents a bed state parameter, not a grain mobility number. Changes are controlled by a variety of factors including sediment supply regime, the degree of bed structuring, and the history of bed evolution. Our results highlight the importance of sediment supply regime as a control on bed surface evolution and the channel stabilizing function played by surface structures.</jats:p>",

The characteristics of change revealed the temporal and spatial variation characteristics and related factors of the runoff generation mechanism in the basin. The results showed that the Gushanchuan Basin is still dominated by HOF runoff, but the runoff generation mechanism has also changed with changes in the underlying surface, which are reflected in increased runoff components, the reduced proportion of HOF runoff, and the increased proportion of saturation-excess overland flow (SOF) runoff and mixed runoff. We analyzed the variation law of underlying surface in the basin, which indicated that the increase in the forest grass area was the main factor affecting changes in the watershed runoff generation mechanism. This research will enable a deeper understanding of the runoff generation mechanism of the main soil erosion areas in the Loess Plateau, and reveal variations in the runoff generation mechanism in the Yellow River.</jats:p>",

In the indirect evaluation, with the initial parameters and the length of the forced impulse, the current line, acceleration and pressure sensor courses were used. Apart from the volumetric flow rate, the analysed parameters were the time periods of the injector opening and closing process. Those time segments were composed of response time and opening/closing time, the sum of which gives time of full opening. Functional relationships describing the volumetric flow rate, time of full opening and closing are presented, which are helpful not only in comparative tests of different injectors, but also in modelling the operation of gas injector or algorithms of gas supply control system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mutual shifts in offline and online demand have become the norm in supply chain operations. The online-to-offline (O2O) supply chain system consists of a platform vendor, a physical store, and a product. The platform vendor sells the product directly online and governs either the centralized decision-making of a self-operated store or the decentralized decision-making of a franchised store offline. In this study, supply chain decision models with and without demand shifts are constructed to obtain optimal wholesale and selling prices and to maximize profit. The coordination mechanism under decentralized decision-making is designed to optimize the O2O supply chain, and the validity and applicability of the model are verified by numerical simulation. Results show that, regardless of whether a store is self-operated or franchised, the total profit of the system increases, and online and offline prices depend on a range of demand shifts. With an increased proportion of online demand shifts, the offline selling price and total profit of the system increase, whereas the online selling price and profit of the platform vendor decrease under decentralized decision-making. When the fixed transfer payment fee is within a certain range, a two-part-tariff contract can effectively coordinate the supply chain. This study not only contributes to the theoretical literature on O2O supply chain systems but also provides practical decision-making support for managers.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose a fault risk warning method for a distribution system based on an improved RelieF-Softmax algorithm. Firstly, four categories including 24 fault features of the distribution system are determined through data investigation and preprocessing. Considering the frequency of distribution system faults, and then their consequences, the risk classification method of the distribution system is presented. Secondly, the K-maxmin clustering algorithm is introduced to improve the random sampling process, and then an improved RelieF feature extraction method is proposed to determine the optimal feature subset with the strongest correlation and minimum redundancy. Finally, the loss function of Softmax is improved to cope with the influence of sample imbalance on the prediction accuracy. The optimal feature subset and Softmax classifier are applied to forewarn the fault risk in the distribution system. The 191-feeder power distribution system in south China is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

The methods of linear algebra, numerical optimization methods, methods of modeling and analysis of established and transient modes are used. Results. The mathematical model of the salient pole rotor and non-salient or cylindrical pole rotor synchronous motor is presented, which is presented in the form of a alternate scheme, which allows to take into account the effect of displacement of current and saturation of the non-salient pole rotor motor's magnetic core. A method for determining the parameters of the synchronous motor based on passport data is proposed, which allows to improve the accuracy of modeling in steady state and transient modes. The mathematical model is reduced to a three-phase coordinate system a, b, c of the stator winding. The rotor windings are modeled in the coordinates d, q. The results of mathematical modeling allow us to determine the magnitude of the shock currents and mechanical moments of the synchronous motor. It is shown that non-synchronous switching on of the synchronous motor, which occurs in case of automatic transfer switch, can lead to engine damage. Shock currents can also be dangerous to other power supply equipment. Thus, synchronous motors, if transfer switch is used, require synchronization before being connected to the network. Scientific novelty. The mathematical model of the synchronous motor was improved taking into account the displacement of current and saturation of the magnetic conduit, the method of determining the parameters of the mathematical model based on the passport data of the engine was improved, which allowed to increase the accuracy of the simulation and the reliability of the simulation results. The modes of power transfer switch are simulated and the values of shock current and shock mechanical moment of the engine are obtained. Practical meaning. The mathematical model of the synchronous motor allows to analyze the behavior of synchronous motors in interaction in the power supply system and to identify the dangerous states of synchronous motors that may occur during the transfer switching. The proposed model improves the accuracy of determination of the limits of dangerous states and improves the reliability of synchronous motors and power supply systems</jats:p>",

Understanding patterns of uptake of behaviors among the poorest under ideal experimental conditions, such as those of an efficacy trial, can help identify strategies that could be strengthened in routine programmatic conditions for more equitable uptake. WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a randomized controlled efficacy trial that provided free-of cost WASH hardware along with behavior change promotion. The current paper aimed to determine the impact of the removal of supply and demand constraints on the uptake of handwashing and sanitation behaviors across wealth and education levels.<jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> The current analysis selected 4 indicators from the WASH Benefits trial— presence of water and soap in household handwashing stations, observed mother’s hand cleanliness, observed visible feces on latrine slab or floor and reported last child defecation in potty or toilet. A baseline assessment was conducted immediately after enrolment and endline assessment was conducted approximately 2 years later. We compared change in uptake of these indicators including wealth quintiles (Q) between intervention and control groups from baseline to endline.<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For hand cleanliness, the poorest mothers improved more [Q1 difference in difference, DID: 16% (7, 25%)] than the wealthiest mothers [Q5 DID: 7% (-4, 17%)]. The poorest households had largest improvements for observed presence of water and soap in handwashing station [Q1 DID: 82% (75, 90%)] compared to the wealthiest households [Q5 DID: 39% (30, 50%)]. Similarly, poorer household demonstrated greater reductions in visible feces on latrine slab or floor [Q1DID, -25% (-35, -15) Q2: -34% (-44, -23%)] than the wealthiest household [Q5 DID: -1% (-11, 8%). For reported last child defecation in potty or toilet, the poorest mothers showed greater improvement [Q1-4 DID: 50-54% (44, 60%)] than the wealthier mothers [Q5 DID: 39% (31, 46%). <jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold>By simultaneously addressing supply and demand-constraints among the poorest, we observed substantial overall improvements in equity. Within scaled-up programs, a separate targeted strategy that relaxes constraints for the poorest can improve the equity of a program. <jats:bold>Trial registration:</jats:bold> WASH Benefits Bangladesh: ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT01590095.

Only in a small part of the sinusoidal voltage, namely in the zone of reaching the amplitude value, a barrier discharge occurs with the generation of ozone. Therefore, the efficiency ozone generators at sinusoidal voltage do not exceed 2%. When powered by a pulsed voltage, ozone generation occurs almost during the application of the entire voltage pulse; in addition, ozone generation also occurs in the pause between pulses, due to oscillatory processes in the pause between pulses. In addition to a significant increase in ozone yield, there is practically no process of heating the dielectric barrier.</jats:p>",

Building on Albert Hirschman’s model of exit, voice, and loyalty, this article contributes to the literature by pointing to street-level bureaucrats’ exercise of discretion as influencing citizens’ dissatisfaction with policy implementation. We identify three main elements—personal, organizational, and environmental—influencing discretion informally, causing clients’ dissatisfaction. We also point to a combination of three conditions triggering the creation of an alternative supply of services: (1) citizens’ dissatisfaction with policy implementation; (2) street-level bureaucrats’ monopoly over policy implementation because only one supplier exists; and (3) clients’ perceptions of participation channels as blocked. Using a qualitative case study approach, we test our claims by analyzing the case of Israeli marriage registrars. We demonstrate how Israeli citizens’ dissatisfaction with how government bureaucrats implement marriage regulations led to the creation of the Tzohar non-governmental organization that provides alternative marriage services. </jats:p><jats:p> Points for practitioners </jats:p><jats:p> In situations in which street-level bureaucrats have a monopoly over policy implementation and citizens feel they cannot exercise their voice about that implementation, their dissatisfaction with how street-level bureaucrats use their discretion in implementing the policy may eventually lead to the creation of alternative sources of public services. </jats:p>",

However, each year more than 2 million people from low-income countries are unable to access modern radiotherapy technologies [1]. Thus, the urgent task in the field of radiation oncology is to increase the availability, quality and efficiency of radiotherapy, monitoring the level of technical, methodological and human resourcing of radiation therapy in Ukraine in accordance with trends in Europe and the world. The actual task of the study is to review and analyze the existing level, availability and effectiveness of applying the modern technologies of radiation therapy in the regions of Ukraine.&#x0D;\nPurpose – analyzing the current state and level of availability of radiotherapy in Ukraine, seeking for opportunities to expand applying it.&#x0D;\nMaterials and methods. Analyzing and comparing statistical data of the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine and the information of IARC GLOBOCAN, IAEA DIRAC Database, summarizing the results.&#x0D;\nResults. The level of technical and technological equipment as well as staffing of oncology centers of Ukraine has been analyzed, along with assessing quantitative and qualitative components of radiotherapy care in comparison with the average European indicators. The assessment of the state of radiotherapy care in Ukraine was carried out with due regard for the increasing number of patients.&#x0D;\nConclusions. According to the WHO, the structure of cancer incidence in Ukraine is similar to the European one, however higher specific mortality rate indicates, first of all, the insufficient level of covering the population of Ukraine by specialized diagnosis and oncological care, its low efficiency and engineering backwardness. It has been determined that radiation therapy in Ukraine is needed annually by at least 90 thousand cancer patients. In fact, only about 44 thousand of them are provided with tele-radiation therapy. First of all, this is due to extremely insufficient radiotherapy equipment available in Ukraine and using outdated radiation treatment technologies in gamma-ray teletherapy that result in its low quality and aggravating the clinical consequences. Given the growing number of cancer patients in 2022, Ukraine will need about 160 machines for tele-radiotherapy. The rise and adjusting the clinical and technical capabilities of regional oncology centers in terms of quality and efficiency of radiation therapy is possible under the conditions of their rapid technical.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we first investigate the performance of the current LAES (termed as a baseline LAES) over a far wider range of charging pressure (1 to 21 MPa). Our analyses show that the baseline LAES could achieve an electrical round trip efficiency (eRTE) above 60% at a high charging pressure of 19 MPa. The baseline LAES, however, produces a large amount of excess heat particularly at low charging pressures with the maximum occurred at ∼1 MPa. Hence, the performance of the baseline LAES, especially at low charging pressures, is underestimated by only considering electrical energy in all the previous research. The performance of the baseline LAES with excess heat is then evaluated which gives a high eRTE even at lower charging pressures; the local maximum of 62% is achieved at ∼4 MPa. As a result of the above, a hybrid LAES system is proposed to provide cooling, heating, hot water and power. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid LAES system, three performance indicators are considered: nominal-electrical round trip efficiency (neRTE), primary energy savings and avoided carbon dioxide emissions. Our results show that the hybrid LAES can achieve a high neRTE between 52% and 76%, with the maximum at ∼5 MPa. For a given size of hybrid LAES (1 MW×8 h), the primary energy savings and avoided carbon dioxide emissions are up to 12.1 MWh and 2.3 ton, respectively. These new findings suggest, for the first time, that small-scale LAES systems could be best operated at lower charging pressures and the technologies have a great potential for applications in local decentralized micro energy networks.</jats:p>",

By using the newly developed RTCDM (refined Total Chloramine Decay Model) and pipe section reactor, the role of four typical pipes in disinfection chemistry was qualitatively and quantitatively compared, and the mechanism of pipe wall mediated chloramine decay was further described. As for the four typical pipes studied, the characteristics of deteriorating water quality, especially for accelerating total chloramine decay was in the order of cast iron pipe &amp;gt; steel pipe &amp;gt; cement lined ductile iron pipe &amp;gt; polypropylene-random pipe. Cast iron pipes, cement-lined ductile iron pipes, and steel pipes of long service age are characterized by one or two driving forces leading to TCR decay. Aged cast iron pipes could take up chloramine by Fe(0) and microbes (especially nitrifiers) spreading over the inner wall. Aged steel pipe is characterized by aggressive electrochemical corrosion and weak nitrification. Lime and gypsum leaching is the main cause, and nitrification/denitrification may also occur in aged cement-lined ductile iron pipe. Polypropylene-random pipes have a minimum effect on disinfection chemistry. This knowledge is of value in speculating the reasons leading to TCR loss in the full scale distribution system.</jats:p>",

This paper is devoted to the analyzes of the dynamics of environmental indicators of the regional logistics system taking as an example the economic region \"Polissya\". On this basis, modern environmental problems of the district's logistics system have been identified. An analysis of the development of world markets for \"green\" bonds, \"green\" loans and sustainable investment assets is made. Peculiarities and characteristic features of \"green\" financing instruments for the development of logistics systems of different levels are considered. As a result of the research it is established that in the Ukrainian realities it is expedient to apply the advanced international experience of realization of the \"green\" financing of infrastructure projects mechanism in economic areas. This will successfully transform regional logistics systems in the context of the green economy and achieve sustainable development of transport infrastructure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Assuming the two retailers decide whether to acquire information to segment consumers and price them differently, we investigate the problem of information acquisition and third-degree price discrimination in the supply chain composed of one common manufacturer and duopoly retailers. We explore how the supply chain members’ pricing decisions are affected by the fraction of high price-sensitivity consumers and the consumers’ difference in price sensitivity. Analytical results show that the manufacturer’s wholesale price increases with the fraction of high price-sensitivity consumers and decreases with the consumers’ difference in price sensitivity. Moreover, if a retailer chooses to acquire information and price discriminate, the retail prices for two types of consumers increase with the fraction of high price-sensitivity consumers. However, the retail price for consumers with high (low) price sensitivity decreases (increases) with the consumers’ difference in terms of price sensitivity. By comparing the results among different information acquisition and price discrimination decisions, we find that there exist two possible equilibrium decisions for both retailers: both retailers acquire information and price discriminate and no retailer acquires information and each charges a uniform price for all consumers. The strategy which dominates depends on the fraction of high price-sensitivity consumers and the consumers’ difference in price sensitivity. However, compared with no retailer acquiring information, the manufacturer is better off when two retailers acquire information. Consequently, the manufacturer designs a fixed fee contract to stimulate retailers to price discriminate and to achieve a win-win situation for them finally.</jats:p>",

The interactions of these precursors are vital to elucidate the formation of halogenated DBPs during chloramination. This work investigated the formation of total organic halogen and select individual DBPs in two laboratory-chloraminated source waters containing iopamidol and bromide. Experiments were carried out in batch reactors containing Barberton source water (BSW) and Cleveland BSW (CSW), spiked with iopamidol (5 μM), bromide (15 μM), and 100 μM monochloramine. Total organic iodine concentrations were approximately equal regardless of source water since they are mostly unreacted iopamidol and iopamidol DBPs. Almost equal amounts of total organic chlorine (3–4 nM) were produced in the source waters, but higher quantities of total organic bromine were formed in BSW than CSW. Substantial quantities of regulated trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) were formed in the source waters, along with appreciable concentrations of iodinated trihalomethanes (CHBrClI, CHCl2I, and CHBr2I). Low concentrations of iodo-HAAs were detected, especially at low pH. Overall, bromide concentrations appeared to suppress iodo-DBP formation during chloramination of iopamidol in the presence of natural organic matter. A good correlation (R2 = 0.801) between the yields of regulated DBPs and iodo-DBPs was observed.</jats:p>",

The main methods of energy resources management (creating a system of rational consumption and saving of energy resources, using energy-efficient materials, equipment and technologies, identifying the potential of energy-saving measures at operating facilities) have been determined. The priority directions for reducing the production energy intensity in the water supply processes have been defined. An algorithm is proposed that includes the processes of collecting, modeling, structuring information, as well as developing an optimal solution for an enterprise. A model for optimizing work in water supply processes is presented, software products are considered that allow to control the processes of energy saving and energy efficiency. The most promising software products for their introducing them into practice of the enterprise have been identified, including General Electric Intelligent Platforms CSense. A plan for the sequential implementation of the software product into operation at the enterprise is presented. The dynamics of electricity consumption at the enterprise, the structure of energy consumption are illustrated. It is noted that the most significant contribution to the amount of energy consumption is made by the technological processes of water intake and supply. It has been substantiated that the most energy-consuming process for the enterprise (Water Supply Branch of the State Unitary Enterprise St. Petersburg Vodokanal) is replacement or maintenance of pumping equipment. The components of energy conservation of the enterprise under study are the partial regulation and automation of processes.</jats:p>",

Besides basic hydrographic and biogeochemical parameters, the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC), a critical index of the strength of the oceanic biological pump, was also measured at several locations within two CEs and one WE using floating sediment traps deployed below the euphotic zone. The POC flux associated with the CEs (85 ± 55 mg-C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) was significantly higher than that associated with the WE (20 ± 7 mg-C m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). This was related to differences in the density structure of the water column between the two types of eddies. Within the core of the WE, downwelling created intense stratification which hindered the upward mixing of nutrients and favored the growth of small phytoplankton species. Near the periphery of the WE, nutrient replenishment from below did take place, but only to a limited extent. By far the strongest upwelling was associated with the CEs, bringing nutrients into the lower portion (∼50 m) of the euphotic zone and fueling the growth of larger-cell phytoplankton such as centric diatoms (e.g., <jats:italic>Chaetoceros</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Coscinodiscus</jats:italic>) and dinoflagellates (e.g., <jats:italic>Ceratium</jats:italic>).

Currently, PT XYZ does not have supply chain risk management to identify and mitigate the risks that occur within the company. Therefore, this study aims to identify risks, determine priority risks and provide priority risk mitigation strategies that occur in the supply chain at PT XYZ. The method used is Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR), Fuzzy Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (Fuzzy FMEA) and Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The results of the study found 29 risk events and 4 priority risk events. Based on 4 prioritized risk events, the criteria which have the highest weight are the lack of the process of checking the raw material to be produced have a weight value 0.650 with the mitigation strategy carried out on the criteria is the lack of the process of checking raw materials to be produced is to adjust the demand documents and raw materials available. For the supplier performance criteria is not good to have a weight value 0.265 with the mitigation strategy carried out is conducting direct inspection to supplier company. The criteria for lack of coordination between companies and suppliers have a weight value 0.085 with the mitigation strategy carried out is to coordinate with suppliers. The lowest weighting criteria is the absence of project demand / tonnage forecasting processes with weights 0,000 and mitigation strategies carried out is to carry out project demand / tonnage forecasting processes.</jats:p>",

Given an opportunity to find solutions to pre-existing issues in the city, the government was keen to rebuild faster and better. The blueprint that was finalised mid-2012, had 17 anchor projects to lead its rebuilding efforts along with governance and legislative changes to facilitate rebuilding. Drawing on past literature using the case study of Canterbury earthquakes 2010-2011, this paper first reviews the rebuilding process in Christchurch. 14 face to face interviews were held with those involved in and subjected to these governance and structural changes. The study suggests the complex post-disaster environment limit the effectiveness of the imposed changes. Rebuilding efforts were hindered by the absence of a proper legislative framework, the ambiguity in defining roles and responsibilities of recovery agents, the time-pressure to rebuild resulting in hasty planning, limited public involvement in rebuilding and the lack of strategic relevance to ensure the outcomes are accepted by the public and fit with the city’s image in the long run. It is recommended that future research focuses on implications of post-disaster rebuilding practices on the wider community, businesses, and the government.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Carbon tax policy has been shown to be an effective incentive for the reduction of carbon emissions, and it also profoundly influences supply chain cooperation. This paper explores the interaction between carbon taxes and green supply chain cooperation. Specifically, we analyze the impact of a carbon tax on green supply chain coordination and further optimize the carbon tax to achieve a win-win situation for both the supply chain and the environment. Because consumer’s behavior has a significant impact on green product demand, we consider the problems above under two types of consumer’s behavior characteristics: consumer’s environmental awareness and consumer’s reference behavior. A game-theoretic model is employed to describe a green supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer, combining important factors such as the carbon tax rate, green investment coefficient, and degree of reference effect. Then, we obtain the optimal carbon tax rate by balancing the total tax revenue and product greenness. A revenue-sharing contract is introduced to achieve green supply chain coordination, and the impact of the carbon tax on coordination is analyzed. The results show the following. (1) The carbon tax rate and the difference between the power of the manufacturer and retailer are the main factors determining green supply chain coordination. (2) Maximum greenness can be achieved when development costs are higher, while the maximum tax revenue is obtained when the development cost is lower, but with the loss of greenness. (3) If the power of the manufacturer is low, coordination can be achieved under the optimal carbon tax. If the power of the manufacturer is at a medium level, coordination can be achieved by increasing the carbon tax; as a result, increased greenness will be realized, but with the loss of tax revenue. However, when the power of the manufacturer is strong, coordination cannot be achieved. (4) Price reference behavior can promote supply chain coordination, but consumer’s environmental awareness cannot.</jats:p>",

The surface water environment monitoring module can receive and display the surface water environment parameter information in real time, and has the functions of data comparison analysis and historical data search, and the eutrophication assessment and water bloom prediction and warning module can analyze the eutrophication status of water bodies in real time and provide short-term and medium-term warnings for water blooms.

An early lung adenocarcinoma model was established in 10 female mice with subcutaneous injections of a 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine solution. Micro-CT pulmonary and bronchial arteriography were performed to demonstrate the blood supply of early lung adenocarcinomas, especially the tumor–vessel relationships, and the findings were correlated with the pathology results. The quantitative and texture changes in the tumor-supplying vessels were analyzed. Micro-CT showed that the pulmonary artery was densely distributed in and around tumors in 141 (84%) of 167 early lung adenocarcinomas, the bronchial artery was not related to tumors, and there were four patterns of tumor–pulmonary artery relationships that correlated well with pathologic findings. Quantitative and texture analyses showed that the tumor size had positive correlations with vessel volume (VV), VV fraction (VVF), vessel thickness (VT), vessel number (VN), inverse difference moment, long run emphasis, gray level nonuniformity (GLN), and run length nonuniformity (RLN) and negative correlations with vessel separation (VS), inertia, and short run emphasis (SRE); the size of the solid component had positive correlations with VV, VVF, VT, VN, GLN, and RLN and negative correlations with VS, cluster shade, and SRE. This study concluded that early lung adenocarcinomas are mainly supplied by the pulmonary arteries in mice, and micro-CT angiography can clearly demonstrate the morphologic changes of pulmonary arteries and their relationships with tumors.</jats:p>",

The task is to determine the thickness of the thermal insulation of the pipeline and the size of its depth based on the analysis of the temperature field in the ground during long-term cycle. The temperature field in the \"insulated pipe-ground\" system, which changes over time, is proposed to be determined by solving the heat conduction equations in polar coordinates. In this case, a bundle of pipes is considered as one pipe of equivalent radius. This approach allows to simplify the interface conditions of the pipe, thermal insulation, polyethylene shell and the host soil, as well as to use a simple numerical method for solving the equation – the finite difference method. The results of calculations of the maximum depth of soil thawing from the depth of the heat supply pipe at different thicknesses of thermal insulation are presented. It is proposed to determine the optimal depth of the underground heat supply pipeline from the condition of annual establishment of the zero isotherm of the host soil at the level of the boundary of the active soil layer by the beginning of the heating season. The possibility of finding a zero isotherm at this level is illustrated by calculations of isotherms by the beginning of the heating season (September) at various depths and thicknesses of thermal insulation. Based on the results of calculations the method of estimation the insulation thickness and depth of the pipeline from the condition of minimizing the functional that characterizes the measure of deviation of the ordinates of the zero isotherm on the left-hand boundary of the region from the depth of the active soil layer at the beginning of the heating season.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays, due to environmental issues, government rules and economic interests have increased attention to the collection and recovery of products, which has led to the formation of new concepts such as reverse and closed-loop supply chains. The implementation of the closed-loop supply chain as a solution to sustainable development is expanding from one hand and increasing the profitability of companies on the other. For this purpose, a mathematical model was developed to design an integrated closed-loop supply chain network, which is a combination of two-problem localization problems and flow optimization. The proposed model was designed to minimize network costs and to maximize the level of responsiveness to customers. The cost parameters of establishing centers in this model are uncertain; to overcome the model’s uncertainties, stochastic programming is used. In the mathematical model, supplier, manufacturer, distributor and customer in the direct supply chain and collection/rehabilitation, destruction, recycling centers and, second-type distribution center for sale of second-hand products as well as second-hand products customers in the reverse flow are considered, to be closer to the real today world. This model is multi-periodic mix integer nonlinear programming where the shortage has allowed. To motivate and encourage customers to buy more, in addition to getting closer to the real world and it happens more in practice, is considered all units of discount for transportation cost in the forward flow. To solve this model Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) is using. The parameter tuning was done using the Taguchi method. Then, the important criteria for measurement and comparison of performance algorithms have used, including the Mean Ideal Distance, Diversification Metric, Number of Pareto-optimal Solutions, and the Quality Metric. Results of the Comparative metrics show that NSGA-II outperforms MOPSO in almost all cases in achieving the best trade-off solutions. </jats:p>",

In this study, we analyzed retrospective data on the current and future supply of red blood cell concentrates (RBC) in this region and compared it to the current and future RBC demand in SL hospitals. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The projection of the SL blood supply in 2030 was modeled based on SL demographics for age distribution and donation frequency of donors, and the RBC transfusion data for in-house patients. These results were compared to published data on the transfusion demand from the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (MV). &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For the period January 1 to December 31, 2017, a total of 43,205 whole blood donations were collected. The donation frequency in SL never exceeded 80 per 1,000 inhabitants and was well below the numbers in MV. Thirty-one percent of the donors were responsible for 53.5% of the donations, and donors older than 45 years of age contributed highly to the total blood supply. In addition, 40,614 RBC transfusions at 10 SL hospitals were analyzed representing nearly all RBC transfusions for in-house patients in this region. RBC transfusions per 1,000 inhabitants increased with age from 24 (50–54) to 140 (80–84) years. Facing an already existing structural deficit of nearly 8,200 RBC in 2017, the projection predicts a dramatic increase in the regional deficit to &amp;#x3e;18,300 RBC in 2030. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Our results on RBC demand in SL are comparable but not identical to those projected for the region of MV in eastern Germany. Due to the ongoing demographic changes in Germany as a whole, regular regional monitoring of RBC demand and the age structure of blood recipients and donors should be implemented to allow for better strategic planning in blood transfusion services and hospitals. </jats:p>"

The Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) and other participants of the federal project ‘Clean Water’ assigned the task of providing 90.8% of the Russian population Federation with high-quality drinking water from centralized water supply systems until 2024. Currently, Rospotrebnadzor has switched to a new model of risk-based control and supervision, which determined the study’s purpose: to evaluate the effectiveness and economic efficiency of the new model of the service in the field of centralized drinking water supply. At present, Rospotrebnadzor has switched to a new model of risk-based control and supervision. The purpose of the study. To evaluate the results and cost-effectiveness of the new model of the service in the field of centralized drinking water supply. Material and methods. The study used indices of the control and supervisory activity of Rospotrebnadzor, indicators of drinking water quality of centralized water supply systems, data on morbidity and mortality of the population of the Russian Federation for 2014-2019. The results were estimated by the proportion of samples of drinking water from centralized water supply systems with excess hygienic standards prevented by the actions of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare, as well as controlled cases of morbidity and mortality. The economic efficiency assessment was based on a comparison of the costs of implementing the activities of Rospotrebnadzor and financial losses prevention as a result of a decrease in morbidity and mortality Results. An assessment of the results of the Rospotrebnadzor activity showed the occurrence of more than 36.75% of samples in 2019 that did not meet sanitary requirements for sanitary and chemical indices was prevented (1.8-2.0 times more than in 2014-2015), and 1.51% for microbiological (1.6 times more than in 2014). As a result of the activities of the Rospotrebnadzor, 249 deaths and 185,097 thousand cases of diseases of the population associated with the quality of drinking water were more prevented if compared with the pre-reform period. The economic efficiency of the service’s activities to improve the quality of drinking water of centralized water supply systems increased by 28.8% and amounted to 67.7 rubles in 2019. Conclusions. The introduction of a risk-based model in the control-supervision activities of Rospotrebnadzor led to a decrease in the likelihood of violations of sanitary requirements for the drinking water quality from centralized water supply systems and an increase in the number of prevented deaths and diseases of the population associated with the quality of drinking water. The economic efficiency of the service to improve the quality of drinking water from centralized water supply systems has increased.</jats:p>",

This value creation occurs along the fisheries supply chain, including fishermen, shippers, fish processing units, and industry. To assess the innovation maturity, the FHP machine was assessed with the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Innovation Readiness Level (IRL). The TLR was carried out by TRL-Meter and IRL was carried out by IRL-Meter. The data was collected by interviews and questionnaires with related stakeholders. The data assessed that the machine met the requirement for TRL level 9 and IRL Level 3. The recommendation for TRL 9 and IRL 3 has been conducted through a strategic partnership with a related state-owned enterprise. Because the FHP shows product competitiveness, gives value-added, and generates value creation in the fisheries supply chain, it could be a role model for the development of the FHP cluster in another location. However, the involvement of local and central governments still needs to be improved significantly. Furthermore, the government should build a conducive ecosystem for technology-based innovation in the country.</jats:p>",

For this, we developed a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive study, in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, located in the northeastern semiarid region, during the regional assessments done by the Collaborating Center for the School Feeding Program in 2018 and 2019. We analyzed the policy from the perspective of the social actors inserted at the ends of the supply and demand chain through the application of questionnaires and focus groups. There were 188 social actors from 45 municipalities taking part in our data gathering. We examined the meeting of supply and demand based on the performance of the policy in the state, and identified that: i) the percentage of purchases between 2011 and 2017 was, on average, 19.1%, demonstrating that, despite not meeting the recommended rate, the state has progressed its investments in this segment; ii) some limitations characterized the limited effectiveness of public purchases of family farming for schools: lack of federal actions to enhance the value of family farming, unfavorable conditions for local agricultural production, low performance of technical rural assistance, menus do not reflect the offer of family farming, difficulties in preparing and executing the public call and insufficient communication between social actors; iii) Action and decision-making, through street-level bureaucracy, depends on the discretion of the social actors. We believe that this study can collaborate in the understanding of structural problems that affect the implementation of the program and assist in the search for alternatives that are consistent with the current needs, aiming at the construction of sustainable food systems.</p>"

Fresh water, which includes rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds, contributes less than one thousandth of a percent of the total water on Earth, but it is critical for the environment and human life. Change in land use and land cover (LULC) is a foremost concern in global environment change. Rapid changes in LULC lead to the degradation of ecosystems and have adverse effects on the environment. There is an urgent need to monitor changes in LULC and evaluate the effects of these changes in order to inform decision makers on how to support sustainable development. This study used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometry images to detect and investigate changes in LULC patterns in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, between 2008 and 2017. Six types of LULC were used to explain the major changes of LULC in the study area. The results showed that there was a reduction of barren lands and an increase of urban areas. It also showed an inconsistent behavior of water bodies during the study. Snow area, which also increased, needs further investigation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we analyse the heterogeneity of water supply infrastructure in Accra, Ghana, to understand the politics of water in cities where infrastructural diversity has always been the norm. We do this by extending the use of heterogeneous infrastructure configurations as a heuristic device, shifting the focus and scale of urban political ecological analyses of infrastructural diversity from users and access to water distributions at city scale. To explain the impacts of three experiments in the distribution of water across the city, we analyse how changes in the technical and operational arrangements of Accra’s bulk water filling points reflect changes in the social relations of cooperation or conflict between the diversity of actors and infrastructure supplying water across the city. We find the uneven waterscape of the city is shaped by a plurality of actors whose practices are informed by a range of motives. These motives exceed profit-making, political legitimacy, patronage and petty corruption including also solidarity, religious beliefs and pragmatic choices. We show that distributions of water, risks and responsibilities among different actors involved in operating the water filling points are constantly contested with ambiguous and unforeseen outcomes foreclosing but also opening new possibilities for progressive experimentation. Documenting how relations between actors and technologies of water provisioning are dynamic, and open to incremental improvements towards progressive (re)distributions of water, our analysis at the city scale calls for further focus on how practices and policies of solidarity can be extended across heterogeneous provisioning systems. </jats:p>",

The presence or absence of those factors impacts organisations' ability to gain a competitive advantage over their rivals. As a risk-prone business sector, construction organisations need to identify those determinants that could ensure their superior performance. To date, global studies have identified many determinants that govern the performance of construction organisations. However, few of these are known in New Zealand, and their weightings could be useful in forming business strategies. Therefore, this paper measures the significance of identified determinants of construction organisational performance. A total of 100 professionals participated in a questionnaire survey administered using a snowball sampling technique. The Relative Importance Index approach was used to rank the determinants according to their importance to organisational performance. Five main determinants were significant and ranked highly, with more than 80% relative importance index scores. These determinants are resources and capabilities, competitive strategies, organisational characteristics, environmental factors, and customers relationship management. This finding provides a useful benchmark for future research on the significance of some determinants that could explain the performance differentials experienced in the construction domain in New Zealand</jats:p>"

The adaptation mechanism was discussed through the analysis of the process of passive response, adaptation and even active adjustment of water resources system under changing environment. The adaptability of the water resources system can be described as natural resilience (NR) of natural system and artificial adaptation (AA) social (artificial) system. The natural resilience indexes were identified and analyzed from the aspects of water quantity, water quality and water ecology. The artificial adaptation indexes were identified and analyzed from the aspects of resource, eco-environment, socio-economic and technical factors. On this basis, the index system was constructed in accord with process mechanism of water resources system adaptability. Besides, to address the two-dimension factors of water resources system adaptability, a method of system analysis based on connection numbers–fuzzy risk matrix was proposed based on the theory of risk matrix. The synthesis interval [Apess, Aopt] of water resources system adaptability is obtained, by defining the pessimistic criterion when two-dimension factors meet the evaluation standard at the same time, and the optimistic criterion when either of the two-dimension factors meets evaluation standard. Finally, the case study in the Huaihe River basin in China was carried out. The results show that the adaptability level of water resources system in the Huaihe River basin expressed fluctuating uprising tendency in 2006–2015. The adaptability level is the lowest [1.856, 2.625] in 2009, the highest [2.500, 3.536] in 2015.</jats:p>",

This study investigated the kinetics of biomass growth and biodegradation of benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) by Arthrobacter sp. in a surfactant-aided batch system. The effect of different surfactants on aqueous solubility of BBP and DBP was initially examined, which showed that Tween 80 resulted in maximum bioavailability and biodegradation efficiency of the phthalates by the bacterium and without inhibiting the biomass growth. Compared with BBP, DBP was found to be efficiently degraded and supported the bacterial growth within a short period of time over the entire concentration tested in the range 100–1,000 mg L−1. A maximum biomass concentration of 1.819 g L−1 was obtained at 120 h for a DBP concentration of 600 mg L−1 in the presence of Tween 80, which is 5.66-fold increase in biomass concentration as compared with only DBP as the sole substrate. For evaluating the biokinetic parameters involved in DBP biodegradation, the experimental data on DBP utilization were fitted to various kinetic models as reported in the literature.</jats:p>",

The MODSIM-DSS was established by dividing the basin into 14 subbasins, and the irrigation facilities of agricultural reservoirs, pumping stations, diversions, culverts and groundwater wells were grouped within each subbasin, and networked between subbasins including municipal and industrial water supplies. The SWAT was calibrated and validated using 11 years (2005-2015) daily streamflow data of two dams (DCD and YDD) and 4 years (August 2012 to December 2015) data of three weirs (SJW, GJW, and BJW) considering water withdrawals and return flows from agricultural, municipal, and industrial water uses. The Nash−Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of two dam and three weirs inflows were 0.55∼0.70 and 0.57∼0.77 respectively. Through MODSIM-DSS run for 34 years from 1982 to 2015, the agricultural water shortage had occurred during the drought years of 1982, 1988, 1994, 2001 and 2015.

We used the following methods: theoretical, logical, scientific and practical analysis; systematization and interpretation of research results. In accordance with the laws of the acmeological theory of fundamental education, the theory of functional systems and the acme-synergetic and socio-synergetic concept of the development of social systems, we made an attempt to identify different types of models of productive professional competencies of a teacher and to identify their characteristics, taking into account a single quality criterion for education in the system of professional education at different levels. Based on the results of the study we 1) theoretically substantiated and determined the features of acmemodeling as a method of developing teacher productivity in professional and educational activities, 2) identified and gave characteristics of invariant idealized models in the activities of a teacher, 3) clarified functional elements of the educational system activity and highlighted the interrelated structural elements for all invariant idealized models of productivity.</jats:p>",

There is a synthesis of the structure of the control system and the control algorithm based on the analysis of processes in electrical circuits using computer modeling to substantiate the system parameters and check the proposed solutions. The possibility of ensuring the normal functioning of a local object for a possible violation of the quality of electricity during the most loaded peak hours and most of the daytime during the autonomous operation of the system is shown. Relationships are obtained for determining the values of the input voltage of the inverter, the inductance of the reactor and the PWM frequency when the inverter is operating in the active rectifier mode with the possibility of reducing the PWM frequency in the autonomous mode with a decrease in energy losses in the switches and an increase in efficiency. The structure of the control system has been improved to ensure that the battery operates in the active zone of charging characteristics in an autonomous mode and switching the load to the grid when the inverter charges the battery in the active rectifier mode. The simulation model of energy processes in the system has been improved, taking into account the charging and discharging characteristics of the battery. It has been established that the lowest costs for electricity consumed from the network are achieved at maximum loads during peak hours, the ratio of the capacities of photoelectric and storage batteries is justified. The performance of the proposed solutions is confirmed by modeling in Matlab and on an experimental setup based on a standard hybrid inverter. The solutions obtained are the basis for the design of new and modernization of existing photoelectric systems of local objects, including the use of software and hardware control systems.</jats:p>",

To achieve the goal, the most common methods for calculating solar radiation were described and analyzed in detail, and the most accurate ones were recommended. The more laborious Bogoslovsky method (taking into account the time of the day) can be recommended for automated calculations in Excel, and the Hamburg method (taking into account the horizon sides) – for comparative evaluative engineering calculations. When carrying out “in-depth” model calculations and accounting for solar radiation, the ASHRAE method is explicitly suitable, which has two important advantages: it takes into account the solar factor in relation to a specific type of glazing and is adapted for automated calculations in ANSYS FLUENT.</jats:p>",

The monitoring of surface water quality by remote sensing monitoring technology can provide important research significance for water resources protection and water quality evaluation. Finding the optimal spectral index sensitive to water quality for remote sensing monitoring of water quality is extremely important for surface water quality analysis and treatment in the Ebinur Lake Basin in arid areas. This study used Sentinel-2MSI data at 10 m resolution to quickly monitor the water quality of the watershed. Through laboratory experiments and measurement data from the Ebinur Lake Basin, 22 water quality parameters (WQPs) were obtained. Through Z-score and redundancy analysis, 9 WQPs with significant contributions were extracted. Based on the remote sensing spectral band, four water indexes (NDWI, NWI, EWI, AWEI-nsh) and 2D modeling spectral index (DI, RI, NDI), the correlation analysis between WQPs and two kinds of spectral band indexes is carried out, and it is concluded that the overall correlation between WQP and 2D spectral modeling is more relevant. This paper calculates the evaluation and models the 2D spectrum of the Water Quality Index (WQI). The WQI is predicted and modeled through four machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, PLSR, PLSR-SVM).The results show that the inversion effect of the two-dimensional spectral modeling index on water quality parameters (WQPs) is superior to that of the water index, and the correlation coefficient of the DI (R12-R1) SWIR-2 and BLUE band interpolation index reaches 0.787. On this basis, three kinds of two-dimensional spectral modeling indexes are used to inversely synthesize the WQI, and the correlation coefficient of the ratio index of the RI (R11/R8) SWIR-1 and near-infrared (NIR) bands is preferably 0.69. In the WQI prediction, the partial least squares regression support vector machine (PLSR-SVM) model in machine learning algorithms has good modeling and prediction effects (R2c = 0.873, R2v = 0.87), which can provide a good basis. The research results provide references for remote monitoring of surface water in arid areas, and provide a basis for water quality prediction and safety evaluation.</jats:p>",

Secondly, an appropriate real demand function is constructed, according to the characteristics of the product and consumer positioning, combined with the expression of the demand function in economics. Thirdly, by using the constructed “real demand” function and combining the basic knowledge of optimization and probability theories, the profit function for manufacturers in “real demand” pattern is established. When the manufacturer wishes to obtain optimal profit from three different sales models, the product manufacturing quantity and pricing are analyzed.

A total of 52 water samples from deep tube-well, tube-well, dug-well, and tap water were collected and analyzed for physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters using standard methods. The results revealed that chloride, total hardness (TH), copper, nitrate, sulfate, and turbidity were within the recommendations of the National Drinking Water Quality Standard (NDWQS). Total coliform (TC) bacteria in 84.6% of the samples exceeded drinking water guidelines. Similarly, the isolates of different enteric bacteria, namely Escherichia coli (21.5%), Citrobacter spp. (20.9%), Klebsiella spp. (19.8%), Proteus spp. (13.9%), Enterobacter spp. (8.72%), Salmonella spp. (5.8%), Shigella spp. (5.2%), and Pseudomonas (4.1%) were identified in the samples collected from the respective sources. Out of the 52 water samples, 7.7% of samples had fecal contamination of somatic coliphage. The groundwater and municipal water supply in the study area are not safe for drinking purposes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses power supply quality in an industry in terms of Mikheevsky GOK—one the largest mining and processing plants in the Chelyabinsk Region and in Russia. The power supply quality is understood here as the reliability, economic efficiency and electromagnetic compatibility of basic power consumers. These objectives can be successively achieved through in-house power generation by gas piston power plants, as well as thanks to banks of supercapacitors capable to maintain power factor within the present ranges. The capital expenses connected with buying mill electric drives with capacity to tens megawatts are appreciably cut down owing to an original decision to use asynchronous motors with phase-wound rotors and liquid rheostats, which were commonly used at the dawn of adjustable electric drives. That decision allowed rejecting expensive variable speed drives at admissible power quality. Design and installation of capacitors with current-limiting coils neglected harmonics of lowvoltage variable speed drives and follow-up resonances, which resulted in overcurrents and in failure of the capacitors. Finally, the plant sustained considerable losses. The way out of this situation is shown by the research and modeling as series connection of currentlimiting coils and filters set to suppress outer lowest harmonics (5, 7, 11) in the canonical series. The economic effect and payback period of the implementation of the proposed solution are governed, first, by the extended failure-free operation of capacitors due to elimination of overcurrents and reduction in energy loss in wattless power flows and, second, by zero extra expenses connected with installation of filter-equipped coils. The study was supported by the President of the Russian Federation, Grant for Young Candidates of Sciences—MK-499.2020.8.</jats:p>",

The article shows the possibilities of applying the spatial concepts of the actor-network theory in the interests of forming a relevant intelligent information security management system for supply chains. Materials and methods. The article discusses a new approach based on the provisions of the actor-network theory, which makes it possible to form the structure of an intelligent information security control system for supply chains, consisting of three main functional blocks: technical, psychological and administrative. The incoming information security threats and the relevant system responses generated through the interaction of the system blocks were considered as enacting the three Law’s spaces: the space of regions, the space of networks and the space of fl uids. Results. It is shown that the stability of this system in the space of networks is a necessary condition for its successful functioning in the space of regions, and its resilience in the space of fl uids gained through the dynamic knowledge formation helps overcome the adverse effects of the fl uidity. The problems of the intentional / unintentional nature of information security threats, as well as the reactivity / proactivity of the corresponding responses of the intelligent information security management system for supply chains are investigated. Conclusions. The proposed approach showed the possibility of using such an interdisciplinary tool in the fi eld of information security as the concepts of the actor-network theory. The intelligent information security control system built on its basis ensures that almost all the features of solving information security problems in supply chains are taken into account.</jats:p>",

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) enable detailed and accurate data collection that can be used to determine flood source, extent, impact and the presence of property level flood resistance measures. This paper draws on the practical experience of the authors including the use of UAVs during flood events. We highlight the potential uses of UAVs in flood risk management activities and the associated challenges. The impact of a flooding event will also be dependent on how well an area is prepared in terms of community and property level resistance and resilience measures. We have looked at potential reasons why there is not a greater uptake of property level resistance and resilience measures. It is clear that a standardised approach is required if UAVs are to fulfil their potential within flood risk management activities. We have identified five pillars of standardisation that underpin an overarching, purpose-driven, cost-effective systems-based approach to the use of UAVs in flood risk management. These are as follows: (P1) deployment, data collection and flight-related regulatory requirements; (P2) data processing, data merging and outputs; (P3) the introduction and use of innovative approaches and technological integration; (P4) use of outputs for public engagement and (P5) policy development and governance. We consider that the proposed approach will maximise cost-effective information gathering, standardise the way processed outcomes are generated and provide the basis for comparable and robust flood risk information that is based on a single coherent methodology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Facing the increasingly serious waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) recycling problem, recycling enterprises actively introduce online recycling channels, build dual channel reverse supply chains (DRSC), and use high-level recycling price and service levels to enhance consumers’ recycling enthusiasm and recycling amount. Nevertheless, in China, where the imbalance of regional development is widespread, the recycling center, third-party recycler (TPR), and third-party platform (TPP) are faced with the choices of pricing and service level when facing multi-regional consumers. This paper mainly answers the following questions: (1) When the recycling center and TPP introduce online recycling channels in multi-regional situations, how should they set online recycling price, transfer price, and service level? (2) When consumer preference for online channels changes in a certain region, how should recycling enterprises adjust their optimal pricing and service level decisions for different regions to maximize their own profits? How do the profits of recycling enterprises change? In order to solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose three pricing and service level decision models for the recycling center with online channels, namely, keeping prices unchanged, unifying all prices, and maximizing its own profits. By using the Stackelberg game to solve the model, we get the optimal pricing, service level decisions, as well as the maximum profits of the recycling center, TPP, and TPR when consumer preference changes. By analyzing the results of the model, we find that the change of consumer preference for online channels in a certain region will affect the decision and profits of multi-regional recycling enterprises. Specifically, consumer preference for online channels in a certain region will not only lead to an increase in the profits of the recycling center and TPP and a decrease in the profit of local TPRs, but also an increase in the profit of TPRs in other regions. In addition, at the beginning of introducing online channels, the recycling center can adopt two strategies to avoid conflicts among channels: keeping offline transfer prices unchanged and unifying all transfer prices, but the former promotes its economic profits more significantly.</jats:p>"

The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna reports ∼ 7% of global silky landings but there is a moratorium on the export of their fins. During a 4‐year period (2014–2017) we used genetic differentiation observed between Atlantic and Indo‐Pacific silky sharks to assess the contribution of Atlantic individuals to fins randomly obtained in the two largest shark fin markets in the world, Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 604). We did not detect any Atlantic fins in either market despite robust sampling effort with an estimated Indo‐Pacific contribution of 99.8% to these markets. These findings indicate that supply chains for silky shark fins in Hong Kong and Guangzhou primarily originate in the Indo‐Pacific and are mainly under the purview of three Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. Our results are consistent with the possibility that ICCAT parties have achieved high compliance with the ban on silky sharks. We suggest research and monitoring improvements that could enhance our understanding of the global trade of silky sharks and enable better fisheries management.</jats:p>",

It is also concluded that it is advisable to develop this direction of calculations for forecasting and designing power supply systems. The article is devoted to the problem of choosing a model for forecasting electricity consumption when solving the problem of operational daily planning of electricity supplies in the wholesale market. The task of forecasting electricity consumption acquired particular relevance after the emergence of the wholesale electricity market: an underestimation of the forecast leads to the need to launch expensive emergency power plants, while an overestimation leads to an increase in the costs of maintaining excess capacity. The choice of artificial neural networks for this purpose is well-founded. The most suitable architecture of an artificial neural network for solving the problem in question is a multilayer perceptron containing several layers of neurons: an input layer, one or more hidden layers and a layer of output neurons. The transmission of information usually takes place in one direction - from the input layer to the output layer. An example of power consumption prediction based on the results of the nearest measurements in the time domain is considered and an approximation error is determined. The results of approximation and prediction of power consumption showed that a root-mean-square relative error did not exceed 6.32 %, but there is an outlier at one point up to 34 %. The reserve for improving the forecast accuracy is to study the influence of additional factors such as an ambient temperature and the day factor which takes into account the load distribution by the days of the week.</jats:p>",

Silicic acid (DSi) is one of the macronutrients essential in fuelling biological hot spots of diatom‐dominated primary production along the WAP. Here we measure the concentration and stable silicon isotopic composition of DSi in porewater profiles, biogenic silica content (BSi), and diatom abundance from sediment cores collected along the WAP. We couple these measurements with reaction‐transport modeling, to assess the DSi flux and the processes that release this key nutrient from the sediment into the overlying waters. Our results show that the benthic DSi flux is dominated by the diffusive flux, which is estimated to be equivalent to 26.7 <jats:styled-content>±</jats:styled-content> 2.7 Gmol yr<jats:styled-content><jats:sup>−1</jats:sup></jats:styled-content> for the WAP continental shelf. The DSi isotope profiles reveal the important impact of sedimentary processes on porewater DSi and suggest that biogenic silica dissolution is the main source of DSi in porewaters and consequently of the benthic fluxes. Our integrated data‐model assessment highlights the impact of surface productivity on sedimentary processes and the dynamic environment of core‐top sediments where dissolution and reverse weathering reactions control DSi exchanges.</jats:p>",

Methods: To solve the set tasks, we used the statements and methods of the theory of power supply, experimental planning, mathematical and system analysis, and the theory of electrical measurements. In the experimental studies, the Trans-AURA Emergency Process Recorder and the Tektronix TDS 2014 Digital Oscilloscope were used, and the Aura2000 and MS Excel 2010 software products were used to process the experiment results. Results: The basic requirements for the AC traction power supply system grounding are presented. The flaws of the traditional grounding system of the catenary supports on the rail network are revealed. Two possible directions are described, which allow eliminating issues during the operation of the AC traction power supply system. The first direction requires the introduction of an additional stage into the traction network protection system, which makes it possible to identify short circuits through a high rail-to-earth resistance. The second suggests the need to revise the relay protection system itself, which includes changing the approach to grounding the catenary structures, the methodology for calculating the relay protection settings, a more detailed analysis of electrical safety conditions, etc. An equation has been formulated to determine support-groupto-earth resistance taking into account the group grounding cable and the existing requirements for ensuring the sensitivity of the main protection means, which allows ensuring reliable operation of feeders’ relay protection. The results of experimental tests of electrical safety conditions and electromagnetic influence are presented. The tasks are identified being the essential prerequisite to the widespread introduction of a system with supports without rail network grounding. Practical importance: The developed methodology for selecting the protection settings will make it possible to operate the AC catenary system without the supports’ rail grounding, as well as introduce the proposed additions to the instructions for grounding traction power supply devices at “Russian Railways”</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses a method for determining water discharge at intake points under the conditions of lack of hydrological data. As an example is given the calculation of the river flow at intake points of the hydroelectric power chain cascade on the river Mtkvari (Chitakhevi HPP, ZAHPP, Ortachala HPP). The data taken from the hydrological stations of ,,Likani,, and „Tbilisi“ are multiplied by the adaptation coefficient, which is obtained by dividing catchment areas of Chitakhevi HPP ZAHPP and Ortachala HPP. The method allows to receive continuous average monthly and annual water discharge at the intake points of Chitakhevi HPP, ZAHPP, Ortachala HPP, instead of incomplete hydrological data. Additionally, the impact of Zhinvali reservoir is taken into account in the calculation of river flow at intake points of the ZAHPP and Ortachala HPP. Also its effect on natural water inflow of river Mtkvari is established. The calculation results show that since of the operation of Zhinvali HPP the average annual water inflow of the river Mtkvari is decreased by 10% at the intake points of the ZAHPP and Ortachala HPP.  Using the calculation results it is possible to determine the river flow for existing and planned HPPs on the section of Chitakhevi-Ortachala. The method also helps to determine the design parameters of these HPPs more accurately that is important for effective and safe operation of HPPs on the river Mtkvari during different levels of water flow.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objectives:In this study, through the results of the high-concentration 2-MIB (2-Methyl Isoborneol) treatment by two different types of advanced treatment plants (Post Peroxone+GAC, UV/H2O2+GAC F/A) which intake raw water from the same water intake facility, the 2-MIB removal characteristics by oxidation process of each WTPs (Water Treatment Plants) were compared and analyzed, and optimal operation methods were derived.Methods:The 2-MIB removal rate was compared and analyzed according to each AOP (Advanced Oxidation Process) operating conditions (Post Peroxone+GAC of the G WTP and UV/H2O2+GAC F/A of the I WTP). The optimal equations of chemical injection were derived through the correlation between the operating conditions of the AOP for each WTPs and 2-MIB removal rate. By analyzing the operating characteristics of each WTPs, the cost and unit price for optimal operation were calculated according to the 2-MIB concentration of raw water and water production. Optimal operating conditions were derived through the performance of oxidation facilities and chemical injection equations of each WTPs, and economical operating plans were reviewed through linked operation of 2 WTPs.Results and Discussion:The 2-MIB removal rates for each WTPs were 70~100% for the G WTP and 50~96% for the I WTP. The operating conditions affecting the 2-MIB removal were [O3 injection×contact time], H2O2/O3 for Post Peroxone of the G WTP, and [UV dose×H2O2 injection] for UV/H2O2 of the I WTP. As a result of comparing the operating cost(electric power cost + chemical cost) of each WTPs, I WTP was 6.6~24.3 KRW/m3 higher than G WTP. It is considered to be because the H2O2 injection was 11~43 times for UV/H2O2 than Post Peroxone. Optimal operating conditions could be derived through the performance evaluation of each oxidation facilities and chemical injection equations of each WTPs. The G WTP and the I WTP are equipped with pipe line for linked operation in the water supply pipes, so the water production for each WTPs can be distributed. In the case of the same water production, it was confirmed that the unit price can be reduced when the water production ratio of the G WTP is increased. Because the decrease in cost of the I WTP is higher than the increase in cost of the G WTP.Conclusions:It was confirmed that both Post Peroxone+GAC of G WTP and UV/H2O2+GAC F/A of I WTP were effective in 2-MIB treatment. As for the operating cost, it was analyzed that UV/H2O2 had higher unit pice than Post Peroxone because of the large amount of H2O2 injection. Considering the 2-MIB removal rate and operating cost of each WTPs, it was possible to derive the optimal operating conditions for each WTPs and a linked operation plan.</jats:p>"

In this study, field investigation and geostatistical analysis methods of positive matrix factorization (PMF) and geographic information systems (GIS) were used to systematically study the pollution in rainwater runoff from a manganese mining area in Xiangtan, China, to evaluate source contributions for the health risk assessment of PTEs. The average concentrations (mg/L) of six PTEs were: 0.3357 (Mn), 0.0450 (Ni), 0.0106 (Cu), 0.0148 (Zn), 0.0068 (Cd) and 0.0390 (Pb). The coefficients of variation (CV) for Mn and Zn were &amp;gt;180% and &amp;gt;130%, with the other analytes having values below 70%. The GIS and PMF analysis produced more refined spatial source apportionments, including mining, smelting, transportation, agricultural production and natural sources. The results of the health risk assessment showed that the non-carcinogenic risk was negligible, and the carcinogenic risk was potentially dangerous but acceptable for both adults and children. In addition, the children's total carcinogenic risk value was greater than that of adults, highlighting their vulnerability. This study demonstrates the potential of PMF to provide a framework to spatially prioritize treatment objectives within the mining region to improve environmental conditions.</jats:p>",

Mobile workforces can present many opportunities to rural communities and economies. However, the capacity, viability and competitiveness of rural-based businesses to engage in supply chains serving mobile labour may be undermined by limited attention to how businesses manoeuvre downturns while maintaining a level of readiness to recover and scale-up in order to meet emerging mobile workforce needs. Drawing upon interviews with businesses in Fort St. John, British Columbia, Canada, our research uses the concept of resiliency to examine challenges and strategies associated with business capacity and agility to scale-up and scale-down in response to changing economic conditions associated with large-scale mobile workforces and related economic sectors. Our findings suggest that the capacity to scale-up and scale-down is shaped by capital, human resource and infrastructure strategies, inventory management and contract management strategies. Industry and state policies may also play a role supporting the conditions that will improve the agility, capacity and readiness of businesses operating in volatile resource-based economies. </jats:p>",

From the viticultural aspect, the research was conducted in two climatically very different years. The first research year (2014) was characterized by an abundant precipitation and less sunny days, resulting in a later technological grape maturity, amounting to 34 days when compared to the year 2015, which was extraordinarily warm and arid during the grape ripening period. In both research years, in the conditions of the soil’s low supply with the organic matter, phosphorus, and potassium, a mycorrhizal symbiosis influenced the higher content of phosphorus and potassium in the Graševina’s dry leaf matter. In a year experiencing more precipitation and less heat, a higher nitrogen content was found in the vine leaves manifesting a mycorrhizal symbiosis. In the dry and warm conditions, the calcium content was increased during the entire period of grape ripening, and a justifiably higher content of zinc, manganese, and iron was found in the period immediately preceding a technological grape ripeness. A positive influence of mycorrhiza on the yield, sugar content, and total acidity was not determined.</jats:p>",

The article notes that Turkmenistan currently faces one of the most important tasks of state policy - the development of the Karakum desert, which occupies 80% of the country's territory. This huge area is not used due to lack of electricity, water and low level of social and living conditions. The methodological and methodological basis of research is composed of mathematical modeling techniques using the laws of photoelectricity and heat exchange and mass exchange. Technical and economic calculations have shown that the solar heating and photoelectric modular installation reduces the unit cost in contrast to traditional solar water heating systems, and the payback period is 30... 40% faster. With a feasibility study for the construction of solar power plants based on heat and photoelectric modules, depending on local conditions and customer requirements, it is possible to adjust design, energy and economic parameters. From saving organic fuel 1110.6 thousand tons y. t. It is possible to reduce the anthropogenic load on the surrounding environment, while the savings in electrical energy will be 444.24 thousand kWatt per year, and the reduction in emissions of harmful substances will be (in tons per year): SO2 - 23083.69; NOx – 12429,68; CO – 1614,24; CH4 – 1614,24; CO2 – 1614,24; solids - 1614.24.</jats:p>",

The productivity of the Danish manufacturing industry has increased six times over the last 50 years, whereas the Danish con-struction industry has only doubled. Mass customization has not been extensively explored in the construction industry; therefore, the theoretical background is currently limited. Nevertheless, utilization of mass customization as a strategy might have potentials in the construction industry. This research is a multi-case study of 11 companies in the construction industry focusing on how the cases apply the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization 1) solution space development, 2) choice navigation and 3) robust process design, and how their im-provement initiatives effect performance, and how the cases plan to develop the three funda-mental capabilities of mass customization. The outset is an analysis of project phases and criti-cal success factors characterizing the cases followed by an analysis of how the cases apply and plan to develop the nine tools and approaches supporting the development of the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization. The data are collected through interview as a two-way communicative approach providing holistic and in-depth explanations of the 18 variables of the analysis. The results are that all 11 cases aim at increasing all nine tools and approaches, which strengthen the utilization of the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization in the sense of improving the productivity. This research put forward a definition of mass customization intending to make the concept more visible and accessible for the construction industry.</jats:p>"

TSC participants can be trade, production, catering, logistics companies, travel agencies, but also households, primarily in rural areas. Households can play a role at all levels of TSC (suppliers of goods, materials and services, tour operators, travel agencies, end customers) and in various forms of tourism, but they play the most important role in rural and agritourism. Logistics is important in the optimization of logistics flows of households in TSC, having in mind imperatives of quality of goods, services, or complete tourism products that they can supply customers with.

Based on a wide range of sources, social changes in the behavior of Sharua peasants in the context of an aggravated food problem are shown. As a result, it was determined that the export of raw materials, food, income from agriculture, which were the main sources of financing for industrialization, led not only to an aggravation of the crisis situation in agriculture, but, as a result, to massive famine.</jats:p>",

The results of the analyses indicated these samples were primarily made from multiple raw mineral materials, including antigorite, actinolite, clinochlore, turquoise and muscovite. No nephrite was recovered from the Sujiacun site. This is strikingly different from other top‐ranking settlements of Longshan Culture, such as Dantu, Liangchengzhen and Xizhufeng, in which nephrite was the main material of jade artefacts. This may reflect the distinctions in the supply system of jade raw materials among different rankings of Longshan period sites. In addition, laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA‐ICP‐MS) was used to analyse the composition of the rare earth elements of serpentine jade. These preliminary results were compared with published data on the composition of serpentine jade and it was found that the Sujiacun serpentine jade artefacts were likely sourced from the Taishan jade deposit.</jats:p>",

To help deal with these risks, a virtual dual-sourcing production-inventory system can be deployed. In this paper, we study such a system which consists of a raw material supplier, a manufacturer, and a virtual dual-sourcing contingency supplier. The manufacturer needs to determine the production, procurement, and inventory plan of raw materials. When its supplier is interrupted, the manufacturer may need to adjust the production and inventory plan and work with the contingency supplier. We develop a system dynamics method to simulate the operations in this production-inventory system to identify the approximately optimal order-up-to-level inventory policies. We find that the virtual dual production-inventory strategy can be the optimal contingency policy to deal with supplier dynamic disruption risks. Furthermore, for disruption risk with low frequency and long duration, the manufacturer should increase the safety inventory level before the disruption. Otherwise, it should increase the safety inventory level in every cycle.</jats:p>",

Research into project success needs comprehensive analysis and approaches in  various contexts, especially touching on non-technical skills (personality). This study aims to  focus on examining the association of Project Manager Personality Traits (PMPTs) to the  success of Small Public Construction Projects (SPCPs) and moderated by working experience.  A survey was carried out to collect data using a structured Big Five Inventory (BFI) and  Project Success Achieved Instrument (PSAI) questionnaire. Partial Least Squares Structural  Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used on a sample of 137 respondents for hypotheses testing  and moderation effect analysis. Results show that PMPTs had a positive impact on the success  of SPCPs. Conscientiousness (CT) and Agreeableness (AG) traits influence were more  prominent when compared with other traits. While working experience does not moderate the  relationship between PMPTs and the success of SPCPs. This study reflected the theoretical  research of personality traits and their impact on the construction management industry. There  have been limited studies of project success in the relationship with the BFI in the past,  especially in the SPCPs context. The present study provides a basis for researchers interested  in this area to examine further the use of BFI and PSAI as resources in other industries.  Practically these findings may enable government or authorities to better align and suit project  managers and their assigned project-based levels, where project managers are located in  ministries overseeing small-scale projects. This study contributes theoretically to SPCPs  literature by offering insights into project manager personality affecting project success and  focus on selected agency in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article assesses the current state and problems of the power supply system, highlights the most pressing problems in the public utilities sector in the Arctic zone of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). On the basis of statistical processing of information by subdivisions of JSC Sakhaenergo, the authors present an analysis of the structure of generating capacities and the dynamics of the installed capacity of power plants, including those based on renewable energy sources. Diesel power plants account for the largest share of the installed capacity, with renewable energy sources accounting for less than 1.4%. The main problem in power generation is equipment wear. In total, in the Arctic uluses of the republic in the communal and household sector, the standard resource for operating time since the start of operation exceeded more than 30% of the total number and 20% of the total installed capacity of diesel units, of which 60% are operating after major repairs. The authors outline main problems of fuel supply for the considered Arctic uluses: harsh climatic conditions, difficult transport accessibility, unstable hydrological situation, insufficient amount of dredging work, and a shortage of special road equipment. The assessment of the wear of power transmission lines and transformer substations is carried out. Of the total length of overhead power lines, 18.5% exceed the service life limit. For cable lines, this figure is 50.6%. In five uluses, more than half of the installed capacity of transformers exceeds the standard resource. Assessment of the electricity losses level shows that, on average, they amount to 15% for district power grids. In a number of Arctic uluses, there are high energy losses in power grids as well as their constant growth. When replacing and reconstructing outdated infrastructure, it is advisable to implement measures aimed at reducing losses and increasing the capacity of lines.</jats:p>",

It specifically analyzed the influence of working capital, return on investment, earning per share and gross operating profit on interest rate in Nigeria. Data was extracted from the Annual financial report of a manufacturing company using both descriptive research method and covariance while Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) were used to analyze the relationship which exist among the variables. The result of the findings showed that there is cointegration which implies aa long run relationship among the variables. The result revealed that Earning Per Share (EPS) had no significant impact on interest rate manufacturing firms in Nigeria. Furthermore, the result depicted that gross operating profit has a significant and positive impact on interest rate of manufacturing firms in Nigeria. The research recommends that financial managers increase their money supply and ensure that it is properly managed in order to enhance their investment, thus strengthening firm profitability. Furthermore, we suggest that financial managers should increase investment in working capital to accelerate their productivity so that they can also improve the profitability of the firms.</jats:p>"

Focusing on Shangshui County in central China’s Henan Province, this paper thoroughly analyzes this demand-supply balance through literature query and field survey. Firstly, the amount of nitrogen nutrients converted from the crop straws, and LP manures were calculated for the study area. Next, the demand for nitrogen nutrients of agricultural planting in the study area was estimated based on the soil properties and agricultural planting area. Based on the calculation results, the demand-supply balance of the nitrogen nutrients converted from AOWs for agricultural utilization in the study area was subject to quantitative analysis. The results show that: In 2017, the agricultural planting in Shangshui County demanded 35.16 kilotons of nitrogen nutrients; the total supply of nitrogen nutrients converted from AOWs stood at 25.86 kilotons, including 12.41 kilotons from crop straws (47.99%) and 13.45 kilotons (52.01%) from LP manures; the demand-supply ratio (amount of demand/supply quantity) of nitrogen nutrients was 1.36, that is, the demand surpassed the supply; therefore, the nitrogen nutrients provided by the AOWs in the study area can be fully utilized by the agricultural soil in the region.</jats:p>",

Existing ventilation systems cannot effectively remove the waste heat and pollutants generated by dense crowds. In this paper, a guardrail-based air supply terminal is proposed. Two indices, the velocity target value and temperature target value, were introduced to facilitate the evaluation of the guardrail-based air supply terminal. The jet air velocity, penetration air velocity and width of the unventilated strip are optimized based on CFD numerical simulations; the values obtained were V<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 0.25 m/s, V<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> = 0.15 m/s, and W = 290 mm. The guardrail-based air supply terminal was found to create a homogeneous air velocity of 0.3 m/s to avoid draft sensations. The uniformity and effectiveness of the air supply via the optimized guardrails are verified by full-scale experiments and visual experiments. The temperature of the working area was maintained at 26°C in the summer, creating a comfortable environment. Compared with other existing air distribution systems in high and large spaces, the velocity target value, air age, and temperature target value with the proposed air supply terminal were the smallest. The energy consumption of the guardrail-based air supply terminal was 61% less than that of the vertical wall jets. The results indicate that the guardrail-based air supply terminal not only meets the thermal comfort requirements but also saves energy. </jats:p>",

The baseline scenario was first constructed to describe the trade situation and virtual water among different regions and sectors from 2009–2020. Then two hypothetical policy scenarios were set to analyze the economic, water consumption and virtual water trade impacts under different policy shocks. The results show that (1) the Huaihe River basin was a net virtual water outflow region, with 13.977 × 109 m3 virtual water transferred outside the river basin in 2009, and 26.653 × 109 m3 VW transferred to outside in 2020. Jiangsu is the largest virtual water outflow province (mainly flows to outside), followed by Anhui. Anhui suffers from severe water shortage, but provides a net virtual water outflow to Henan, Jiangsu and Shandong and outside; (2) reducing Anhui's agricultural output (S1 scenario) and Anhui's agricultural virtual water outflow (S2 scenario) can not only reduce virtual water trade but also save water, but S1 scenario reduced net virtual water outflow by more, and saved more water. S1 had a positive effect on gross domestic product (GDP), but reduced the employment rate.</jats:p>",

Quality risks which bring enormous hidden danger to the product quality can be propagated and accumulate along the supply chain. It is of great significance to quantify the propagation mechanism of quality risk between supply chain network nodes and identify the key quality risk factor that causes fluctuation of product quality. This study for the first time applies the SoV into the research on quality risk propagation of complex product collaborative manufacturing supply chain network. Firstly, this paper uses the CN to construct a complex product collaborative manufacturing supply chain network according to its characteristics. Secondly, on the basis of SoV, the quality risk propagation model is established. Thirdly, we put forward a method to identify the key quality risk factors of supply chain network based on the risk propagation effect. Lastly, a numerical simulation is given to verify the effectiveness of the model and its identification method. The results reveal that the quality risk propagation includes the vertical propagation within enterprises and the horizontal propagation from the lower-level enterprises to the upper-level enterprises of the supply chain. The quality risks of an enterprise are determined by its own quality risk factors and the quality risk passed by the lower-level enterprises.</jats:p>",

The current situation, the role of digitalization during the crisis, and the composition of anti-crisis measures already taken by the world’s largest economies are investigated, and long-term measures are proposed aimed at restoring the global economy and moving toward more equitable and sustainable development.The authors identify a significant green component in public policy proposals published since the pandemic began and note that many proposals relate to equity and inclusiveness in development and meeting the needs of individuals. The authors further identify key areas of sustainable development that require action in the near future and which can create new opportunities for economic development: renewable energy and clean transport, cyclical economy, digitalization and environmental protection. At the same time, it is noted that the transition to a green economy is of a long-term nature and may conflict with the need in the short term to support the economy in overcoming the crisis.These priority areas for government action require attention within the framework of Russia’s anti-crisis policy. Given the sharp drop in oil prices, the acceleration of digitalization and decarbonization, and the magnitude of the 2020 economic crisis, Russia needs to begin an accelerated transition to low-carbon energy, a cyclical economy and the restoration of its ecosystems with accelerated digitalization.</jats:p>",

Using data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2014 in 19 HIV services in the Centre and Littoral regions in Cameroon, we investigated the role of healthcare supply-related factors in time to ART initiation in HIV-positive patients eligible for ART at HIV diagnosis. HIV service profiles were built using cluster analysis. Factors associated with time to ART initiation were identified using a multilevel Cox model. The study population included 847 HIV-positive patients (women 72%, median age: 39 years). Median (interquartile range) time to ART initiation was 1.6 (0.5–4.3) months. Four HIV service profiles were identified: (1) small services with a limited staff practising partial task-shifting (n = 4); (2) experienced and well-equipped services practising task-shifting and involving HIV community-based organizations (n = 5); (3) small services with limited resources and activities (n = 6); (4) small services providing a large range of activities using task-shifting and involving HIV community-based organizations (n = 4). The multivariable model showed that HIV-positive patients over 39 years old [hazard ratio: 1.26 (95% confidence interval) (1.09–1.45), P = 0.002], those with disease symptoms [1.21 (1.04–1.41), P = 0.015] and those with hepatitis B co-infection [2.31 (1.15–4.66), P = 0.019] were all more likely to initiate ART early. However, patients in the first profile were less likely to initiate ART early [0.80 (0.65–0.99), P = 0.049] than those in the second profile, as were patients in the third profile [association only significant at the 10% level; 0.86 (0.72–1.02), P = 0.090]. Our findings provide a better understanding of the role played by healthcare supply-related factors in ART initiation. In HIV services with limited capacity, task-shifting and support from community-based organizations may improve treatment access. Additional funding is required to relieve healthcare supply-related barriers and achieve the goal of universal ART access.</jats:p>",
