      "abstract": "<jats:p>The semiconductor industry is highly dependent on rare earth elements (REEs) due to their unique properties that enhance the performance of semiconductor devices. REEs, including lanthanides, yttrium, and scandium, are essential in various processes, from producing powerful magnets to improving display technologies and gas sensing capabilities. However, the global supply of REEs is heavily concentrated in China, which accounts for over 90% of production. This concentration poses significant risks for the U.S. semiconductor industry, which relies on imports from China for critical materials. Despite efforts to diversify sources and develop domestic capabilities, the U.S. remains vulnerable due to a lack of processing infrastructure and environmental challenges. This paper explores the current state of the global REE supply chain, focusing on the U.S.’s dependency on foreign imports. Through scenario planning and strategic recommendations, the study offers insights into how the U.S. can strengthen its domestic supply chain and reduce its reliance on foreign REEs, thereby enhancing its competitiveness in the global semiconductor market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: This study aims to examine and analyze the nexus between Green Intellectual Capital (GIC), Supply Chain Integration (SCI), Digital Supply Chain (DSC), Supply Chain Agility (SCA) dan Business Performance (BP). It also aims to examine and analyze the mediating influence of several variables: (a) the mediating role of SCI on the relationship between GIC and BP, (b) the mediating role of DSC on the relationship between GIC and BP dan (c) the mediating role of SCA on the relationship between GIC and BP.Design/methodology: Quantitative approach is carried out using a survey to the owners or managers, and owners and managers of courier service SMEs in two provinces, namely East Java and Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY). These two provinces are known to have a courier service SMEs in a large amount because of its population density and large business transaction. The number of respondents analyzed are 183 SMEs. This study uses purposive sampling with certain criteria. The approach of the model is using Structural Equation Modelling with AMOS 23.Findings: (1) GIC has a significant positive influence on SCI; (2) GIC does not have a significant positive influence on BP; (3) GIC has a significant positive influence on DSC; (3) GIC has a significant positive influence on SCA; (4) SCI has a significant positive influence on BP; (5) DSC has a significant positive influence on BP; (6) SCA does not have a significant positive influence on BP. The results of mediation analysis conclude that: (a) SCI mediates the influence between GIC on BP; (b) DSC mediates the influence between GIC on BP; and (c) SCA mediates the influence between GIC on BP.Research limitations/implications: Selecting respondents using purposive sampling is feared to not be able to generalize the population in the two provinces, namely East Java and DIY. The study also uses a self-administered survey, especially on assessing business performance, thus it is feared that there might be a bias, although it has been compared to similar competitor SMEs. Courier service SMEs also have limitation in implementing digital SC, thus they do not quite understand the questionnaire asked even though the researcher has provided assistance during the research.Managerial Implication: Companies need to improve GIC and DSC through various strategies and policies such as training, workshop, and other intellectual development routinely and intensively. It can be done by cooperating with other parties such as universities and the government. This step should be taken in order to achieve harmony in all activities of supply chain management (SCM). Companies should also carry out an effective and efficient learning process for companies to move more agile and dynamic, therefore BP can increase sustainably and not static.Theoretical Implication: This study provides a theoretical contribution, especially on the nexus between GIC, SCI, DSC, SCA, and BP. DSC becomes a very interesting strategic aspect when it is implemented in the current era, where all the business process cannot be separated from digital-based technology.Originality/value: Studies in Asia, moreover in Indonesia, which integrates GIC and associate it with business performance mediated by SCI, DSC, and SCA is still rare. In this era, there is a need for an increase of digital competition in all human resources of courier service SMEs in Indonesia, especially when the SMEs have not had a good SCM system. Digital supply chain requires GIC, and they must be fast and agile to adapt to technology and environmental turbulence.

Thus, it is increasingly important for supply chain managers to skillfully navigate multiplex relationships to coordinate and manage resources across functions and firms in today's competitive environment. In this work, we describe, in a supply chain context, how the prevalence of multiplex relationships, which exist when multiple, potentially incongruous relationships are present between firms and among individuals within these firms, is an important basis for individual behaviors that influence firm competitiveness. Drawing on recent advances in the relational multiplexity theoretical perspective, we identify and discuss several research opportunities for enriching our understanding of interpersonal level antecedents of firm competitiveness. Specifically, we present research opportunities related to supply chain behavioral implications of individual differences and socio‐structural adaptation, informal relationship capitalization and creation, temporal orientation and transience, contemporary multiteam structures, and cross‐level relational valence (a)symmetries. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of the informal, interpersonal relationships that overlay formally specified roles and develop representative research questions to spur further exploration in each area.</jats:p>",

This paper examines this second alternative. The structure‐conduct‐performance (SCP) paradigm and the competitive dynamics literature are used to explore the relationships between political actions that leverage supply network resources, supply chain strategies, and firm performance. We extend a well‐known typology of political actions from the strategic management literature and suggest that beyond influencing or complying with the political environment, firms may choose to moderate the political environment (circumvent or submit) or stay neutral (free ride). An integrated model is developed to explore the relationships between political actions and supply chain strategy, along with a series of propositions outlining how political actions can facilitate supply chain risk management strategies.

Firms' competitive behavior—the series of competitive actions taken to create or maintain competitive advantage—thus, is a key predictor of profitability and has received much attention in the strategic management literature. The central tenet of this article is that supply networks and the relationships among firms in these networks fundamentally shape the nature of interfirm competition and, ultimately, firm performance. Although prior research has amply studied the competitive dynamics among (horizontal) rival firms as well as the linkages between supply network characteristics and firm performance, there remain important opportunities to examine how supply networks enable and shape firms' competitive behavior and the effectiveness of their rivalrous activity. The goal of this article, therefore, is to take stock of the advances made in prior literature and to outline topics for future study at the intersection of competition and supply chain management. Collectively, we lay out a comprehensive perspective on the role that supply networks can play in affecting competition that, we hope, will inform and guide efforts to enhance our understanding of firm‐level competitive behavior and associated performance outcomes.</jats:p>",

With this object in view, seven separate computer programs were developed for the course of house water supply and sewerage system design that allow to estimate the maximum second flowrate depending on the number of facilities; to determine the water head loss, nominal diameter and flow velocity for the each section of the cold water pipe to estimate the size and head loss of impeller water meters; to calculate the pump power; to determine the water head loss, nominal diameter and flow velocity for the each section of the hot water pipe; to estimate the total hourly water consumption in the house; to determine the coefficient Ks and to estimate the calculated flow rate in the sewer outlet from the building and in different sections of the sewer in the adjacent to the building territory. The developed computer applications were tested in five groups of the Architecture Faculty of KNUCA in the autumn semester of 2021/2022 academic year when students studied the discipline \"Engineer facilities of buildings\" The total number of students studying this course was 96 persons. 90 persons of them (93.8%) completed the course project on time. The average score on the course project was 94.5. The results show that the use of computer programs in the educational process increases students' interest in learning the course and motivates them to progress in their studies.</jats:p>"

It talks about the imperative to focus on supply agility and resilience in an increasingly VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) environment, the ten core principles leveraging which one can build an effective supply resilience approach. It then discusses the need to have a holistic supply resilience program across source, make and deliver with cross-functional representatives and executive sponsorship. The paper speaks in some detail about how to go about conceptualising and executing the different workstreams of the program around procurement, manufacturing, logistics, resilient planning and innovation resilience. One needs to look at the big picture and hence it is important to bring the outputs and analytics of the different workstreams together to drive an end-to-end view of supply resilience and agility for a category and then overall for the supply chain. The paper gives an approach on how to look at this end-to-end view. Finally, it suggests the key success factors and tailwinds that are necessary to successfully execute and embed the supply resilience programme within the DNA of the organisation.</jats:p>"

Respondents in this study had at least three years’ experience in the management of pharmaceuticals and other health products in one or more public health intervention programs including HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis &amp; Leprosy, Malaria, Reproductive Health and Family Planning, Vaccines and Immunisation, Neglected Tropical Diseases and Essential Medicines Programmes.&#x0D;\nFindings: The findings of the research study were based on a holistic and comprehensive approach that included cost benefit analysis, justifications, and circumstances for viable integration of vertical public health supply chain systems, which are relationship management, information integration, product integration and coordination called the four modalities/dimensions/practices of supply chain integration and need to exist in a continuum driven by purposeful leadership. Even though the data collected through semi-structured interviews did not allow for differing views among respondents, the opportunity to freely express one’s opinion resulted in a rich data. Going forward, the government and its development partners need to demonstrate political and financial commitment to the course of integrating vertical public health supply chain systems in the country. The research study for the first time presented a practical and contextual framework for the seamless integration of public health supply chain systems, especially for low- and medium-income countries.&#x0D;\nUnique contribution to theory, practice, and policy: This research study contributes to the integration of vertical public health supply chain system in Nigeria and proffer practical and systematic contextual framework for achieving a seamless integration of vertical supply chain systems in the public health.</jats:p>"

To start that discourse, this issue offers three invited papers. In “Broadening our understanding of interfirm rivalry: A call for research on how supply networks shape competitive behavior and performance,” Christian Hofer, Jordan Barker, Laura d'Oria, and Jon Johnson discuss the criticality of the supply network to a focal firm's capability in engaging competitive behaviors and the effectiveness of their rivalrous activities, which together affect the firm's competitive advantage. Michael Howe and Yao Jin explore the relational multiplexity theoretical framework in “It's Nothing Personal, or is it? Exploring How Relational Multiplexity in the Supply Chain Can Enhance Competitive Behavior.” In “A theoretical model on how firms can leverage their supply chain strategy through political actions,” Abhay Grover and Martin Dresner use the structure‐conduct‐performance and competitive dynamics perspectives to theorize about the relationship between political strategies, supply chain risk management strategy, and firm competitive advantage. These invited papers provide a solid foundation to further a discourse that explains how and why changes in supply chain networks can enable firms to rapidly introduce competitive actions such as new product innovations to remain competitive in their respective industries.</jats:p>",

The situation in many intermittent water supply systems is that they have enough water to cover the demand of the users but are supplying it intermittently, and the challenge is to achieve a transfer from intermittent to continuous supply. If the delivery of water is continuous, which supplies drinking water 24/7, it covers not only the basic needs of the user, but all the needs for water they may have. The present study was carried out using smart domestic water meters to obtain consumption information in an intermittently supplied pilot sector. The electromagnetic meters record the water flow through pulses and generate consumption information, which gives us the consumption pattern in volume of water and in the time it is used. During the study, multivariate statistical methods were applied to obtain information from the domestic meters and to identify, as realistically as possible, the consumption of drinking water and the relationship between consumption and specific characteristics of the users and thus anticipate future demand. The results showed a close relationship between consumption and the size of the residence. The most influential factors were the number of bathrooms and the number of occupants. A direct relationship between the pressure and the volume supplied was presumed at the beginning of the study but the opposite was found. Equipment was installed to measure the pressure in the network at the time of establishing the continuous supply of drinking water. The multivariate analysis provides a selection of the most important variables that influence and explain the behavior of the water use and consumption pattern, with the operation determined by the operating agency.</jats:p>",

The results showed that the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) of aerators under process state are reduced by 13.07% and 14.48% respectively compared with that in clean water in the No.3-tank and No.6-tank, and the aeration uniformity index (IAU) is 4.86 and 1.46 respectively. The oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in the third corridor decreased significantly, but dissolved oxygen (DO) was a high level. Oxygen in supply (Qs) was much greater than oxygen in demand (Cs), which have resulted a large waste of energy consumption. Finally, the subsection regulation strategy was proposed based on the principle of oxygen balance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on transfusion practices and safety. The Scientific Committees consider that the COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential risk of reducing and compromising the blood product supply and expressed considerable concern about transfusion safety.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMethod: In this concise review, we provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for blood safety and sufficiency during the initial phases of the pandemic. We searched the PubMed database, the websites of the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Communicable Diseases Center. We used the keywords COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the impact of COVID-19 on the blood supply, impact of COVID-19 on blood collection, COVID-19 and transfusion safety, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through blood transfusion, COVID-19 symptoms, asymptomatic blood donor, COVID-19 patients.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tResults: Data provided from blood transfusion centers and blood banks worldwide show that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the activities of the blood supply system. It has impacted blood collections and caused a significant decrease in blood donors. The estimated asymptomatic infection rate was 15–46% of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The estimated incubation ranges are between 2 and 11 days, and almost all infections developed symptoms by day 14. The RNAemia phase of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be brief and low level, is typically associated with more severe disease, and is not demonstrated to be an infectious virus. It is detectable in only a tiny proportion of patients. Post-donation, post-transfusion information, and molecular testing of swab samples collected from asymptomatic donors at risk for COVID-19 provided data supporting the absence of transfusion transmission (TT) of COVID-19. The TT risk is currently theoretical. To prevent and minimize respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to donors and staff while donating blood, blood centers have had to activate their emergency plans and propose appropriate response measures.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tConclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on blood transfusion activities worldwide. The risk of transmission of COVID-19 through transfusion of blood collected from asymptomatic individuals is now only theoretical and likely minimal. Blood systems should adopt a national approach for coherence and coordination to ensure public confidence in blood safety and supply.</jats:p>"

However, the main obstacle to empirical research on SC innovation is a lack of validated and well‐developed scales to measure it. Therefore, developing a measurement scale for the SC innovation construct is necessary. This paper describes the development and validation of a third‐order SC innovation scale based on the collection of primary quantitative and qualitative data. SC innovation was then operationalized as a multidimensional construct with three aspects, namely, marketing, technology development, and logistics‐oriented innovation activities, resulting in 31 measurement items. The developed SC innovation scale applies to the textile and apparel industry primarily. Business‐to‐business marketers can apply this empirically validated scale to evaluate their SC innovation efforts and identify areas for improvement.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Academic/practical relevance: Such co-opetitive practices are common in industrial supply chains, but firms’ co-opetitive strategic sourcing with the potential of information leakage has not been examined in the literature. Methodology: We build a game-theoretic model to capture the firms’ strategic interactions under the co-opetitive supply partnership with the potential information leakage. Results: The DO exploits its information advantage to obtain a better wholesale price from the VI and may use dual sourcing to protect its private information. Anticipating that, the VI may offer wholesale price concessions as an information rent to obtain the DO’s information. Our work identifies demand uncertainty and efficiency of outside supply market as the factors affecting the VI’s pricing decision and the resulting equilibrium. Pooling equilibrium arises often, but in a few cases, the equilibrium is separating. At the separating equilibrium, the DO always single sources, either from the VI or the independent supplier depending on the demand state. The VI benefits from ancillary revenue-generating opportunity, and from information acquisition in a separating equilibrium. On the other hand, the DO’s benefit is a cheaper price in exchange for market information in a separating equilibrium. In the pooling case, the DO uses dual sourcing to hide demand information, especially in the high demand case, and to better supply the end-market through his accurate demand information. Managerial implications: Our work provides useful insights into firms’ strategic sourcing behaviors to efficiently deal with the potential of information leakage in the co-opetitive supply environment and for the rationale behind such relationships often observed in industries. </jats:p>",

Such a situation is projected to increase in a multiplying manner in the years to come. So, under such threatening circumstances, adequate population policies need to be applied to prevent further escalation. Many countries have experienced famine. China for example, experienced a wide food shortage in 1961, in which over 30 million people died. Even in present modern time, many people within the African nations are starving.

The disruptive effects on the economy are exacerbated for countries that did not adopt a carbon tax or with a high exposure to natural disasters.

On the assumption that the blockchain will need to be adopted at the supply chain level, the enabling factors and the contingent variables of different supply chains must be identified and analysed. The appropriate identification of supply chain partners is becoming a critical factor of success since the globalization of supply chains makes their management and control increasingly difficult.

Five blockchain providers and seven focal companies working in the fashion industry were interviewed to compare their different viewpoints on this topic.

In this vein, blockchain technologies can play a groundbreaking role in improving the traceability, accountability, and sustainability of complex supply chain networks. The present study examines the instrumentality of blockchain technologies in enabling supply chain mapping and supply chain integration. The study also tests the direct impact of blockchain technologies on supply chain sustainability. Data are collected from 132 Malaysian Electrical and Electronics firms using a close‐ended questionnaire. The study employs Partial Least Squares‐Structural Equation Modelling (PLS‐SEM) and Partial Least Squares‐Multi Group Analysis (PLS‐MGA) for analyzing the hypothesized relationships. The results show that blockchain technologies do not have a direct impact on supply chain sustainability. Nevertheless, this finding reveals a robust indirect effect of BT, through SC integration and SC mapping, on the SC sustainability. The study's findings imply that the notion of the sustainable supply chain can be significantly attained by mapping upstream, midstream, and downstream supply chains. The well‐mapped supply chain can further improve supply chain sustainability. The findings of the study also suggest the adoption of blockchain technologies as a broad‐based strategy to attain multi‐tier goals, for example, supply chain mapping, sustainability, and integration.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many countries worldwide have committed to mitigating global climate change by switching to renewable energy generation, leading to continuously increasing shares of renewable energy sources in the energy system. However, one major drawback is the strongly fluctuating nature of those energy sources. Power to gas technology to generate hydrogen and subsurface hydrogen storage is one of the options to balance this fluctuating availability. Depending on the specific development of the energy system, different scales of storage are needed with different scales of impacts on the subsurface that may arise. This study, therefore, quantifies the induced hydraulic effects of hydrogen storage in porous formations, accounting for four possible future energy system scenarios and based on an existing geological storage structure. The aim is to identify and quantify the large-scale and long-term hydraulic effects of the storage operations and to estimate the affected subsurface spaces using numerical simulation models.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The storage structure used was identified in a storage potential study and is located in the North German Basin at a depth of about 1000 m and consists of a Rhaetian sandstone formation. Formation permeability and porosity are derived from regional depth correlations, while boundary conditions are applied considering the local geological settings. For the storage operation, energy and mass balanced load profiles are derived from the four considered scenarios, with charging rates during times of surplus power varying from 1.9 GW to 6.4 GW and discharging rates during withdrawal from 4.7 GW to 15.9 GW, depending on the respective energy system scenario.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Simulation results show that up to 21 storage wells and 2.8 billion cubic meters of storage gas in place volume are required to support the required energy output for all scenarios considered. Scenario analysis shows that significant pressure responses at the well bottom hole are thus induced, which are limited to a geomechanically allowable range of 80 bar to 130 bar. Due to the high withdrawal rates required, storage design is mainly influenced by the lower pressure limit. In the far field, pressure responses of more than 3 bars and 5 bars are found within horizontal distances of up to 7.5 km and 5 km, respectively. The vertical pressure impact is much lower at 5 m and 20 m, respectively. This can be recalculated as a total impacted volume by 3 bars and 5 bars from 1.25&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;9 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; - 4.63 &amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;9 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; to 0.57&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;9 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; - 1.10&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;9 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;, depending on the scenario, respectively. This study thus shows that for grid-scale energy storage subsurface space on the order of tens of millions of m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; for the hydrogen gas phase will be required, while a much larger volume of 4.6&amp;amp;#215;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;9 &amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; will be affected by pressure changes of 3 bar or more. On the other hand, at least from an energetic point of view the storage structure investigated is sufficient to accommodate the national storage demand. The study results and the approach presented can thus contribute during site selection and storage facility planning to characterize subsurface and energy system requirements.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;River deltas represent globally important population centres and areas for food production, embedded on a nexus of land-water production. Yet pressures at the sea-land interface in these coastal areas are increasing from population growth, economic expansion and climate change. Over time, delta human populations have shifted from sea to land-based food production, the former more associated with local communities&amp;amp;#8217; subsistence and the latter with exports of food products elsewhere leading to potentially irreversible land use-land cover changes (LULCC). While livelihood diversification by switching between or including both sea and land food production systems, could promote resilience and increase food security, food production based on sea and land-based resources has seldom been addressed in tandem, and potential unintended spill-over effects and LULCC may emerge which may jeopardise both. Here we examine the extent to which deltas have food production systems based on sea and land-based food sources (biomass, calories and protein) and which factors could drive these relationships, as transitions between sea and land food production in deltas may have local and global food security implications.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We use global datasets across 235 large deltas, which include&amp;amp;#160;information on&amp;amp;#160;food biomass, calories and proteins from sea (fishing and aquaculture) and land (crops and livestock) production systems. Based on these indicators of food production, we calculated a sea:land ratio to examine to what extent food production of each delta is weighted towards the sea or land. We find clear geographical patterns in the sea:land food production ratio in global deltas: the majority of the deltas exhibit a dominance of sea-based food production (particularly those at higher latitudes) while the deltas in most of Europe, Central and Southern America, show a dominance of land-based food production. We found similar geographical patterns for biomass, calories and protein, with the relationship being stronger for protein than biomass or calories. We then examined how the sea:land ratio changes along gradients of human population density, and condition of the local ecosystems. Surprisingly, we found no relationship between population density and the sea:land ratio, indicating other factors may be at play (e.g., local context). Indeed, we found that as food production is mostly due to land contributions (i.e., the lower the sea:land ratio) the stronger the negative relationships with ecosystem conditions such as biodiversity intactness, soil and water quality. These results suggest that transitions between sea and land food production and subsequent LULCC can therefore be both complex and problematic in deltas globally, as these may represent switches in not just biomass but also nutritional quality, and may have severe implications for local ecosystem health and functioning.&amp;amp;#160;Increasing our understanding of what drives these transitions and associated LULCC at the nexus between land-water, and their effects, will allow more sustainable management of coupled food production systems and associated earth system processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Glaciers are important contributors to streamflow (Q), acting as water storage units during the accumulation season of a glaciological year and releasing water during its melting season. Glaciers often play an essential role in semiarid regions where the anthropogenic pressure on surface water resources is very high (e.g., Indus basin). The climate-driven glacier retreat observed worldwide is having major consequences on surface water supply. Here, we present a model-based approach to estimate the contribution of glaciers to streamflow and surface water supply over the global continental area (except Greenland and Antarctica). We refer to this contribution, i.e. the fraction of Q that can be explained by the presence of glaciers as opposed to their absence, as glacier-dependent streamflow (GDS). GDS is derived from the global hydrology model WaterGAP 2.2d at 0.5&amp;amp;#176; resolution; it is equal to the difference between Q computed with the standard version of the model, which does not include glaciers, and Q computed with a non-standard version that includes glaciers (C&amp;amp;#225;ceres et al., 2020). Global maps of mean yearly and mean monthly GDS are given in absolute values (m&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;/s), and in percentage of Q and of consumptive water use from surface water over two 30-year periods, 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. The model performance is evaluated by comparing Q simulated with WaterGAP 2.2d including glaciers to observations from the Global Streamflow Indices and Metadata archive (GSIM) downstream from glaciers. With this study, we aim (1) to identify the regions that rely the most on GDS for surface water supply and are therefore most vulnerable to water scarcity problems related to glacier retreat, (2) to identify spatial and temporal changes (e.g., shifts in seasonality, long-term trend) in GDS between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010, and (3) to evaluate the performance of WaterGAP 2.2d including glaciers in terms of Q.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;C&amp;amp;#225;ceres, D., Marzeion, B., Malles, J.

In the changing world order, with economic crises, instabilities, pandemics, and social media, sustainability awareness differs significantly from past years. In addition, developing new technologies and concepts (big data, blockchain, IoT, robotic, etc.) plays a crucial role in meeting social awareness in terms of sustainability. Food sustainability is also one of the most important pillars in this concept. The integration of new technologies in agriculture and food chains will enable the current world population to use resources more efficiently and sustainably. Blockchain, one of the technologies that emerged with the arrival of Industry 4.0, is a technology that can be used effectively in many sectors. Particularly in supply chain networks, it is seen as a technology that supports the sustainability concept due to its features such as decentralization, reliability, transparency, consensus standards, and traceability. However, since blockchain is an immature and new technology, there are some challenges with integrating it into existing conventional systems. This study aims to present a conceptual framework for the integration of blockchain technology to establish a sustainable tea supply chain, define possible actions, and prioritize the possible risks that may arise in this integration process; this will be done through the Spherical Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (SF‐AHP) approach. In this context, initially, the current tea supply chain will be considered and the activities carried out will be defined in terms of technological, environmental, and strategic sustainability. Then, the design that includes the integration of all activities with blockchain technology is presented. The proposed design covers the entire tea supply chain from end to end and is considered with regard to all sustainability dimensions. In the proposed framework, barriers that may be encountered and risks that may arise at each stage of the tea supply chain process are identified; managerial implications are then presented to eliminate these risks. To enhance the use of the recommendations made, risks and barriers are prioritized with SF‐AHP management. Thus, the problems that need to be solved primarily in the technological transformation process can be evaluated more clearly. The proposed theoretical framework is expected to extend to all agricultural practices and support technological advances throughout the agricultural sector.</jats:p>",

Raw Materials (RM), including the Critical ones (CRM), are essential for the sustainable functioning of modern societies; they are used in several clean and low carbon technologies (batteries for electric vehicles, turbines for wind energy, solar panels, etc.), as well as employed in the electronic industry (capacitors, electronic devices, etc.). Furthermore, as for clean and low carbon technologies, the demand for CRM is dependent on which wind, solar, and battery technologies will become dominant in the marketplace. Indeed, the acceleration in deployment of the key low carbon technologies has real implications for the commodities market; thus, not only REE but also aluminum, copper, silver, iron, lead, and others all stand to potentially benefit from a strong shift to low carbon technologies. All literature examining material and metals implications for supplying clean technologies strongly agrees that building these technologies will result in considerably more material-intensive demand than would traditional fossil fuel mechanisms.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The availability of CRM/RM is increasingly under pressure, and the criticality of the processing infrastructure and the recovering of these elements from various resources, leads the EU to be dependent on their imports, often from non-EU countries, which have been always affected by: fluctuating policies of the market, potential conflicts in the areas interested by their exploitation, higher environmental impacts connected to their exploitation, processing and waste management. China is the biggest producer of the 30 CRM for the EU; other countries have dominant supplies of specific CRM, such as USA (Beryllium), Brazil (Niobium), Chile (Lithium), South Africa (Iridium, Platinum, Rhodium, Ruthenium), Kazakhstan (Phosphorous), Guinea (Bauxite), DRC (Cobalt).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is still a high potential for RM/CRM available in Europe, but their exploration and extraction have faced a strong competition due to highly regulated environmental protection and different land uses. Several studies show that in many regions massive amounts of strategically important materials, such as metals, have been accumulated in landfills and extractive waste facilities. EU legislation aims to reduce the amount of wastes disposed in waste facilities and landfills and to foster the recovery and recycling of waste. The objective set by the measures of Circular Economy packages is not to allow any more landfills by 2050. Contemporary, EU policies intend to boost the domestic exploitation, which need to be faced in a sustainable way (also applying new financial instruments for companies, such as the &amp;amp;#8220;Sustainable Finance&amp;amp;#8221;). Thus, wastes (including extractive waste) have to be intended as resources and landfills (including extractive waste facilities) have to be considered as &amp;amp;#8220;raw material reserve&amp;amp;#8221; to be exploited. To face the challenges connected to sustainable RM/CRM supply, an interdisciplinary approach and a wider knowledge about waste characteristics, volumes, localization, suggested processing activities, main impacts on environment and human health are needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

However, the link between erosion and weathering is complex because weathering rates can be limited by the supply of minerals to the weathering zone, by the supply of acidic fluids, or by the kinetics of mineral weathering. Existing approaches that model the carbon cycle over geologic timescales assume that with increasing erosion rates, weathering transitions from a supply limit where weathering rates scale linearly with erosion to an &amp;amp;#8216;acid&amp;amp;#8217; or a kinetic limit where weathering is insensitive to erosion. Alternative models fit a single power-law to the relationship between erosion and weathering across multiple orders of magnitude. The validity of these two approaches remains difficult to assess at the landscape scale because existing data do not cover all limits or because co-variation between runoff and erosion obscures the driver of changes in weathering rates. Here, we compile five datasets of solute concentrations in streams that span well-defined erosion rate gradients in relatively uniform lithologies and with limited or well-constrained variations in runoff. Across 2-3 orders of magnitude of erosion rates, and for both metasedimentary and granitic lithologies, we find that silicate weathering rates are insensitive to erosion rates. In turn, weathering of sulfide and carbonate minerals increase with erosion rates, consistent with a limitation by mineral supply. However, contrary to existing models of supply-limited weathering, we observe a non-linear increase of sulfide and carbonate weathering rates with erosion. These new findings suggests that supply-limited and kinetically limited zones of weathering co-exist within a single landscape across multiple orders of magnitude of erosion rate. The distribution of these zones is most likely controlled by erosion processes. As a consequence, existing weathering models that assume a linear relationship between erosion and weathering at the supply limit may overestimate the sensitivity of weathering rates to erosion and underestimate the impact of climate on these reactions, with implications for the effect of mountain building on the carbon cycle and on Earth&amp;amp;#8217;s climate.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The discharge coefficient is influenced by several factors; in this study, some parameters that influence discharge coefficients of ogee weirs are investigated. These factors include: the weir upstream slope, apron elevation, and downstream submergence. In this regard, ogee weir physical models were fabricated. These models comprise: an ogee weir with a vertical upstream face, ogee weirs with inclined upstream faces (18, 33, and 45 degrees), ogee weirs with downstream apron thicknesses of 3, 5, 7, and 10 cm in free flow and an ogee weir with a vertical upstream slope under submerged-flow conditions. Results show that for all ogee weirs, the discharge coefficient (C) increases with increasing P/He, and then remains constant (P is the spillway height and He is the head above the weir crest). The value of the discharge coefficient decreases from 2.25 in free-flow conditions to 2.15 with submerged-flow conditions. For a constant head over the ogee weirs (He), the discharge coefficient decreases with increasing downstream apron elevation and submergence. The relative discharge coefficient shows a constant trend initially, with increasing hd/He, then later shows a decreasing tendency (hd is the difference between the downstream head and the ogee spillway crest). The threshold value for submergence ratio (hd/He) is 0.75 in the ogee weir in this study. With increasing submergence ratio from 0.75 to 1, the relative discharge coefficient (Cs/C0) decreases from 0.88 to 0.24.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To deal with environmental uncertainty, organizations need resilience to respond to disruptions, such as changing market conditions or variations in demand or supply, while avoiding large scale adjustments. The concept of resilience is ambiguous, often explained as the capability of an organization or a supply chain to recover its original state, within an appropriate time frame, after being disrupted. Resilient supply chains have event handling capabilities, can provide efficient responses, and can return to their normal operating performance, after the disruptive event. To increase their resilience, companies often make changes or adjustments to their internal IT infrastructure, which may temporarily disrupt their smooth operation. As a result, contemporary IT infrastructures are mixed and include varied systems or technologies. Although new technologies, including blockchain, IoT and cloud-based solutions, may facilitate the handling of changes by providing secure, low cost and scalable solutions, more traditional systems may hinder such changes. Therefore, the relationship between IT and supply chain resilience is still unclear. The paper intends to examine the above issues by adopting a socio-technical approach to explain the concept of supply chain resilience and investigate the role of IT. More specifically, based on previous literature and on the appreciative systems thinking theoretical perspective, the paper develops a theoretical framework to analyse the organisational and/or supply chain resilience. It then uses this framework to examine and explain the impact of IT, by identifying important characteristics of an IT infrastructure and examining whether they may support or hinder business resilience.</jats:p>"

The progress toward these goals, aided by international monitoring, has helped to reduce global disease burden and improve quality of life. Safe drinking water and sanitation are critical determinants of human health and well-being, and the international community has lately deemed their human rights.&amp;amp;#160;This research aims at assessing the access to drinking water and sanitation services at the individual home level in the rural villages of Nothern Kazakhstan that either used to have access to piped water systems or currently can enjoy the water from the centralized water systems. The questionnaire was conducted in 10 villages of Pavlodar region to identify the access to drinking water and sanitation services as well as perceived satisfaction with the water source, additionally water samples from existing water sources were analysed. The results show that every fourth household used water from the centralised system. At the same time, every household had a complaint about the water from the system, namely, every fourth has complained about the turbidity of the water, 30% of households were unhappy with the smell and the same amount of households found water very hard. As the raw water source for the centralised systems is underground water, the water quality analysis has shown that the pH fluctuates between 3.90 and 8.96 with an average value of 7.79, which indicates the different nature of the groundwater in the study area.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Half of the respondent households used water from private boreholes where more than half connected water to the house and enjoyed the tap water. Still, 8% of the households used water from an open-source - the Irtysh river. All the above-mentioned households have access to piped water while using the other alternative water sources.&amp;amp;#160;All the investigated rural settlements had only private houses and about 82% of the households had toilets outside. 2,3 % of the households had only toilets at home connected to the centralized sewer system and 15% of the households had toilets inside the house connected to septic tanks. This means that more than half of households are still inaccessible for full sanitation and hygiene.&amp;amp;#160;In Kazakhstan's rural communities with the access to centralized water systems the disparity in access to better drinking water and sanitation does exist. Monitoring within-country disparity in these metrics can help Kazakhstan achieve progress toward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by identifying neglected regions and implementing strategies to reduce access disparities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

SCM entails managing the interactions between the entities in charge of the effective production and supply of agribusiness products from the farm to the consumer in order to consistently satisfy consumer demands for quantity, quality, and price. In actuality, this frequently involves overseeing both horizontal and vertical alliances. Traditionally, the agricultural business has been driven in a colloquial fashion by the wholesalers and they have done so without the supervision of a proper legal framework. The large number of players and long-standing traditional methods have had a negative impact on the efficiency of operations and have exacerbated the already plunging economy. Through our extensive research using tools like Mendeley Cite, VOS Viewer etc., we came to the conclusion that there’s been a dramatic rise in the importance of SCM due to the rising awareness about the environment, food safety concerns and social security etc. However, just a few farmers participate in actually making a difference especially in third-world countries like India. The backward farmers have negligible faith in marketing agreements and are reluctant to enter into them. The existing system still uses outdated supply and procurement procedures. Aspects like the problems with consumer packaging, branding, and the promotion of organic farming towards sustainable agriculture are lacking in the existing supply chain management. Therefore, it’s necessary to encourage farmers to sign production contracts and that requires the participation of both the public and commercial</jats:p>"

Against this background, this paper examines the impact of money supply on food inflation in Nigeria using monthly data between 1996:01 and 2021:12. The augmented Dickey-Fuller test of unit root is to check the stationary of money supply growth and food inflation. Thereafter, an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) model is specified in order to capture both contemporaneous and effects of money supply on food inflation and the model is estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation technique. The results reveal that money supply has contemporaneous effect on food inflation. No evidence of lagged effect is found. It is therefore concluded that controlling the growth in money supply is an effective measure to control food inflation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deteriorated power system components have a higher probability of failure than new components. Still, reliability of supply analyses traditionally model all components of the same type with the same probability of failure, and thus neglects the effect of deteriorated components. This paper presents a methodology to integrate a condition dependent component probability of failure model into a power system reliability analysis. The component state is described by a semi-Markov process, and the paper shows how this, under reasonable assumptions, can be approximated by a Markov process. The Markov assumption simplifies the analysis and allows the model to include preventive retirement and be calibrated to statistical data. A case study using statistical data for Norwegian power transformers shows that, in the Norwegian power system, the proportion of failures that are due to poor condition is small, partly due to the common strategy of preventive retirement. However, if the condition of the transformers were worse, the impact of poor condition can be considerable. The methodology further enables identification of the transformers that contribute most to the risk to reliability of supply. The paper thus highlights the importance of accounting for component condition in strategic decisions such as long-term renewal planning.&lt;br&gt;</jats:p>"

As part of the circular economy, supply chains are converted into closed-loop supply chains as this prevents non-recoverable waste and is thus more sustainable than traditional linear supply chains. The reverse supply chain is the part of the closed-loop supply chain that represents the phase whereby goods, at the end of their life span, are sent to a recycling or recovery facility. It is essential that goods in reverse supply chains reach their destination instead of being discarded along the way. In this article the authors presume that the current compensation systems in the international transport conventions discourage carriers or participants to close the material loop. The reason for this is that the compensation systems in international transport conventions are primarily based on the value of the transported goods. Because an inherent characteristic of goods in a reverse supply chain is that they have a negligible or low value, a financial incentive is lacking for the carrier to take care of the goods and make sure they reach their destination. The authors found several solutions to overcome these flaws. One is including a financial incentive in the transport conventions by making use of the principles for determining the customs value of imported goods. Taking a bottom-up or top-down approach are two other solutions explored in this article. In the case of the bottom-up approach, private parties include different contract models to facilitate the successful closed material loop, whereas the top-down approach introduces legal instruments to governments to intervene if the value for the compensation between the parties is too low.</jats:p>"

Green customer integration partially mediates the influence of SSCF adoption on firm performance. Green supplier integration partially mediates the effect of SSCF adoption on environmental performance, but does not mediate the effect of SSCF adoption on financial performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Geomorphic systems are affected by climate forcing and sediment supply. Due to non-linear relationships of forcings and sediment mobilization, it is debated whether environmental signals are preserved in such systems, or if they are rather dampened or shredded in the sediment output. Tracing the cause and effect in such systems is commonly impossible to do from observations alone. Therefore, numerical models are interesting to study geomorphic system behavior. We use a modeling chain consisting of the SedCas sediment cascade model (Bennett et al., 2014; Hirschberg et al., 2021) and the AWE-GEN stochastic weather generator (Fatichi et al., 2011), which has been calibrated for a debris-flow catchment in the Swiss Alps, the Illgraben, and used for climate change impact assessment (Hirschberg et al., 2021). Here we use this modeling setup to study the long-term behavior of such a system under consideration of different mean erosion rates and sediment production mechanisms. This numerical experiment is unique because we conducted simulations at high temporal resolution (hourly) while also spanning geological time scales (10k years).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We show that the analysis of short sediment records is characterized by high uncertainties and that especially supply-limited systems are at risk to have underestimated mean sediment. This is in concert with field observations on short- and long-term erosion rates from other basins, and can be attributed to transient hillslope sediment supply to the channel. Furthermore, we demonstrate how large hillslope landslides, or the absence of sediment supply, introduce long-term memory effects which can be quantified in the sediment yield. This long-term memory increases uncertainty and reduces interannual variability in annual sediment yields. Interestingly, details of the actual timing of sediment supply events are shredded and have no discernible impact on sediment yields at the outlet. The study highlights the need of characterizing variability in erosional events with regard to their stochastic nature. Furthermore, these results will corroborate the analysis of erosion rates, support decision making and decrease the risk of misinterpretation both in natural hazard and climate change impact assessment, especially if they are based on short records.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;REFERENCES&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Bennett, G.

High concentration sediment transport may exist during flash floods, and performs unsteady supply process in channels. Based on laboratory experiments, this paper analyzed the responses of riverbed elevation and water level to unsteady sediment supply. The unsteady sediment supply is described as a single triangular sediment process. The sediment supply rate of all tests is greater than the sediment transport capacity of the flow. Results show that the riverbed deposits and water level rises continuously during sediment supply, while the flow depth decreases correspondingly. The greater the rate of sediment supply, the faster the rising of riverbed elevation and water level. After the sediment supply ended, the deposited bed degraded and the rising water level decreased. Compared with the constant sediment supply, the riverbed elevation and water level under unsteady sediment supply rise greatly. In addition, it is found that the flow discharge with saturated sediment supply is much less than that without sediment supply in the same water level. Because the concentration sediment transport increases the flow resistance and then makes the water level sharply rise. The study highlighted the important effects of the unsteady sediment supply on bed morphology and water level surge in water and sediment disasters, and enhanced the understanding of the mechanism caused by the sharply rise of water level in flash floods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Large wood (LW) has earned increased attention as a component of fluvial systems as its ecological and physical benefits, as well as its contributions to damages during flood events, have been realized. As LW found in river networks had originated from outside of the channel corridor, significant efforts have been made to identify recruitment processes that supply LW to channels. Evidence has proved treefall, landslides, bank erosion, debris flows, and fluvial entrainment contribute to LW recruitment. Prediction and identification of the areas prone to these processes are very challenging but could serve to better understand wood dynamics. Therefore, identifying areas prone to recruitment processes, estimating available LW, and determining LW connections in a watershed will help design management strategies aimed at mitigating LW&amp;amp;#8217;s impacts as well as provide insight on the movement and recruitment of LW in fluvial systems. Analogous challenges exist when dealing with sediment dynamics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We applied the graph theory (GT) to instream LW supply and transfer. A GT is a set of nodes representing different entities (i.e., wood sources) with edges connecting nodes based on determined relationships (i.e., wood recruitment processes). The GT proves useful in exploring landscape connectivity with the capability of identifying critical nodes or regions, measuring properties of connectivity, identifying process coupling based on spatial patterns, and defining related geomorphological processes such as that of sediment cascades in which landscape components are coupled based on properties effecting sediment transfer.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;GT proves capable of defining connections between LW recruitment from hillslopes to the channel and from channel segment to channel segment. Currently, the fuzzy logic toolbox presented by Ruiz-Villanueva and Stoffel (2018) has been utilized to delineate the connected, recruitment process prone areas for landslides, debris flows, and bank erosion in the study area of Vallon de Nant, Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. The delineated areas have been used in ArcPro in coalition with vegetation data to extract hillslope-to-channel connections and channel-to-channel connections. The channel or fluvial network has been segmented based on the presence of features which reduce downstream transfer of LW such as channel widening and presence of obstructions. The determined connections will be applied in the R package, igraph, to extract network properties of the constructed, instream LW GT model.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;GT aids complex network analyses by providing a technique which retains only the critical information. Therefore, following the rigorous work of determining the system components, connections, and constructing the graph model, additional analysis can be performed with streamlined performance. Through our graph representation of instream LW supply and transfer, we plan to use the mathematical framework and algorithms from graph theory to further our understanding of instream LW such as the likely origins based on cost analysis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8220;This work is supported by the SNSF Eccellenza project PCEFP2-186963 and the University of Lausanne.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ruiz-Villanueva, V., Stoffel, M.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"tr\">Purpose- The aim of the research is to examine, analyze and provide insight into possible future projections of Turkey's role in the security of energy supply and the formation of new trade routes of the European Union (E.U.) after the Ukraine-Russia war within the scope of data obtained from experts. In addition, the current research has been understood that the EastMed project has reached a stalemate with Turkey's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) agreement with Libya and has emerged due to the necessity of new solutions. In addition, turkey's strong position is mentioned, emphasizing that it is an important stakeholder in world politics and trade.\nMethodology-   Since research requires expertise in a particular field, it is determined according to the purpose and scope of the research to be carried out with a specific focus group. The experts in the focus group were reached by the snowball sampling method. In this context, an in-depth interview technique from qualitative data analysis methods was carried out to a group of experts in international relations, international trade, and logistics departments. The research data were obtained from the faculty members and faculty members included in the group between 28.02.2022-09.03.2022 through Google Docs, and the analysis process was started.\nFindings- When the data obtained from the experts included in the research are examined, the perspective against the Tr-Med project, which is the recommendation of the research, is very positive. One reason is that the EastMed project is already known to be unsustainable, and in addition, the United States has withdrawn its support from the project. It can also be seen as the E.U.'s production of alternatives to existing energy supply processes in order to ensure energy supply security after the Ukraine-Russia war. In addition to the Tr-Med project, it is foreseen that the main routes of east-west-axis trade will shift to Turkey due to future sanctions against Russia.\nConclusion- Turkey is foreseen to continue their union in the future because it is already a stakeholder of the E.U. in the TANAP project, has a partner in imports and exports, and is an actor who will play a role in the process of establishing relations with countries such as Iran, Israel, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Qatar in the supply of energy supplies. However, the increase in freight prices in the post-COVID-19 period increased transportation costs, and in addition, the increase in raw material prices caused global inflation. With the Ukraine-Russia war, the price of crude oil at $130, experts say, will see $300 in oil in the future, which will make Turkey the E.U.'s manufacturing hub.\n\nKeywords: Energy security, pipeline, Eastern Mediterranean, naturel gas, Silk Road, one belt and one road ınitiative\nJEL Codes: F4, L8, N4\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Water utilities around the globe are facing an extraordinary demand for the secure supply of potable water as a result of population growth, urbanisation and climate change. New knowledge, technologies and systems-based approaches are urgently needed to adaptively optimise resource capacity, operations and assets utilisation during a time of escalating environmental, regulatory and financial pressures.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;This presentation summarises fundamental mathematical and engineering challenges for the design, optimisation and control of next generation water supply networks. These networks dynamically change connectivity (topology), hydraulic conditions and operational objectives. The design and control of dynamically adaptive water supply networks aims to improve pressure management, resilience, efficiency, incident management and sustainability.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The current ability of complex water networks to dynamically adapt their connectivity, operational conditions and application objectives is extremely limited. Water supply networks are operated as disjointed (or loosely coupled) sub-systems that have evolved over many years. The operational practice of sub-dividing water supply networks into small discrete areas, District Metered Areas (DMAs), has been successfully implemented by the UK water industry to reduce leakage in excess of 30% in the last 25 years. A DMA has a fixed network topology with permanent boundaries, typically a single inlet and it includes between 1,000 and 3,000 customer connections. By closing boundary valves to form small metered areas, the natural redundancy of connectivity and supply within large looped networks is severely reduced; thus affecting operational resilience, water quality and energy losses. Consequently, the implementation of DMAs has introduced operational constraints that affect both consumers and utilities. Furthermore, these constraints are beginning to inflict financial penalties upon water utilities through recently introduced performance indicators.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;The dynamically adaptive sectorisation and configurability of water supply networks that we have pioneered combines the benefits of the traditional DMA approach for leakage management with the advantages of substantially improved resilience and considerably enhanced management of pressure, energy, failure incidents and water quality. This operational method includes the replacement of a subset of kept-shut boundary and control valves with self-powered network controllers with varying modulation functions. The controllers modify the network connectivity and continuously monitor and control the hydrodynamic conditions. To enable this new approach, we have been developing novel monitoring, modelling and control methods and technologies. We have been extensively evaluating these in operational networks.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this presentation, we summarise design-for-control strategies to improve the pressure management and resilience of sectorized water distribution networks (WDN). We formulate the mathematical optimization problems and describe solution methods for the resulting large-scale non-linear (NLP) and multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programs. We also discuss analytical and engineering challenges for the scalable implementation of these methods.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two years-plus into a global pandemic, we all have experienced the fragility and uncertainty that dogs the global supply chain for lifestyle goods and services. Remember last year when you couldn’t find a multipack of toilet paper to save your life? Or maybe you’re currently in the market for a vehicle, so you visit your local dealership—and find that the lot that’s normally awash with shiny, new vehicles … has three. And though they carry a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of about $25,000, they are being offered for well in excess of $30,000. These supply-and-demand anomalies can be directly attributed to disruptions in the supply chain—whether it’s manufacturing woes such as parts shortages or logistical snarls with goods stacked up at ports for a lack of dockworkers or truck drivers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>These same types of supply chain challenges that affect us on a personal level can also do a number on industries. For oil and gas, the situation is unique. The symbiotic relationship between oil companies and oilfield service (OFS) companies has run hot and cold for decades. Oil company supply chains are directly tied to those service companies that provide the tools and equipment required for oil and gas extraction and production. When things go sideways, service companies have historically retained much of the contractual risk. However, that doesn’t change the fact that when service companies are impacted by shortages, so are their clients.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This past year, as oil prices rebounded from pandemic lows and global demand started to creep back up, OFS companies were faced with overcoming gaps in the supply chain at their expense—some of which continue today.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>“Supply chain and inflationary pressures also drove higher costs and delivery issues primarily across our OFS and DS [digital services] product companies,” Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive at Baker Hughes, told investors in January. “Our teams have continued to work to offset some of these pressures, but we expect to continue to see some level of tension and disruption in these areas potentially through the first half of the year.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Those impacts place pressure on profit margins for OFS companies, and oil companies will fight to keep their costs from increasing, which could create a tenuous scenario for 2022.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Many of the supply chain disruptions affecting Baker Hughes stem from logistics, some shortages more broadly, and disruptions in shipments. The company is offsetting the impact by employing new shipping routes and increasing lead times on specific items.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>“Right now, pretty much about 90% of our suppliers are giving us 1-year lead times, and we have all of our 2022 on order there. To give you some perspective, if I go back 7 months, that 90% was about 20 to 30%,” said Simonelli. “That’s really what’s going on in the industry. We are planning for it. We’re working through it and operating in this new normal.”</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Baker Hughes is far from the only oilfield service firm being affected by the “new normal.” Many are experiencing increasing delays in the delivery of tubulars, meters, and other basic oilfield equipment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n        <jats:p>This article focuses on the strategic issue of an agile supply chain. Different goals are considered in supply chain design. Today, the concept of sustainability in supply chains plays an important role in goal setting. In general, sustainability leads to less economic, social, and environmental risks, and attention to this type of sustainability covers many criteria in the literature. Therefore, in this study, optimization of the stability of a supply chain network has been considered. In addition, a lesser-known aspect of sustainability, the political aspect, has been added to the previous aspects. This paper assumes four levels, namely supplier, wholesaler, retailer, and customer. An optimal network structure is designed to consider economic, social and environmental sustainability and the new measure of political sustainability. The design of this supply chain is done by defining a mathematical model that has several objective functions, including economic, political, and environmental goals. These objective functions select the relationships and links between the levels in a supply chain network. For this purpose, a directional graph corresponding to a supply chain is designed. Then, with the help of an ideal multi-objective planning problem, an optimal configuration is obtained, which is a subgraph of the main network graph. The target problem has been modeled for a holding company which is a supply chain for Covid-19 drugs. Then the problem was solved using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) metaheuristics algorithm and NSGAII multi-objective genetic algorithm. A comparison was carried out between these two methods and the results indicated that MOPSO performed better.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Slow and fast fashion companies and their supply chains can learn a lot from each other. The fast fashion business model is often associated with short lead times, while the slow fashion business model is deemed to be more sustainable in nature. Therefore, many people believe that fast fashion companies do not have enough time to be concerned with the sustainability of their practices. This study seeks to determine whether fast fashion companies should be more concerned about the sustainability of their production. The findings show, among other things, that these fast fashion companies are also getting better in terms of building their business sustainability. This becomes clear when a total of 20 slow and 20 fast fashion companies are analyzed using the triple bottom line approach. As a result, it is safe to say that fashion companies' business models do not define whether or not they are concerned about the sustainability of their practices. Rather, it is each company's awareness of the environment that motivates them to implement sustainable, eco-friendly practices in their operations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The European Green Deal (EGD) is a development strategy aimed at transforming the European Union into a the world's first climate-neutral area. The way to achieve this goal is a low-emission energy transformation, which should end in 2050, but the first milestones should be achieved already in 2030. Following the dynamically accelerating EU climate and energy trends will be a significant transformation challenge for Poland. The strategies proposed in the EGD will have a significant impact on key areas of the national economy (energy system, construction, industry, transport, households), including the level of supply and demand for many mineral raw materials. The most visible changes will be registered in the group of fossil fuels, but also regarding metallic raw materials, which will be associated with the development of advanced technologies for renewable energy sources.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A crucial breakthrough in the Polish energy transformation was the country's accession to the declaration of resignation from the coal exploitation, which Poland signed during the World Climate Summit in 2021. According to the social contract, the last hard coal mine in Poland will be closed by 2049. Thus, for the first time Poland was on the list of countries that officially confirm the withdrawal from coal. The resignation from this raw material is also included in the Polish Energy Policy 2040, according to which hard coal will be replaced by natural gas, nuclear energy and renewable energy. As a consequence, an increase in demand for both natural gas and nuclear fuels, should be expected. It should be noted that Poland does not have its own fossil nuclear fuel sources, and the domestic extraction of natural gas covers only 13% of the demand. In both cases an increasing demand for fuels should be assumed in the coming decades. Crude oil is also in the group of fuels sensitive to changes resulting from EGD. The main sector of the Polish economy in which petroleum products are consumed is transport. The development of electromobility, the use of biocomponents and alternative fuels will be the most important factors influencing changes in the level of demand for crude oil in the next 10-20 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The EGD strategy will play an important role in changing the structure of demand for metallic raw materials, both in terms of their quality and quantity. It should be emphasized that Poland has the largest copper ores deposits in Europe. In recent decades, the Polish production has accounted for nearly 50% of the total copper ore concentrates production and for more than 20% of the total refined copper production in the EU. Development of demand for this raw material is related to the scale of use of refined copper, among others in renewable energy (wind power and photovoltaics) and electromobility, which are the pillars of EGD. Unfortunately, practically all other metals important in development of renewable energy sources in Poland (e.g. cobalt, nickel, manganese, lithium, REEs, silicon) are completely deficit for the Polish economy due to lack economically feasible domestic sources.&amp;amp;#160;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Many people are competing to open a restaurant because food is a basic need that must be met by humans, so opening a restaurant will certainly provide many benefits for restaurant owners. In a restaurant business process, of course, it involves many roles such as the role of a waiter, the role of a chef, the internal role of the raw material stock section, and so on are interrelated and must be synchronized. However, in practice, restaurants still use conventional methods that are inefficient, effective, and structured. Some restaurants in the city of Medan only use conventional records both in ordering and recording raw material stocks so that errors often occur due to the inaccurate calculation process. In addition, the business processes in a restaurant are still not well structured between each working part so that ordering errors often occur. Therefore, research will be conducted to build a restaurant information system using the Supply Chain Management method. The results showed that the application of the Supply Chain Management method to the restaurant information system that was built was proven to be able to integrate all parts of the restaurant business properly so as to prevent errors from occurring by every party working in the restaurant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As businesses see the value of developing an integrated relation with their suppliers and customers, supply chain management has become a significant problem in many sectors. Supply chain management which includes Warehousing and Logistics has evolved into a strategy for boosting competitiveness by lowering uncertainty and increasing customer service. While logistics handles the practical aspects of storing and delivering the items kept in a warehouse, warehousing focuses on the secure storage of commodities inside a structure. Over time, majority of businesses have concentrated their emphasis on the effectiveness and efficiency of these business processes. However, an increasing number of companies are starting to see the strategic significance of planning, managing, and creating a supply chain as a new way to conduct business. This paper summarises previous efforts on supply chain modelling and identifies key challenges and  opportunities related to supply chain modelling. This is to assist firms in capturing the cohesiveness of inter- functional and inter-organizational integration and coordination across the supply chain network and to  subsequently make better supply chain decisions. The service process, arrival process, number of system locations, number of servers and the number of customers, who may be people, data packets, automobiles, are some of the variables that we have taken into consideration while writing this research paper.

The use of BDA brings the digital transformation of FSCs closer providing sustainable implications and added value to their operation. Harnessing BD’s potential is becoming more and more relevant in addressing the constantly evolving complexities in food systems. However, the field of BD applications in the FSCM domain is severely fragmented and relatively “primitive”. The present research is one of the earliest attempts to recognize and present a comprehensive analysis for the BD applications across different segments of FSC proposing a conceptual framework that illustrates the role of BD in a data-driven FSCM environment. For the purposes of our research, we adopted the systematic literature review (SLR) method aiming at the identification of the dominant categories and themes within the research area. Based on the SLR findings, we propose a conceptual framework that captures the interconnection between FSC performance and BD applications by using the input-process-output (IPO) model within a data-driven FSCM context. The main research contribution lies on the thematic classification of relevant research, the conceptualization of this fragmented field, the development of a conceptual framework, and the presentation of a future research agenda pertaining to BD applications in a data-driven FSCM context.</jats:p>"

The following is a balance sheet of our efforts, demonstrating the instances when we were able to realize our goals, as well as critiquing our limitations.

However, the supply of Co is prone to severe fluctuation, disruption, and price instabilities. This review aims to identify the future evolution of Co supply through technologically resilient and environmentally sustainable pathways. The work shows that advances in both primary and secondary sources, Co mining methods and recycling systems are yet to be fully optimised. Moreover, responsible sourcing from both large mines and small artisanal mines will be necessary for a resilient Co supply. Regulatory approaches may increase transparency, support local mining communities, and improve secondary Co recovery. Novel Co supply options, such as deep-sea mining and bio-mining of tailings, are associated with major techno-economic and environmental issues. However, a circular economy, keeping Co in the economic loop for as long as possible, is yet to be optimised at both regional and global scales. To achieve environmental sustainability of Co, economic incentives, regulatory push, and improved public perception are required to drive product innovation and design for circularity. Although the complexity of Co recycling, due to lack of standardisation of design and chemistry in batteries, is an impediment, a sustainable net zero transition using Co will only be possible if a reliable primary supply and a circular secondary supply are established.</jats:p>"

This has prompted researchers to search for new, more experimental, inexhaustible sources of energy that can be sustained for the foreseeable future. At this point, many agree that renewable energy is the way forward. The crux of the issue however lies in what source should be used, which technology should be adopted and what factors associated with generation, transmission and distribution should be considered in order to create the most robust energy policy applicable on a large scale but with enough room to be reinterpreted and adapted to a particular country or business.

Since 2017 a large numbers of forest companies in northern Iran have struggling with providing enough wood supply to retain their production-line demands as a result of the logging ban policy over commercial forests. Therefore, they have to buy commercial logs from far-distance domestic plantation and low-quality timbers, either from legitimate or illegitimate sources. This will negatively affect transportation and unit delivery cost of raw materials. The current study is aimed to provide an integrated modeling approach to analyze the current supply-chain network and propose possible logistic scenarios to improve inbound logistics. The model was applied to a realistic wood supply-chain network of 23,000 km² with 172 forest companies which stretch across 20 cities in Mazandaran province, located in northern Iran. To do so, supply sites, demand locations, cost data (transport, loading and unloading type of machine, etc.) and assortment types were collected. Then, an optimization model with in inventory management was formulated to integrate this information and provide an optimal solution. The results showed that the demand portfolio of the studied logistic network consisted of sawlogs (38%), low-quality timbers (15%) and farm-tree pruning woods (45%). Illegitimated timbers provided 22% of the small-sized mill’s demands, while the rest came from legal sources and/or wood yard terminals. The use of wood-yard terminal instead of purchasing woods from illegitimate wood dealers led to a saving of US$1.29 of available tonnes of wood fibers. We assessed the sensitivity of the solution, such as changing in the policy of illegitimate woods, which shows a significant effect on the total cost of network.</jats:p>"

This book offers a succinct list of essential elements for effectively mentoring oneself—especially during difficult times. They are designed to help shape the right attitude (clarity balanced with kindness) toward improving self-exploration and enhancing personal understanding. Following this, 50 brief lessons and illustrative stories are offered with the belief that it is not the amount of darkness in the world or people that is crucial; it is how people stand in that darkness (having a healthy perspective) that makes all the difference. The main topics include unlearning, preventing loss of emotional energy, self-forgiveness, toxic compassion, detachment, posttraumatic growth, the four types of friends needed in a strong interpersonal network, and inhabiting and modeling unpopular strengths. Underlying the contents and philosophy of the book is that vulnerability cannot, and should not, be ignored, avoided, or escaped. Instead, it needs to be psychologically inhabited with a spirit of humility because when one takes knowledge and adds humility, one gets wisdom. And, when one takes this very wisdom and adds it to compassion—including self-compassion—one gets the love that is at the heart of a rich and caring life.</jats:p>",

Most investigations have been carried out on the scour process at a uniform pier. However, in reality, many bridge piers behave as non-uniform depending on the exposure of their foundation into the flow field. All the experimental investigations were carried out in the present study to understand the effect of pier geometry, the position of footing top with respect to bed level, and sediment mixtures (uniform and non-uniform) on local scour under clear water conditions. A total of 106 experiments were conducted in the present study with a different combination of pier models, sediment mixture, and footing top with respect to bed. A maximum scour depth model was developed using 182 data points consisting of experimental data (106) and extracted from the literature (76). To develop a model, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) based modeling technique known as gene expression programming (GEP) was employed in this study. The GEP model was developed by using 130 data points and independent 52 data points for the model validation. The performance of the proposed scour model for the compound bridge pier was found to be satisfactory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;During 2017-2018, the City of Cape Town, South Africa faced an unprecedented drought crisis with the six main water storages supplying Cape Town falling to a combined capacity of just under 20%. Throughout the crisis, groundwater was considered the most important alternative urban water supply source but also the most vulnerable to contamination through accidental return flows from the municipal network, private residences and agricultural industries. This project aimed to constrain the stable isotope chemistry of the water supply network in the Stellenbosch municipality and monitor the augmentation of groundwater into the network using stable isotopes. Long-term monitoring points have been established at 35 tap water sites, 20 private wells as well as at the 3 supply reservoirs that feed the municipal network. Rainwater (4 locations) and local surface water (6 locations) were also monitored over the one-year sampling period in 2021. Preliminary data show distinct isotopic signals associated with each supply reservoir as well as in the local groundwater. Rainfall is predominantly received in the winter season (May-Aug) and typically has more negative isotope delta values. Typical residence times in storage dams and reservoirs appear to be between 2-3 weeks in the winter and 3-4 weeks in the summer, according to stable isotope hydrograph separations. Domestic water supply is consolidated at 2 water treatment facilities in Stellenbosch, where isotope values of all 3 supply reservoirs mix. The amounts of water received from each reservoir changes throughout the year according to dam levels, this change is evident in the stable isotope values at the tap water sample locations. The data also shows significant return flow into the alluvial aquifer system during warmer months when private stakeholders&amp;amp;#8217; water consumption is at its highest. Groundwater is expected to supplement this urban supply network in Q1-2 of 2022 and will likely disrupt the current distribution of stable isotopes in the network, providing further insight into the potential return flow into the local groundwater system. For longer term monitoring, tap water locations that receive the same supply have been identified and single locations (8 in total) have been selected to monitor through 2022 to optimise the monitoring network. Similarly, only 4 rainfall collection sites will continue monitoring. Interested stakeholders and policy makers include municipal supply managers as well as local farmers and industry that can use this data to develop water management strategies and identify areas where leaks or overuse is likely. Hydrograph separations would be more accurate with longer term monitoring rainfall, reservoir and tap water by identifying trends in storage residence time, mixing and release schedules throughout the supply systems. Although the data indicates that there are return flows into local groundwater, these results could not distinguish the mechanisms by which water is entering the system. Further monitoring in targeted areas is needed to constrain if return flows originate from leaks, irrigation or other urban recharge processes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Two cases were analysed: when an additional superconducting element was included in the conventional power supply system and when the total power supply system was made of a superconductor. The analysis was carried out by simulating the cooperation of the arc receiver with its simplified power supply system in Matlab Simulink software. The characteristics of the changes of the arc current, its conductance and voltage as a function of the arc length changes for selected superconductor parameters, i.e., different values of the critical current and different values of the resistance in the resistive state, are given. The time courses of these quantities as well as the courses of resistance changes in the superconductor at randomly varying arc lengths are presented. The analysis showed that by selecting the critical current and resistance in the resistive state of the superconductor, arc parameters such as arc current drawn and arc conductance can be influenced. By making the entire power system from a superconductor, the arc current can be increased by 1.8% for a 1 cm arc and by 1% for a 1 cm arc. The ability of the superconductor to lose its superconducting state and return to that state can be used to limit the value of the current drawn by the arc over certain ranges of arc length. The range of these lengths can be controlled by selecting the value of the critical current of the superconductor. By selecting the resistance of the superconductor in the resistive state, the value of the limited current can be influenced. In the case studied, for a 1 cm arc length, an arc current 45% lower was obtained when the superconductor was in the resistive state.</jats:p>"

The results show that the cost function of VVSCND is almost 0.04% greater than VSCND without risk and worst case. If the conservative coefficient increases up to 50%, the cost function will change 0.04%, but the time solution changes slightly. By growing 10% for agility coefficient, the cost function changed 0.34%. In addition, growing the resiliency coefficient increases the cost function, too. When the scale of problems increases, the time solution and cost function increase.<jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic>Finally, this research suggests sustainability, agility, and resiliency for VSCND by considering risk and robustness for the first time. These requirements include CO2 emission, flexible capacity with reliable facilities and responsive SCND. As a result, we, as researchers and designers of SC, try to apply this type of VSCND to delivering vaccines on time because it causes to face pandemics and epidemics like COVID-19 as well as possible. It is possible to consider viability to increase cost, but we complied with sustainable, resiliency, and agility requirements. Effect of this form designing is a long time and decrease CO2 emissions, improve the level of responding to citizen and customers. Therefore, as a designer of VVSCND, we suggest to healthcare managers to use and apply comprehensive designing like VVSCND.</jats:p>"

This effect has been suggested to result from stimulation of coupling efficiency of skeletal muscle oxidative phosphorylation by reduced nitrate derivatives. In this paper, we report the acute effects of sodium nitrite on the bioenergetic behaviour of L6 myocytes. At odds with improved efficiency of mitochondrial ATP synthesis, extracellular flux analysis reveals that a ½-hour exposure to NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (0.1 – 5 µM) significantly decreases mitochondrial coupling efficiency in static myoblasts and tends to lower it in spontaneously contracting myotubes. Unexpectedly, NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> stimulates the rate of glycolytic ATP production in both myoblasts and myotubes. Increased ATP supply through glycolysis does not emerge at the expense of oxidative phosphorylation, which means that NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> acutely increases the rate of overall myocellular ATP synthesis, highly significantly so in myoblasts and tending towards significance in contractile myotubes. Notably, NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exposure shifts myocytes to a more glycolytic phenotype. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption does not decrease after NaNO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exposure, and non-mitochondrial respiration tends to drop.

Building energy consumption is one of the major sources of global warming, which can be controlled with renewable energy installations. This paper deals with an advanced evacuated hybrid solar photovoltaic–thermal collector (PVT) for simultaneous production of electricity and domestic hot water (DHW) with lower carbon emissions. Most PVT projects focus on increasing electricity production by cooling the photovoltaic (PV). However, in this research, increasing thermal efficiency is investigated through vacuum glass tube encapsulation. The required area for conventional unglazed PVT systems varies between 1.6–2 times of solar thermal collectors for similar thermal output. In the case of encapsulation, the required area can decrease by minimizing convective losses from the system. Surprisingly, the electrical efficiency was not decreased by encapsulating the PVT system. The performance of evacuated PVT is compared to glazed and unglazed PVTs, and the result shows a 40% increase in thermal performance with the proposed system.

Most of the scholarly articles were mainly focused on content analysis to discuss aspects of the research related to COVID-19 and supply chain management. The literature reviews with the bibliometric method involving supply chain management in the COVID-19 context are still scarce. In this paper, we undertook a bibliometric analysis of the research on COVID-19 and supply chain management, finding a total of 257 papers published in 2020 and 2021 to determine the thematic direction of the related flourish of research. The analysis used a combination of bibliographic and network analysis to capture the direction the research has been taking. The study identified the most highly productive authors, prominent journals, and geographic centers of publications about this phenomenon. It also examined networks related to co-authorship, countries of collaboration, co-citations and highly cited authors, and co-wording. The examination identified four thematic clusters, comprised of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains, the improvement of supply chain resilience for viability, technology and innovation for supply chain sustainability, and supply chain risk management in response to COVID-19. These findings support the need for further investigation into supply chain management, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains, and, more broadly, supply chain resilience.</jats:p>"

The results show that two transformations are needed to achieve a local food system: changing the supply chain system to one that is shorter and more structured and increasing quality consistency. Recommendations are presented in the form of a series of human activity systems to achieve transformations. Human activities to achieve a shorter and structured supply chain involve building cooperation, operating operational activities to add value, product identification, promotion, and developing fair-trade contracts. Human activities required to achieve transformation of increasing quality consistency include identifying high-demand customer requirements, forecasting, scheduling planting, and harvesting, improving training, cooperating with research institutions, farmer assistance, and quality inspection.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Antarctic Bottom Water has experienced a marked contraction and warming, particularly in the Atlantic sector, in the past three decades. Much of the global abyssal waters are composed of this bottom water and these changes have seen concomitant ocean heating and global sea level rise via thermal expansion. This warming has been linked to a contraction in export of the densest classes of bottom water from the Weddell Gyre due to processes that are not well determined but potentially including changes in wind forcing or source water formation. With regard to wind forcing, several mechanisms have been suggested, however their relative scale and whether they occur concurrently remains unclear. Using two mooring sites within the Weddell Sea, we estimate lag times between temperature anomalies at 3000m depth finding changes in the strength of the boundary current connecting the two sites. These changes in flow speed are synchronous with changes in wind forcing and bottom water transport. In particular, bottom water temperatures increased in response to anomalously strong wind forcing in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2018 over a period of six months, indicating a contraction in export of the most dense water classes from the Antarctic. These findings reaffirm the importance of wind forcing in driving changes in the export of dense water to the lower limb of the Atlantic overturning circulation, with potential consequences for long-period climate evolution.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Selection committees deciding on film grants consist, to a large extent, of industry veterans who tend to prefer projects that seem familiar to them. In this study, we have drawn on the concepts of homophily and network theory to systematically study the impact of film subsidies in two empirical studies conducted in Germany. First, we had conducted interviews with film producers about their experiences while applying for a film grant and how this has changed over time. The results suggest an inter-organizational isomorphism resulting from a reproduction of norms and judgements. One mechanism at work here might be newcomers’ adjustments and the self-affirmation of veteran producers. Second, we had conducted a network analysis to assess how being connected to others, particularly members of a funding committee, affects a grant sum for a film. The more a film crew is connected to other industry professionals, the higher the amount of funding received; the presence of a former, current or future committee member on a film crew also enhances the sum. We conclude that the way German film funding is designed does not promote innovation or diversity as policy goals but serves as a means of self-reproduction of industry standards.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, global pharmaceutical value chains have been actively developing. Formed close cross-country and inter-sectoral ties contributed the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the functioning of global pharmaceutical chains. The effects of Covid-19 were overlapped previously emerging trends towards defragmentation of global pharmaceutical production. The aim of this paper is to identify possible firm strategies and models for restructuring pharmaceutical chains aimed at increasing their resilience in response to the damaging effects of Covid-19. We suppose that the resilience of the chain as a whole depends on the resilience of its separate links, and we show that the restructuring of pharmaceutical chains takes place in the form of the so-called “link” restructuring (restructuring of separate links of the chain). The paper highlights such models of “link” restructuring of sectoral cross-border chain as “zero” restructuring (stock creation); localization (including import substitution); migration (including reshoring and regionalization); globalization, which operate both in the short and long term periods. The multistage nature of global pharmaceutical chains, as well as the dynamic development of pharmaceutical outsourcing processes, have created favorable opportunities for “link” restructuring. At the same time, the features of restructuring were influenced by various factors, among which the degree of technology intensity of the pharmaceutical chain takes a key place. The paper proposes one of the possible classifications of pharmaceutical chains depending on the technologies used, where the following are distinguished: low-tech and medium-low-tech chains (production of essential pharmaceutical goods); medium-high-tech chains (production of generics); high-tech chains (production of patented drugs, production of biopharmaceuticals, production of medical equipment). The main conclusion the author comes is as follows: the higher the technology intensity of the pharmaceutical chain, the less defragmentation of pharmaceutical production will take place. Thus, in the production of high-tech biopharmaceutical goods, the most needed strategies will be regionalization and globalization of the chain links, while in the production of essential pharmaceutical goods, the strategy of localization and import substitution will be very successful (especially in the short term). This is due to the fact that as the technological effectiveness of the pharmaceutical chain increases, investment costs grow, which makes the efficiency of the chain’s functioning no less important than its resilience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Water scarcity is a serious socio-environmental challenge for sustainable development which is recognized as a potential cause of social conflict within and between countries. It is expected to intensify due to increasing water demands from increasing populations, rapid urbanization, industrialization, and climate changes. With predictions of dire global water scarcity, attention is turning to Unconventional Water Resources (UWRs) which are considered as supplementary water resources that need specialized processes to be used as water supply. The literature encompasses a vast number of studies on various UWRs and their usefulness in certain environmental and/or socio-economic contexts. Considering the increasing importance of UWRs in the global push for water security, the current study intends to offer a nuanced understanding of the existing research on UWRs by summarizing the key concepts in the literature. The number of articles published on UWRs have increased significantly over time and most publications were authored from researchers based in the USA or China, India, Iran, and Spain. Here, twelve general types of UWRs including fog, dew, rainwater harvesting, and cloud seeding as Atmospheric Unconventional Water (AUW); artificial recharge, fossil water as Unconventional Ground Water (UGW); iceberg water and virtual water as Transferred Unconventional Water (TUW), and wastewater, desalinated water, and agricultural drainage water as Processed Unconventional Water (PUW), were used to assess their global distribution, showing that climatic conditions are the main driver for the application of certain UWRs. Overall, the literature review demonstrated that, even though UWRs provide promising possibilities for overcoming water scarcity, current knowledge is patchy and points towards UWRs being, for the most part, limited in scope and applicability due to geographic, climatic, economic, and political constraints. Future studies focusing on improved quantitative documentation and demonstration of the physical and socio-economic potential of various UWRs could help in strengthening the case for some, if not all, UWRs as avenues for the sustainable provision of water.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Keywords:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Water scarcity;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;UWRs; distribution maps; literature review&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The flow by crossing over the inflatable weir and colliding with the surface of the downstream stilling basin loses its energy by about 10–85%. The relative horizontal distance of the projectile-jet from the crest varies between 1.6 and 2.8.

In the Maroni River Basin, as in many transboundary river basins of the world, socio-political borders criss-cross through natural ecosystems and hence intersect through ecological boundaries. As neighbouring countries share ecosystems, they also share inherent ecosystem processes, functions and, hence, the ecosystem services (ES) that these areas provide. However, life and land uses are changing in the river basin. A growing need for land, urbanization, a decrease of shifting cultivation patterns towards smallholder agriculture and a run for gold put pressure on natural ecosystems.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Our work on ES in this area was twofold: under the umbrella of the ECOSEO Project, we conducted a first ecosystem services assessment for the river basin, extracted from two national ES assessments on the base of Land Use Land Cover data. In participatory expert workshops in Paramaribo, Suriname and Cayenne, French Guiana, stakeholders from the territory assessed the capacity of abundant ecosystem types to supply 21 different ecosystem services using a matrix-based approach. A comparative assessment of workshop results showed that experts in both territories shared a similar understanding on ES supply capacities despite the different cultural and socio-political contexts of both territories. Whilst Suriname&amp;amp;#8217;s economy still depends on the primary sector and exploitation of natural resources, French Guiana as Outermost Region of the European Union has to adhere to the much stricter EU/French environmental legislation. Between 2015 to 2020, , land uses in Suriname changed much stronger then in French Guiana. Gold mining is the major driver for deforestation, especially on the Surinamese side of the river basin, followed by agricultural expansion. An overview of the ecosystem service bundles presents a snapshot of ecosystem service supply, and allows to quantify changes in ES supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expert-based matrix assessment showed direct changes in ES based on LULC changes, a qualitative assessment was added. We conducted 14 in depth interviews with local and indigenous population in the Upper Basin in 2019. Hereby, land use changes and their effects on ES supply were thematized. Illegal gold mining activities and intensification of agriculture were mentioned to contribute strongly to the degradation of ecosystems. Especially regulating ES in the Upper Maroni River were affected, with consequences on freshwater quality, supply of wild foods and fish and transportation for the entire lower River Basin.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As LULC changes, especially gold mining-related activities, on both sides of the river have a severe degrading effect on ecosystem condition and related ES supply, cross- or transboundary conservation efforts are needed to safeguard ecosystems and their services for the population on both sides of the Maroni River.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The assessment of surface-groundwater fluxes is crucial for understanding pollutant pathways through the natural environment. Several techniques to characterize these surface-subsurface interactions have been applied as an attempt to quantify these fluxes in the humid temperate Northeastern USA. Most recently, stable isotopes are considered to be an important tool to describe the movement of waters through the hydrosphere. This study was conducted in the Quabbin-Wachusett Reservoir System, which supplies water for the Boston Metropolitan Area in Massachusetts and depends on water quality management based on environmental trends. Recent trends indicate that despite efforts to reduce road salt application during the winter, salt indicator trends are still increasing in the watershed. Salt transport characterized by monitoring trends of specific conductivity and chloride across the watershed demonstrate that subsurface water concentrations are significantly higher than the streams and reservoir (for chloride, median value is 204 mg/L for wells and 102 mg/L for streams). The present investigation hypothesizes that salt infiltrates through the subsurface during the cold months (October-March) and then releases back to surface water throughout the year. Since groundwater can act as salt storage, an important question for water management relates to the timeframe needed to observe a reduction of salt presence in the watershed after road salt reduction policies and other mitigation strategies take place. To investigate this, oxygen isotopes are being used to identify the dominant hydrological pathways influencing groundwater recharge patterns.&amp;amp;#160; Stable water isotope compositions for warm precipitation (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O -2.14 to -8.98 per mille), cold precipitation (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O -4.57 to -13.57 per mille), and groundwater (&amp;amp;#948;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;18&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;O -8.27 to -9.66 per mille) were used to assess proportional recharge dominance via local winter and summer precipitation isotope end-members. Preliminary analyses indicate that the groundwater recharge is winter dominant (92% obtained from the winter bias seasonal recharge ratio Rwinter/Rannual; values &amp;gt;= 80% represent winter dominance), thus the applied road salt during cold months can be contributing to sustained increases in conductivity in the groundwater. The results show potential dynamics that explain higher levels of specific conductivity and chloride in the subsurface water and the continued increases in stream and reservoir concentrations. Further investigation is being conducted with larger datasets in order to have a better understanding of sample frequency needed to be representative of the system&amp;amp;#8217;s predominant seasonal recharge and runoff generation patterns, as well as, how the water isotopic composition is variable spatially and temporally in the region.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

These are presented as a panacea for the recovery of rural economies and, in general, of food system sustainability. In this context the short food supply chains (SFSCs) become relevant, as happens in Europe, where strategies and regulations designed on their implementation were adopted. Recognising that scientific research always plays an important role in guiding institutions’ choices in many fields, it seems important to focus on how SFSCs are considered in the European academic panorama. Therefore, this contribution presents a study performed on a sample of 108 papers published in journals during the last decade. The findings concerning the investigated issues and the approaches to analysing SFSC development and effects are reported from both the producer and consumer perspective. The review strongly emphasizes the factors affecting participation in SFSCs. Moreover, it highlights that the positive perception of SFSC sustainability is not based on scientific evidence. The analysis outlines current research directions and identifies challenges that are still open in order to offer researchers food for thought with a view to developing further future insights.</jats:p>"

How can we characterize the issues/challenges in SFSCs? While doing so, we offer a holistic perspective on SFSCs. We make use of the SCOR model to define SFSC processes as well as to describe the nature of these issues/challenges. The findings of this study shed light on the nature and strategic-tactical-operational level of the issues/challenges in SFSCs and point out the limitations in the existing literature such as the SFSC processes that are neglected.

Therefore, not only conceptual efforts to prevent environmental pollution and provide consumers with quality drinking water are of great importance, but also the mechanisms for their implementation should be revealed. In this aspect, one of the main tasks is the introduction of the latest tools, materials and designs of water treatment facilities and quality control of water supplied to consumers or discharged into natural sources. Pollution entering water bodies changes their physicochemical and biological parameters and leads to complications in the operation of water supply facilities. The solution of these problems is facilitated by the use of advanced technologies for the treatment of both drinking and wastewater. No less important is the establishment of optimal modes of operation of water treatment plants, which ensures maximum efficiency of their operation, conservation of water and energy resources, obtaining guaranteed quality of purified water. The article substantiates the use of natural mechanisms in the processes of deironing of water from underground sources and wastewater treatment. The generalized analysis of the operation of the units with bioreactor and contact clarifier filter during the filter cycle revealed that the standard quality of filtered water is ensured only between the minimum Gmin and maximum Gmax specific dirt content of the filter. It is offered to carry out automation of management of work of such installations at control by the differential pressure gauge of the maximum losses of pressure on the filter corresponding to Gmax value, with its switching to the washing mode. When washing the filter, it is necessary to reduce the specific amount of activated sludge from Gmax to Gmin, controlling the duration of washing the specified intensity with a timer. The proposed measures provide significant savings in water and electricity costs during operation.</jats:p>"

The article aims to determine whether a farmer selling his products, both processed and unprocessed is subject to a favourable legal regime intended for the agricultural sector, or whether this activity qualifies him as a commercial entrepreneur. The legislation of three EU Member States and the law of the USA were subject to a comparative legal analysis, based on the dogmatic method. The study found that under the EU Member States’ law, farmers involved in short food supply chains are granted a privileged agricultural status, which certainly strengthens their market position in competition with food businesses and big retailers and is an incentive to undertake and conduct the activity of agri-food marketing. In turn, under American law, agricultural activity and direct marketing are economic activities that cause farmers to operate within a business as an entrepreneur. The main tool to support the participation of US farmers in short food supply chains is financial programmes offering incentives to direct marketing. It was concluded that the systemic legal solutions, as in the presented legislation of the EU countries, in contrast to aid programmes, provides farmers with favourable conditions in the long term, without additional bureaucracy and the need to fill out documents and applications, thus giving them a sense of confidence and stability in engaging in food direct marketing.</jats:p>"

Therefore, the analysis of secondary data collected from the National Sanitation Information System (SNIS) was considered, we considered information and rates of losses in distribution, losses in revenue, population served, per capita consumption, and volumes of water produced, consumed and billed in the period 2010 to 2019. The results show that the city has a slow tendency to reduce real and apparent losses, an adequate per capita consumption; trend of increased demand due to population growth, reduction of the volume of water produced and increase in volumes consumed and billed. . Based on the results, it is concluded that: there should be greater investment to accelerate the reduction of losses; efforts to reduce losses are indispensable so as not to have to increase water production in the same proportion; it is not recommended to continue the reduction of per capita consumption so as not to compromise the minimum conditions of hygiene and maintenance of health; and finally, the trend presented by the volumes produced, consumed and billed need to be maintained so that the city's indicators continue to improve and are among the best in the region or country.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Businesses have to deal with many potential risks in the supply chain, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The retail market in Vietnam has great potential for long-term development with the birth and rapid development of domestic supermarkets. However, market opening policies have resulted in fierce competition from a large number of foreign supermarkets. At the same time, customers have become more professional in their approach to shopping and carefully consider any decisions about shopping and the use of services at supermarkets. In this study, the authors use three models (i.e., the SERVQUAL model, the binary logistic model, and the Grey model) corresponding to a three-dimensional frame of reference (i.e., past, present, and future) to provide supermarket managers with a multi-dimensional view of the supermarket business situation. The results identify four factors−namely, quality of goods, personnel, safety, and facilities and equipment−that significantly impact customer satisfaction. The second frame of reference shows that factors such as age, academic level, and income affect the decision to reuse any service at the supermarket. The third frame of reference provides supermarket managers with forecast data about the supermarket business situation for 2021 to 2024. These results provide a solid foundation for supermarket managers seeking to develop strategies and take measures to adjust business activities to achieve the best business efficiency and avoid potential risks in the company’s supply chain. In addition, the results of this study are valuable references for researchers in the fields of customer service, supply chain management, and customer behavior. In particular, the factors obtained in this study will greatly strengthen the scientific value of the service sector and the model of retail supermarkets in Vietnam and other countries around the world. In fact, the business strategy of supermarkets still depends on the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to combine the results of this study with the experience of managers to develop the right business strategies and achieve further results and sustainable development.</jats:p>"

A qanat or kariz is a slightly sloping underground aqueduct used to transport water from water wells or aquifers to the surface for irrigation and drinking supply. A cyanobacterial strain was isolated from the mat and grown in BG11 liquid medium. Fragments of 16S rRNA, <jats:italic>mcy</jats:italic>G and <jats:italic>mcy</jats:italic>D genes were amplified and sequenced, as well as the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS), from which secondary structures were analyzed. The obtained molecular data, together with morphological and physiological observations, were used to describe the new organism. The isolate was related to a morphotype of <jats:italic>Nostoc</jats:italic> sensu lato group, with similar characteristics of <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic>, after microscopic inspections. The 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis placed the isolate into the typical cluster of the recently proposed genus <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic>. Morphological analysis revealed distinctive characteristic and secondary structures of 16S–23S rRNA (D1-D1´ and Box-B regions) derived from comparative analysis, which did not match known species of <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic>. These results lead us to propose a novel <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic> species, <jats:italic>Desmonostoc alborizicum</jats:italic>, which was described and compared with similar taxa. Furthermore, for the first time a potential toxic species of <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic> was isolated from water supply, since the <jats:italic>mcy</jats:italic>D and <jats:italic>mcy</jats:italic>G genes of microcystin synthetase (<jats:italic>mcy</jats:italic>) cluster was successfully sequenced. The presence of the microcystin was confirmed by chemical analyses that also lead to the discovery of numerous other cyanobacterial secondary metabolites. We recognized substantial amounts of the potent microcystin variant microcystin-LR present in cell extracts of the <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic> strain. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of diversity, systematics, and occurrence of <jats:italic>Desmonostoc</jats:italic> genus.</jats:p>"

The spatial heterogeneity of algae growth and the absence of universal reference standards for algae control often lead to water quality problems in these projects. The Middle Route (MR) of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project of China (SNWTPC), the world&amp;amp;#8217;s largest inter-basin water transfer project, has operated stably for six years. Its water resources have benefited more than 60 million people and an ecosystem cover more than 160,000&amp;amp;#160;km&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;. To understand the water environment risk of this mega hydro-project, this study focused on the relationships among three key parameters: water temperature (T), water discharge (Q), flow rate (V) and analyzed the spatial&amp;amp;#8211;temporal variation characteristics of the algal cell density (ACD) in the MR of the SNWTPC from January 2016 to December 2018, 36&amp;amp;#160;months in total. The Copula functions were applied to identify and evaluate the multivariate risk variation of the water environment. Our result demonstrated that there was a significant positive correlation between T and ACD, and the ACD at the downstream has a 50% risk higher than 700&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#215;&amp;amp;#160;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;cell/L in summer. Overall, the water quality status of the MR of the SNWTPC is quite well, and the ACD kept at an average level of 10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;6&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;cells/L during the monitoring period. Additionally, the ACD increased from upstream to downstream, showing the relatively higher ACD in summer and autumn than in spring and winter, with the ranges of 500&amp;amp;#160;~&amp;amp;#160;700&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#215;&amp;amp;#160;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;cells/L and 200&amp;amp;#160;~&amp;amp;#160;300&amp;amp;#160;&amp;amp;#215;&amp;amp;#160;10&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;4&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#160;cells/L, respectively. The water temperature affected the ACD over the early-warning thresholds at different canal sections were as follows: 29, 26, and 21&amp;amp;#8451; from upstream to downstream, respectively. The influences of the hydrodynamic factors, water discharge and flow rate, impact on the ACD variation were analyzed to achieve the purpose of specific algae control for different canal reaches.

The Solid State Nuclear Track Detector (SSNTDs) technique was used to examine the obtained water samples to identify boron levels. Boron levels were found to range from 0.28 ppm in Al Alwa (Al Qurnah) (tap water) to 1.85 ppm in Oil Street. This study's findings were compared to international standard values and previously published research. These findings may be utilized by the Iraqi government to develop guidelines to decrease radioactive contamination of drinking water in Basrah. The 41 surface water samples tested in this study had boron levels that were lower than the international standard limits. As a result, the boron level in Basrah's drinking water is normal. However, there is a chance that boron contamination will become a serious concern shortly. As a result, additional research is required in the future.</jats:p>",

The forecasting of water demand can give rise to a better understanding of water consumption behaviour across all sectors of economy and therefore aid in effective water demand management. This study compares the application of the seasonal ARIMA, exponential state space (ETS) models, artificial neural network (ANN) models and hybrid combinations of them in developing forecast models for all categories of water consumption for Trinidad. The best forecasting model was selected using the forecasting assessment criterion of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The forecasts were conducted until the end of December 2021. The results of the study show that hybrid model combinations are adequate in forecasting four out of the five categories and the single model, SARIMA, has been found suitable for the domestic category. Forecast plots revealed an increase in water demand until the end of 2021. The study also demonstrates the suitability of hybrid models for forecasting water demand for the island of Trinidad.</jats:p>",

None of the companies can design improvement projects to resolve these barriers because of a lack of rare resources, such as human resources (HR), budget, information, etc. Methods: Barriers are first extracted from previous studies and interviews with experts in this study. Then, these barriers are customized for this case study by the Delphi method. Then, these blood supply hubs are ranked by measurement alternatives and ranking according to the compromise solution (MARCOS) method. Since this method needs primary weight, the best–worst method (BWM) is applied to obtain this weight. Result: Results have pointed out that business owners’ unwillingness was the highest priority among the nine barriers. Conclusions: Additionally, implementing blockchain for SCM of blood supply requires paying more attention to business owners’ unwillingness barriers and resolving them. Furthermore, hub 4 is faced with many problems in tackling barriers to implementing SCM blockchain.</jats:p>"

The HOR phase I shows that the risk agent with the highest Aggregat Risk Priority (ARP) value is the lack of environmental management system standards (A4), and the risk agent with the lowest ARP value is inhumane treatment/harassment (A12). Based on the Pareto principle, 7 Risk Agents will be prioritized to be handled according to the highest ARP value, such as lack of environmental management system standards (4170), lack of quality control inspection (3790), lack of maintenance management (3346), lack of quality control from suppliers (3000), lack of enthusiasm for work (2984), decreased level of discipline (2832). The internal communication system of the company is poor (2538). Furthermore, 15 mitigating techniques are proposed.

Contingency plans and restart tasks took centre stage, sometimes coming up short. We found that many downstream tier suppliers lacked contingency plans altogether for managing operational disruptions of the magnitude we faced during the pandemic. We developed the operational restart readiness checklist (ORR checklist) with a focus on contingency planning in the automotive industry. It served as the basis for our work as we developed a survey of restart and recovery activities, created a presentation and webinar and drafted an eBook on the impact and root causes of supply chain disruptions. We identified the resources needed to return to operational stability amid restart challenges. Our ORR checklist offers manufacturers a framework for improving contingency planning.

Most existing approaches to explaining such forms emphasize the differences between hierarchy, market and hybrid contracting. This study specifies the forms of vertical interaction in supply chains and determines the factors of their choice. Supply chain integration on a par with vertical restrictive agreements is proposed to be considered as a form of hybrid contracting. On the basis of the theory of the firm the question of the choice of the form of vertical interaction is considered. It is shown that supply chain integration leads to a fundamental transformation of market multilateral relations into bilateral supply contracts and to the formation of transactional-specific assets which ensure the sustainability of this form of vertical interaction. As a result, compared to market interactions, there is a decrease in transaction costs while control costs increase, so supply chain integration occupies an intermediate place between the market and vertical restrictive agreements.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this research is to study the gravel bed in gravity currents with large salinity. The tank is separated in two parts by a vertical gate, which separates the fresh water with the gravel bed from the salt water with the impermeable bed. When the gate opens, a flow is created due to density difference. The salinity densities are large (from 1,050 to 1,090 kg/m3). These specific densities have been chosen to simulate liquid wastes that affect the environment. Compared to experiments in the same tank without a gravel bed, it is observed that the gravel bed reduces the propagation of currents and mainly reduces the current with the smallest density difference at the lowest height. The main conclusion of this study is that the kind of channel bed plays a key role in the propagation of gravity currents. The gravel bed affects significantly the velocity and the distance traveled by the currents in comparison with impermeable bed.</jats:p>",

To decelerate and contain the spread of the virus, the European Union, like all other great economic powers, attempted to provide a symmetrical response. Thus, curfew measures were imposed in order to restrict mobility and isolate the population from the COVID-19 hotspots. These measures could be associated to widespread contagion effects in the economy, a deterioration of the public finances and a distortion of many supply chains, some of them critical for the EU. The main aim of this paper is to provide a more objective and comprehensive picture of how the European Union economic landscape has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. In this regard, the author analyses, using some of the most relevant databases, the manner in which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced, at a macroeconomic level, the dynamics of production, public spending, private investment, consumption and intra- and extra-EU trade. Further, the second aim was to analyse the directions proposed by the European Union for the post-pandemic economic recovery. Finally, the author underlines the need to focus more on the security of supply for essential materials in dealing with future crises, such as climate change. The research is mainly phenomenological in nature and, with the help of the positivist dimension, the author captured the most representative and useful correlations and causal relationships resulting from the analytical approach used in this paper.</jats:p>",

Nigerian airlines run on civil grade jet A-1 fuel, and almost annually, the aviation sector is plagued with jet fuel scarcity and the resulting flight delays, rescheduling, and cancellations. Jet fuel scarcity and the escalating cost are products of multifaceted factors that are related to finance, logistics, management, and policy. This study highlighted the operational specifics of the Nigerian aviation fuel sector; it identified various business opportunities that affect air transportation and discusses the main industry challenges responsible for jet fuel price volatility and scarcity in Nigeria. Instability and shortage of foreign exchange (Forex), non-refining of jet fuel locally, and absolute dependence on jet fuel importation are some of the key causal factors.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Tacrolimus (FK-506) is a macrolide widely used as immunosuppressant to prevent transplant rejection. Synthetic production of FK-506 is not efficient and costly, whereas the biosynthesis of FK-506 is complex and the level produced by the wild type strain, <jats:italic>Streptomyces tsukubaensis</jats:italic>, is very low. We therefore engineered FK-506 biosynthesis and the supply of the precursor L-lysine to generate strains with improved FK-506 yield. To increase FK-506 production, first the intracellular supply of the essential precursor lysine was improved in the native host <jats:italic>S. tsukubaensis</jats:italic> by engineering the lysine biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, a feedback deregulated aspartate kinase Ask<jats:sub><jats:italic>St</jats:italic></jats:sub>* of <jats:italic>S. tsukubaensis</jats:italic> was generated by site directed mutagenesis. Whereas overexpression of Ask<jats:sub><jats:italic>St</jats:italic></jats:sub>* resulted only in a 17% increase in FK-506 yield, heterologous overexpression of a feedback deregulated Ask<jats:sub><jats:italic>Cg</jats:italic></jats:sub>* from <jats:italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</jats:italic> was proven to be more efficient. Combined overexpression of Ask<jats:sub><jats:italic>Cg</jats:italic></jats:sub>* and DapA<jats:sub><jats:italic>St</jats:italic>,</jats:sub> showed a strong enhancement of the intracellular lysine pool following increase in the yield by approximately 73% compared to the wild type. Lysine is coverted into the FK-506 building block pipecolate by the lysine cyclodeaminase FkbL. Construction of a Δ<jats:italic>fkbL</jats:italic> mutant led to a complete abolishment of the FK-506 production, confirming the indispensability of this enzyme for FK-506 production. Chemical complementation of the Δ<jats:italic>fkbL</jats:italic> mutant by feeding pipecolic acid and genetic complementation with <jats:italic>fkbL</jats:italic> as well as with other lysine cyclodeaminase genes (<jats:italic>pip</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>Af</jats:italic></jats:sub>, <jats:italic>pipA</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>St</jats:italic></jats:sub>, originating from <jats:italic>Actinoplanes friuliensis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Streptomyces pristinaespiralis</jats:italic>, respectively) completely restored FK-506 production. Subsequently, FK-506 production was enchanced by heterologous overexpression of Pip<jats:sub><jats:italic>Af</jats:italic></jats:sub> and PipA<jats:sub><jats:italic>Sp</jats:italic></jats:sub> in <jats:italic>S. tsukubaensis</jats:italic>. This resulted in a yield increase by 65% compared to the WT in the presence of Pip<jats:sub><jats:italic>Af</jats:italic></jats:sub> from <jats:italic>A. friuliensis</jats:italic>. For further rational yield improvement, the crystal structure of Pip<jats:sub><jats:italic>Af</jats:italic></jats:sub> from <jats:italic>A. friuliensis</jats:italic> was determined at 1.3 Å resolution with the cofactor NADH bound and at 1.4 Å with its substrate lysine. Based on the structure the Ile91 residue was replaced by Val91 in Pip<jats:sub><jats:italic>Af</jats:italic></jats:sub>, which resulted in an overall increase of FK-506 production by approx. 100% compared to the WT.</jats:p>"

The study employs the Johansen-Juselius test (1990) to examine the long-run determinants of money supply in Egypt and the error correction model to examine the short-run determinants. We conclude that real GDP, discount rate, budget deficit, and net foreign assets have significant long-term effects on money supply, whereas exchange rate and net domestic assets have no effects. We recommend higher degrees of cooperation between the Central Bank of Egypt and the institutions responsible for the formulation of financial and commercial policies. we also recommend that the central bank continue monitoring foreign assets and strengthen its supervisory activities on banking institutions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several studies investigate the various aspects of tobacco at the processing and cigarette manufacturing levels, but the profitability, supply response, and input demand of tobacco farms in Pakistan remain unknown. Our study fills this gap by examining farm-level profitability, input demand, and output supply using survey data of 140 tobacco farms by employing a profit function approach. The results show that tobacco production is not very lucrative at the farm level and farmers are responsive to changes in market prices for the inputs and output. The price of tobacco is the most important determinant of the output supply and demand for inputs, and farmers’ response to increasing tobacco prices is positive but inelastic in the study area. The use of variable inputs such as fertilizers, labor, mechanical power, pesticides, and farmyard manure is important in resource allocation decisions in tobacco production. As a result, a price increase for green tobacco leaves would significantly increase the demand for farm inputs such as fertilizers, labor, mechanical power, pesticides, and farmyard manure. Tobacco production is negatively affected by the increasing input prices in the study area. Among the fixed factors, land area has a significant impact on tobacco productivity in the province. The present study is the first to quantify the farm-level input demand and output supply; therefore, based on the findings, the increasing tobacco production requires higher output prices and reasonable input prices.</jats:p>"

However, the presence of shallow gas (mainly composed of methane) and the processes of delta erosion caused by diminished sediment supply bring complexities to the present situation. This study investigates the response of the gas charged deposits in the Yangtze subaqueous delta to erosion process based on historical bathymetric data and the dataset obtained from a seismic survey. Both seismic and bathymetric data reveal a prominent erosion belt at water depth ranging from 5-20 m, extending from the southwest to the northeast in the nearshore area of the Yangtze subaqueous delta. Erosion is severe in the south while slight in the north area due to the differences in hydrodynamic condition, sediment erodibility and sensitivity to sediment reduction. Seabed erosion reduces the thickness of cap bed, as well as overburden pressure at gas front, making it easier for gas to seep through the sediment column and bypass the process of anerobic oxidation of methane within the SMT (an important methane filter). The spatial coincidence between the shallower gas front and pockmarks also indicates that sea bed erosion accelerates gas seeping activities. It expected more greenhouse gas would be expelled into atmosphere under the impact of bed erosion induced by ongoing decline of riverine sediment supply.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The study was cross-sectional in nature and adopted the quantitative research approach. The data was collected from the beneficiaries of RWSS at the household level. A multistage random sampling technique was adopted. The districts for the study were selected purposively since they have more RWSS as compared to other districts. The six functional RWSS schemes were randomly selected from the Gujranwala division. An interview schedule was structured to collect data from the water users. Data was entered, summarized, and analyzed using SPSS version 22. A linear regression test was applied to assess the impact of CBOs' functioning on the satisfaction of water users. The study concluded that CBOs at community level were performing their role adequately to ensure the sustainability of water supply schemes. It was also indicated that water provided through these schemes was of good quality and adequate to meet community members' needs. It was also concluded that the functioning of CBOs was the initial, major, and significant source of quality water availability and RWSS sustainability.</jats:p>"

The research shows that: (1) the recovery rate is negatively correlated with the wholesale price, and positively correlated with government subsidies, consumers' low-carbon preference and low-carbon level. (2) Government subsidies play a positive role in the recovery decision-making of closed-loop supply chain members. When the government provides the same subsidy price to the recovery subject, manufacturers prefer to entrust retailers for recovery, and manufacturers' participation in cooperative recovery mode is conducive to improving the product recovery rate of closed-loop supply chain.

Pharmacy Warehouse functions as a place to store drugs and medical devices before being distributed to health facilities such as community health centers, clinics, and hospitals. One of the Pharmacy Warehouse Technical Implementation Units located in Dairi Regency, North Sumatra, has several problems that occur along its supply chain. These problems, among others, are related to time, cost, and the number of products shipped. In addition, there was also an increase in aggregate demand for drugs and medical devices in 2018-2019. This increase in demand reinforces the need for designing pharmaceutical supply chain performance measurements. In designing the supply chain performance measurement, the framework used is the Supply Chain Operational Reference (SCOR) which includes the plan, source, make, delivery, and return processes, which are then translated into a number of criteria based on the attributes of reliability, responsiveness, agility, costs, and assets to a number of Key Performance Indicators (KPI). In weighting KPI, the method used is Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Based on data processing and analysis, a supply chain performance measurement design was obtained with 11 performance indicators. Based on the AHP results, it was found that the highest weight value of 0.750 was obtained on the indicators of accuracy and delivery speed, while the lowest weight value of 0.117 was obtained on the order picking accuracy indicator.</jats:p>"

Desalination technologies can be a reliable technique for providing freshwater. Capacitive deionization is one of the innovative desalination methods that has received increasing interest. Flow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) (a new architecture of capacitive deionization) is one of the efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly desalination methods for freshwater production. In this experimental research, the performance of an FCDI system was investigated and the influence of important parameters such as flow rate of flow-electrodes, electrolyte salt concentration of flow-electrodes, and initial feed water concentration will be assessed on the efficiency of desalination operation. In this study, the flow-electrodes operated in short-circuited closed-cycle operation (SCC) mode, and also the feed water operated similarly to the flow electrodes in closed cycle. Moreover, in all the experiments, the salt adsorption capacity (SAC) and salt removal efficiency (SRE) was calculated. Herein, by optimizing the above-mentioned parameters, the salt removal efficiency of 83% and a SAC value of 29.12 mg/gdry carbon were achieved in 5 hours.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The total power consumed by electrical loads from the electric mains consists of their two components – active and reactive. Most electric drives of modern industrial enterprises operate with a reactive power index of 0.7–0.8. This leads to increased consumption of full power, which increases the load on the mains supply. Modern electric drives are built according to the principle: power supply – rectifier – DC link-inverter – asynchronous motor. Full power consumption occurs at the junction of the “power supply-rectifier”, where the required active power factor of the converter device can be formed. The higher the active power factor, the lower the reactive component in the total energy consumed. Thus, the article proposes a solution to the problem of creating highly efficient converter devices for powering electric motors with the formation of the necessary power factor, since frequency-controlled electric drives of modern mechanisms in industrial enterprises are the main consumers of electricity, which have a significant impact on the state of the supply network. The article considers the possibility of increasing the power factor of the mains input of electric drives with two-link frequency converters based on active (controlled) rectifiers with current inverters and voltage inverters. New methods of control of active rectifiers based on the use of AC rectifiers on fully controlled thyristors GTO, GCT, as well as IGBT transistors with pulse width adjustment are proposed. The variants of the construction of these rectifiers and the results of modeling the proposed control methods are presented, confirming a decrease in the passive components of the mains current, and as a consequence, an increase in the power factor of the network input. The simulation results are performed in the MATLAB 10 program, and are the basis for confirming the method of increasing the active power factor at the network input of a controlled frequency converter with a two-link structure.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management (SCM) is considered at the forefront of many organizations in the delivery of their products. Various optimization methods are applied in the SCM to improve the efficiency of the process. In this research, the projected stochastic gradient (PSG) method was proposed to increase the efficiency of the SCM analysis. The key objective of an efficient supply chain is to find the best flow patterns for the best products in order to select the suppliers to different customers. Hence, the focus of this research is on developing an efficient multi-echelon supply chain using factors such as cost, time, and risk. In the convex case, the proposed method has the advantage of a weakly convergent sequence of iterates to a point in the set of minimizers with probability one. The developed method achieves strong sequence convergence to the unique optimum, with probability one. The SCM dataset was utilized to assess the proposed method’s performance. The proposed PSG method has the advantage of considering the holding cost in the profit analysis of the company. The results of the developed PSG method are analyzed according to the product’s profit, stock, and demand. The proposed PSG method also provides the prediction of demand to increase profit.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Buildings account for a large portion of the total energy use in the US; therefore, improving the operation of typical variable-air-volume (VAV) systems in buildings can provide a tremendous economic opportunity. ASHRAE Guideline 36 recommends a resetting strategy for supply air temperature (SAT) for VAV systems based on outside air temperature. However, this strategy may not produce optimal performance, particularly when simultaneous cooling and heating occurs in zones. In addition, there is no strategy recommended in the Guideline to reset the zone minimum airflow set point in a single-duct VAV terminal unit with reheat, although this setpoint has a great impact on zone reheat requirements and ventilation efficiency. Thus, this paper introduces new strategies to reset both the SAT and zone minimum airflow rate set points to improve the efficiency of typical VAV systems. The strategies were tested under various conditions through experiments performed in fully instrumented VAV systems located in the HVAC lab at the University of Cincinnati. The experiments were conducted on a chilled-water VAV system that serves three controlled zones with hot-water reheat VAV boxes controlled by a typical commercial BACnet web-based building automation system BAS. The simulation studies were performed using the building energy simulation software EnergyPlus to evaluate the strategies at a larger scale in various locations. The simulation results show that the proposed resetting strategies can provide fan energy savings between 1.6% and 5.7% and heating load savings between 7.7% to 33.7%, depending on the location. The laboratory testing shows that the proposed strategies can provide stable control performance in actual systems as well as achieving the anticipated reheat and fan energy savings. The result offers significant improvements that can be implemented in the Guideline for single-duct VAV system operation and control.</jats:p>"

The analysis of modern data on the sources and intensity of entry, content, transformation and influence of phosphates and heavy metals on aquatic organisms and surface water bodies was carried out. It is emphasized that an excess of phosphorus compounds leads to the development of eutrophication in water bodies. It is shown that heavy metals belong to the group of the most dangerous toxic substances entering aquatic ecosystems, mainly as a result of technogenic action. In terms of toxicity, they are second only to pesticides. Unlike organic pollution, heavy metals are elements that do not undergo destruction in the aquatic ecosystem, but are only distributed among its components. A scheme of the intensity of pollution of individual components of the biosphere is given. Modern methods of water treatment both from phosphates and from heavy metal ions, which have their own advantages and disadvantages, are considered.

The difficulty consists of the assimilation by the actors in the supply chain and its own complexity. Therefore, this research focuses on the main differences among the three main variables (integration, circular economy, and the elements of the traditional supply chains) of a supply chain in the coconut sector in the province of Manabí, Ecuador. To achieve this, two hypotheses and their possible combinations are defined. The first hypothesis focuses into the existence of the differences among variables. The second one, is based on the possibility of a positive strong correlation among the variables. Hence, relationships between the three variables in the context of circularity are identified. The supply chain under study is formed by 160 actors, limited to the national sector. For the diagnosis of each of the variables, three check lists are used, which allow to compute a general value for each variable in each actor and in the supply chain. Results indicate that: (a) the supply chain of the coconut sector in the province of Manabí has a performance evaluated to be fair in terms of integration levels, circular economy and the definition of the supply chain; (b) actors dedicated to production and manufacturing show slightly superior performance compared to those dedicated to selling to the customer; (c) the actors maintain proportional and direct performances in the three variables. As a consequence of this study, strengths and opportunity areas of the coconut sector to accomplish an effective transition towards the circularity.\nKey Words: supply chain management, circular economy, coconut sector case study</jats:p>"

In several towns and industrial clusters across India, this is becoming a rising subject of concern. Groundwater is difficult to contaminate, but once contaminated, it is difficult to clean up. It is critical to attain this goal using a variety of aquifer vulnerability assessment approaches. All of these strategies rely on process models as well as statistical or overlay index methodologies. Groundwater vulnerability is a major topic of discussion due to declining groundwater levels and rising contamination, posing a serious threat to the environment and water sources. To identify the risk and to assess the vulnerability, extensive research has been carried out among all the methods based on different parameters and different indexes. The DRASTIC method is one of the most important and accurate of the overlay and index methods for the assessment of groundwater vulnerability. This research study is a systematic analysis of the available research articles on the applications of the DRASTIC and Modified DRASTIC (DRASTIC-L) performance management process on Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This research also reveals research gaps in the various groundwater vulnerability assessment approaches, as well as their limits and hypotheses. This study discovered that integrating GIS with DRASTIC is the most effective and accurate way for determining groundwater vulnerability. In agricultural, arid, semi-arid, and basaltic zones, the modified DRASTIC model also outperforms the traditional DRASTIC model.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the development of a controller for ESP power supply. The controller maintains the voltage applied to ESP at its maximum average value by duty cycle control that results in an improvement in dust collection-efficiency. The limiting factor for the output voltage is the breakdown of gas (spark/arc) in the electrode gap of ESP. During a spark/arc condition, the duty cycle limit imposed by the controller causes a reduction in output voltage that leads to the prevention of spark/arc. The present design has a response faster than line frequency power supply controllers. The control circuit is simpler, easy to implement and uses a standard PWM controller IC. The design of power stage uses a flyback current-fed push-pull DC-DC converter with multiple secondary circuits, which has the advantages of instantaneous current limit and less voltage stress on rectifier-diodes. Simulation is performed to obtain a 1 kV, 100 W output from a 24VDC source. The results are compared with experimental values to validate the controller’s ability to achieve good load regulation during normal operation and a reduction in output voltage during spark/arc condition.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Price surge of essential commodities despite inventory availability, due to artificial shortage, presents a serious threat to food security in many countries. To protect consumers’ welfare, governments intervene reactively with either (i) cash subsidy, to increase consumers’ purchasing power by directly transferring cash; or (ii) supply allocation, to increase product availability by importing the commodity from foreign markets and selling it at subsidized rates. Academic/practical relevance: This paper develops a new behavioral game-theoretic model to examine the supply chain and market dynamics that engender artificial shortage as well as to analyze the effectiveness of various government interventions in improving consumer welfare. Methodology: We analyze a three-stage dynamic game between the government and the trader. We fully characterize the market equilibrium and the resulting consumer welfare under the base scenario of no government intervention as well as under each of the interventions being studied. Results: The analysis demonstrates the disparate effects of different interventions on artificial shortage; whereas supply allocation schemes often mitigate shortage, cash subsidy can inadvertently aggravate shortage in the market. Furthermore, empirical analysis with actual data on onion prices in India shows that the proposed model explains the data well and provides specific estimates on the implied artificial shortage. A counterfactual analysis quantifies the potential impacts of government interventions on market outcomes. Managerial implications: The analysis shows that reactive government interventions with supply allocation schemes can have a preemptive effect to reduce the trader’s incentive to create artificial shortage. Although cash subsidy schemes have recently gained wide popularity in many countries, we caution governments to carefully consider the strategic responses of different stakeholders in the supply chain when implementing cash subsidy schemes. </jats:p>",

The SCLI was a campaign by German civil society organizations that advocated for a law that would make it mandatory for corporations active in Germany to respect human, labor, and environmental rights along their supply chains. This research explores the strategies for advocacy used by the SCLI in the process of effective law-making. It also investigates the role of the SCLI in the context of global labor solidarity. The research results show that although this new law has some shortcomings in terms of international human rights standards, it has achieved partial progress as one of the most successful examples of alliance building between unions and civil society organizations in Germany. The SCLI has brought about a paradigm shift from voluntary towards mandatory due diligence. This experience can be carried one step further to accomplish a supply chain law at the European Union level. The authors argue that the SCLI experience opens up a new stage for rethinking the structural dilemma of unions in Germany in choosing between global solidarity and national corporatist social partnership.</jats:p>",

The methodological triangulation is applied in this study. A literature review, semi-structured online interviews and insights from open webinars serve as the sources of data. A framework, based on three pillars: validation, positioning and evaluation of business practices, is used for data analysis. The dependencies between OA activities and SCRES strategies are presented. The authors discuss their evolution during and in the post-pandemic period and outline the SCM trends in a strategic perspective. This paper investigates a pathway for closing the gap between OA theory and industry practice to create SCRES during and post-COVID-19 outbreak. This article starts the discussion on creating SCRES through OA. Future quantitative and qualitative research should explore the applicability of OA to enhance SCRES in a dynamic environment. Understanding the critical connection between exploitation and exploration practices and how OA influences SCRES provides valuable insight into the subject to supply chain managers supporting them in pursuing their roles successfully in the times of crisis. This study is focused on two concepts, OA and SCRES, of critical importance for how practitioners manage supply chains in the times of crisis. The resilience of supply chains to crises is crucial for the well-being of societies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The multimodal system in Indonesia requires development in order to create a more efficient and reliable freight transport and diminish the domination of road transport, i.e. trucks. The utilization of more than one mode in a multimodal system, where there is a door-to-door element, requires a network development concept that refers to the use of generalized costs, instead of costs incurred to use the system (out of pocket). Generalized cost is the concept of monetization of time, distance and cost variables into a certain unit value (time or cost). The aim of this study is to analyze the generalized cost model of freight transport in Java based on truck, train and ship modes. In this paper, the generalized cost variable used is based on the viewpoint from freight forwarders and shippers obtained through primary surveys and the AHP method cost, reliability and lead time. Monetization of reliability and lead time variables on costs is based on a stated preference survey, the results of which show that the truck mode has a time VOR Rp 1,181,771 and VOT Rp 174,079 (per delivery per hour). These values are the largest compared to the other modes considering that congestion and the unavailability of adequate infrastructure are the factors that cause delays. The results of the generalized cost show that the ship mode, which has the largest generalized cost value, is 1.29 times more expensive than the truck mode considering that the journey is heavily influenced by weather and has a need for further modes to the destination as well as additional handling equipment which increases transportation costs. The outcome are expected to be used by the government as a reference in determining multimodal transport development policies which will enable the system to compete in the logistics sector.</jats:p>"

The power supply system goes into abnormal modes operation when, after a short-term failure or disturbance, it does not restore normal mode. The electrical complex, which includes a wind power plant, as well as a battery and a diesel generator connected in parallel, is able to provide reliable power supply to consumers which meets the power quality indicators. The article develops an algorithm that is implemented by an automatic control system to select the operating mode depending on climatic factors (wind) and the forecast of energy consumption for the day ahead. Forecast data is selected based on the choice of the methods, which will have the smallest forecast error. It is concluded that if the energy consumption forecast data is added to the automatic control system, then it will be possible to increase the efficiency of the power supply complex. In the developed algorithm the verification of normal and abnormal modes of operation is considered based on the stability theory. The criteria for assessing the normal mode of operation are identified, as well as the indicators of the object’s load schedules for assessing the load of power supply sources and the quality standards for power supply to consumers for ranking the load by priority under critical operating conditions and restoring normal operation are considered.</jats:p>"

To safeguard their operations against disruption in order quantities, supply chain members have been looking for alternate suppliers. This paper considers a two-level supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and two suppliers of a certain type of components required for the production of a finished product. The primary supplier (supplier A) is unreliable, in the sense that the quantity delivered is usually less than the ordered quantity. The proportion of the ordered quantity delivered by supplier A is a random variable with a known probability distribution. The secondary supplier (supplier B) always delivers the order in its entirety at a higher cost and can respond instantaneously. In order for supplier B to respond instantaneously, the manufacturer is required to reserve a certain quantity at an additional cost.

A total of 259 responses obtained from restaurant owners/managers were used for our analysis. Results revealed a significant effect of external GSCM on restaurant ethical attitudes, while internal GSCM was found to have no measurable effect. Further it was found that restaurant ethical attitudes facilitated cooperative behaviors toward green suppliers. More specifically, restaurant ‘information sharing’ and ‘flexibility in arrangement’ significantly improved their environmental performance; however, ‘joint action’ had no such effect.

Starting March 2020, given the skyrocketing prices of PPE in the open market, healthcare institutions were confronted with the dire need to reshape their PPE procurement strategy. One avenue that financially constrained healthcare institutions pursued were donation platforms that offered access to donated PPE by individuals and organizations. We document a real-life case study of one of the most prominent donor platforms that emerged during this period: Get Us PPE. From 20 March 2020 to 2 July 2021, Get Us PPE received 23,001 total individual requests for PPE from every US state and some US territories. In response to these 23,001 requests, Get Us PPE delivered 17,540,571 units of PPE. The number of PPE units delivered was still less than 25% of the total units of PPE requested, indicating the enormity of the PPE shortage. Using this case study, we identify key supply chain issues that manifest during emergencies and highlight the formation of a platform ecosystem to resolve these issues. We also observed a robust supply chain network design that addresses key supply chain sustainability metrics such as minimizing material waste and transportation miles, while balancing other stakeholder factors such as donor and recipient characteristics as well as shipment complexity. We argue that the roadmap followed by Get Us PPE could serve as a template for organizations that emerge in the context of future humanitarian crises.</jats:p>"

Methods: questioning, logical analysis, economic modeling. Results: As a result of a survey of anesthesiologists at a pediatric surgical hospital, problems with dosing drugs for general anesthesia for children in a pediatric surgical hospital were identified, due to the lack of special pediatric dosages and concentrations of injectable drugs. Injectable drugs have been identified that cause difficulties in individual dosing for children due to the lack of the required form of release: INN fentanyl (ampoules), propofol, ketamine, rocuronium bromide (ampoules and vials). Losses in the primary packaging of these medicines with a single use in young children are up to 50%-90%, which leads to both material losses and environmental risks when disposing of residues. An analysis of instructions for medical use showed that pharmaceutical manufacturers do not provide for an indication of the period and conditions for storing these medicinal products after the first opening of the vial. Conclusion: A set of proposals has been developed to optimize the circulation of injectable drugs for general anesthesia used in children: the advantages of using drugs in vials compared to ampoules are shown, and the primary packaging “vial” for fentanyl solution for injections is recommended; recommended the introduction of a requirement for registration of injectable drugs for general anesthesia in vials to indicate the period and storage conditions after the first opening of the primary packaging; on the label applied to the primary packaging, it is necessary to indicate the date and time of opening the vial;in the registration dossier of injectable medicinal products for general anesthesia, it is necessary to provide data confirming the stability after the first puncture of the capping of the vial during the recommended period and storage conditions of the medicinal product.</jats:p>",

This study examines profitability, input demand, and supply response of tobacco in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by employing a normalized restricted trans log profit function. The findings indicate that tobacco production is profitable, and barn owners in the province are responsive to changes in output and input market prices. The use of labor and fuel wood in the processing of green leaves is very important in resource allocation decisions. The demand for labor and fuel wood increases as the price of tobacco output rises at the barn level. Furthermore, higher input prices have anegative effect on the province's tobacco supply. This study suggests that the government should seek an alternative to fuel wood that wouldn't only help in reducing costs but also be beneficial to the environment and prevent deforestation.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes a parameter optimization method for the current source APS applied to PETs, enabling the APS to have multiple output voltage self-regulation capabilities. By optimizing the excitation inductance and leakage inductance for the current transformer of the APS, the excitation current plays a regulating role in energy transmission, thus realizing the self-regulation of the output voltages. The proposed method enables the voltage deviation and voltage change of the output modules to be suppressed under the unbalanced loads and large load fluctuations. Moreover, the APS can still operate normally when a short-circuit or an open-circuit fault occurs on the output sides. Therefore, the stability and reliability of the APS are improved, and the design difficulty of the post-stage voltage regulator circuit is also reduced. Finally, the simulation results are given, and a prototype containing three output modules was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed parameter optimization method.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Problem definition: Few papers have explored the impact of price matching negotiation (PM), in which a channel matches its price with the resulting wholesale price bargained by another channel, on firms’ performances, consumer welfare, and social welfare, with and without supply chain coordination. Academic/practical relevance: Negotiation has been widely seen in determining both uniform and discriminatory wholesale prices, which affect outcomes of competitive supply chain practices. Methodology: To characterize the PM mechanism, we use game theory and Nash bargaining theory to compare PM with simultaneous negotiation (SN) through a common-seller two-buyer differentiated Bertrand competition model. Results: Our analysis reveals that PM can benefit the seller but hurt all buyers, which is at odds with some fair wholesale pricing clauses intending to protect buyers. Under coordination with side payments, however, all firms can conditionally benefit more from PM than from SN. Despite firms’ gains, PM leads to less consumer utility and social welfare compared with SN, unless the second buyer in PM is considerably less powerful than the first buyer. Coordination further worsens PM’s negative impact on consumer utility and social welfare. Moreover, the existence of a spot market can increase the wholesale price in PM, hurting buyers, consumers, and society. Furthermore, the qualitative results about PM remain robust under an alternative disagreement point for PM, multiple buyers, and other extensions. Managerial implications: This paper delivers insights on when price matching in supply chain wholesale price negotiation can benefit a seller, buyers, consumers, and society in a variety of scenarios. It advocates how managers can use PM to their own advantages and provides rationale to decision makers for policy regulations regarding wholesale pricing.</jats:p>",

Transient-based defect detection is a powerful method applied in water pipelines. This paper investigates the efficiency of the transient-based inverse transient analysis (ITA) method in estimating the characteristics of ICs in the viscoelastic water supply system in the time domain. To better evaluate this method, an experimental transient model was developed using polyethylene pipelines (with a length of 158 meters and a nominal diameter of 2 inches). In the first step, the hydraulic transient solver was calibrated in the calibration approach of dynamic parameters of pressure wave speed and pipe wall viscoelasticity. Then, the sensitivity of the ITA method to the spatial step of the method of characteristics and signal sample size was assessed. Finally, the efficiency of the ITA method was evaluated for several experiments with different transient intensities and a noisy signal. The results indicated that the accuracy for locating the IC was higher than the accuracy for the IC's length.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The greatest sustainability challenge facing humanity today is the greenhouse gas emissions and the global climate change with fossil fuels led by coal, natural gas and oil contributing 61.3% of global electricity generation in the year 2020. The cumulative effect of the Stockholm, Rio, and Johannesburg conferences identified sustainable energy development (SED) as a very important factor in the sustainable global development. This study reviews energy transition strategies and proposes a roadmap for sustainable energy transition for sustainable electricity generation and supply in line with commitments of the Paris Agreement aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in global average temperature to 1.5°C above the preindustrial level. The sustainable transition strategies typically consist of three major technological changes namely, energy savings on the demand side, generation efficiency at production level and fossil fuel substitution by various renewable energy sources and low carbon nuclear. For the transition remain technically and economically feasible and beneficial, policy initiatives are necessary to steer the global electricity transition towards a sustainable energy and electricity system. Large-scale renewable energy adoption should include measures to improve efficiency of existing nonrenewable sources which still have an important cost reduction and stabilization role. A resilient grid with advanced energy storage for storage and absorption of variable renewables should also be part of the transition strategies. From this study, it was noted that whereas sustainable development has social, economic, and environmental pillars, energy sustainability is best analysed by five-dimensional approach consisting of environmental, economic, social, technical, and institutional/political sustainability to determine resource sustainability. The energy transition requires new technology for maximum use of the abundant but intermittent renewable sources a sustainable mix with limited nonrenewable sources optimized to minimize cost and environmental impact but maintained quality, stability, and flexibility of an electricity supply system. Technologies needed for the transition are those that use conventional mitigation, negative emissions technologies which capture and sequester carbon emissions and finally technologies which alter the global atmospheric radiative energy budget to stabilize and reduce global average temperature. A sustainable electricity system needs facilitating technology, policy, strategies and infrastructure like smart grids, and models with an appropriate mix of both renewable and low carbon energy sources.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates Government intervention in a three-echelon supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. Government is the top level member trying to reduce environmental impacts based on the amount of carbon emission during the production process. Government controls the chain by collecting tax from the retailer which is indirectly paid by the customer and paying subsidy/imposing fine on the manufacturer. Government encourages manufacturer to reduce carbon emission by contributing some subsidy and also makes an effort to generate Government net revenue (GNR) by imposing tax. The GNR is generated by collecting tax from the retailer on the sold product and penalty from the manufacturer at the trading price for the extra amount of emissions. The retail price is decided based on the selling price, tax and greening level. We aim to determine optimal levels of pricing, greening and amount of tax to be levied. The models for both linear and iso-elastic demand patterns are developed. The aim of this piece research is two-fold: (i) review the existent literature on the relationship between environmental collaboration and sustainability performance and (ii) render a tenable prototype of supply chain to illuminate the relationship between sustainability and profitability. According to the aforesaid goals this paper has carried out a detailed empirical research by using advanced structural equation modelling approaches. The research findings will be particularly important for manufacturing companies struggling to find techniques to achieve sustainability performance. Also it will aid the supply chains in developing environmental collaboration with the Govt. in order to attain the targets of GSCM.</jats:p>",

To achieve the purpose of the study, we used the following research methods: logical operations (analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction) – to determine the structure of the milk supply chain, to make conclusions about main findings; the correlation analysis – to identify the tightness of links between farm’, processors’ and retailers’ prices; the trend modelling – to build the functions of the trend of prices of different levels of the milk supply chain; the regression modelling – to construct the regression functions of prices of downstream sectors of the milk supply chain; graphic – for visual presentation of main tendencies, pricing and price dynamics in the milk supply chain. The research was performed on the basis of the statistical data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine for 2013–2020.&#x0D;\nResults. This paper presents the empirical evidence of asymmetric price transmission along the milk supply chain in Ukraine. The results of modelling proved asymmetric magnitudes of price growth at the organizational and technological stages of the milk supply chain: in the case of the farm prices of raw milk increase the processors’ and retailers’ prices grow up by a much bigger magnitude. There is no leg in price transmission in the milk supply chain, the price shocks at the farm level instantly pass to processors’ and retailers’ prices. The evidence of asymmetry of price transmission testifies the weaknesses of the market positions of farmers and consumers in the milk supply chain in Ukraine, points out the threats for the food security and sustainable development of all agents of this chain. &#x0D;\nOriginality / scientific novelty. For the first time, the quantitative assessments of the magnitude and speed of the price changes in the process of price transmission in the milk supply chain in Ukraine were obtained. The asymmetry of the magnitudes of the vertical price transmission in the milk supply chain in Ukraine was identified. The hostage position of farmers in the case of price shocks was further proved.&#x0D;\nPractical value / implications. This paper provides a better understanding of arrangements of market forces in the milk supply chain, the consequences of price chocks in the upstream sector of the milk supply chain. The practical value is the methodological and empirical support for the development of regulative measures to improve the milk supply chain’s functioning and sustain food security. Assessment and analysis of the mechanism of price transmission reveals the weak parts of the food supply chain, contributing to the scientific foundation of elaborating the necessary policy actions for harmonization of relations between producers of different stages of the milk chain.</jats:p>"

Will this change mean less stability or more stability for grocery supply chains? In other words, will more dynamic pricing downstream mean more last-minute purchases, more overtime work, and more empty space in trucks and warehouses? Or will it mean more regular and more standardized orders, smoother schedules, and less waste? To answer this question, we fit a pricing and ordering model to data from a large Chinese supermarket chain (daily prices, sales, inventories, and shipments from products from seven categories at 78 stores for 3.5 years) and then simulate a counterfactual grocery chain in which the estimated price-adjustment costs are set to zero. We find that the removal of price-adjustment costs stabilizes the supply chain, reducing both its shipment volatility, its sales volatility, and its bullwhip (the difference between the shipment and sales volatility). </jats:p>",

This study presents the topography of the scour hole formed by water jets from circular nozzles in the downstream pool. Experimental studies for topographic changes in the downstream pool are limited in the literature. Several experiments were carried out to determine scour morphology due to turbulent water jets obliquely impinged on the downstream pool. The topographic changes, maximum scour depths, volume of scour hole and upstream and downstream slopes of scour hole at the equilibrium time were studied in detail. The densimetric Froude number and impingement angle affect the scour morphology. The volume of scour hole increases with the increase of densimetric Froude number and the decrease of impingement length. The topographic maps clearly show that the water jet affected the scour with the decrease of its velocity due to contact with the air at large impingement distances. Moreover, the upstream scour hole angle is approximately equal to the downstream scour hole angle. The findings will be useful in hydraulic applications such as design of plunge pool of an impinging jet spillway, bottom outlet structures, pond water aeration systems, outlets of culverts and storm drainage pipes.</jats:p>",

The study revealed that the IAI is unlikely to achieve its target for 2021-2022 due to pandemic induced SCDs and MSIL is no exception. The study revealed that in 2019-2020, the MSIL reduced its production several times to adjust dealers’ inventories in view of unprecedented economic slowdown and the prolonged domestic slump in automobile industry. In 2020-2021, MSIL is still facing severe disruption risks caused by the COVID-19 along with other OEMs in India and globally. In the first wave of the pandemic in India, MSIL production was totally halted and domestic sales were virtually zero in April 2020. During the second wave of the pandemic crisis in India, MSIL again experienced a severe fall in production and sales performance due to regional lockdown restrictions and SCDs. The rapid decline in production of MSIL has been mainly due to the pandemic induced lockdown and the SCDs in auto-components and halt in manufacturing activities. Therefore, robust mitigation strategies are needed to recover from the COVID-19 induced SCDs. The suggested model focused on the SCDs and risk management and offered the proactive and reactive responses for speedier readjustment of automotive industry from the COVID-19 pandemic induced SCDs. Ending the COVID-19 era and its impact on SCDs will not only depend on government policies, but also on proactive and reactive risk mitigation measures initiated by the firms. Robust measures should be taken to tackle the current supply chain threats in automotive sector to build the resilience of supply chain systems to safeguard them against business downturns.</jats:p>"

In this sense, sustainability was considered through a dual focus in this paper: (1) the efficient use of retail property assets for economic purposes and (2) the impact of these physical retail assets on the local environment in terms of carbon footprint. The study relied on space syntax ideology in computing spatial accessibility index and adopted business rate datasets in computing changes in retail rental value and stock. Findings showed that spatial accessibility across retail locations could predict the performance of retail rental value (but not stock) across the sampled cities. The study further showed that extent of city analysis (scale) is significant in estimating retail location performance and understanding the influence of accessibility. This evidence has the potential to facilitate better decision-making concerning the planning, design, and management of retail locations and spaces. The study is significant because it can serve as a reference for promoting an urban sustainability agenda, especially in ensuring that urban land and properties are used optimally to maximise their social, economic, and environmental values.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tracing food products along the entire supply chain is important for achieving better management of food products. Traditionally, centralized traceability systems have been developed for such purposes. One major drawback of this approach is that different users of the supply chain have their own systems with their own complexities and distinct features; thus, the interaction among them creates challenges when implementing a single centralized system. Therefore, a decentralized traceability system is favorable for tracing food products along the supply chain. In this study, we develop a supply chain traceability system framework based on blockchain and radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The system consists of a decentralized blockchain-enabled data storage platform for data management and an RFID system at the packaging level for data collection and storage. We applied a consortium blockchain to the application. Fabric 2.0 in Hyperledger was chosen as the development platform. The proposed blockchain-enabled platform can provide decentralized data management and its underlying algorithm can guarantee data security. The system includes a creatively designed blockchain-enabled data structure in the RFID tag. When people scan the tag, the relevant information is written in the tag as a block linked to the previous blocks; simultaneously, the information is transmitted to the blockchain platform and recorded on the platform. No battery is required and the system works when there is an RFID reader nearby. The usage conditions included shipment, stocking, and storage. The RFID tag can be directly attached to paper packaging. This approach embeds the blockchain technique into the RFID tag and develops a corresponding system. The new traceability system has the potential to simplify the tracking of products and can be scaled for industrial use.</jats:p>"

Despite the potential for development in countries like Brazil, the results of these investments in supply chains have not yet been systematically assessed. Methods: This study analyses foreign and domestic investments as an explanation for the recent growth of Brazilian agribusiness and evaluates the implications of different investment arrangements for the future development of the sector in the country. The research was based on a literature review of 12 agribusiness supply chains in Brazil. Results: Through a content analysis, the results reveal win–win situations with foreign and domestic investments supporting the streamlining of supply chains, mutually benefiting domestic and international groups and increasing the productivity of the entire sector. However, the results also reveal win–lose cases with chains and segments practically controlled by foreign multinationals in which local groups have practically no share. Finally, there are also cases of lose–win in which groups subsidized by the state are privileged in relation to others, compromising the sector’s growth. Conclusions: The current liberal business environment results in the need for a new vision of development based on win–win opportunities for domestic and foreign investments created by dynamic sectors such as agribusiness.</jats:p>"

Therefore, resource allocation can make the best use of limited resources in economic activities. Taking the two-stage supply chain where the outputs from the upstream supplier are taken as the inputs for the downstream manufacturer as an example, this paper applies the cross-efficiency model to comprehensively evaluate the efficiency scores of supply chains in the process of resource allocation and explores the relationship between the cross-efficiency of the supply chain and that of two enterprises within this supply chain. Furthermore, the self-interested behavior of enterprises is taken as the Pareto improvement principle to propose a Pareto-optimal two-stage cross-efficiency model, and this model can be used to optimally allocate the limited resources among two-stage supply chains. A common set of weights is determined to make all supply chains DEA efficient. Finally, the proposed model is illustrated to be feasible and effective through a practical application of 27 Iranian resin production companies.</jats:p>",

In this process, large amounts of air bubbles develop; as a result, contact surface area increases, and hence the water-air-mass transfer accelerates. There are numerous methods for increasing DO concentration in water, including self-aeration, mechanical aeration, chemical aeration, and hydraulic structures. The hydraulic structures are an economical and efficient way of enhancing stream/river water aeration. Even though the water only comes into contact with the structure for a short while, it increases the amount of DO in a river system. In this study, an experimental investigation has been carried out to determine the aeration performance of different types of piano key weir (PKW). To this end, three different types (type-A, type-B, and type-C) of PKW laboratory-scaled models were tested. The results demonstrated that the type-A PKW created maximum oxygen transfer efficiency of the three PKW types. In addition, the results show that the aeration efficiency of all PKW models increases with drop height but decreases with increasing discharge over the weirs.</jats:p>",

This work presents an optimization technique for the design and operation of a standalone microgrid with load demand. The research framework is demonstrated by a case study in a remote rural location in Uttarakhand (India). This research proposes an integrated techno‐economic optimization and power management of a standalone integrated renewable energy system to meet the electrical energy demand. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE), the net present cost (NPC), and pollution emission are minimized using grey wolf optimization. Four alternative models are compared based on environmental considerations and economic research. According to the simulation findings, the optimal configuration has a 0.203 $/kWh LCOE and a 92% renewable portion. In addition, the optimization results have been presented and compared. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the impact of various factors on the system in question.</jats:p>",

Drought limitations on ecosystem carbon fluxes can be caused either by limited soil moisture supply, mainly expressed through the soil water content (SWC), or enhanced atmospheric demand, expressed through the atmospheric VPD. However, these two parameters are generally strongly correlated and the distinguish of their differential effects on ecosystem level processes is difficult. While soil water content is mainly affected by the local precipitation patterns, VPD is strongly affected by the air temperature. Both quantities are expected to alter under the current climate change scenarios, but the rise in temperature is expected to result in amplified increased in VPD. The ability to quantify the differential effects of SWC and VPD on ecosystem productivity is, therefore, critical for making predictions about future forest productivity and survival in the Mediterranean region under the ongoing climate change.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In this study we attempt to make a distinction between the impact of soil moisture and VPD on water limitations on GPP in Aleppo pine forests in Greece and in Israel. For the aim of the study, we performed GPP estimates for two Mediterranean sites in the two study sites that differ in water supply and local VPD. The separation of SWC and VPD limitations was achieved by the use of generalized additive models. Our results indicate that the parameter that dominates drought limitations in Aleppo pine is SWC, while VPD has a secondary and lesser effect.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Aleppo pine is a conifer species representing one of the major components of Mediterranean ecosystems, which is, in turn, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.

First, the motivation is presented that makes IDF curve renewal a global issue. Second, current practices are described and reviewed and the main impacts of climate change on short precipitation extremes around the world are briefly discussed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Among the various types of high-speed land transport a magnetic levitation transport (magnetoplanes) is recognized as the most promising, so research related to the improvement of this type of transport is relevant. The work is devoted to the integra-tion of three promising research technologies: magnetolevitative transport, photoelec-tric energy conversion and phase-metric radionavigation. It is this integration, i.e. the essential interpenetration of these three subsystems, results in an overall synergistic ef-fect. Achieving the goals of sustainable development of the national economic complex within the framework of traditional transport and energy technologies is problematic, as energy consumption of transport systems exceeds one third of energy consumption, and the fastest mode of transport – an air transport is one of the leading air pollutants. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to substantiate a promising way to solve this problem by combining in a single system of renewable energy technologies and magne-tolevitative transport. The methods of system analysis and decomposition, statistical analysis of solar insolation, radiophysical experiment, computer modeling of photovol-taic energy converters, algorithmization of current control processes and forecasting the energy storage devices state are involved. The result of the research is the development of physical and technical bases for the improvement of magnetolevitative transport. Conclusion: by combining in a single system of renewable energy technologies and mag-netic levitation transport it is possible to create a system of all-weather guaranteed power supply based on solar energy and a reliable precision high-speed control system in real time.</jats:p>"

The CTE–KDE approach is evidence‐based that identifies, and documents activities. It can be easily performed by (i) auditors; (ii) food manufacturers/processors; (iii) food suppliers to access gaps in process and supply chain. For example, for a grain processor storage of grain is identified as a CTE performed under grain elevator, and the necessary KDE includes the location of storage bin and supplier details. The CTE–KDE approach requires verifiable data, and the ability to assess graduated levels of success based on data. This article proposes the use of vulnerability analysis to predict levels of success in each CTE–KDE situation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance and Novelty</jats:title><jats:p>A vulnerability analysis model identifies, quantifies, and prioritizes various factors responsible for reducing the efficacy of a system.

According to this extension, at very low net wage levels near the subsistence income level, the positive shape of the supply curve of labor may also be curved backward and become negatively sloped. A decrease in the low wage rate requires an increase in the labor supply, to maintain a minimum income level for survival. The S-shaped curve leads to a double-peaked Laffer curve, which also includes the possibility of three tax rates, each of which enables the collection of the same tax revenue. This may occur in contrast to the traditional single-peaked Laffer curve, which has two tax rates with the same revenues.</jats:p>"

Either way building a resiliency augmentation to support both situations is a must system that we are missing from any supply and demand or supply chain. Presently, we do not have any Business Resilience System (BRS) built in any of our existing chain of supplies nor within any demand or supply that both business and consumer may ask for when it comes to either one of them. Far from what some economists consider the dismal science, they drive most decisions in the supply chain, and supply chain managers need to be fully aware of the economic conditions that drive their business, their suppliers, and their customers. Last Christmas was a good example of a lack of resiliency. The port of Los Angeles came to an absolute halt when the chain of cargo ships seating off the port and lining up for their goods to be unloaded. Yet, the port authority could not provide the necessary labor resources to be in place to unload these cargo ships. Such shortage of labor and lack of having a contingency plan as a resiliency system created a chase at consumer level from supply and demand, naturally supply chains were in a mess</jats:p>"

In our model, the input data was sourced on a weekly basis from three commercial aquaponic farms in South-East Texas over the course of a year. Due to limited number of data points, dimensionality reduction techniques like pair-wise correlation matrix was used to remove the highly correlated predictors. Feature selection techniques like the XGBoost classifier and Recursive Feature Elimination with ExtraTreesClassifier were used to rank the features in order of their relative importance. Ammonium and calcium were found to be the top two nutrient predictors and based on the months in which lettuce was cultivated, the median of these nutrient values from the historical dataset served as the optimal concentrations to be maintained in the aquaponic solution. To accomplish this, Vernier sensors were used to measure the nutrient values and actuator systems were built to dispense the appropriate nutrient into the ecosystem via a closed loop.</jats:p>"

Thus, the water supply network is designed for the regime  of  maximum water consumption in the settlement, and the period of operation of the network is characterized not only by maximum water consumption, but also by minimum water use, which takes place at night. Therefore, the velocities of water flow through the pipes will change during the day from maximum to minimum, and in some areas will fall to zero and even change the direction of flow. This situation  contributes to the formation on the inner surface of water pipes of biological film, which develops on all types of pipe material (concrete, plastic, steel, cast iron, copper). Hours of minimal water consumption, characterized by low water flow rates, are favor able for the process of fixing bacteria on the inner surface of the pipes and the formation of local colonies  that destroy the material of the pipeline.&#x0D;\nSpecial attention is paid to iron bacteria, which oxidize iron oxide, turning it into oxidative. This process is accompanied by precipitation,- hydroxide. Therefore, in the process of vital activity of iron bacteria in the middle of the pipelines formed a mobile sediment, which reduces the diameter of the pipes, and the water gets a rusty-red color and an unpleasant odor.&#x0D;\nAttention is drawn to the fact that some artesian waters used for water supply of the population contain hydrogen sulfide. When oxygen enters such bodies, they begin to develop filamentous sulfur bacteria. In appearance filamentous sulfur bacteria (Beggiaroacea) resemble long tufts of gray hair, and congestion, formed from filamentous sulfur bacteria rapidly increase in volume and clog the living section of the pipes, saturating  the drinking  water with an unpleasant odor.&#x0D;\nTherefore, bacteria transported through the pipes together with drinking water degrade its quality, saturating the water with an unpleasant odor, clog the living section of the pipes and destroy the inner surface of the pipes and destroy the inner surface of the pipes due to corrosion.</jats:p>"

Based on interviews with Unite shop stewards and work with the union’s Research Department, this article explores efforts within Unite the Union, the largest private and public sector trade union in the UK and Ireland, to advance such a strategy through the union’s activist shop stewards and democratic structures. While considering the limitations of existing union approaches to trade issues as well as the challenges of developing such a strategy within the context of a large multisector trade union, the article puts forward a methodology of applied industrial research rooted in the principles of workers’ inquiry and supply chain solidarity. Taken together, the article considers the potential for new collaboration between the union’s shop stewards within supply chains to more fully realize their latent collective industrial power.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to enumerate the extent of the LULC change from 1986 to 2018, its measurable impacts on nutrient losses and major pollution areas based on the SWAT in the Bilate catchment, southern Ethiopia. The sequential uncertainty fitting version two (SUFI-2) algorithm in SWAT-CUP was used in calibration and validation. Calibration and validation showed good agreement between observed and simulated values. Results showed that significant changes in nutrient loss occurred, following the direction of LULC changes between 1986–2002 and 2002–2018. The increase in agricultural land and built-up area accounted for 9.46% and 0.69% of the catchment area, respectively. The total phosphorus and nitrogen loads reached 2.52–1.27 kg/ha and 15.41–31.69 kg/ha between 1986–2002 and 2002–2018. Sub-basins 11, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 55 were the most important areas with nutrient pollution sources identified. The nutrient loads reduce water quality and fish productivity in Lake Abaya. The results of this study improved the understanding of nutrient loading from LULC changes and provided the required knowledge on integrating LULC and water-quality management.</jats:p>",

Due to the unbalanced supply of UR PG, this paper studies the distribution gap of UR PG through DM. This article mainly uses experimental, comparative, and survey methods to compare and analyze the urban-rural income gap and uses modern technology to describe the relationship between the supply of PG and income. Experimental results show that the UR income gap ratio is above 2, and the gap is still large. Therefore, for the supply of PG, there are also certain differences between UR areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study aims to find out the collaboration between Theory of Constraints (TOC) and Supply Chain Management (SCM) at a manufacturing company, especially that produces infusions. This is a qualitative research with interpretive approach. The collaboration between TOC and SCM is to identify on overall company constraints such as internal constraints on production process as broken machine, power outage, and ineffective production process flow, and external constraints related to suppliers and customers such as defective raw materials, delays in the delivery of raw material, and delay transportation of shipping to customer. The company overcomes the constraints by providing solutions as quickly as possible. The solutions that are provided by the company are scheduling engine maintenance, power outage schedules, providing generators, and port schedules. They may require no small cost, but customers’ satisfaction is the most important thing. The factors that influence the constraints are human, time and technical. This research also explores the social values ​​adopted by the company by donating to victims of natural disasters and donated to the employees’ family. Based on the evaluation of all the aspects, it can be concluded that company efficiency is not the basis for being judged materially.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The expansion of marine renewable power is a major alternative for the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. In Europe, however, the high penetration of offshore wind brings intermittency and power variability into the existing power grid. Offshore solar photovoltaic power is another technological alternative under consideration in the plans for decarbonization. However, future variations in wind, air temperature or solar radiation due to climate change will have a great impact on both renewable energy resources. In this context, this study focusses on the offshore energy assessment off the coast of Western Iberia, a European region encompassing Portugal and the Northwestern part of Spain. Making use of a vast source of data from 35 simulations of a research project called CORDEX, this study investigates the complementarity of offshore wind and solar energy sources with the aim of improving the energy supply stability of this region up to 2040. The most pessimistic greenhouse gases emission scenario (RCP8.5) is considered. The 35 simulations are validated by comparing wind speed at 10m, air temperature at 2m and solar radiation values with data from the ERA5 reanalysis database. Although the offshore wind energy resource has proven to be higher than solar photovoltaic resource at annual scale, both renewable resources showed significant spatiotemporal energy variability throughout the western Iberian Peninsula. When both renewable resources are combined, the stability of the energy resource increased considerably throughout the year. The proposed wind and solar combination scheme is assessed by a performance classification method called Delphi, considering stability, resource, risk, and economic factors. The total index classification increases when resource stability is improved by considering hybrid offshore wind-photovoltaic solar energy production, especially along the nearshore waters.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

Losses incurred due to water loss include being unable to meet drinking water needs, reduced revenues, increased operational costs and worsening infrastructure. One of the concrete efforts of PDAM management is to control the level of water loss. Water loss is defined as the difference between production volume and collectible water volume based on customer meter. Data analysis for water loss control is done by identifying the existing PDAM conditions related to Non Revenue Water (NRW) level issues and efforts that have been made to address them. Identification of PDAM existing conditions begins with identifying the service area as a whole through an existing network map. Then the identification of existing conditions of PDAM through existing water balance data. Water balance data is available for each component of the water balance so that existing conditions are obtained for each existing component for both commercial water loss, physical water loss, and NRW level. Asset management and technology can also play a role in water  loss control analysis. Currently the use of SCADA technology in water loss control is able to monitor, control, and acquire data on a particular process continuously.</jats:p>",

Each supply chain consists of a Tier 0 manufacturer, a Tier 1 supplier, and a pair of Tier 2 suppliers with different disruption probabilities. The two manufacturers are engaged in Cournot competition. The two Tier 1 suppliers that serve different manufacturers may procure from different or the same Tier 2 suppliers. We investigate the impact of upstream supply chain structures on the manufacturers' performance by comparing two representative configurations: the <jats:italic>paralleled supply chain configuration</jats:italic>, which has no overlap in Tier 2 suppliers, and the <jats:italic>overlapped supply chain configuration</jats:italic>, which has the same Tier 2 suppliers. We derive the manufacturers' equilibrium sourcing strategies in the two configurations. When the more reliable Tier 2 supplier is quite reliable or the more unreliable Tier 2 supplier is very unreliable, both manufacturers offer a low wholesale price to induce their Tier 1 suppliers for single sourcing. When the more reliable Tier 2 supplier is not sufficiently reliable and the more unreliable Tier 2 supplier is not that unreliable, both manufacturers offer a high wholesale price to induce their Tier 1 suppliers for dual sourcing. There are also certain conditions under which one manufacturer chooses the high‐price sourcing strategy and the other one chooses the low‐price sourcing strategy. Besides, we demonstrate that competition decreases the manufacturers' incentives to induce dual sourcing. In a more competitive market, the manufacturers prefer less overlap in their upper suppliers. Finally, we conduct several extensions to show the robustness of our findings.</jats:p>",

This study examines the business unit in the supply chain channel in producing food products from Cowhide in Indonesia. There are many business units with high demand for rawhides from cattle for use as food products. Thus, this opportunity is utilized to increase the productivity of business units in Indonesia. This study aims to determine the business unit utilization in the supply chain channel by considering patterns of business processes, value-added products, and optimal supply chain strategies.Design/methodology/approach: The study interviews 18 business units of Cowhide in Indonesia, including two slaughterhouses, five cattle owners, three restaurants, two cowhide drying business units, one cowhide cracker business unit, three cowhide traders’ traditional markets, one cowhide boiler business unit, and one retail shop. The SCOR model, Hayami, and discrete event simulation are integrated to analyze business unit utilization in Cowhide's food products' supply chain channel.Findings: There are five supply chain channels from 7 business units in food products. Then, the highest value-added product ratio was the cowhide cracker business unit at 31%. Finally, Channel 1 is the highest utilization rate of 40%. Moreover, the policymaker can study non-food products to compare cowhide raw materials' business unit utilization because Indonesia has many of these raw materials and is easy to obtain.Research limitations/implications: Further study is suggested to measure each business unit's performance in the supply chain channel and then strengthen institutions to increase productivity.Originality/value: This study needs to measure each business unit's performance in strengthening its supply chain strategy to optimize the supply chain channel. This study's implication can contribute to business units in improving their business processes and stakeholders in the decision-making process, including associations, communities, cooperatives, and the Government, in increasing the potential for economic growth on SMEs in especially of Cowhide.</jats:p>"

While agriculture is the most important industry in rural areas and provides livelihoods for 70% of the world's poor, it is also the industry that creates the greatest disconnect between suppliers and retailers. In addition, due to lack of transparency, buyers and customers cannot be sure of the true value of a product or service. The proposed system is an agricultural supply chain model using the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are implemented in different stages of the supply chain. These contracts guarantee to meet all predefined conditions before conducting transactions ensuring security, reliability and transparency. This can give consumers greater confidence in the products they buy, and it is also an opportunity to reward producers who use good agricultural practices to develop their products. This will ultimately lead to sustainable farming practices and responsible consumption. Keywords: Supply Chain; Ethereum; Smart Contracts; Transparency; Agriculture;</jats:p>"

Many water as[1]sessment studies are restricted to silo thinking, mostly focusing on water-related consequences, while lacking a quantification of trade-offs and synergies of economic, social, and environmental dimensions. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a &amp;amp;#8220;nexus&amp;amp;#8221; approach that integrates a water supply constrained multi-regional input-output (mixed MRIO) model, scenario analysis, and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to quantify the trade-offs and synergies at the sectoral level for the capital region of China, i.e. the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration. A total of 120 industrial transition scenarios includ[1]ing nine major industries with high water-intensities and water consumption under current development pathways were developed to facilitate the trade-off and synergy analysis between economic loss, social goals (here, the number of jobs) and environmental protection (with grey water footprint representing water pollution) triggered by water conservation measures. Our simulation results show that an imposi[1]tion of a tolerable water constraint (a necessary water consumption reduction for regional water stress level to move from severe to moderate) in the region would result in an average economic loss of 68.4 (&amp;amp;#177; 16.0) billion Yuan (1 yuan &amp;amp;#8776; 0.158 USD$ in 2012), or 1.3 % of regional GDP, a loss of 1.94 (&amp;amp;#177; 0.18) million jobs (i.e. 3.5 % of the work force) and a reduction of 1.27 (&amp;amp;#177; 0.40) billion m3 or about 2.2% of the regional grey water footprint. A tolerable water rationing in water-intensive sectors such as Agriculture, Food and tobacco processing, Electricity and heating power production and Chemicals would result in the lowest economic and job losses and the largest environmental benefits. Based on MCDA, we selected the 10 best scenarios with regard to their economic, social and environmental performances as references for guiding future water management and suggested industrial transition policies. This integrated approach could be a powerful policy support tool for 1) assessing trade-offs and synergies among multiple criteria and across multiple region-sectors under resource constraints; 2) quantifying the short-term supply-chain effects of different containment measures, and 3) facilitating more insightful evaluation of SDGs at the regional level so as to determine priorities for local governments and practitioners to achieve SDGs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

For this purpose, two triangular cross-sectional shaped channels with 30° and 45° sidewall slopes were made. In various hydraulic conditions, bed slopes were carried out at different flow discharges and channels. The results have been used to test the stage-discharge curve, Manning roughness coefficient, n, the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, f, and flow velocity profiles. By increasing the channel bed slope and flow discharge, the water surface fluctuation increased simultaneously. The fluctuation of flow surface profile in the triangular cross section (TCS) at 45° is more than in TCS 30° cases. The stage-discharge rating curve has less curvature with increasing channel bed slope. The Darcy-Weisbach f obtained from TCS 30° is higher than for TCS 45°, which means that TCS 30° has more resistance against flowing water passing through the channel than the 45° cross-section. Examination of the velocity contours shows that the maximum velocity occurred in the 30° triangular cross-section. Practical-sound findings from this research might be helpful for hydraulic engineers to design cost-effective open channels and other similar hydraulic structures.</jats:p>",

In this context, for the studies about platform supply chain management with manufacturer’s green production and the platform’s marketing activities simultaneously are rare, we consider that a manufacturer invests in green technologies to produce products and sell them through a smart platform supply chain by an agency selling or reselling strategy, in which the platform provides data-driven marketing technology to promote green products. Four game models are constructed to study the operational efficiency of the platform supply chain considering selling strategy difference and government subsidy. The results show that: (1) The manufacturer’s green technology and the platform’s data-driven marketing levels, as well as all member’s profits are all influenced by the potential market demand of green products, the sensitivities of consumers to green product attributes, and data analysis technology. (2) The service commission rate charged by the platform plays a main role on the manufacturer’s selling strategy choice, when the service commission rate is low, the manufacturer chooses an agency selling strategy and can obtain more profit, but now the green technology level is not necessarily better than that in the reselling system. With the service commission rate increases, a manufacturer that chooses the reselling strategy can obtain more profit, and the green technology level is better than in the agency selling system. (3) Government subsidy can effectively encourage the manufacturer to improve the green technology level, and now the platform will improve the data-driven marketing level. There is a threshold range of the service commission rate charged by the platform in which the government can guide the manufacturer and the platform to reach an equilibrium selling strategy by regulating the subsidy level.</jats:p>"

The objective then is to coordinate business processes from manufacturers, suppliers, transportation, warehouses, distributors, and partners to the customer in such a way that lower costs, shorter production times and product and service quality adapted to customer requirements are achieved. In the present work, a system is created that evaluates the behavior of the supply chain based on quality. To carry it out, focus groups and exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation are used to compile the main components of quality management in the SCQM supply chain and the set of dependent variables associated with the determining factors. The results show the most valuable key factors and this is an instrument that allows their evaluation. In the development of the research, the review of impact literature is carried out, methods, techniques and tools such as interviews, document review, work with experts, brainstorming, descriptive analysis and exploratory factor analysis, diagrams or control graphs are used.</jats:p>"

The presented sustainable purchasing and supply management (SPSM) competence model is based on the combination of a systematic literature review (SLR) and a Delphi study. The competence model outlines specific SPSM competences which are divided into functional-oriented, cognition-oriented, social-oriented and meta-oriented competence clusters. We also discuss their applicability during typical purchasing and supply management processes. Each of the 26 competences is presented with a short definition as well as exemplary behaviors. For research on SPSM from an organizational point of view, the analysis of the relevance of competences with regard to purchasing process stages offers a conceptual basis for bringing sustainability into overall PSM models, instead of positioning sustainability as an ‘add-on’ activity, which risks the potential of sustainability issues becoming marginalized. The resulting SPSM competence model can serve as a basis for improving teaching and training in both higher education and professional training contexts. In practice, it can also serve to aid the selection of new employees, evaluate employee performance, create development plans or build HR systems.</jats:p>",

Back propagation neural network (BPNN) is applied to energy supply predicting and energy security early warning in oil–gas enterprises, and the security early warning system is designed based on the auxiliary cognitive system. The security early warning system is used to predict the peak value of oil and gas supply, and then the detection performances and the data security transmission performances of different models are compared and analysed. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation model for security management of oil–gas supply chain based on the neural network is established. It is found that compared with convolutional neural network (CNNs), the improved BPNN model algorithm proposed shows increased accuracy by 5.4%, reduced model training time and test time, and improved accuracy and recall rate. The accuracy, recall rate, and F1 value of the proposed model are 88.48%, 75.88%, and 96.21%, respectively, which were obviously higher than those of the CNN. It suggests that the improved security management model of oil–gas supply chain shows better recognition and prediction accuracy. Based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis results, the optimization suggestions for management strategies in oil–gas enterprises are put forward, which is of strategic significance for improving the security of oil–gas supply.</jats:p>",

Correlation and structural equation models (SEM) were used. This technique consists of multiple regression analysis and factor analysis and analyses the structural relationship between the underlying structures and the measured variables. The results indicated a significant relationship between the supply chains that have a loop from the following perspectives: economic motivations, customer awareness, environmental legislation, and sustainability. By increasing financial reasons, customer awareness and environmental legislation, sustainability will increase as they all move in the same direction. Therefore, the overall effect of a closed-loop supply chain is positive and significant.</jats:p>"

This study aimed at mapping the spatial distribution of low and high groundwater-contaminated regions in the Sheikhpura district of Bihar for safe drinking and irrigation water availability. To account for spatial distribution, groundwater quality parameters, such as fluoride, iron, total dissolved solids, turbidity, and pH, were analyzed using integrated interpolation, geographical information systems, and regression analysis. A total of 206 dug wells and bore wells were analyzed for <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> observations in the Sheikhpura district of Bihar, India. The analysis indicated that the periphery south of Chewara and Ariari blocks, i.e., about 9.16% of district area, is affected by fluoride content (1.55–2.32 mg/l) which is highly unsuitable for consumption, as recommended by the WHO and BIS standards. However, the remaining area (90.84%) is within the permissible limit of fluoride content (0.37–1.54 mg/l). In most areas, iron content is beyond WHO permissible limits (&amp;gt;0.1 mg/l), except 3.1% area in the eastern region with 0.06–0.12 mg/l iron, although iron concentrations in groundwater are under the acceptable limit (&amp;lt;0.3 mg/l) as per BIS standard across the district. However, pH and total dissolved solids were within permissible limits. Each of the modeled geospatial maps was validated using a set of 17 <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> observations. The best-fit model between observed and predicted variables such as fluoride, iron, total dissolved solids, and pH produced a coefficient of determination (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) of 0.96, 0.905, 0.91, and 0.906, respectively. The findings of this study provide insights and understanding on groundwater pollution regimes and minimize uncertain causes because of the high spatial distribution of geogenic fluoride and iron occurrence, and will also be helpful to policymakers for better planning, investments, and management to supply potable water in the area.</jats:p>"

Often conflated with a lack of access, misinterpretation of what unmet need means and how it is measured has important implications for family planning programs. We review previous examinations of unmet need, with a focus on the roles of access and demand for contraception, as well as the role of population control in shaping the indicator's priorities. We suggest that disaggregating unmet need into “demand‐side unmet need” (stemming from lack of demand) and “supply‐side unmet need” (stemming from lack of access) could allow current data to be leveraged into a more person‐centered understanding of contraceptive need. We use Demographic and Health Survey data from seven sub‐Saharan African countries to generate a proof‐of‐concept, dividing women into unmet need categories based on reason for contraceptive nonuse. We perform sensitivity analyses with varying conceptions of access and disaggregate by education and marital status. We find that demand‐side unmet need far exceeds supply‐side unmet need in all scenarios. Focusing on supply‐side rather than overall unmet need is an imperfect but productive step toward person‐centered measurement, while more sweeping changes to family planning measurement are still required.</jats:p>",

The alternative reservoir operation strategies corresponding to the flood storage capacity (Vpl) of 10, 20, and 30% of the active storage capacity (Vhi) are evaluated and compared with the prevailing inter-reservoir operation procedure in terms of inundation effects. The results reveal that increasing the Vpl from 10% to 30% of the Vhi reduces the flooded area by 11.8% and lowers the water level at downstream stations from 6% to 30%. The government's procedure is considered safe to supply water, but the inundation duration is longer, resulting in more damage than the scenario of Vpl=20%Vhi. Regarding urbanization, the expansion of newly urbanized areas has resulted in increased flooding in their surrounding areas, with an increase in flood depth of more than 3 m. Moreover, the new roads have reduced the capacity of flood drainage and caused severe flooding. The water level difference between the two sides of the road can be as high as 2 m. This research will assist managers in developing and implementing appropriate downstream flood control measures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, there are three sub-districts in Tasikmalaya City that are still vulnerable to clean water, namely Kawalu, Tamansari, and Cibeureum sub-districts. PDAM Tirta Sukapura, owned by the Tasikmalaya Regency Government, has not been able to meet clean water needs, so the Tasikmalaya Municipality Government plans to build a new PDAM as an alternative. The Ciwulan river in Cibeuti Village is a source of water that will be used as a collection point. Rain data was taken from 2 stations, namely Gunung Satria and Cikunten II stations, for ten years. The evapotranspiration value was calculated using the Penman-Monteith method. The calculation of the discharge in the intake area, namely Ciwulan-Cibeuti with a watershed area of ​​405 km2, used the NRECA method using parameters taken from the calibrated Ciwulan-Sukaraja station. The calibration parameters are PSUB = 0.86; GWF = 0.22, reduction coefficient = 0.80; and NSE = 0.764. The determination of the dependable flow is calculated using the Weibull method. The magnitude of the Q90's dependable flow is 4.3 m3/s. The projected population for the next 15 years is estimated at 307,857 people, so the amount of water needed is around 0.535 m3/s. Opportunities for business entities to participate in building PDAM are wide open, with the certainty of return plus profits or independent management by business entities within a certain period of time. The challenge for the government and business entities is to provide reasonable prices to customers and new networks.</jats:p>"

One of the issues to fulfill this objective is ensuring high reliability indexes of the associated DC/DC converter, which is indispensable in practice. Three-stage interleaved boost converter is proposed in this context with a reliability-based reconfiguration control. The proposed control approach is passivity based, it is robust against high-temperature variations and load perturbations. However, this article proposes a novel method that adapts the reference current by a linear transformation. The fault tolerant control manages the open circuit failure to adapt the control algorithm to two-stage converter reconfigured structure. The matlab/simulink-based simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme as well as the reconfiguration method, which can give a technical improvement in the exploitation of PEMFC power supplies in the presence of faults and perturbations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: We study the coordination of an E-commerce supply chain between online sellers and third party shippers to meet random demand surges, induced by, for instance, online shopping holidays. Academic/practical relevance: Motivated by the challenge of meeting the unpredictable demand surges in E-commerce, we study shipping contracts and supply chain coordination between online sellers and third party shippers in a novel model taking into account the unique features of the shipping industry. Methodology: We compare two shipping contracts: the risk penalty (proposed by UPS) and the flat rate (used by FedEx), and analyze their impact on the seller, the shipper, and the supply chain. Results: Under information symmetry, the sophisticated risk penalty contract is no better than the simple flat rate contract for the shipper, against common belief. Although both the risk penalty and the flat rate can coordinate the supply chain, the risk penalty does so only if the shipper makes zero profit, but the flat rate can provide a positive profit for both. These results represent a new form of double marginalization and risk-sharing, in sharp contrast to the well-known literature on the classic supplier-retailer supply chain, where risk-sharing contracts (similar to the risk penalty) can bring benefits to all parties, but the single wholesale price contract (similar to the flat rate) can achieve supply chain coordination only when the supplier makes zero profit. We also find that only the online seller, but not the shipper, has the motivation to vertically integrate the seller-shipper supply chain. Under information asymmetry, however, the risk penalty brings more benefit to the shipper than the flat rate, but hurts the seller and the supply chain. Managerial implications: Our results imply that information plays an important role in the shipper’s choices of shipping contracts. Under information symmetry, the risk penalty is unnecessarily complex because the simple flat rate is as good as the risk penalty for the shipper; moreover, it is better for the seller-shipper coordination. However, under information asymmetry, the shipper faces additional shipping risk that can be offset by the extra flexibility of the risk penalty. Our study also explains and supports the recent practice of online sellers (e.g., Amazon.com and JD.com), but not shippers, to vertically integrate the supply chain by consistently expanding their shipping capabilities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In relation to the main element of the hydrogen storage and supply system based on the hydro-reacting composition – the gas generator – an algorithm for its control has been developed. The development of such an algorithm is carried out in three stages. At the first stage, the problem of formalizing the hydrogen generation process is solved. Formalization of this process is carried out using the transfer function of the gas generator. The use of the criterion for the minimum error of the mismatch of the given amplitude-frequency characteristics of the gas generator allows to represent its transfer function in the form of a transfer function of the inertial link. At the second stage, the problem of determining the conditions for the occurrence of self-oscillations in the pressure stabilization subsystem is solved. A prerequisite for the emergence of a self-oscillating mode of operation of the hydrogen storage and supply system is the presence of a relay static characteristic of the pressure sensor. For the characteristic parameters of such a system, the ranges of values of the parameters of self-oscillations, frequencies and amplitudes, are determined. For these parameters, analytical expressions are obtained, which include the main parameters of the pressure stabilization subsystem in the hydrogen storage and supply system.&#x0D;\nAt the third stage, the problem of forming a gas generator control algorithm is solved. As a test action in the implementation of the control algorithm, self-oscillations in the pressure stabilization subsystem are used. The control algorithm for the gas generator of the hydrogen storage and supply system includes determining the parameters of self-oscillations and comparing their values with the values obtained a priori.&#x0D;\nA typical diagram of a hydrogen storage and supply system is presented, in which the developed gas generator control algorithm is implemented</jats:p>"

Selecting the right suppliers and establishing proper ordering and shipping systems are important to reduce unnecessary resource loss and improve the core competitiveness of enterprises. However, most scenarios for supplier selection, order allocation, and transportation solution selection remain largely unknown, particularly in the context of big data. To overcome this problem, this study presents a two-level supply chain network. The ranking and selection of suppliers are achieved by constructing a supplier importance measurement index system and establishing an evaluation model with principal component analysis, while combining the greed idea to establish constraint equations for multiple indicators, order allocation to selected suppliers, and finally, the allocation of transportation solutions considering the loss rate of operators. Finally, a real-world example is employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

At the same time, the optimization of their resources is a major concern for industries to minimize carbon emissions, boost sustainable practices, and improve a country’s long-term economic development. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the impact of Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) methods on operational performance with the mediation of technological innovation, in the context of Pakistani manufacturing firms. The partial least square-structural modeling (PLS-SEM) method is adopted in this paper. Data were gathered from 223 different manufacturing firms in Pakistan and then analyzed among these variables. The data show good validity and reliability, and structural model explains 61% of the variance in operational performance and 45.4% of the variance in technical innovation, demonstrating its predictive validity. The R-square criteria classify R-square entities of 0.67, 0.33, and 0.19 as considerable, moderate, and weak, respectively. It is demonstrated that all the f-square values are greater than 0.020 and 0.35, indicating a significant effect on the model’s validity. The findings of this study reveal that GSCM practices have a significantly positive effect on both technological innovation and operational performance. Technological innovation has a direct influence on operational performance and has a partial mediating effect on the relationship between GSCM practices and operational performance. Therefore, this research offers managers insight into the importance of technological innovation and GSCM practice adoption to achieve competitive advantages. It further provides the groundwork for managers, practitioners, and environmental management researchers to emphasize the value of GSCM practice in improving operational performance.</jats:p>"

Reasons behind shifting trends of flow patterns were also investigated. Model performance was validated and simulated data was synchronous to observed data. In general, percentage of Pattern (6) was 14%, 20%, 17%, 12% and 11% per annum and in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively by 2013. It was increased by 26%, 30%, 22%, 25% and 35% per annum and in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively since 2014. Increased temperature and flow dynamics (such as 10,000 m3 s−1 in spring) in Three Gorges Resevoir (TGR) since 2014 were underlying shifting trends of density current patterns. Correlation among patterns prior to and after newly built upstream reservoirs was novel and innovative in finding hydrodynamic thresholds to increase effectivity. Particulars elaboated and associated with respective density current patterns indicate increased surface velocity and water exchange with increased overflows. This could help understanding hydrodynamics and ecological variations in TGR and XXB. Thermal establishment and flow dynamics in TGR triggering overflow intrusion in XXB are required to be achieved. A hydrodynamic and water quality model of XXB coupled with TGR mainstream is recommended to correlate additive impacts of advantageous and disadvantageous patterns and to evaluate hydrodynamical thresholds triggering advantageous patterns in XXB.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the present era of vulnerabilities, the concept of the resilient supply chain has appeared to be the most promising and efficient tool to adapt and recover from significant disruptions. Though enormous research is available regarding the capabilities and practices that enable the resilient supply chain’s success, little consideration is given to the barriers that inhibit its successful implementation in the actual scenario. In this research, we have identified 14 critical barriers to resilient supply chain in the context of the Indian manufacturing supply chain. Further, we have used an integrated Fuzzy-DEMATEL approach to evaluate these barriers. The findings reveal that lack of managerial commitment is among the most influencing barriers to the resilient supply chain, followed by poor risk awareness and poor information sharing. This research enables the academicians to understand the resilient supply chain’s various capabilities, practices and barriers and provides a novel approach for quantitative analysis of the subjective parameters. Moreover, the findings enable the supply chain practitioners to allocate the resources and capabilities that mitigate the barriers and make the supply chain genuinely resilient. </jats:p>",

At the same time, the pandemic has intensified interest among businesses, governments, and academics to examine environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues. In today’s hyper-globalized economy, ESG measures are futile unless they explicitly incorporate a firm’s end-to-end operations throughout its entire supply chain. On the other hand, well-calibrated ESG measures should play a central role in guiding a firms’ day-to-day supply chain management practices. To illustrate the value of unifying ESG and end-to-end supply chain thinking, we present three supply chain cases that arose amid the COVID-19 pandemic, involving online platforms; public health supply chains; and vaccine development, manufacturing, and distribution, respectively. Drawn from these three cases, we spotlight some new research opportunities in both ESG and supply chain management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Введение. Проблема недостаточного употребления йода (I) и неблагоприятных последствий его дефицита (ЙД) в питании населения Украины остается актуальной. Основными природными источниками I для человека являются продукты растительного и животного происхождения, вода, воздух. Исследования, которые проводились в разных странах, доказали, что ЙД является проблемой, непосредственно связанной с питанием.Цель. Оценка питания и йодного обеспечения школьников 10–12 лет г. Киева. Материалы и методы. Обследовано 60 детей в возрасте 10–12 лет (33 мальчика и 27 девочек). Проведены определение I в моче с последующим расчетом медианы, ультразвуковое исследование щитовидной железы (ЩЖ), анкетирование родителей и детей. Оценка результатов исследования осуществлялась согласно критериям ВОЗ: нормальная экскреция I с мочой – 100–200 мкг/л; недостаточная – 50–100 мкг/л, соответствует ЙД легкой степени; 20–50 мкг/л – ЙД средней степени; ниже 20 мкг/л – тяжелый ЙД.Результаты. Анкетирование показало, что дети не получают достаточного количества I, витаминов, макро- и микроэлементов. Медиана йода мочи (МЙМ) детей обследованной группы составляла от 22,19 до 484,66 мкг/л. МЙМ ниже 100 мкг/л имели почти 40,0% детей, наблюдалось смещение результатов влево, что указывает на их неравномерное распределение. Среди обследованных 51,7% имеют достаточное обеспечение I, 48,3% детей находились в зоне слабого и умеренного ЙД. Частота случаев зоба у мальчиков – 9,1%, у девочек – 25,9%. Средние показатели частоты зоба у детей – 20%.Заключение. Анкетирование школьников свидетельствует о недостаточном поступлении I, белка, микро- и макроэлементов с продуктами питания, их рацион питания нельзя считать правильным. В большинстве домохозяйств не используется йодированная соль. 51,7% детей 10–12 лет имеют достаточное обеспечение I, однако 48,3% детей находятся в зоне слабого и умеренного ЙД. Средние показатели частоты зоба у детей составляют 20%, что соответствует слабому ЙД. Несмотря на то что питание имеет важное значение в развитии йододефицитных заболеваний (ЙДЗ), говорить о массовой профилактике ЙДЗ путем его коррекции нельзя.</jats:p>\n                                                                                            <jats:p>Introduction. The problem of insufficient intake of iodine (I) and the adverse consequences of its deficiency (ID) in the diet for the population of Ukraine remains relevant. Researches that have been carried out in different countries have proven that ID is a problem directly related to nutrition.Purpose. Assessment of nutrition and iodine supply of schoolchildren 10–12 years old in Kyiv.Materials and methods. 60 children aged 10–12 years were examined (33 boys and 27 girls).The determination of I in urine with the subsequent calculation of the median, ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland (TG), questioning of parents and children was carried out. The results of the study were assessed according to the WHO criteria: normal urinary excretion of I 100–200 mcg/l; 50–100 mcg/l – insufficient and meets mild ID; 20–50 mcg/l – medium grade ID; below 20 mcg/l – severe ID.Results. The survey showed that children do not get enough I, vitamins, macro- and microelements. The median urine iodine (MIM) of the children of the examined group ranged from 22.19 mcg/l to 484.66 mcg/l. Almost 40.0% of children had MIM below 100 mcg/l, there was a shift in the results to the left, which indicates their uneven distribution. Among the surveyed 51.7% have sufficient support I, however, 48.3% of children were in the zone of weak and moderate ID. The incidence of goiter in boys is 9.1%, and in girls – 25.9%. The average rate of goiter in children is 20%.Conclusion. A questionnaire survey of schoolchildren indicates an insufficient intake of I, protein, micro- and macroelements with food, their diet cannot be considered rational. Most households do not use iodized salt. 51.7% of children 10–12 years old have sufficient support I, however 48.3% of children are in the zone of weak and moderate ID. The average rates of goiter in children are 20%, which corresponds to a weak ID. Despite the fact that nutrition is important in the development of iodine deficiency diseases (IDD), it is impossible to talk about mass prevention of IDD by correcting it.</jats:p>",

Specifically, two Tuscany companies in the world of fashion footwear sector have been assisted in the analysis of their supply chains. In particular, the case research method has been employed for theory building to evaluate how companies reacted to the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to focus on potential resilience strategies that could be adopted to deal with a disruption, such as that caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, in order to understand the dynamics of the supply chains, the standard production processes were initially studied and mapped, analyzing in detail the planning, programming, and control phase. After conducting a descriptive analysis of the data, possible resilience factors of SMEs’ fashion supply chains have been extracted, and strategies that SMEs could adopt to better cope with the disruption caused by the pandemic have been suggested. The outcomes of this study can be used by decision-makers to predict the operative and long-term impacts of epidemic outbreaks on the supply chains with some suggestions of potential resilience improvement strategies. The paper is concluded by summarizing the most important insights and outlining future research agenda.</jats:p>"

There is an urgent need for a new high-quality voltage sensor to replace it. Aiming at the problems of complex structure, difficult adjustment, poor temperature stability, large optical power loss and inconvenient voltage introduction of the existing optical fiber voltage sensor, an optical fiber voltage sensor based on full polarization state detection without polarizer and analyzer is proposed. The sensor only contains three main components: Grin Lens, BGO crystal and total reflection mirror. It has few devices, simple structure and easy alignment. Moreover, the polarization state evolution and high voltage on the transmission line of Pockels effect of BGO crystal are analyzed. The voltage sag simulation model of the electrified railway is established. The sample data of different disturbance sources are obtained with the assistance of the designed optical fiber voltage sensor. S-transformation and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks are introduced and combined with the prototype of electrified railway power quality detection and analysis device to identify voltage sag sources. The designed optical fiber voltage sensor is suspended. There is no electrode or grounding on the sensor, which saves expensive insulators and increases the sensor’s measuring range. The sensor has a good linear relationship in the power frequency AC voltage range of 0~10 kV at room temperature. It is proved that the design is effective. The working condition analysis of the actual railway power supply reveals that it can detect the voltage sag amplitude and disturbance time, and identify the type of voltage sag disturbance source.</jats:p>",

In addition, the government’s contribution and assistance to SMMEs were low. While suppliers’ integration (r = 0.051, p 0.05), information sharing (r = 0.052, p 0.05) and postponement (r = 0.98, p 0.05) had no significant effect on performance, the extent of outsourcing (r = 0.121, p 0.05) did. Results finally showed that government assistance (r = 0.61, p 0.05) has a positive and significant effect on supply chain management practices. The study concluded that suppliers’ integration and information sharing capabilities were fairly good among the entrepreneurs, the operational performance level among the entrepreneurs was high and satisfactory, and the government’s contribution to the growth of SMMEs was found to be significant, but generally low.</jats:p>"

Despite recent attempts to provide such estimates, much empirical work remains to be done considering the prevailing shifts in consumption trends in the Philippines. Price and expenditure elasticities are estimated for seven food categories for rural and urban Filipino households, using Stone–Lewbel (SL) price indices and the quadratic almost-ideal demand system (QUAIDS) model. We used multiple years (2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018) of the Philippines Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) to estimate the food demand system. The results show that rice is a normal good for most households, particularly for rural consumers. However, it is an inferior good for the top 30% of rural Filipinos and the top 40% of urban Filipinos. As income increases, such wealthy households tend to replace their rice-dominated diet with nutrient-dense food products. Female-headed households, younger households, and households with educated members consume significantly more animal proteins such as meat and dairy products.</jats:p>"

Quantitative analysis of the environmental impacts (water, energy and carbon) of urban agglomerations can make trade‐offs among water conservation, energy use, climate change mitigation, and urban development. In this study, a multi‐layer water‐energy‐carbon production path analysis (MWPPA) model is developed for identifying the key final demands, sectors and supply chain paths of the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PUA). Results show that, water, energy and carbon‐emission intensities respectively reduced by 27.3%, 35.6% and 27.6% in 2015, compared to the levels in 2012. More than half of the water‐energy‐carbon (WEC) footprints are export‐driven, where Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan dominate the WEC footprints of PUA. Results also disclose that Shenzhen is the main recipient of water‐energy, while Jiangmen and Huizhou are the main providers of water and energy, respectively. Policy makers are suggested that each industry actively integrate into global value chains in order to leverage its comparative advantage, and Huizhou should take full advantage of its fossil base to form a complete industry chain from the R&amp;D end to the production end around the energy industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: Fast recovery from sourcing interruptions is a key objective for global supply chains and for business continuity professionals. In this paper, we study the impact of different supply chain strategies—supplier diversification and the use of long-term relationships—on the ability of a supply chain to recover from sourcing interruptions. Academic/practical relevance: Improving supply chains’ recovery ability has been an important focus area for both practitioners and academics. Collectively, available anecdotal evidence and theoretical analyses provide ambiguous recommendations driven by competing effects of different sourcing strategies. Our paper provides the first rigorous and large-scale empirical evidence relating the use of different supply chain strategies to the ability of a supply chain to recover from supply interruptions. Methodology: We develop a compound estimator of a supply chain’s recovery rate that can be constructed using limited available data (only the time series of firms’ actual sourcing behavior). Using more than two and half million import manifests, we extract firms’ maritime sourcing transactions and use this data to estimate recovery rates of different firm-category supply chains of publicly traded U.S. firms. Results: We find that supplier diversification is associated with slower recovery from sourcing interruptions, whereas the use of long-term relationships is associated with faster recovery. A one standard deviation decrease in the former is associated with a 16% faster recovery, and a like increase in the latter is associated with a 20% faster recovery. Managerial implications: Our paper brings important empirical evidence to the hitherto theoretical debate on the impact of sourcing strategies on faster recovery in supply chains. We therefore provide actionable advice on supply chain design for faster recovery. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: The Classic Latarjet Procedure (CLP) is a proven method for increasing anterior shoulder stability, where the posterior aspect of an osteotomized coracoid is fixed to the glenoid rim. De Beer’s Congruent-Arc Technique (CAT) is a recognized variation where the medial aspect of the coracoid is fixed to the glenoid. Consolidation of the coracoid graft depends on the compression achieved and the vascularity of the graft. Nonunion rates of 9.4% have been documented in the literature. Methods: Ethical approval was granted for our study by the medical school ethics board. Eight cadaveric shoulders were dissected using the standard deltopectoral approach. In each limb, the blood supply to the coracoid was identified, photographed, and protected. The coracoid process was osteotomized at its elbow and a bone transfer was performed. The effects on the coracoid blood supply of CLP vs CAT were noted. Results: In all cases, the blood supply to the coracoid process arose directly from the axillary artery, bifurcating close to the tip of the coracoid. CLP was performed with no disruption to the arterial supply of the coracoid or pectoralis minor. CAT was found to stretch the arterial supply in most specimens, potentially impacting blood supply to the coracoid. CAT also requires the sacrifice of the arterial branch to the insertion of the pectoralis minor. Conclusion: CLP appears less likely to stretch its arterial supply compared to CAT and allows retention of the arterial branch to pectoralis minor insertion. This has potential implications for graft union and recurrent shoulder instability. </jats:p>",

The metallurgical industry is the third industrial group with the highest consumption of potable water in the world. This study can be used in other metallurgical industry segments besides residences, public and private works. Currently, the water usage scenario of Curitiba and the metropolitan region is classified as ‘quantitative critical’, which can cause companies to accelerate the process of water collection through alternative sources. Through surveying potential sources for water collection, three sources of capture and one point for press water were classified. For validation of these potentials, chemical-physical tests were performed on the water samples. Subsequently, reservoir sizing calculations were performed based on the ABNT NBR 15527 standard. Thus, the first idea of reducing potable water consumption was up to 84%, even in the month with the lowest volume of rain.</jats:p>",

To what extent are these provisions holding back the female labour supply? We estimate a rich dynamic life-cycle model of labour supply and savings for couples and singles using the Method of Simulated Moments for the 1945 and 1955 birth cohorts. Our model matches well the life-cycle profiles of labour market participation, hours, and savings for married and single people, and generates plausible elasticities of labour supply. It implies that eliminating these marriage-related provisions would drastically increase the participation of married women over their entire life cycle, reduce the participation of married men after age 60, and increase savings. If the resulting government surplus were used to lower income taxation, there would be large welfare gains for the vast majority of the population. These results hold for both cohorts, including the later one, which has participation similar to that of more recent generations.</jats:p>",

Many pipelines have already exceeded their design life with some segments more than 50 years with high potential for leaks that have caused production loss. To extend the operating lifetime of existing pipelines, a pipeline repair project was started in 2019 with sleeve installation. Based on factual data, the project team has experienced a delay in the first 2 months of the project. One of the main contributions to the delay was the welding failure that occurred in January 2019. The welding failure has caused a fire incident due to burn-through in the existing pipeline. The root cause analysis of burn-through incidents has been done with the finding of poor welder performance to meet project requirements. The recommendation is to measure the welder’s performance from heat input data records and analyze the rejection rate and capability index. This research demonstrates how Six Sigma methodology using the DMAIC process and Statistical Quality Control can be applied successfully in pipeline repair projects to address issues of reducing defective welds, improving quality performance, and achieving project milestones. The analysis result showed an improvement in quality performance where the defect rate continued to decline as well as the capability index of the welder continued to improve and completed sleeve installation above the target. The project team also managed to achieve the six sigma level. Improvements also occurred in safety performance which achieved zero incidents due to welding failure (burn-through) from February 2019 to December 2020. In terms of business, actual cost savings achieved 28% from the approved budget.</jats:p>"

While effects of N supply on P dynamics have been much studied, much less is known about the opposite (P‐effect on N). We conducted a meta‐analysis by compiling a total of 1,734 individual experimental observations from 116 peer‐reviewed publications to assess P‐addition effects on soil N dynamics. Globally, P additions increased the soil total nitrogen (TN) pool, potentially as a result of enhanced plant and microbial immobilization and reduced N losses, with a stronger effect detected under longer duration of P addition (≥5 yr). A coupled increase in soil organic C with TN signifies the fundamental role of exogenous P supply in enhancing soil C sequestration. Phosphorus addition accelerated some of the soil N cycling processes including gross N mineralization, gross nitrification, and denitrification, with the effect sizes varying among ecosystem types and increasing with P addition rates. Our results indicate the fundamental role of P in affecting soil N pools and processes, and highlight the efficacy of P supply in sequestering soil C and mitigating global C emission.</jats:p>",

Then, using artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and gene expression program (GEP) methods, the accuracy of numerical models was evaluated. Results showed that increasing dimensions of the edges increased energy dissipation, and the highest and lowest energy dissipation was related to the models with 3 and 4 serrations, respectively, Compared to the edgeless state, the 4-edge model, with relative dimension of 0.1, increased energy dissipation by an average of 20%, and the 3-edge model, with relative dimension of 0.15, by an average of 69%.

To assess the awareness of pharmaceutical specialists in the Smolensk region about antihypertensive drugs used in children and adolescents. Materials and methods. In 2020, a sociological study was conducted by the method of anonymous questioning among the employees of pharmacies in the Smolensk region. The work design is a prospective study. Results. The study involved 109 pharmaceutical workers, of which 95.4% are women, aged 35 years, with a higher pharmaceutical education and a specialty in pharmacy. Most of the respondents had 5 to 10 years of work experience as a pharmacist. Pharmacy employees prefer reliable information sources in 84.4% of cases. When self-assessing the degree of familiarity of specialists with the group of antihypertensive drugs, the average score of the respondents was 3.8. 57.7% of the surveyed respondents correctly indicated all groups of antihypertensive drugs. Conclusion. When assessing the awareness of pharmaceutical specialists in the Smolensk region about antihypertensive drugs used in children and adolescents, it was found that there is insufficient knowledge of the range of these groups and the importance of additional education for pharmaceutical workers in this area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Product proliferation occurs in supply chains when manufacturers respond to diverse market needs by trying to produce a range of products from a limited variety of raw materials. In such a setting, delaying the point of the proliferation helps manufacturers improve their responsiveness by postponing the ordering decisions of the final products until there is partial or full resolution of the demand uncertainty. This strategy can be implemented in two different ways: (i) redesigning the operations so that the point of proliferation is swapped with a downstream operation or (ii) reducing the lead times. To establish cost efficiency, manufacturers can systematically reduce their operational costs or postpone the high‐cost operations. We consider a multi‐echelon and multi‐product newsvendor problem with demand forecast evolution to analyze the value of each operational lever of the responsiveness and the efficiency. We use a generalized forecast‐evolution model to characterize the demand updating process, and develop a dynamic optimization model to determine the optimal order quantities at different echelons. We demonstrate that reducing the lead time of a downstream operation is more beneficial to manufacturers than reducing the lead time of an upstream operation by the same amount, whereas reducing the upstream operational costs is more favorable than reducing the downstream operational costs. We also indicate that delaying the proliferation may cause a loss of profit, even if it can be achieved with no additional costs. Finally, a decision typology is developed, which shows effective operational strategies depending on product/market characteristics and process flexibility. </jats:p>",

This study could play an important role in elucidating the effect of chlorine disinfection on ARGs.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The systematic review outlining this protocol will be performed according to the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) guidelines. The main question is, “what is the effect of chlorine disinfection on ARGs in drinking water supply systems?” For this purpose, the articles will be considered, in which chlorine’s effect on ARGs is investigated. The search includes electronic resources, grey literature, and related websites. Electronic resources include Scopus, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Science Direct. After the final search, the obtained articles will be collected in the reference management software (Endnote X8). Upon removing the duplicate articles, the first stage of article screening will be performed based on the title and abstract the articles. In the second stage, the articles obtained from the first screening stage will be screened based on the full text of the articles based on the eligibility criteria. Then, two members of the expert team extract the data. To assess the validity of the articles, bias sources will be determined by an expert team. Biases will be defined according to the criteria designed by Bilotta et al. Finally, a narrative synthesis will be performed for the extracted data; if appropriate data are available, quantitative analysis will also be performed.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec>",

This article explores the materials needed for water splitting electrolysis, electrochemical abstraction of hydrogen from light alkanes, and looping thermal-chemical reaction processes that typically form and then dissociate an acid compound in a two- or three-step process. The focus is on the R&amp;D needs of materials that are used for high-temperature electrochemistry, focusing on solid-oxide, ion-conducting cell materials sets (SOECs). To exploit the availability of low-cost electricity, these materials must stand up to cyclic operations. They also must be durable for years of service to reduce operating and maintenance costs, and they must achieve high conversion efficiencies to avoid large, energy-intensive recycle loops.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

To maintain the versatile demand types of products, a retailer is to stock more than one product of the same category, and consequently, he has to purchase products from different manufacturers. This article formulates a dual-channel supply chain model with two manufacturers and a standard retailer, where the optimal online prices, retail prices, wholesale prices, and level of green improvements are decided under different types of decision making power strategies such as Centralized, joint manufacturers Stackelberg, separate Stackelberg, Nash games are investigated. The optimal results are derived and compared with the help of a numerical example. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed to scrutinize the effect of some important parameters. It is found that the green level is higher in a double dual-channel model than in a single dual-channel model. Moreover, the own-channel price sensitivity parameters affect the profit functions of the members negatively. The manufacturers must control the cost-coefficients of greening to increase the green level of the manufacturing products.</jats:p>",

In this study, we examine a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer selling re-products generated from waste products and a single retailer selling new products and consider two settings: enforcing a carbon tax policy or enforcing a subsidy policy. Under each setting, we put CSR into account, construct two models for the retailer to implement or not implement CSR activities, and analyze the decisions obtained under optimal solutions. Through numerical simulation and comparative research, we observe that the carbon tax policy applies to the supply chain where CSR activities are implemented, while the subsidy policy applies to the supply chain where CSR activities are not implemented. Reasonable selection of CSR implementation methods with low-cost coefficients by the retailer is conducive to eliminating profit conflicts among supply chain members. The government should fully consider the decision-making thresholds of supply chain members to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the policy.</jats:p>"

At present, the lack of theoretical research on energy consumption model leads to a certain blindness in the development of energy conservation. Strengthening energy consumption benchmarking management is helpful to quantitatively analyze energy consumption parameters. However, it is difficult to form systematic research on energy consumption and tap the energy-saving potential within the system only based on benchmarking management. Through the research of this paper, the energy consumption data information of energy consumption system can be processed, analyzed and optimized efficiently, the key energy consumption influencing factors can be extracted, the mathematical model can be built, the model base can be provided for the energy consumption analysis of typical energy consumption system, and the general energy consumption evaluation and energy-saving diagnosis tools and systems can be developed as the information processing tools and credentials of energy-saving diagnosis data, Provide scientific guidance for the rational application of power grid energy-saving technology and equipment, and effectively promote the improvement of power grid energy efficiency.</jats:p>",

Faced with this challenge, Cameroon has committed its DSCE to continue its reforms to improve the management of water resources and the implementation of drinking water supply programs throughout the country. Tested by the facts and despite many investments in this sector, the lack of access to drinking water is still glaring among our populations and in particular that of the Sahelian region of the North. Our study aims to explore the influence of socio-political factors in the supply and distribution of drinking water through wells and boreholes in the department of Mayo-Louti. Based on an inductive approach and using the qualitative research method, it is underpinned by the ontology of heuristic subjectivity. The sample is structured in 4 focus groups of 3 respondents each which give a total of 12 participants. These foci are the female, the community leaders, the youth, and the policymakers. However, the sample size is determined theoretically by the saturation point following the principles of grounded theory and the data is analyzed using the process of open coding, axial coding, and selective coding. The study shows the influence of determinants such as drought, demography, housing development, partisan politics, and health on the policy of supply and distribution of drinking water in the community of Mayo-Louti. Furthermore, the research work proposes an inclusive and sustainable model for setting the agenda for water points which is based on the ethical collaboration of all stakeholders in a process of development education.</jats:p>"

In essence, it is a shared database, and the data or information stored in it has the characteristics of “unforgeable,” “full traces,” “traceable,” “open and transparent,” and “collective maintenance.” Based on these characteristics, blockchain technology has laid a solid “trust” foundation, created a reliable “cooperation” mechanism, and has broad application prospects. This paper is aimed at studying a method in view of the integrate of system analysis and system simulation to solve the problems in the production and distribution (P&amp;D) system in the supply chain, proposing a more realistic optimization plan, and then promoting it to various enterprises. This article proposes the idea of using supply chain management, through system analysis, system simulation, case analysis, and comparative research methods, starting from the strategic level, tactical level, and operation level of supply chain management to optimize the P&amp;D system. Pay attention to the P&amp;D system issues in the supply chain environment, and apply the method of system analysis and system simulation to get a better P&amp;D plan. The experimental results of this paper show that the total cost of the supplier selection strategy is 5.204 million yuan, and the delayed delivery rate is 30%. The new reconstruction strategy makes the total cost as low as 3,809,700 yuan, and the total delayed delivery rate is as low as 7%.</jats:p>",

Technically, an energy system is no longer merely a pipe or a cable but also includes more and more ICT technology. Also the management and organization of the infrastructure have become more complex. In the EU, network activities are increasingly unbundled from production and supply. This led to various communication challenges and complicates the operations of the system. Increasingly, energy production and supply is also taking place at the local level, which requires additional ICT technology and management structures. Hence, the level and types of disruptions have become more diverse and the potential for supply disruptions has increased. Disruptions may be the result of external causes (damages to pipelines and cables due to construction work), internal causes (lack of communication between parties) but increasingly also of cybercrime. This chapter examines these developments and the regulatory regime in the EU to protect energy systems and safeguard supply security.</jats:p>",

The Covid-19 pandemic revealed that crisis preparedness is a crucial capability that water utilities must possess. The purpose of this paper is to identify managerial actions and responses that were undertaken by water utility managers in order to reduce the risk related to the first economic lockdown caused by the unexpected Covid-19 crisis. As water utilities should learn from Covid-19 so as to strengthen their future risk preparedness, the paper offers some theoretical underpinnings on risk management. As a result of literature analysis, we focus on the risk management framework that distinguishes five types of risk. The survey was carried out among 116 waterworks in Poland in April 2020. The results indicate the importance of minimising liquidity risk and supply chain risk, which is relevant to the adopted theoretical framework. The findings also highlight the importance of a category that was not originally included in the research model – that is human resource risk, an area that requires managerial attention in the water utility sector. The results could also provide useful pointers for other water utilities, especially those operating in the same or similar legislative regime.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Problem definition: To manage supplier social responsibility (SR), some firms have adopted a self-assessment strategy whereby they ask suppliers to self-report SR capabilities. Self-reported information is difficult to verify, and this leads to an important credibility question: can a buyer expect truthful reporting? We examine whether a supplier’s SR capability can be credibly communicated through free and unverifiable self-reporting. Academic/practical relevance: SR is a strategic focus for firms because consumers care about ethical production. Some firms rely on supplier self-assessment as part of their SR strategy. It is important to understand the value and challenges of this approach. Methodology: We develop a cheap talk model of a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is endowed with a given SR level (privately known to the supplier) that represents the probability of no violation. The buyer sells in a market that is sensitive to publicized SR violations. The supplier first communicates its SR level to the buyer, and then the buyer chooses between two audit stringency levels to conduct on the supplier and also chooses how much to order. Results: Influential truthful communication may emerge in equilibrium if (i) the buyer orders a larger quantity from the high-type supplier but imposes a more stringent audit than the buyer would for the low type and (ii) the high-type supplier opts for this larger order, whereas the low-type, fearing audit failure, does not. The buyer can benefit as the audit becomes more expensive. Managerial implications: Supplier SR self-assessments can be a valuable strategy for buyers but only if the buyer has access to auditing capabilities of different levels and does not precommit to a particular level. It is valuable for firms to engage in an up-front auditing step to ensure a minimum SR capability of approved suppliers because very low-performing suppliers never truthfully report. Implementing supplier self-assessments may or may not help reduce the social damage resulting from potential SR violations; we identify situations when it helps and when it does not. </jats:p>",

Drawing on a qualitative study of a garment hub in South India where such claims have frequently arisen, we explore the conditions of freedom and unfreedom in worker hostels and how suppliers who run such hostels respond to competing expectations about worker freedom. Our findings show that hostels perform three interrelated functions: restriction, protection, and liberation, which together constitute a complex mix of freedom and unfreedom for migrant women workers that we term hybrid (un)freedom. As a result, we problematize the binary understandings of freedom and unfreedom that predominate in the modern slavery literature. We also develop a new way forward for examining freedom in the context of hostels that considers the system of relationships, traditions, and socio-economic arrangements that workers and employers are locked into and that prevent meaningful improvements in the freedom of women workers. </jats:p>",

Rainfall, as an important source of water resources, is gaining more and more attention. Under this background, it is very necessary to analyse the changes in rainfall in Beijing, the capital of China. This study analysed the daily average temperature, rainfall data from 20 stations in the Beijing area in the past 50 years (1960–2012). Linear regression, mean variance, M-K method and ArcGIS spatial analysis are used to analyse Beijing's temperature and rainfall characteristics. These methods are applied to analyse the mutual relations between Beijing's rainfall, temperature changes and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The results show that in the past 50 years in Beijing, the precipitation has shown a downward trend, the temperature has generally shown an upward trend, and the evaporation has generally shown a downward trend. The interrelation between regional climate change and the SOI is not significant. In the past 50 years, urban development has been closely related to the reduction of rainfall and increase in temperature. This study responds to the urgent need for research on the rainfall and temperature.</jats:p>",

A standard questionnaire was used for interview that addressed clinical symptoms, food consumption, and environmental exposures. Clinical specimens were cultured using standard microbiological methods for bacterial and viral pathogens. During 6 days of epidemy, 690 patients were treated to the emergency room of Kruje hospital.\n\n\nRESULTS: Day 3 presented the highest number of patients 39.1% (270/690) and the last day of epidemy presented the lowest number of patients 1.4% (10/690). Abdominal pain continuing with vomiting was more frequently clinical sign among patients. The most affected age group is 15–44 years old, which is also the most active age group. Salmonella Gr. B and Norovirus G2 were the results taken from the examination of stool samples. Analysis of a water sample resulted in Enterococcus faecalis contamination.\n\nCONCLUSION: Problems with drinking water are still present in our country. The latest outbreak shows the special care and importance of safe storage and distribution of drinking water. Investments in water supply as well as rigorous monitoring of drinking water should be an absolute priority of both public health and local government employees.</jats:p>"

Businesses face capital constraints impacting directly on their final product price and demand. This article studies optimal decisions and operational strategies in a logistics network considering two capital-constrained manufacturers who produce products of different qualities and sell them to a retailer having deterministic demand over a specific period. The high quality product manufacturer borrows capital through an online P2P lending platform with a service fee, while the low quality product manufacturer pre-sells products for competing with the high quality product manufacturer. In this study, we find optimal prices of the SC participants, service rate of the online P2P platform and percentage of the pre-ordering quantity of the retailer. We analyse optimal Stackelberg and Nash equilibrium of the SC participants. We find that an increase in the amount of opportunity cost will cause a decrease in the pre-ordering quantity of the retailer affecting the SC profit in numerous ways. The online P2P lending platform should consider the amount of the retailer’s target profit in determining the platform’s service rate. We posit some practical insights based on our numerical study and observations for SC managers enabling them to take appropriate measures about their optimal strategies according to the networks’ existing economic conditions.</jats:p>",

In the present paper, a new factor called local fitness is used in combination with the search space reduction method to obtain an optimal answer. In this method, a fitness function is calculated for each zone. For each zone, proximity of the pressure and flow rates obtained from the model to the corresponding observational data indicates that the values selected for the nodes of that zone are close to the correct values. In the next steps, using a search space reduction method and performing the optimization process with the local fitness function, the chance of selecting those values is increased. In this study, leakage was assigned to nodes with emitter coefficient. This method was used on the water distribution network of Birjand. Three factors of background leakage, leakage hotspot and apparent losses were considered as unknown parameters. Results of the present method were compared with the results of a genetic algorithm (GA) and the corresponding exact values. Based the results, the present method showed better results in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.</jats:p>",

In conjunction with payment terms, we model the impact of two commonly recommended supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices: quick response to supply disruptions and use of a secondary (backup) source. Among other results, we uncover a feedback mechanism that contributes to the negative effect of extended payment terms on a supplier's finances and show that longer payment terms can worsen buyer outcomes, especially when the supplier faces a higher risk of disruptions. We also show that, when considered alongside extended payment terms, common SCRM practices may not always be beneficial for buyer firms. Our research suggests decisions related to SCRM and extended payment terms should not be made independently. </jats:p>",

Such is the case for Runde catchment in Zimbabwe, whose rural communities depend on groundwater. Climate change and increased variability pose a threat to water availability by affecting groundwater potential and recharge, but the full extent of the threat is not well understood. Thus, the main objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater potential and recharge in the catchment. The groundwater potential mapping was performed using a spatially weighted overlay method with inputs: soil type, geology, land use, observed precipitation, topographic wetness index and elevation. This mapping produced a groundwater potential index, classified into groundwater potential zones and cross-validated with borehole yield data, r=0.63 and n=62. The groundwater potential validation showed 1.6 and 4.8% of the total boreholes were in the high (&amp;gt;7 L/s) to very high (4–7 L/s) while 43.5 and 50.1% moderate (1–4 L/s), and low (&amp;lt;1 L/s) groundwater potential zones respectively. The simulated precipitation increased by 23% for 2020–2080. Climate change impacts decreased average groundwater potential by 30.8% (13,062.90 km2) low, 5.8% (2433.25 km2) moderate and increased by 34.8% (14,707 km2) high by 1.8% (789.15 km2) very high groundwater potential.

These constraints lead to a mismatch between demand and supply of water for those sectors. This study applies central tendency and variability to analyze data and a mixed methods approach to interpret the result. From 1999 to 2019, the growth rates of population, gross domestic product, and urban population are ­1.354, 6.084, and 3.70%, respectively, contributing to increased water demand. However, the average groundwater depletion increased from 2.455 km3 (1989–1990) to 4.9016 km3, while the average flood-affected areas enhanced by 8,644 km2 in 2014–2018 compared to 1987–1991. Furthermore, salt-affected areas incremented by 222,810 ha in 2009 contrasted to 1973, whereas the mean wind speed of cyclones increased by 30.02 km in 2015–2020 compared to 1988–1995. The mean sea-level rise increased by 16.8 and 169.2 cm in 1995–2000 compared to 1979–1983 in Cox's Bazar and the Char Changa station, respectively. The Mann–Kendall test was applied to detect the trend.

The results in the study could help in comprehensively understanding the impact of the harmonic on the effective performance of the SIM machines when they were powered using a non-sinusoidal power supply. Here, the performance of the SIM when subjected to a maximum load or non-load condition were studied and determined. Furthermore, numerous experimental work was presented to validate the results of the SIM. Power analyses and spectral analysis indicated the actual difference in the overall harmonic wave distortion. It was seen that the current load increased to 89% (i.e., an increase of 11%) when the motor working from the non-sinusoidal source. This investigation highlighted the direct impact of the non-sinusoidal power source on the properties and components of the SIM machine.

Evaluation of the efficiency of open geothermal systems in flooded and drained mines of the Donetsk basin for heat supply of buildings with maintaining a safe mine water level.        Methods. Both circulation and non-return geothermal systems for the mine water heat recovery are analyzed. We proposed the energy and cost criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of open geothermal systems based on a comparison of the produced thermal energy with the energy costs for its production. The criteria use the relationships of thermodynamics, hydraulics, analytical formulas for calculation of ground water flow and methods to calculate the heat demand of indoor spaces.        Findings. The estimated ranges of thermal capacity from a few tens kW to a few MW and a coefficient of performance (COP) conversion factor of 3.5-6.8 achievable by geothermal systems for the studied closed mines of Donbas correlate well with the values of these indicators at open geothermal systems operated in different countries, which shows the technical and economic feasibility of the installation to cover local heat demands. The possibility to fully cover the needs for thermal energy is shown on the example of buildings with office spaces for staying of a few hundred people. We demonstrate how to preliminary calculate the parameters of mine water circulation with maintaining the safe level in terms of keeping the ground water quality in the areas adjacent to the mine.        Originality. The developed criteria and calculation methodology allow to realistically evaluate the parameters of the efficiency of operation for open non-return and circulation geothermal systems, taking into account mining, geological and technology conditions, to prioritize the exploration of geothermal resources in mines and to evaluate the parameters of mine water circulation with maintaining the safe mine water level.        Practical implications. The study showed the feasibility of installation and effective operation of open geothermal systems at the mines of the Donetsk basin for heat supply of buildings located in the adjacent areas with maintaining a safe mine water level.</jats:p>",

Owing to some of its properties, its use requires a dual-fuel supply system; thus, the use of natural gas as a fuel for diesel engines is currently limited. Systems that supply gas fuel to diesel engines do not usually interfere with the engine control system. This solution significantly reduces system-installation costs. However, as demonstrated in the present study, it considerably changes the course of the combustion process, which increases thermal and mechanical loads. In this case, the combustion process can be controlled by changing the liquid fuel injection pressure or advancing the injection angle.

There are currently substantial concerns regarding food production, manufacturing, delivery, and consumption in light of emerging issues within the food supply chain. Limitations on the mobility of workers, variations in consumer demands, the shutdown of food manufacturing industries, limited food trading regulations, and financial stress throughout the food supply chain are all results of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results showed that government supervision costs, evaluation of government by consumers and pig farmers, government subsidies to pig farmers and consumers, and the proportion of stakeholder behaviours affected the formation of tripartite relationships.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The urgent need for CO2 reduction is calling upon the industry to contribute. However, changes within local energy supply systems including efficiency enhancement are bound to several economical and technical constraints, which results in interfering trade-offs that make it difficult to find the optimal investment option for CO2 mitigation. In this article, a new optimization model is presented that allows to optimize the design and operation of a supply and heat recovery system and production scheduling simultaneously. The model was used for retrofitting of a small brewery’s local energy system to identify decarbonization measures for eight potential future scenarios with different technical, economical and ecological boundary conditions. The results show that the proposed cost-optimized changes to the current energy system only slightly reduce carbon emissions if decarbonization is not enforced since the optimal solutions prioritize integration of photo voltaic (PV) modules that mainly substitute electricity purchase from grid, which is already assumed to be carbon free. However, enforcing decarbonization rates of 50% for the assumed future boundary conditions still results in cost savings compared to the current energy system. These systems contain heat pumps, thermal energy storages, electric boilers, and PV. Battery storages are only part of the optimal system configuration if low to moderate decarbonization rates below 50% are enforced. An analysis of marginal costs for units not considered in the optimal solutions shows that solar thermal collectors only require small decreases in collector cost to be selected by the solver.</jats:p>"

Access to imported vaccines or ways to produce them locally became the principal source of hope for these countries. But developing a strategy for success in obtaining and allocating vaccines was not easy task. The governments in those countries have faced the difficult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing the price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against the concerns over their efficacy and safety. We aimed to analyze public opinion regarding the governmental strategies to obtain COVID-19 vaccines in three Central Asian countries, focusing particularly on possible ethical issues.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We searched for opinions expressed either in Russian or in the respective national languages.

To find the high level of specialization, suppliers of pharmaceutical logistics must be selected under a mathematical model that can treat vague and uncertain real-life circumstances. The notion of bipolarity is a key factor to address such uncertainties. A bipolar fuzzy soft set (BFSS) is a strong mathematical tool to cope with uncertainty and unreliability in various real-life problems including logistics and supply chain management. In this paper, we introduce new similarity measures (SMs) based on certain properties of bipolar fuzzy soft sets (BFSSs). The proposed SMs are the extensions of Frobenius inner product, cosine similarity measure, and weighted similarity measure for BFSSs. The proposed SMs are also illustrated with respective numerical examples. An innovative multi-attribute decision-making algorithm (MADM) and its flow chart are being developed for pharmaceutical logistics and supply chain management in COVID-19. Furthermore, the application of the suggested MADM method is presented for the selection of the best pharmaceutical logistic company and a comparative analysis of the suggested SMs with some of the existing SMs is also demonstrated.</jats:p>",

Respondents used in this study consisted of 30 rice farmers chosen through purposive sampling technique in Pamarican District, Ciamis Regency, West Java. The analytical method used is multiple linear regression or multiple linear regression model with Ordinary Least Square to analyze the influence of the distance of the farmer to the grain collection point, the length of time the farmer makes inventory, the experience of farming, the farmer's storage capacity, and the method of payment for grain or the transaction system on the delivery performance. The results of the analysis show the variables of distance, inventory, and transaction systems. The distance variable has a significant positive effect, the inventory variable has a significant negative effect, and the cash transaction system will improve the delivery performance of farmers to PT MDP. Farmers make cost efficiency for grain delivery by collecting grain first. A decrease in delivery performance occurs when farmers store the grain longer</jats:p>"

Here, we\ndetermined the effect of downregulation of SIRT3 on acetylation of\nmitochondrial complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) subunit A (SDHA) and\nexplored whether SIRT3 activating agents would rescue complex II\nactivity and improve mitochondrial bioenergetics in PD models.\nExperimental Approach: SD rats and differentiated MN9D cells were\ntreated with rotenone (ROT) to establish animal and cellular PD models.\nSIRT3 activators including icariin (ICA) and honokiol (HNK) were\nemployed to activate SIRT3 in the PD models. Protein acetylation was\ndetected using western blot and immunoprecipitation. Activities of SIRT3\nand mitochondrial Complex II, NAD/NADH ratio, mitochondrial respiration\nand ATP production were assessed in different models. Key Results: SIRT3\nactivity was suppressed in ROT-induced PD models. The downregulation of\nSIRT3 resulted in hyperacetylation of SDHA, leading to compromised\nactivity of mitochondrial complex II and a decline in ATP production.\nMechanistically, the suppression of SIRT3 activity was attributed to the\ndecrease of NAD+/NADH ratio caused by the inhibition of mitochondrial\ncomplex I induced by ROT.

Recent analyses show that the focus needs to be shifted from foodshed size portrayed as an isotropic circle to a commodity–group-specific spatial configuration of the foodshed that takes into account the socio-economic and biophysical conditions essential to the development of local food supply chains. We focused on a specific animal product (beef) and used an innovative modeling approach based on spatial analysis to detect the areas of the foodshed dedicated to beef feeding (forage, pasture, and grassland), considering the foodshed as a complex of complementary areas called an archipelago. We used available statistical data including a census to address the city-region of Avignon, France covering a 100 km radius. Our results showed that the factors driving the use of short supply chains for beef feeding areas are the foodshed archipelago’s number of patches, the connectivity between them, and the rugosity of the boundaries. In addition, our beef self-sufficiency assessment results differ depending on geographical context. For instance, being located within the perimeters of a nature park seems to help orient beef production toward short supply chains. We discuss possible leverage for public action to reconnect beef production areas to consumption areas (the city) via short supply chains (e.g., green, home-grown school food programs) to increase local food security through increased local food self-sufficiency.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the assessment of energy consumption in food systems, and in food loss and waste valorization systems, is an increasing trend in recent years. In this line, this work presents a systematic review, selecting 74 articles from a search of 16,930 papers regarding the key words “energy assessment food”. The aim was to determine the current and historical trends in this field of research. Results pointed to a worldwide acceleration in trends since 2014, standing out in China and other Asian countries. Concerning the topics of the publications, energy consumption in the food sector is a research field which has existed since 1979. Moreover, the study of energy valorization systems using food loss and waste is an increasing trend since 2010. Additionally, publications focused on the water–energy–food nexus appeared firstly in 2014 and have grown exponentially. Moreover, life cycle assessment highlights as the most widespread methodology used.</jats:p>"

Based on a detailed study of the soybean market chain in Brazil, this paper illustrates that the current neoliberal economic approach has resulted in a business which is dependent on foreign multinationals. While foreign companies hold 60% of the soybean market share, Brazilian groups hold only 40% of the entire business, with the domestic market share concentrated in land (13.3%) and labor (14.3%). But the expansion of foreign investments in agribusiness in the country offers opportunities occupied by Brazilian companies, characterizing a situation of associated dependent development. Currently, 12.4% of the share held by Brazilian companies belongs to capital and technology intensive segments such as seed production (2.4%), fertilizers (4.8%), agrochemicals (0.6%), machinery (0.3%), and agro-industry trade (4.3%). The increase in the participation of Brazilian groups in agribusiness requires agricultural policies that can be inspired by a new development paradigm. Opportunities created by foreign investments can be used by domestic groups to increase their share in agro-industrial sectors. Lessons from the Brazilian case can help other developing countries to explore areas of opportunities for domestic investments in dynamic economic sectors such as agribusiness.</jats:p>"

US law now requires stakeholders in the agri-food supply chain to support traceability by tracking food materials they acquire and sell. However, having the complete and consistent information needed to quickly investigate sources and identify affected material has proven difficult. There are multiple reasons that food traceability is a challenging task, including diversity of stakeholders and their lexicons, standards, tools, and methods; unwillingness to expose information about internal operations; lack of a common understanding of the steps in a supply chain; and incompleteness of data. The objective of this work is to address the traceability challenge by developing a formal ontology that can provide a shared and common understanding of the traceability model across all stakeholders in bulk food supply chains. A formal ontology can support semantic mediation, data integration, and data exploration, thus improving the intelligence and reliability of trace and track process. The Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF) procedures and principles are employed in the development of the supply chain traceability ontology. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is selected as the top-level ontology. A bottom-up approach is also adopted in a sense that a real use case related to the bulk grain domain is selected to be used for requirements definition and ontology validation. A software tool for visualization of the traceability graph is developed to validate the developed ontology based on simulated data. The test and validation results indicate that the developed ontology has the expressivity needed to represent the semantics of traceability data models within the scope of the selected use case. Also, it was observed that the developed supply chain traceability tool can effectively facilitate the track and trace process through visualizing the Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, thus eliminating the need to formulate complex SPARQL queries for information retrievals.</jats:p>",

This study aimed to investigate the use of a combined simple designed solar geyser/photocell for drinking water disinfection.\r\nMaterials and Methods: In this study, a solar geyser with a simple design was combined with a solar cell and its efficiency on the disinfection of contaminated water was investigated. This study was carried out with artificially polluted tap water by a solar geyser joined with a solar photovoltaic cell. The heated water (55°C) was kept for 2 hours using a solenoid valve. The pilot plant was operated and monitored for one year. The volume of the collected effluent was measured every 24 h. The most probably number (MPN) of total coliforms and fecal coliforms in 100 mL of 24-hour composed samples were measured.\r\nResults: The mean volume of disinfected water production was calculated as 2095.74 ± 270.28 mL/day. The strongest correlation was found between disinfected water and the maximum daily ambient air temperature with a linear model (R2 = 0.9937). The results showed that by increasing the sunny time, the volume of water outlet increased. Therefore, sunny time and UV radiation have direct effect on volume of disinfected water.\r\nConclusion: The simple designed solar geyser for drinking water disinfection was efficient and recommended for tropical areas, emergency conditions, and farms for agricultural activities.</jats:p>"

Partial least squares (PLS) was the main method used to test and verify the research model and hypotheses. According to the test results, blockchain and smart contracts positively influence partners’ trust. Increasing trust produces a positive effect on increasing visibility, further promoting competitiveness and environmental performance. However, the vulnerability of smart contracts still causes information security concerns. If smart contracts are adopted for an extended time, partners will worry about problems of information vulnerability stemming from the smart contract, further reducing trust and affecting visibility. Regarding academic implications, this study not only proves the relationship between blockchain, smart contracts, partners’ trust, increasing visibility, competitiveness, and environmental performance. In addition, we also proved the vulnerability of smart contracts; our test results fill these gaps.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the nature of access and characteristics of water sources and their impact on the choice and usage of water by providing empirical and statistical evidence. A survey of 1,300 households was conducted across six major cities in Southwest Nigeria, using structured questionnaires, field surveys, personal interviews, and observations. The data obtained were analysed using SPSS 27 for descriptive statistics and characterised using enhancement-based strategies. The result showed that 5% of respondents had access to pipe water, 66% used private wells and boreholes, and 29% used off-site water sources. The study discovered that 15 different water sources with unique attributes were consumed. The daily consumption ranged between 301 and 361 and 1,153 and 1,421 litres per household (L/hh/d) for those using off-site and on-site water sources, respectively. This study provides new insights with empirical evidence. As such, there is a need to re-evaluate the present water supply policy implementation, funding approach, and level of coverage. Additional policies that support and fund decentralised water projects, without compromising on water quality, should be provided, since they are more accessible to the people.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study is motivated by the challenges faced by clinics in sub‐Saharan Africa in allocating scarce and unreliable supply of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) among a large pool of eligible patients. Existing discussion of ARV allocation is focused on qualitative rules for prioritizing certain socioeconomic and demographic patient segments over others at the national level. However, such prioritization rules are of limited utility in providing quantitative guidance on scaling up of treatment programs at individual clinics. In this study, we take the perspective of a clinic administrator whose objective is to maximize the quality‐adjusted survival of the entire patient population in its service area by allocating scarce and unreliable supply of drugs among two activities: initiating treatment for untreated patients and continuing treatment for previously treated patients. The key trade‐off underlying this allocation decision is between the marginal health benefit obtained by initiating an untreated patient on treatment and that obtained by avoiding treatment interruption of a treated patient. This trade‐off has not been explicitly studied in the clinical literature, which focuses either on the incremental value obtained from initiating treatment (over no treatment) or on the value of providing continuous treatment (over interrupted treatment) but not on the difference of the two. We cast the clinic's problem as a stochastic dynamic program and provide a partial characterization of the optimal policy, which consists of dynamic prioritization of patient segments and is characterized by state‐dependent thresholds. We use this structure of the optimal policy to design a simpler Two‐Period heuristic and show that it substantially outperforms the Safety‐Stock heuristic, which is commonly used in practice. In our numerical experiments based on realistic parameter values, the performance of the Two‐Period heuristic is within 4% of the optimal policy whereas that of the Safety‐Stock heuristic can be as much as 20% lower than that of the optimal policy. Our model can serve as a basis for developing a decision support tool for clinics to design their ARV treatment program scale‐up plans. </jats:p>",

This work is concerned with the planning of a real agri-food supply chain for milk product for the city of Tlemcen in Algeria. Specifically, the challenge is to redefine the existing supply chain and optimize distribution planning. The management of perishable products is a relevant issue in the ASC management domain, since the sellers cannot wait for the best favorable market conditions unless the quality and safety of their products deteriorate. These products must therefore be rapidly shipped from the sellers to the customers. In addition, consumer’s demand for healthcare products continues to grow and government regulations are tightening. In addition to these factors, the variation for these time-limited products and their prices makes it difficult to plan purchases in supply networks.</jats:p>",

Through reviewing the research literature, related criteria were identified and selected based on experts' opinions and the fuzzy Delphi method. The fuzzy CRITIC method was used to determine the weights of the criteria. Finally, based on weighted indices and the fuzzy COPRAS method, food packaging suppliers were ranked according to their ability to manage the risks of sustainable supply chain activities. The results show that operational risks are essential in evaluating suppliers' risks in sustainable supply chain activities in the food packaging industry.

The real fairness preference coefficient of the online retailer estimated by the manufacturer is negatively correlated with the manufacturer’s wholesale price and carbon emission reduction. The revenue sharing proportion of the manufacturer presents a positive correlation with its wholesale price but shows no correlation with the retail price, the green degree, or the supply chain profit.

When analyzing data compliance, it is necessary to identify and take into account the influence of a number of health-saving predictors. The aim of the study is to conduct a multifactorial analysis of health-saving predictors for patients with chronic diseases and to develop methodological foundations for the organization of their medical and pharmaceutical support. Materials and methods. The study of health-saving predictors for patients with chronic diseases was conducted on the basis of the results of an assessment of the behavior and lifestyle of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The empirical database is formed by the results of a survey of 411 patients. Methods of statistical analysis using software products Statistica 10, Microsoft Excel were used. Methods of mathematical statistics were used (Student's two-sample test to assess significant intergroup differences; analysis of average ranks and analysis of variance). Results and discussion. By means of multivariate analysis of health-saving predictors for patients with diabetes mellitus, the most significant parameters of health-saving of patients with chronic diseases have been identified. The systematization of predictors on the basis of \"controllability\" was carried out. Unmanageable predictors of a patient's health include gender, age, level of education and income; conditionally controlled predictors include the functional state of the body, the presence of comorbidity and/or polymorbidity, the severity of polypragmasia, the duration of the disease; controlled predictors include the level of sanitary literacy and patient compliance, the presence of self-control skills of the disease, the level of social adaptation and the lifestyle. Conclusion. A logical and functional model of strategic management of medical and pharmaceutical care for patients with chronic diseases has been developed and a generalizing cumulative indicator (patient's health saving coefficient) has been formed on the basis of controlled predictors of health saving, which allows to evaluate the health saving potential of a particular patient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Droughts have directly affected at least 1.5 billion people in the last century, generating economic losses up to $124 billion. They are a recurrent, creeping meteorological hazard that may endanger the water and food security of large regions. The frequency and severity of droughts are expected to increase with climate change, especially in Africa, Central America, and also in Europe where annual losses may multiply by 7 and represent up to 2 times the size of the European economy in the medium-long term.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drought Early Warning Systems (DEWS) are key pillars of a risk-based, proactive management strategy. The increasing number of sources of EO data has remarkedly improved the monitoring capabilities of DEWS. Despite there are good examples of global and regional drought monitoring systems, these tools still lack of seasonal forecasting capabilities able to provide enough accurate and specific predictions of drought impacts at the subregion level (e.g. basin, district). These deficiencies constitute a challenge for the scientific community and provide an opportunity to improve the current services.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To address this gap in the DEWS landscape, the InfoSequia DEWS is developed to integrate the strengths of spatial, satellite-derived data with machine learning techniques for seasonal forecasting. InfoSequia consists of two modules:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;InfoSequia-MONITOR provides more than 50 drought predictors including meteorological (SPI, SPEI), vegetative (VCI / TCI / VHI), and hydrological (water level in reservoirs, groundwater storage status) drought indices, as well as atmospheric oscillation indices, all of them retrieved from satellite (e.g. MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, GRACE), hybrid (eg CHIRPS), or reanalysis and modeling (ERA5-Land) products. All indices are obtained from dekad values &amp;amp;#8203;&amp;amp;#8203; which are timescale aggregated at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The spatial resolution of the indices ranges from 5km (SPI, SPIE) to 250m (VH indices).&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Acknowledging the limitations of physically-based modelling on the seasonal time scale, the InfoSequia-4CAST module rests on the Fast and Frugal Tree (FFT) algorithm, a machine learning technique in which binary decision trees are trained and generated at the subregional level with the historical and spatially-aggregated predictors of drought. Final outputs are delivered in the form of monthly warnings of risk of failure up to 6 month lead times.&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All InfoSequia algorithms run on a cloud platform, with cloud geoprocessing functionalities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With support of the European Space Agency (ESA), InfoSequia is being developed and piloted to provide operational seasonal forecasts of: a) crop yield failures at the district level in Mozambique, and b) water supply failures in the Segura river basin in SE Spain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Seasonal outlooks of drought impact support improvement of the water and food security of a region by allowing the early exploitation of groundwater reserves or unconventional water resources (desalination, reuse), the optimal water allocation of limited resources among users, or the implementation of ex-ante cash transfers or food vouchers. This research introduces the general workflow which underpins InfoSequia, how limitations due to technical barriers and data gaps are addressed, and the key performance indicators generated for both pilot cases.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</jats:p>"

The article solves the problem of considering the assembly equipment of an organizational and technological system for providing mechanical assembly based on threaded connections of an automated control system for the technological assembly process at an automotive cluster enterprise. Models, classifiers and an algorithm for optimal control of this set are being developed. Research methods of control theory; of the set-theoretical approach; decision-making methods; methods of mathematical analysis are used in the article. The novelty of the work is to develop the classifiers of assembly equipment of the organizational and technological system for ensuring mechanical assembly based on threaded connections depending on the design and degree of the facility automation and the possibility of its calibration. The main distinguishing characteristic of the proposed algorithm is to use the reduced cost of the assembly operation, which makes it possible to form an optimal set of the assembly equipment. As a result of the research a set-theoretic model of an element and a set of assembly equipment are proposed. The classifiers of the elements that make up the assembly equipment are developed. An algorithm for forming an optimal set of assembly equipment at an utomotivecluster enterprise is introduced. The developed algorithm is used in forming the assembly equipment at an automotive cluster enterprises and at the enterprises with a similar organizational and technological system for providing mechanical assembly. The findings of the research state that the proposed set-theoretic model of an assembly facility element allows accumulating and saving information about the elements of assembly equipment which is necessary for the effective management of assembly production at an automotive cluster enterprise. The developed classifiers are applied to decompose the set of equipment used in the assembly based on threaded connections and are necessary for solving the problems of automated control of the organizational and technological system for providing mechanical assembly based on threaded connections of the automated control system for the assembly process at the automotive cluster enterprise.</jats:p>",

In the decision-making process of CLSC, locational, inventory control and transportation issues are addressed to deal with strategic, tactical and operational decisions. This paper utilizes a novel bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to formulate a multi-period multi-product CLSC design problem considering aggregate cost minimization and service level maximization at the same time. To tackle the bi-objectiveness of the model, goal attainment method (GAM) is applied which is then executed by Gurobi Python API to test the applicability of the suggested model for three different scales (small, medium and large). It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology can find the optimal solutions for different problems in a maximum of 500 seconds. Finally, a set of sensitivity analyses is carried out on the main parameters in order to test the behaviors of the objective functions and suggest managerial insights as well as decision aids. The results reveal that the model is highly dependent on the demand parameter, that is, an increase in demand is closely related to an increase in the aggregate cost and a simultaneous downward trend in the service level.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes an integrated control strategy for substations based on the prediction of the water-supply temperature and indoor temperature. Firstly, online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is used to predict the water-supply temperature. Then, a linear prediction model is established to predict the indoor temperature. Finally, the integrated regulation strategy is established with the goal of minimizing operational costs, aiming at ensuring heating quality and meeting the limits of the flow rate and of the supply- and return-water temperatures. The heat-saving rate, power-saving rate and indoor-temperature satisfactory rate are introduced to evaluate the regulation effect of the proposed method. The field study results show that the performance index of operation executed with the regulation strategy proposed in this paper is 9.31%, 16.33% and 20.87% higher than that without our energy-saving regulation strategy respectively. The fluctuations in the water-supply pressure and differential pressure of the secondary network are significantly reduced, and the energy-saving effect is obvious.</jats:p>"

This lockdown stopped the provision of school meals to public school students, most of whom belonged to low-income families facing food insecurity. To guarantee the students’ food security during this period, food items previously provided through school meals were converted into food kits and delivered to the students’ families. Methods: This case study analyzes the logistical impacts of this change in the school food supply chain concerning the legislation, procurement, assembly, and distribution of food kits in the city of Vitória, Brazil. We interviewed suppliers and workers of the Municipal Secretariat of Education and distributed a survey to professionals and beneficiaries. Results: One of the findings was that federal procurement regulations for the acquisition of food for public schools led to difficult choices for school officials during this period. These regulations determined that at least 30% of the budget must be used in local purchases from smallholder family farmers. However, almost all products generated by family farming in the region of Vitória are perishable and require distribution and consumption on the same day, which represents a challenge for the logistic process of assembling and distributing food kits. The solution was the selection of eggs as the primary protein item in the kits. Conclusions: The lessons learned through this study suggest potential actions that would make this supply chain more resilient in future emergencies.</jats:p>"

A trade model with ten regions and five dairy product categories is developed and used to examine the potential benefits of opening international markets to Canadian dairy products. In addition to a baseline, three scenarios are compared—one with SM in place but with Canada able to export freely. Two other scenarios assume SM is eliminated and there is complete free trade, but with high‐ and low‐cost structures. Findings indicate that, in the high‐cost scenario, domestic consumers gain from lower prices as the domestic supply and exports fall compared to the status quo, but producers are less well off. However, under a low domestic cost structure, Canada becomes a major exporter of milk, with both producers and consumers gaining from free trade. This scenario assumes that domestic producers take advantage of economies of scale, enabling them to compete in international markets. Appropriate policies will be required to reform the quota regime, while minimizing the harm done to dairy farmers.</jats:p>",

We used biomass-weighted diversity measures based on trophic traits (those related to feeding behaviours, e.g., mobility, size, food source), stable isotope ratios (δ<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>N and δ<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C), and taxonomy to assess linkages between benthic food web structure and indicators of food supply in the shelf and slope ecosystems of the Canadian Beaufort Sea and Amundsen Gulf (down to 500 m). Benthic communities across both regions used a similar diversity of sedimentary organic matter sources according to stable isotopes, despite known differences between regions in organic matter input and benthic–pelagic coupling. Shelf-edge and upper-slope communities exhibited relatively high trophic trait diversity, which likely reflected the exploitation of pulsed food inputs associated with dynamic processes at the shelf break that affect the production and advection of organic matter to the benthos. Pairwise relationships between trophic traits and sedimentary proxies of benthic food supply were not significant at the regional scale. However, cluster analyses supported the notion that trophic trait composition was influenced by proximity to the shelf edge, where food supply is influenced by episodic events that may not be reflected by in situ sedimentary proxies. Our findings add to growing evidence that evaluating trophic traits composition may provide more information regarding functional responses to changes in benthic food supply than either isotopic or taxonomic diversity indices alone. </jats:p>"

Then, cost models for both the traditional supply chain and the novel supply chain using blockchain technology are developed and the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain operating costs is determined. The results demonstrate that blockchain technology can effectively reduce supply chain operating costs. In addition, this study has an interesting finding that if blockchain adoption is valuable for the supply chain, the quantity of information-sensitive should be moderate. Too many or too few information-sensitive retailers can reduce the value of the blockchain's use.

This study explores a CLSC system wherein original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) license the third-party remanufacturer (TPR) to bear the remanufacturing activities and investigate pricing decisions in the CLSC, while considering collection and remanufacturing cost disruptions. To obtain the optimal pricing strategy, we develop game theory models under the disruptions of both centralized and decentralized CLSCs. Based on theoretical and numerical analyses, we obtain the following results: (1) Whether or not disruption events occur, the centralized supply chain can better encourage consumers to participate in the collection of used products than a decentralized supply chain; (2) when collection disruption in a large positive region or the remanufacturing cost disruption in a large negative region occurs, OEM and TPR profits will greatly increase, and the OEM will raise the licensing fee to extract more profit from the remanufacturing activity; (3) a certain robust region exists for the retail price and wholesale price when the supply chain faces disruption increase; (4) when the supply chain faces the disruptions, it has great influence on the OEM’s licensing fee but little on the TPR’s acquisition price. The main contributions of the study include: (1) We considered the impacts of both technology licensing and collection and remanufacturing cost disruption; (2) we developed game theory models to determine the optimal manufacturing and remanufacturing quantities, and pricing strategy under the disruptions; (3) based on theoretical and numerical analyses, we presented some interesting and important insights.

It has a valuable direct influence on increasing product demand. The supply chain model is developed for manufacturer and retailer, where advertisements are dependent on demand. The advertisement rate has been considered a function that has enhanced at a diminishing rate concerning time, although the growth rate slowed. During the manufacturing cycle, the market’s demand is a function of advertisement, and the customer’s demand is a linear function of time. The production rate exceeds the demand rate during manufacturing and remanufacturing; shortages are not faced. It involves a manufacturing/remanufacturing process that quickly delivers consumer products and less waste. To keep the environment clean, the cost of carbon emissions is incorporated into the manufacturer’s and supplier’s holding and degrading costs. The model’s primary purpose is to minimize the overall cost of manufacturing and remanufacturing. The overall cost during the manufacturing cycle is higher than that during the remanufacturing cycle. This study confirms that the increasing cost of advertising provides the continuous increasing value of the total cost. A numerical example is provided, graphical representation and sensitivity analysis determine the function’s behavior and test the model.</jats:p>",

This paper suggests that, despite the operational challenges of blockchains and the necessity to focus on core business activities, BaaS is promising, with significant efforts in terms of cost-savings, efficiency, and reliability with reduced risks. This study provides insight on BaaS contributions to fostering entrepreneurial finance as well as contributing to the literature on the accomplishments of BaaS within BcSCF provisions for particularly Ghanaian SMEs. Therefore, detailed studies into the viability of technologically-enabled types of SME finance are essential, necessitating more research. Resultantly, some forward-thinking research issues for researchers in the disciplines of innovation, technology, entrepreneurship, finance, and decision science have been presented.</jats:p>",

Through this program, retailers who are interested in the distribution of first quality vegetables provide funds to farmers to increase their production this type of vegetables through the acquisition of new machinery, technology, or training.Design/methodology/approach: The problem is solved through a multi-objective mathematical programming model that simultaneously optimizes the supply chain profits, the waste of vegetables, the economic unfairness among farmers, the unfairness in the distribution of funds, and the freshness of sold vegetables. The ?-constraint method is used to obtain several non-dominated solutions to the problem after linearizing the non-lineal equations related to the unfairness objectives.Findings: Results show that it is possible to improve the indicators related to the vegetable waste, the economic unfairness, the unfairness in the distribution of funds and the freshness of vegetables while maintaining similar to optimal profits for the supply chain. Interesting trade-offs between the five objectives are identified, which can be used by supply chain members to select the most appropriate solution to be implemented in the real supply chain.Originality/value: This research models aspects relevant to the agri-food sector that have not been previously modelled for the problem under study. The main novelties of this paper are the consideration of the limited shelf life of the vegetables as well as the requirement of ensuring a minimum freshness at the moment of their sale, the price dependence on the quality and freshness of vegetables, the optimization of vegetable waste and the freshness of vegetables sold, as well as the joint optimization of the five previously defined objectives.</jats:p>"

The system mathematical model is analyzed by the average small-signal method. The proposed power balance control technique is used in the instance where the main sources supply the load of the system. The energy balance control technique is used in the case that the load at the 24 V and 12 V bus is backed up with a battery. The DC Distributed system is simulated by MATLAB/Simulink. The system has 1 kW power rating and contains 6 voltage bus with voltage ratings of 380, 100, 60, 48, 24, and 12 V. The simulation results show that, with the proposed power balance design and control technique, the system provides good dynamic responses and stability. In addition, the proposed technique simplifies the parameter design of the PI controller and solves the basic control limitations of the DC to DC converter.</jats:p>"

However, the flow through the entrance of the stepped spillway might separate from the first step top and impact the downstream steps at a large unit discharge, causing a so-called jet flow. A new experimental study was conducted to better understand the jet flow in the hydraulic-jump-stepped spillway with comparisons with conventional stepped spillways. The results showed that the critical condition required for the formation of the jet flow was close to the geometric parameters of the upstream aeration basin. Among these parameters, the height of the reverse step had a more significant effect on the local flow pattern, thus lowering the risk of jet flow. The relationships between the critical condition and the geometry of the aeration basin suggested that the Froude number at the entrance of the stepped spillway was the key parameter forming the jet flow. Compared with conventional stepped spillways, the hydraulic-jump-stepped spillway could effectively extend the practical application for large unit discharges by providing a better understanding of jet flow conditions.</jats:p>",

During the last decade, the stakeholder base expected to respond to these sustainability concerns has broadened from directly involved parties to a range of indirect stakeholders along the downstream mineral value chain. These stakeholders variably engage in reporting, supplier risk assessments, exercising supply chain due diligence, third party assurance, and corporate social responsibility measures. This trend reflects a combination of societal, investor, and regulatory pressure as well as industry self-regulation along the supply chain. The present article examines this development from the complementary perspectives of international regulations and voluntary industry and multi-stakeholder initiatives affecting the industrial and the artisanal mining sector as well as the associated mineral supply chains. To this end, we provide an introductory analysis on the global uptake, implementation challenges, and lessons learnt with regard to both regulatory developments and voluntary initiatives. Key challenges identified include a misalignment between local reforms and international efforts, heterogeneous downstream market requirements, and evasive strategies as well as gaps to report on and achieve positive local sustainability impacts, partly brought about by emphasising corporate risk management over local community priorities. Meaningful stakeholder dialogue and increased local ownership are key factors to overcome some of these challenges.</jats:p>",

However, Fe2+/PMS process suffers from difficulty on Fe2+ regeneration. Herein, we report an Fe3+/PMS process by using gallic acid (GA) as an effective promotor for efficient degradation of bisphenol A (BPA). The process exhibited considerable oxidation performance in the pH range of 3.0–10.0. Higher concentration of Fe3+/GA complex exhibited better BPA degradation performance whereby BPA could be completely degraded within 4 mins. Reactive oxidation species (ROS) quenching experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis, and methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) probing experiments revealed that sulfate radical (SO4•−), hydroxyl radical (HO•), and ferryl species are involved and responsible for the BPA degradation. Electrochemical analysis and density function theory (DFT) calculation explored that the self-oxidation of GA boosted the reduction of Fe3+ into Fe2+ for continuous activation of PMS. The GA boosted Fe3+/PMS system reached an intriguing mineralization efficiency of 86.4%. Findings from this work proposed references to improve the oxidation performance of Fenton-like reaction and provided new sight into the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling.</jats:p>",

This paper presents the water saving potential and economic effectiveness of rainwater harvesting systems across eight major cities in China, using a daily water balance model. Results show six to 81 days (or 1.6% to 22.2%) of dependability can be achieved by using a rainwater harvesting system over these cities. The annual water saving efficiency ranges from 10% to 37% and the benefit–cost ratio varies between 0.45 and 1.20 across the studied cities. South China achieves the maximum annual water saving and the highest benefit–cost ratio, while southeast China has the most regular profile of precipitation use. Northwest China was found to be the region with the worst performance, both in yearly water saving and in regularity of rainwater use on a yearly scale. It was also found that the RWH system is not financially feasible in the northeast, southwest and central plains due to the benefit–cost ratios being smaller than 1.0.</jats:p>",

Among the strategies known to govern gene expression locally, mRNA transport and translation have emerged as essential for a neuron’s ability to navigate developmental cues, and to establish, strengthen and remove synaptic connections throughout lifespan. Substantiating the role of RNA processing in the nervous system, several RNA binding proteins have been implicated in both developmental and age dependent neurodegenerative disorders. Of these, TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein that has emerged as a common denominator in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related disorders due to the identification of causative mutations altering its function and its accumulation in cytoplasmic aggregates observed in a significant fraction of ALS/FTD cases, regardless of etiology. TDP-43 is involved in multiple aspects of RNA processing including splicing, transport and translation. Given that one of the early events in disease pathogenesis is mislocalization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, several studies have focused on elucidating the pathogenic role of TDP-43 in cytoplasmic translation. Here we review recent findings describing TDP-43 translational targets and potential mechanisms of translation dysregulation in TDP-43 proteinopathies across multiple experimental models including cultured cells, flies, mice and patient derived neurons.</jats:p>"

Due to the high water cut in the middle and late phases of development, the oilfield’s energy consumption will be quite high, and the rise in energy consumption will lead to an increase in carbon emission at the same time. As a result, the traditional energy model is incapable of meeting the energy consumption requirement of high water cut oilfields in their middle and later phases of development. The present wind hydrogen coupling energy system was researched and coupled with the classic dispersed oilfield energy system to produce energy for the oilfields in this study. This study compares four future energy system models to existing ones, computes the energy cost and net present value of an oilfield in Northwest China, and proposes a set of economic evaluation tools for oilfield energy systems. The study’s findings indicate that scenario four provides the most economic and environmental benefits. This scenario effectively addresses the issue of high energy consumption associated with aging oilfields at this point, significantly reduces carbon emissions, absorbs renewable energy locally, and reduces the burden on the power grid system. Finally, sensitivity analysis is utilized to determine the effect of wind speed, electricity cost, and oilfield gas output on the system’s economic performance. The results indicate that the system developed in this study can be applied to other oilfields.</jats:p>"

Although channel bank erosion is a key geomorphological process supplying alluvial channels with coarse sediments and diversifying aquatic and riparian habitats, banks have often been stabilized to limit erosion risk to human activities and facilities. The objective of this paper is to assess the effects, and their sustainability, of bank protection removal on a 300‐m long reach of the Old Rhine (France/Germany) to promote sediment supply, channel diversification and a rehabilitation of fluvial morpho‐sedimentary processes. This action was combined with the construction of two island groynes to locally increase bank erosion processes. Yearly detailed monitoring was implemented over 6 years, including classical bathymetric surveys, airborne topo‐bathymetric and terrestrial LiDAR, and bed grain‐size and bedload tracking. Following a Q<jats:sub>15</jats:sub> flood, the restoration induced a weak sediment supply. The restoration diversified habitats due to the implementation of the two island groynes, inducing bank scouring and the creation of new macroforms, as well as local bed grain‐size diversification and fining. The cross‐sectional diversity of the restored water channel was close to the regularization engineering phase. Channel bedform diversification persisted 6 years due to the persistence of the two island groynes. The action induced the rehabilitation of fluvial forms, in a static manner, rather than the rehabilitation of fluvial morpho‐sedimentary processes, which raises questions about the sustainability of the benefits of such management actions in terms of fluvial functionality and naturality.</jats:p>",

ICC1 is 220 m thick and exposed over 5 km parallel to bedding and consists of four vertically stacked channel complexes—lower channel complex (LC), and three upper channel complexes (termed UC1–UC3). Based on differences in lithological and textural makeup, and stratal trends, two styles of channel fill and stacking pattern are recognized—disorganized stack of bottom-up channel fills (LC, UC1, and UC2), and organized lateral-offset stack of laterally accreting channel fills (UC3). Bottom-up channel fills show an upward and axis-to-margin fining and thinning, and were filled by poorly sorted, density-stratified flows. In contrast, channel fills of UC3 exhibit negligible upward and lateral fining and thinning and were filled by flows enriched in coarse and very coarse sand and were only negligibly stratified in their lower part. Accordingly, the lower, depositionally important part of the flow had a plug-like density profile with limited overspill that caused circulation patterns in channel bends to resemble those in rivers. Notably, the grain-size makeup of late-stage channel fills of UC3 indicates a change in the makeup of the sediment supply, namely grain size and sorting. Note that this systematic upward change in sediment texture and channel type is observed in most (5 of 8) Isaac slope channel-complex sets at the Castle Creek study area. These changes reflect a change from hinterland- to shelf-dominated sediment supply interpreted to be associated with a long-term rise of relative sea level that progressively expanded continental-shelf accommodation and retention of coarse relict and palimpsest sediment. During short-term relative sea-level falls this increasingly voluminous source of coarse, moderately well-sorted siliciclastic and minor carbonate sediment eventually came to dominate the supply of coarse sediment to the shelf edge, and in turn, controlled the character of turbidity currents that remobilized sediment farther down the continental slope and possibly onto the basin floor.</jats:p>",

However, it has remained a largely untapped opportunity for enhancing productivity due to some behavioral matters such as fairness concerns of remanufacturing related firms. Concerning the emerging and development of remanufacturing industry, this paper provides a game-theoretic analysis for a remanufacturing supply chain (RSC) consisting of one leading manufacturer and a following retailer, with the inclusion of fairness concern. We propose and compare several scenarios of channel members’ fairness preferences as, both members are fairness concerned, only one member is fairness concerned, and both members are fair neutral, to expound how fairness concern affects RSC strategies and resulting utilities. We also demonstrate dynamic evolution and stable state of channel members’ selections of whether being fairness concerned in the long term. Analytical results show that favorable scenarios for the RSC to achieve desired objective are relevant to its preference for improved supply chain performance or enhanced environmental benefit. Whatever the preference is, however, it is detrimental for both members to be fairness concerned in the short term. In the long term, evolutionary stable strategies of fairness concerns indicate that both members or only one member would choose to be fairness concerned. The eventual status relies on the initial state of fairness preference. The results are especially relevant as a reference for remanufacturing related strategies, thus enhancing production sustainability as well as environmental benefits.</jats:p>"

In our paper, cork from <jats:italic>Quercus suber</jats:italic> L. over three consecutive harvests from a traditional rainfed plot, between 1999 and 2017, and cork from an irrigated plot, harvested in 2017, were studied. We applied two X–ray image analysis technologies – X–ray micro-computed tomography and X–ray microdensitometry. Cork development, related with intern porosity, growth and density was studied with the objective of understanding the cork characteristics evolution over the years and with a different water regime. The outcomes of this study suggested an increase in density and porosity over harvests and a slight decrease of the cork growth. Cork samples from the irrigated plot, compared with cork from the same year of extraction in the rainfed plot, showed higher growth rate and higher porosity. The results demonstrated the contribution of climatic factor of precipitation as well as the silviculture model in cork characteristics, showing the relevance of the present work for the definition of the management practices. These may be determinant for enhancing cork quality and quantity production through silviculture measures. Our findings can be particularly useful for stakeholders especially under the conditions of Portugal in terms of increasing the value of the industrial chain of cork.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aimed to verify the diversity of free-living protozoa in two water sources used as a public supply for human consumption in the municipality of Blumenau, SC, for 12 months. Water samples were collected monthly for analysis of environmental variables and for identification of organisms. In total, 39 taxa were recorded in P1 and P2, both in the readings performed on the day of collection and in the cultivation. In P1, 11 taxa were identified in the readings of the day of collection, and after reading the cultivation, 20 new taxa were recorded.  P2 presented 12 taxa in the readings performed on the day of collection and 10 new taxa in the cultivations' readings. Ciliates were the most expressive group in the period, with 69.5% frequency in P1 and 66.1% in P2. The results of the environmental variables in conjunction with the survey of the free-living protozoa of P1 and P2 did not show marked differences between the points.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a vendor-managed inventory (VMI) system, a manufacturing vendor manages their retailer inventories. Studies on VMI-type supply chains mostly have not considered competition between retailers. There are few works on the price competition; however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, none of the papers formulated a service competition strategy. The service level is one of the competitive factors among competing retailers. Sometimes retailers choose to compete cooperatively instead of competing independently with the manufacturer. The present work investigates service, price, and inventory decisions under retailers’ competition and cooperation. Considering the manufacturer and retailers as the leader and followers, respectively, a Stackelberg game model of the problem is developed. The present study proposes a solution algorithm to search the Stackelberg–Nash equilibrium in the retailer cooperation and retailer independence models. The algorithm is numerically demonstrated to explore the impacts of decision parameters. To validate the model, a number of parameters are subjected to sensitivity analyses. It was found that a higher self-service (cross-service) level parameter would lead to higher (lower) profits of the retailer and manufacturer and the total profit in the two models. Retailer cooperation enhances retailer performance; however, manufacturer and system profits decline. Furthermore, when retailers cooperate, they are motivated to offer lower service levels.</jats:p>",

On the other hand, the complementary product market has become an important source of competitive advantage for enterprises. Considering a complementary product supply chain, and taking account of the consumers’ environmental awareness and the green subsidies provided by the government, this paper examines members’ decisions in relation to four contract models based on game theory. By solving the model, it is shown that the government’s green subsidy plan improves the green degree of subsidized products and complementary products. Furthermore, compared to wholesale price contracts, revenue-sharing and cost-sharing contracts motivate manufacturers to improve the greenness of subsidized products, and they achieve a Pareto improvement for the whole supply chain and its members, when the contract parameters are appropriate. Numerical experiments also reveal that both the greenness of the complementary products and the profit for members increase with the green innovation spillover effect as a result of the complementary products and the scale of green consumers with environmental awareness in the market. This study provides good guidance for decision-making concerning the complementary product supply chain, and further contributes to environmental protection.</jats:p>"

In addition, the Mackenzie River, the largest North American Arctic river, discharges great amounts of freshwater, dissolved solids and suspended sediments to the Beaufort Sea. Current changes in these fluxes in response to the warming climate have uncertain consequences for the carbon budget on the shelf and in the deep ocean. To investigate the movement and transformation of organic matter along the land-ocean continuum, we collected water and surface sediment samples along five major transects across the Beaufort Sea during the 2021 expedition of the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Amundsen. Sampling locations span from shallow, coastal, sites with water depths &amp;amp;#8804; 20 m, to shelf-break and deep-water settings on the continental slope (water depths of &amp;amp;#8805;1000 m).

ASF is one of the most significant and critical diseases for the global domestic pig population. Hence, the authors evaluated control strategies and identified bottlenecks during an ASF outbreak. A hybrid approach was selected, including discrete-event and agent-based simulation. An extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model (within a pig farm) and a standard SEIR model (between pig farms) were used to simulate the chain of infection. A total of 576 scenarios with several parameter variations were calculated to identify the influence of external factors on key performance indicators. The main results show a comparison between two control strategies anchored in law: a standard strategy (SS) and a preventive culling strategy (SC). The calculated scenarios show a difference between these strategies and indicate that with SC during an outbreak, fewer farms would be infected, and fewer pigs would be culled. Furthermore, specific geographical areas were identified, which—due to their density of pigs and farms—would be severely affected in case of an ASF outbreak. The analysis of bottlenecks in rendering plants (RPs) showed an increase in the number of days RPs were overutilized as the transmission rate increased. In addition, SS caused more days of overutilized RPs than SC.</jats:p>"

For customer-centric markets, the customer requirements (CRs) need to be integrated into SSC’s DRs. This paper thus proposes a customer-centric approach based on Analytic Network Process (ANP), Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), and Pythagorean Fuzzy Set (PFS) to rank SSC’s DRs, considering CRs and information ambiguity. The PFS is combined with ANP, QFD, and GRA to better handle uncertainty in the SSC. The Pythagorean fuzzy ANP is applied to analyze the correlations among the sustainable CRs and determine the corresponding weights. The sustainable CRs are transformed into the DRs using the Pythagorean fuzzy QFD. The relationships among the resulting DRs are analyzed through Pythagorean fuzzy GRA to prioritize DRs. The approach is validated through a case study. The results obtained in this paper shows that the proposed method is efficient to prioritize DRs of SSC with the consideration of sustainable CRs under uncertain environment. The novelties of proposed method are that it not only offers a customer-oriented SSC planning method through the integration of ANP, QFD and GRA, but also can reflect the uncertain information with a broader membership representation space via PFSs. Based on the proposed method, the decision-maker can conduct comprehensive analysis to prioritize DRs and design appropriate SSC to fulfill CRs under uncertain environment.</jats:p>",

The effect of total flow time (0–260 min), influent flow rates (0.5, 1, and 1.5 mL min−1), bed depths (2, 4, and 6 cm), initial azithromycin concentrations (25, 50, and 100 mg L−1), and pHs (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) was considered in the adsorption process. Based on the obtained structures, three linear equations (LM, LM2, and LM3) were developed. The root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.89% and determination coefficient (R2) of 0.946 were determined for predicting azithromycin removal by the M5 model tree. The results indicated that contact time was more important in the adsorption process, relative to other operating conditions. This research showed that the M5 model tree could be an accurate and faster alternative to the available mathematical models to estimate removal rates of pollutants. The results obtained from the FTIR technique confirmed that the O–H groups on the MWCNTs surface have an important role in azithromycin adsorption.</jats:p>",

Buyers often exaggerate the urgency and quantity of their needs (“crying wolf”). However, both buyers and suppliers eliminate old, inflated orders from their behavioral ordering/supply system implicitly (“knowing wink”) even though they exist in the hyper‐rational ordering system represented by the ERP system. This behavior results in (and from) low credibility of information exchanged between the buyers and suppliers and their subsequent actions, and settles in a suboptimal equilibrium. Eye tracking experiments based on these case studies unpack the psychophysiological mechanisms behind this behavior, specifically, how decision makers consider past UnFilled Orders under different experimental conditions. We find that merely improving the supplier behavior does not help: information discounting reduces only when we sensitize the buyer to the improvement in the supplier behavior. However, this comes with no financial performance improvements; performance improves by further educating the buyers of the optimal target inventory. </jats:p>",

After the review of literature and discussion with experts from the case company and other supply chain professionals, the barriers and resilient capabilities were shortlisted. The study utilized a hybrid of AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS technique to provide weights to the criteria variables (here barriers) and rank the alternatives (here resilient capabilities). Five criteria of barriers were identified for the purpose of the study, namely, strategic barriers, technological barriers, cultural barriers, individual barriers, and organizational barriers. Twenty-three subcriteria were identified for these barriers. Six capabilities were decided upon to be prioritized out of which planning capabilities were obtained to be the most important followed by collaborative, agile, supply chain design modification capability, interoperability, and supply flexibility. The study attempts to fill the gap identified in the literature regarding the lack of studies on supply chain resilience barriers. It therefore provides a realistic framework to prioritize the resilience capabilities required for mitigating such barriers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Various stakeholders are involved in managing supply chain processes in construction. Suppliers can hardly tolerate upfront costs when faced with flaws in the payment pipeline. This is a serious problem in building construction that uses a large variety of materials as opposed to civil construction that requires fewer types of materials. Alternative secure payment systems are needed, and the use of cryptocurrencies can be an option. However, cryptocurrencies are seldom used in building construction projects due to several challenges that are mostly ignored in the existing literature. To fill this gap, this study investigates the use of cryptocurrencies in construction supply chains as an alternative payment solution to improve the financial performance of the stakeholders by taking advantage of this economical and traceable financial transaction system. The study involves exploratory, descriptive, and empirical survey research. Accordingly, a literature review, focus group discussions, and statistical analyses (Friedman test, Wilcoxon test, and Mann–Whitney U test) were performed. The results imply that a lack of technical knowledge about cryptocurrencies, fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies, limited market opportunities, security gaps, personal information required by cryptocurrency systems, no assurance of permanent use, and government actions limiting the use of cryptocurrencies were the most significant barriers against using cryptocurrencies in construction supply chain management. The findings are expected to provide critical information to construction professionals and regulatory agencies about the potential advantages and shortcomings of cryptocurrencies, hence motivating policymakers to create strategies that minimize the concerns of construction professionals about using cryptocurrencies in the building construction industry.</jats:p>"

Dependence on supply chains is also reduced by increasing energy efficiency. In relation to minerals the chapter examines changing needs for industrial inputs, real and perceived threats to mineral supplies, and the role of critical minerals policies. It considers the value of circular economy policies that can reduce dependence on primary raw materials. It concludes that resilience should be identified as a purpose to be pursued in energy measures for renewables, electrification, local supply, and efficiency; and that critical minerals policies and circular economy policies are likely to have increasing legal significance.</jats:p>",

Many companies have embraced artificial intelligence (AI) in the form of powerful computers, applications, or software that can screen job applicants, alert when a machine is about to break down, and read legal contracts. However, the rapid expansion of AI and its use in legal settings, such as contract performance, in a company is a major challenge on the judicial side. This article, thus, establishes an evolutionary game model of whether manufacturing suppliers are performing contracts or not when the court chooses to use artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Considering the complexity of choosing manufacturers' AI strategy, the method constructs a simulation analysis model of manufacturers' contract enforcement behaviour with the participation of several subjects. We can simulate the influence of the factors selected on the strategy chosen by both parties (manufacturers and court) by changing the different influence factors and studying the evolutionary law of different court guidance and regulation strategies on the production behaviour of green products. The results show that the choice of the court and manufacturers to use the AI technology strategy or not is based on the rate of error reduction, through the computational implementation of multi-subject modelling.</jats:p>",

Here, a pocket‐sized, battery‐powered, 10‐channel high voltage power supply (HVPS) is presented, which independently addresses each channel up to 10 kV. The HVPS uses one HV amplifier to create a HV rail and each output connects to the rail via custom optocouplers that are pulse‐width modulated to vary their conductance. These optocouplers distribute charges to and from electrostatic devices at each output, creating a charge‐controlled driving scheme that can generate independent and nearly arbitrary actuation waveforms for each channel. The HVPS weighs 250 g and measures 8.4 cm × 13.3 cm × 2 cm, about the size of a smartphone. The HVPS is characterized when driving hydraulically amplified self‐healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators. While powering a 5 nF actuator, the output of the HVPS reaches 8 kV in 100 ms and drives a 1.5 nF actuator at 100 Hz (0 to 5.4 kV). The HVPS powers an active surface consisting of an array of HASELs and generates undulatory locomotion of a soft robotic inchworm, highlighting the potential for compact HV electronics that power multi‐degree‐of‐freedom robotic systems based on electrostatic devices.</jats:p>",

With the increasing demand for drinking water quality, ARGs have been regarded as a new pollutant that may cause serious public health problems. A large number of studies have shown that the disinfection process of drinking water treatment plants can remove ARGs. However, the effects of traditional disinfection methods on ARGs have their own disadvantages. Tea polyphenols have attracted more and more researchers’ attention as a green, efficient and non-disinfection by-products disinfectant. The effect of the ozone–tea polyphenols disinfection process on ARGs in filtered effluent of waterworks was analyzed by using metagenomic sequencing. The result shows that the ozone–tea polyphenols disinfection process is suitable for specific raw water containing more tetracycline, sulfonamide, β-lactam, and aminoglycoside resistance genes, and the removal rate of total resistance genes in water is higher than the traditional disinfection process. The effect of the ozone–tea polyphenols disinfection process on ARGs is to reduce the transfer of ARGs by destroying ARGs molecules and inhibiting the proliferation of ARGs host cells. As an assistant disinfectant, tea polyphenols have significance for the ability to remove ARGs during traditional disinfection.</jats:p>",

The earthquake resilience of water supply systems is understood to be a function of multifaceted factors, which are time- and space-dependent. Measuring the seismic-resilience of RWSS in China remains a challenge. This paper proposes a multi-stage comprehensive evaluation framework, focusing on the relationship between multi-dimensional factors and the seismic- resilience of RWSS in rural areas, across three stages: before, during and after earthquake events. This study comprises four steps: (1) Development of a multi-stage evaluation conceptual framework; (2) identification of seismic-resilience factors; (3) verification of the relationships between factors and stages; and (4) formation of the final evaluation framework. The relationship between multi-dimensional factors is confirmed by a method of triangulation through the quantitative analysis of PLS-SEM combined with the qualitative literature analysis, highlighting the causal approach of the resilience of RWSSs, so as to better understand the resilience state of each stage of disaster. Understanding these factors and their influence on the seismic capacity of RWSS will enable local authorities to recognize the existing advantages and disadvantages of these factors, so as to carry out better resilience practice in all stages of disasters.</jats:p>"

The systematic comparison of the alternative processes using the PhO as a benchmark for the minimum input (exergy in this case) required to run a process with a certain benefit allows to determine the potential for optimization of each technology. Differences are analyzed by visualizing the losses of each individual production step in a process as well as by the resulting overall energy demand, including the primary energy. Possible alternatives are purchasing liquid oxygen from a cryogenic process or the production by means of Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) on site. The cryogenic production shows a lower exergy demand even though it also has a higher potential for optimization. Yet, the total losses, significantly impacted by the unavoidable transportation, sum up, resulting in the conclusion that the PSA is the preferable option overall, considering energy aspects. Finally, additional criteria such as economic, legal, and structural consequences of the respective choices are briefly outlined.</jats:p>"

Elk abundance was estimated from population counts and varied 3.9-fold across the 15 years of study in northwestern California, USA. Each January, early in the growing season, we estimated forage biomass in the 50-ha meadow complex used by the elk population. Measures of palatable forage cover and height were taken in 270 ¼ m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> plots dispersed throughout sectors. These measurements were then related to dried forage biomass. At both spatial scales, elk abundance was inversely, and precipitation was positively related to forage biomass. At the sector scale, analysis of a linear mixed effect model indicated heterogeneity. In some sectors both predictors were related to forage biomass and in other sectors they were not. Heterogeneity was not from uneven elk grazing as elk grazed sectors in proportion to forage biomass. The varied elk abundance–forage biomass relationships across sectors indicated that spatial heterogeneity declined with increasing elk abundance. Detecting relationships between free ranging ungulate populations and biomass of their food supply is not straightforward.</jats:p>"

The SAP system is currently the ERP software with the largest functions and the most sales and has been widely used by large domestic and foreign manufacturing enterprises. Because of its specific development for enterprises, it is also the most expensive ERP software in the world. This research integrates the existing information resources, takes SAP (system applications and products in data processing) system as the enterprise’s information platform, unifies the information platform into SAP system by integrating the existing information resources (financial system, logistics system, cost control system, production control system, etc.), avoids the information island phenomenon as far as possible, and finally realizes the integrated and unified enterprise information management, which is convenient for the rapid traceability of historical data, providing the best decision analysis method for managers. It is possible to eliminate all non-value-added operations in the value chain, find out the point of cost reduction and efficiency increase, comprehensively optimize the production value chain, improve production efficiency, and finally achieve the purpose of this book. The project implementation of automobile company adopts independent minicomputer system (HP server), with SAPR/3 system as the core and C/S (customer/service) architecture, so as to gradually expand the system function in the future. From the comparison before and after the launch of the SAP project, the above two indicators have increased by 1.5 times, the order fulfillment rate has increased from 30% to 45%, and the timely delivery rate has increased from 60% to 90%. Effective cost control can reduce costs, produce products with larger output and better quality at the same cost, and enable enterprises to maintain an advantage in the competition; effective cost control can also enable enterprises to develop a variety of configurations at the same cost. Products meet the individual needs of customers. The design of this article makes the company’s supply, production planning, logistics, and demand synchronized and integrated.</jats:p>",

The current dynamic balance model of supply and demand cannot obtain high-precision evaluation results of employment quality and meet the requirements of practical application. Therefore, a dynamic balance model of labor market supply and demand under flexible employment is constructed. Big data network is used to set data acquisition channels, complete data collection, unify data sample format, formulate data processing flow, and obtain processed data samples. The correlation analysis method in big data analysis technology is used to complete the analysis of college graduation employment. This paper analyzes the relevant research work of employment quality evaluation, establishes the employment quality evaluation index system, collects the index data, normalizes the index data, then uses the grey correlation method to determine the weight value of the employment quality evaluation index, and uses the fuzzy c-means algorithm to establish the dynamic balance model of supply and demand in the labor market. The experimental results show that the designed method can better balance the supply-demand relationship in the labor market and has a good effect.</jats:p>",

One of the proposals for mitigating climate change is fighting biodiversity loss, which can support climate mitigation and adaptation actions. In Poland, the possibility of excluding large tracts of forest areas from use is being considered. The discussed the exclusion of forest land from use will affect the timber supply and market, especially for broadleaved wood. The main purpose of this analysis is to present a timber supply forecast, with a particular focus on the possibility of obtaining broadleaved hardwood timber in Poland from forests managed by State Forests National Forest Holding under three scenarios that assume different criteria for selecting forest areas for protection. The work was divided into two main phases: (1) the analysis of historical sales volume of wood products and average sale prices of hardwood during the period 2011–2020; (2) the preparation of a forecast of the potential possibility of maintaining broadleaved hardwood production in the three decades between 2020 and 2049. In the forecast, it was assumed that about 2.7 million hectares of planted and production forests are excluded from use in order to implement the provisions of the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy. In Scenario “I”, the supply of merchantable broadleaved roundwood volume will be reduced to 14%–18% that of Scenario “0”. In Scenario “II”, 55% of the “0” scenario is harvested, and in Scenario “III”, 33%–37% of the “0” scenario merchantable broadleaved roundwood is harvested. The introduction of restrictions on timber harvesting as a result of Poland’s compliance with European Union requirements in the area of environmental protection will lead to a significant reduction in the supply of timber on the market. This may lead to a further increase in timber prices and an increase in the importance of large timber buyers at the expense of local buyers. The recommendations contained in the policy objectives that the EU sets for the states should be supported by a thorough analysis when selecting areas for strict protection.</jats:p>"

In order to overcome this barrier, the CircuSChain Game was developed based on the well-known Beer Distribution Game. The CircuSChain Game is a multi-player board game supported by a calculation sheet. The game considers reuse, refurbishing, remanufacturing, and recycling activities within closed-and open-loops, as well as CO2 emissions and material scarcity concepts.

To achieve this goal, the present study selected the Fasa plain in Iran and calculated its water poverty index (WPI) from 2008 to 2018 using parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Also, the study calculated the correlation coefficient between the WPI and climate change and drought in the study area. It then evaluated the effects of water resources management policies in the agricultural sector on the poverty index. The results showed that water consumption had the greatest weight in calculating the WPI. The WPI has fluctuated between 0.297 and 0.678 in the Fasa plain, and the worst situation of water poverty was experienced in 2014. Despite its insignificance, the downward trend in the WPI showed that water resources management has become more unfavorable over time. Finally, it was concluded that the WPI in the Fasa plain was more dependent on drought than on climate change in the short term. Therefore, managing water resource consumption in this plain is vitally important, especially in drought conditions. The results also showed that reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector can significantly improve the WPI. Therefore, solving the water crisis in this plain, given the drought conditions and its future trend, requires policies improving water-use efficiency in the agricultural sector.</jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to characterize the potential impacts of tephra fall on the groundwater-fed water supply system of Ponta Delgada (São Miguel, Azores) by comparing two scenarios of explosive eruptions. Vulnerability matrices were used to compute indexes, by multiplying the thickness of tephra fall deposits, corresponding to increasing hazard levels, by descriptors of the water supply system, representing the elements at risk. In a worst-case scenario, tephra covers a large area inland, severely constraining the abstraction of water to public supply, as 84.8% of the springs are affected. In 12 springs the expected hazard level is of perturbation (5157 m3/day; 12.1% of the daily abstraction) or damage (16,094 m3/day; 37.8%). The same trend is observed considering the storage capacity, as 75.4% of the reservoirs may be somehow affected. Moreover, 72.4% of the 68,392 inhabitants served by the water supply system will be in a zone where the damage level will be achieved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the interchangeable link between human and nature. The health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 are directly or indirectly linked to the natural environment and to the way that agri-food systems interact with nature. Although the pandemic continues to evolve and there are still many uncertainties, important issues about the future of the agri-food sector and the need for a sustainable and environmentally friendly reformation are beginning to arise in society. Nature-based Solutions (NbSs) encompass a broad range of practices that can be introduced in the agri-food supply chain and address multiple environmental challenges of the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 era while providing economic and societal benefits. In this perspective, the design and establishment of multifunctional constructed wetlands as NbSs opens a portfolio of eco-innovative options throughout the agri-food supply chain, offering a realistic and promising way towards the green regeneration of the post-COVID-19 economy and the welfare of society. The aim of this work is to explore the potential role of constructed wetlands as Nature-based Solutions in the agri-food supply chain of the forthcoming post-COVID-19 era. More specifically, this work aims to reveal application opportunities of constructed wetlands in the different segments of the agri-food supply chain, identify linkages with societal challenges and EU policies, and discuss their potential limitations, future challenges, and perspectives.</jats:p>"

Recent artificial intelligence (AI)‐based advancements in technology make it possible to overcome many problems associated with supply chain (SC) networks. The current study was performed to explore the role of AI in establishing an SSC. The research contribution in the field of AI and SSC was examined through a systematic literature review. A total of 353 articles were gathered from the Scopus database in the selected research field. A big data‐based approach, namely, structural topic modelling (STM), was applied to generate emerging thematic topics from shortlisted articles of AI in SSC. Moreover, using R package, a bibliometric analysis was conducted to examine the research trends in the field of AI in SSC. The research trends were then analysed, with generated thematic topics discussed. The proposed research framework can help researchers and practitioners to develop an SSC model using AI‐based techniques. Propositions for future research are given and implications are suggested.</jats:p>",

Given the insufficient supply of medical services and increasing demand for medical treatment, exploring the supply-demand pattern of medical services has become an urgent theoretical and practical problem to be solved. The equity of healthcare facilities has received widespread attention, but due to limited data, there is little research on the supply-demand pattern of medical services.

To investigate the impact of biochar placement methods on soil C and N, a one-year field experiment with five treatments was conducted including control, mineral fertilizers only (F), biochar hole placement (BFH; biochar applied to the soil layer at 5–10 cm) + F, biochar band placement (BFB; biochar applied to the soil layer at 15–20 cm) + F, and biochar band and hole placement + F (BFBH). The results showed that, regardless of the placement method, biochar application increased soil total organic C (TOC) and C pool management index by 6.9–39.7% and 4.1–36.1%, respectively, especially for dissolved organic C (DOC; 6.9–51.3%), readily oxidizable C (ROC; 2.4–46.4%), and microbial biomass C (MBC; 10.4–41.7%). Single biochar placement methods significantly influenced DOC, MBC, and ROC contents of both soil layers in the rank order of BFH ≈ BFBH &gt; BFB at 0–15 cm and BFB ≈ BFBH &gt; BFH at 15–30 cm. Soil TN and microbial biomass N (MBN) mainly accumulated at the site of biochar placement. The increased soil TOC:TN and MBC:N ratios under biochar treatments promoted inorganic N immobilization and reduced the loss of ammonium N and nitrate N (NO3−-N) through leaching at the early stage of tobacco growth. Biochar-adsorbed N was remobilized at a later period (vigorous growth stage and maturity), possibly causing the slow decrease in NO3−-N content. Additionally, soil C and N pools were significantly influenced by the main effects of soil layer and growth stage. Overall, biochar application increased soil C and N pools and inorganic N supply through N remobilization. However, the increased labile organic C content and microbial activity may prevent C sequestration in biochar-amended soils.</jats:p>"

The rejection rates were more than 90% for all chosen divalent metal salts. PHMG membranes displayed excellent enrichment of Li+ from a mixed solution of Mg2+ and Li+ salts. The Mg2+/Li+ mass ratio decreased from 60 to 3.7, accompanying a −3.6% rejection to Li+.

Pre-COVID-19, farmer-direct distribution options and hospitality businesses comprised a substantial proportion of local food producer businesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers favoured local food supply options, farmers collaborated, and produce usually destined for export was redirected into local markets. Critical food supply actions included keeping borders open to food freight, enhancing social capital through real-time business communication, and business flexibility. Solutions included business adaptation, for example, farmers selling produce boxes and hospitality businesses selling excess stock, COVID-safe delivery, and collaboration through digital networks. To better prepare the region for future crises, actions to support communities could include a community approach to agriculture, increasing food supply diversity, facilitating transport to aid food distribution and purchasing, and more effective messaging to discourage panic buying.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research work is aimed to mitigate the adverse effect of numerous portable generators used in academic environments due to the unstable power supply experienced in Nigeria. Data for the study on the existing backup, availability hours from the national grid, and load demand for the area of study were obtained from the residents of the campus, facility managers, and Kaduna Distribution Company as the grid supplier from August 2017 to December 2020. The average load of the campus was obtained to be 80kW. These were used as a baseline to obtain the required size and quantity of material to generate the backup power needed. A total ampere-hour requirement of the battery to be used was obtained to be 4,278.07Ah considering the average battery depth of discharge of 80%. This resulted in a total number of cells required to be 134 considering a battery with a 200Ah rating and a nominal voltage rating of 48V. A solar photovoltaic (PV) system rating of 166.4kW is required to sufficiently charge the battery bank and also serve the load. This amounts to a minimum of 5 panels per string connected in series and 34 number panels per string connected in parallel based on which the total number of panels required summed up to 666. The inverter rating for the load was obtained to be 150 kVA with a total load of 100 kVA, an efficiency of 80%, and an average future expansion of 20 %. A diesel generator rating of 100kVA with a starting kVA rating of 113.64kVA is required to efficiently serve the load considering future expansion of 1.1 and operating efficiency of 80 %. These obtained parameters were simulated using MATLAB/Simulink to test the feasibility of the backup systems. The generation cost of each backup was calculated based on which solar PV with battery bank has an initial energy generation cost of 81.9 ₦/kWh and a future energy generation cost of 0.27 ₦/kWh while diesel generator has an initial energy generation cost of 1602.04 ₦/kWh and a future energy generation cost of 8.07 ₦/kWh as such, PV has the least energy cost and more economical for the academic environment.</jats:p>"

The prosperity of agriculture and industrial production has also brought most people into a well-off life. Since the innovation of agricultural production equipment and concepts, the efficiency of agricultural production in my country has also been greatly improved compared to before the reform and opening up. In the era when robots will gradually become mainstream work machinery tools, the production efficiency and supply of agricultural products will become the focus of attention of the people of all countries. In such a general environment, the competition between agricultural products markets is no longer solely based on the competitiveness of agricultural products but also depends on the advantages of the agricultural supply chain to win. This article analyzes the construction of the sustainable operation mechanism of the agricultural supply chain in the context of wireless communication and the Internet of Things. First, the method of literature research is used to explain the characteristics of the agricultural supply chain and the problems existing in the development of the current agricultural supply chain model in the context of wireless communication and the Internet of Things. Next, study the current situation of the sustainability mechanism of the agricultural supply chain, and finally optimize the construction of the sustainability mechanism of the agricultural supply chain products based on the research results. According to the survey results, the main problem with the current mechanism of the agricultural product supply chain at this stage is that the logistics information technology is difficult to update in time, accounting for about 44%, followed by the lack of effective monitoring methods, accounting for about 34%.</jats:p>",

The problem of using only one power source for such enterprises is connected to current instability in frequency and voltage changes, as well as planned or unscheduled power outages in the power transmission line network. A variant of an automated power supply system is proposed as a backup source. This includes AC power from an external network and power from a combined wind-solar installation. The study proposes schemes for the joint use of wind-solar installations and external sources for enterprises located near power lines. It further proposes a scheme for the joint use of power lines with recuperators and thermoelectric generators, in those cases when enterprises are located beyond the reach of power lines. The result of this proposal is a constant, high-quality and uninterrupted power supply to high-tech power plants at any time of the year and under any weather conditions.</jats:p>",

Exploratory and descriptive research was conducted using a mixed-methods approach. The data collection techniques included documentary research, interviews, self-reports, and questionnaires administered to a sample of 96 milk producers. Interpretive analysis was used to process the qualitative data, and the Mann–Whitney U test and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the quantitative data. The results of the analyses led to the identification of the meso-institutions and their role in interpreting, implementing, and monitoring rules in the milk supply chain. The findings indicated that the meso-institutions do not operate uniformly in the various milk-producing regions. The regression results indicated that effective monitoring by the meso-institutions positively influences the milk producer’s perception of performance. Therefore, to maintain the sector’s competitiveness, meso-institutions are necessary for interpreting, implementing, and monitoring the implementation of rules in the organizational arrangement in the dairy supply chain. The research brings advances in the field of knowledge of meso-institutions, a research frontier of the new institutional economics.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The retailer cannot often identify consumers’ preference for personalized and refined services. This poses a lower service than the consumer expects, which will lead to a decline in consumers’ satisfaction and loyalty. To cope with this problem, we consider a dual-channel supply chain composed of a manufacturer who has the online channel and an offline retailer and introduce the concept of underservice into the framework of pricing and service decision. The influence of consumers’ service expectations and the sensitive coefficient of consumers’ perceptive service on optimal decision-making were explored by optimization theory. First, the mathematical model of profit functions of the offline retailer and the manufacturer was developed by taking into account the service expectation respectively. Based on this, the Stackelberg game was adopted to prove that there is a linkage mechanism between the optimal retail price and the optimal service level under certain conditions. Second, we examined the conditions under which underservice occurs and the factors that influence them. Finally, we explored the stability condition under which the offline retailer’s optimal service level is against pricing. Results show that for newly launched products, the offline retailer will take the risk of increased service costs to adopt a strategy of high profit and good sales as a result of underservice. With regard to expiring products, it is impossible for the offline retailer to provide a lower-than-expected service level. Therefore, the offline retailer will adopt a strategy of small profits but quick turnover. In addition, the optimal service level of the offline retailer is stable against the optimal retail price, which greatly simplifies the service decision of the offline retailer, that is, the offline retailer does not need to consider the pricing strategy of the manufacturer and only needs to offer a level of service equal to the consumers’ service expectation.</jats:p>"

Furthermore, to develop a generalized pan-cancer application of the CSH-method that doesn’t require a hypoxia reference standard for training the CSH-parameters. In a cohort of 69 breast cancer patients, we generated, based on the principles of intravoxel incoherent motion modelling, images reflecting cellular density (apparent diffusion coefficient; ADC) and vascular density (perfusion fraction; fp). Combinations of the information in these images were compared to a molecular hypoxia score made from gene expression data, aiming to identify a way to apply the CSH-methodology in breast cancer. Attempts to adapt previously proposed models for prostate cancer included direct transfers and model parameter rescaling. A novel approach, based on rescaling ADC and fp data to give more nuanced response in the relevant physiologic range, was also introduced. The new CSH-method was validated in a prostate cancer cohort with known hypoxia status. The proposed CSH-method gave estimates of hypoxia that was strongly correlated to the molecular hypoxia score in breast cancer, and hypoxia as measured in pathology slices stained with pimonidazole in prostate cancer. The generalized approach to CSH-imaging depicted hypoxia in both breast and prostate cancers and requires no model training. It is easy to implement using readily available technology and encourages further investigation of CSH-imaging in other cancer entities and in other settings, with the goal being to overcome hypoxia-induced resistance to treatment.</jats:p>"

Irrigating agricultural lands and green spaces with treated wastewater (TWW) can be thus regarded as a way to reduce pressure on fresh water resources and lead to the utilization of ecosystem services, such as regulating and cultural ones. The most important factor affecting the expansion and sustainability of these areas is people's participation. Therefore, this study reflected on the weight of locals' willingness and attitudes as one of the most effective factors in the development of irrigation with TWW in peri-urban areas and ecological buffer zones. The main indicators were accordingly extracted from previous research and examined through a survey questionnaire, and then analyzed by structural equation modeling (SEM) in the AMOS and LISREL software packages. The indicators were related to individuals' health in product consumption (health), people's activities in farmlands and green spaces (assurance), and users' distance from farmlands (accessibility). The study results revealed that accessibility was the most important factor, and then health and assurance were effective in people's participation in agricultural activities in farmlands irrigated with TWW in peri-urban areas and increasing green-space buffer zones.</jats:p>",

Rapid urbanization and rising tourism industry have reshaped the water system in China's island cities, and it is necessary to reveal the characteristics of the aforementioned impacts in relation to strength and duration. Here, we present a framing to interpret the nexus between island developments and water security. Subsequently, their coevolutionary trend and mutual impact effects (coupling coordination degree and response period) were measured by mathematical models, respectively. Results demonstrated that the equilibrium of the water system has shifted from nature- to human-dominated since 2010. Interestingly, the coupling coordination degree between water security and island development showed an upward increasing trend, across the study periods. Moreover, water security exhibited positive and negative shock responses to tourism and urbanization, over 1- and 7-year response periods, respectively. Overall, the findings from this case study provide a quantitative paradigm for island sustainable management, and are expected to inform local decision makers on warning signals of sustainability loss, at a temporal scale.</jats:p>",

Therefore, this study aims to identify how dynamic capabilities theory can enable circular and resilient supply chains. A qualitative research process was deployed in three stages: literature review, European project and nine expert interviews. Key investigative variables were used to identify capabilities used in manufacturing, and five research propositions were developed to address the gaps found in literature. The empirical data helped reveal challenges to circular economy implementation and validate the literature findings. The main contributions include a dynamic capabilities model, a causal relationship model and five research propositions for circular economy implementation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several industries have recently seen the replacement of human labor by automated machinery and equipment. Across the globe, farmers’ attitudes on the use of technology in agriculture are divergent. However, although some people are excited and ready to embrace technology, others are cautious and wary of trying new technologies for the first time. The third category is particularly prevalent in underdeveloped nations such as India, owing to a lack of competence, a lack of effective translation, and most crucially, a lack of financial resources. It is fruitless for the government to attempt to resolve these difficulties due to the fact that they do not take into consideration the changing circumstances and input needs of each agricultural group. Smart Tillage is a cutting-edge framework that was developed to solve the challenges listed above. In India, a decision-based smart engine for the rental and sharing of tools and equipment has been developed, which leverages machine learning methods to proceed towards a selection of tools and equipment. The option is entirely reliant on a variety of input variables, including crop kind, harvest time/month, crop equipment needed, harvest type, and the amount of money available for rental. Additionally, an ideal recommendation engine driven by content and collaborative-based filtering will provide the farmer’s requirements depending on their requirements. In terms of escalation, the proposals would be cost-effective and excellent since they would need little changes in training, technique improvements, and resource management via a new rent-share model similar to that used by Uber. In this work, demand and supply algorithms are used to define market equilibrium, and the results are shown in graphs. This includes discussion of a variety of demand and supply parameters, their impact on market equilibrium prices and quantities, and their effect on shifting demand and supply curves. The many sorts of elasticities (demand, cross-price, supply, income, and so on) are examined, as well as the ramifications for pricing systems that may result from these elasticities.</jats:p>",

This study explores the nexus between monetary policy and economic growth in Nigeria while accounting for the roles of interest rate, money supply, and financial inclusion over a base period of 2004q1 to 2020q4 and a projected period of 30 quarters. Using the dynamic simulation autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the study finds that in the short run, only the effect of money supply on economic growth is statistically significant. However, in the long run, interest rate, money supply, and financial inclusion have statistically significant effects on economic growth. The results are supported by the plots of the dynamic simulated ARDL, where economic growth response is predicted at various time periods after forcing a ±1% change (positive and negative shocks) in interest rate, money supply, and financial inclusion. We, therefore, recommend among other things an aggressive financial inclusion strategy with clearly defined deliverables and timelines to reduce the percentage of persons excluded from the formal financial system.</jats:p>",

Annual mean maximum temperature increased significantly on Penang Island and the middle of Penang mainland at the rates of 0.25 and 0.34 °C/decade, while annual mean minimum temperature increased significantly for all stations from 0.36 to 0.52 °C/decade, showing increases of warm nights in the past few years. Extreme drought events (SPI-3 &amp;gt; −2) over Penang were mostly occurred during the strong El Niño years, e.g. 1988–1989, 1997–1998, 2010–2011 and 2014–2016. The number of drought events is higher during the 2001–2010 (4–11 events) period as compared to the 1991–2000 (6–9 events) and 2011–2020 (7–8 events). Interestingly, the 2011–2020 period tends to have a shorter drought duration, but more intense droughts have been observed, particularly on Penang Island and the northern and southern parts of Penang mainland.</jats:p>",

Here, we clarified how soil water condition modifies the competitiveness of Japanese white birch against perennial weeds, <jats:italic>Eupatorium</jats:italic> species, based on an ecophysiological approach combining a glasshouse experiment and a field survey. We investigated photosynthetic and growth responses to various water regimes from water deficit to waterlogging (two times-a-week irrigation, three times-a-week irrigation, half waterlogging, and full waterlogging) in pot-grown seedlings of Japanese white birch and the competitive weed <jats:italic>Eupatorium makinoi</jats:italic>. The ratio of seedling height of Japanese white birch to seedling height of <jats:italic>E. makinoi</jats:italic> showed a decreasing trend from two times-a-week irrigation to full waterlogging, which suggests a lower competitiveness for light resource in Japanese white birch with increasing soil wetness. The maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V<jats:sub>c,max</jats:sub>) based on unit N was lower in waterlogging treatments than in two times- and three times-a-week irrigation in Japanese white birch, whereas <jats:italic>E. makinoi</jats:italic> showed the opposite response. This suggests that N partitioning into Rubisco and/or Rubisco activation might be suppressed in Japanese white birch but enhanced in <jats:italic>E. makinoi</jats:italic> under waterlogging. The maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub>) was also lower in seedlings of Japanese white birch grown under waterlogging treatments. We further conducted a field survey on the relationship between F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> and topographic wetness index (TWI) in seedlings of Japanese white birch and <jats:italic>E. glehnii</jats:italic> (closely related to <jats:italic>E. makinoi</jats:italic>) naturally grown in a study site 5 years after canopy tree cutting. Lower F<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>/F<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> was observed in seedlings of Japanese white birch with increasing TWI, whereas no significant trend was observed in <jats:italic>E. glehnii</jats:italic>, in agreement with the glasshouse experiment.

This refers particularly to new types of risks such as dynamic crises or emerging risks associated with digital transformation (DT). Therefore, the purpose of this exploratory paper is to investigate RM in SMEs in SCs. More precisely, the aim is to identify patterns that can be used to group SMEs according to their risk behavior (i.e., risk attitude and perception). Drawing from a data set of 181 European SMEs, this paper empirically conceptualizes a typology of SMEs. The typology consists of four distinct types of SMEs that emerged from a cluster analysis: collective risk eliminators, collective playing it safe seekers, collective risk-ignoring knights of fortune, and collective neglecting imperturbable ones. The findings indicate that different risk behavior leads to different degrees of collaboration within the SC. Furthermore, the close interconnection between RM as found in the different clusters and the respective firm’s innovation performance can be shown. By acknowledging the heterogeneity found in SMEs, this paper breaks away from mainstream research that tends to consider SMEs as a homogeneous entity.</jats:p>"

The results showed that, compared with unmodified activated carbon, PAC-1 had a better adsorption effect for NDEA after pre-soaking with 0.8 mol/L permanganate (PM) for 24 hours and calcination at 400 °C for 7 hours. Under the conditions of 8 g/L PAC-1 dosage, pH = 6, and adsorption time of 6 h, the adsorption rate of NDEA with an initial concentration of 50 mg/L reached 78.66%, the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity was 4.916 mg·g−1, and the adsorption rate of unmodified activated carbon to NDEA was increased by 42.5%. The number of oxygen-containing surface functional groups of activated carbon was increased after permanganate prepreg, which can enhance the NDEA adsorption rate. The adsorption process of NDEA on modified activated carbon conforms to pseudo-second-order kinetics, and the adsorption isotherm corresponds to the Freundlich model.</jats:p>",

In order to regulate renewable energies and ensure the sustainable development of renewable energy in China, a regulatory framework is imperative. Electricity demand and supply forecasting have become one of the most important topics for research on sustainable solutions to energy issues. This article analyzes the Chinese electric power industry structure by looking at historical electricity demand and supply data. This study shows how a divergent set of energy policies can facilitate the application of renewable energy to China’s electric power sector. The analysis shows that in 2020, China’s electricity generation and consumption increased by 0.9 and 1.3 percent annually, respectively, producing capacity of power plants increased by 5.6 GW, coal consumption of power supply decreased by 4.3 g/kWh, power generation projects investment increased by 51.6 billion RMB, power grid projects investment decreased by 1.8 billion RMB, and newly installed generation capacity increased by 769 GW year on year (YOY). During the first three quarters of 2021, the generation, consumption and coal consumption of electricity increased respectively by 10.7 and 12.9%, the generating capacity of power plants increased by 9.4 GW, the average coal consumption of power supply decreased by 0.9 g/kWh, power generation projects investment increased by 1.8 billion RMB, while power grid projects investment decreased by 0.3 billion RMB and new generation capacity added around 20.16 GW compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, domestic power consumption grew by 6.0% and 7%, respectively, in 2020–2021. The paper examines China’s current climate, developments, and renewable energy targets between 2020 and 2021.

As a data-driven method, the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) method has been investigated by numerous studies in runoff forecasting. However, selecting appropriate parameters for LSSVM is the key to obtaining satisfactory model performance. In this study, we propose a hybrid model for monthly runoff forecasting, VMD-SSA-LSSVM for short, which combines variational mode decomposition (VMD) with LSSVM and the parameters of LSSVM are optimized by a sparrow search algorithm (SSA). Firstly, VMD is utilized to decompose the original time series data into several subsequences. Secondly, LSSVM is employed to simulate each subsequence, for which the parameters are optimized by SSA. Finally, the simulated results for each subsequence are accumulated as the final results. The validity of the proposed model was verified by forecasting monthly runoff for two reservoirs located in China. Four frequently-used statistical indexes, namely the Nash efficiency coefficient, root mean squared error, correlation coefficient and mean absolute percentage error were used to evaluate model performance. The results demonstrate the superiority of VMD-SSA-LSSVM over the compared models in terms of all statistical indexes, indicating that it is beneficial for enhancing monthly runoff forecast accuracy.</jats:p>",

Sustainability assessments of manufacturing organizations help minimize the negative environmental impact and enhance reputation among public and regulatory agencies. To assess the sustainability of the manufacturing process; it is indispensable to investigate the structured set of triple bottom line (3BL) indicators. Moreover, there is no comprehensive and structured set of 3BL indicators that can effectively assess the sustainability of any organization’s manufacturing process. This research aims to identify and prioritize experts’ consensus structured set of 3BL indicators. The 3BL indicators were identified through an open-ended questionnaire. The prioritization was performed through the Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) approach. Further, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) method was utilized to draw the consensus ranking of sustainability indicators in manufacturing. The findings indicated that the release of greenhouse/harmful gas is the best indicator in the perspective of environmental criteria followed by the rate of contribution to society and operational cost are the most important critical indicator in the case of social and economic sustainability criteria. The outcome of the present study will facilitate researchers and practitioners in developing suitable readiness and operational plans for the sustainability assessment of the manufacturing process.</jats:p>"

The aim of the present study was to analyze the impact on the weight gain of newborn calves due to important management factors related to colostrum supply, iron supply, feeding regime and microbial load at first feeding. In spring 2017, information of 123 Holstein calves were analyzed with regard to the colostrum supply and management factors on eight commercial dairy farms located in Germany. Additionally, blood samples of newborn calves were analyzed for total immunoglobulin G (IgG) and serum iron content. Furthermore, Brix analysis and analysis of contamination by E. coli were performed on first colostrum samples from teats or buckets. Average daily weight gain of calves at days 14 and 50 was calculated. The colostrum IgG was estimated by Brix refractometer. The volume of initial colostrum supply and the time between birth and colostrum intake significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced the serum IgG concentration. The serum IgG concentration, the serum iron concentration and the feeding regimen (restrictive or not restrictive feeding) had a significant effect (p &lt; 0.05) on daily weight gains. In conclusion, this study shows that, in addition to a sufficient supply of immunoglobulins, other aspects, such as an adequate colostrum, iron and milk supply, play an essential role in calf growth rates.</jats:p>"

Although the water is of drinking water quality, its chemo-physical properties often adversely affect the measuring behaviour of a meter after a while. There is thus the risk that they no longer meet legal requirements and may no longer be used. In this paper a test regime with a focus on pH, total hardness and particle load is presented which allows water meters to be tested closer to their operating conditions prior to placing them on the market. The regime goes beyond the conventional continuous durability test as described in OIML R49:2013(E) and ISO 4064:2014. The feasibility and reliability of the test regime has been demonstrated through implementation at different facilities. In the study, the measurement performance of water meters of various types and from different manufacturers was also investigated. A heterogeneous spread of measurement errors was found for both, water meters in mint conditions and those which were exposed to a defined water quality. Furthermore, compared to the conventional continuous durability test, the test regime developed in the study generally leads to stronger changes in the measurement error of the water meters.</jats:p>",

It is important to understand the impact of this new practice on a vehicle manufacturer (VM) that provides gasoline vehicles (GVs) and/or electric vehicles (EVs), and the consumer and social welfare. Implementing the dual‐credit scheme leads to higher prices of GVs and EVs, but the effective price of EVs is actually lower. As the cost difference decreases and consumers’ low‐carbon awareness (LCA) increases, the VM prefers the product choice strategy including EVs under the pure subsidy scheme. Surprisingly, the hybrid scheme makes selling EVs feasible even though the cost difference is high and LCA is low. Although the additional dual‐credit scheme can improve the adoption of EVs, its parameter values should be carefully designed because otherwise it will damage the VM's profit and the consumer and social welfare.</jats:p>",

However, the introduction of the AS will have an impact on spot market in pricing strategy, market share and the profit of the retailer. Hence, to coordinate the supply chain and improve the efficiency of the agricultural supply chain, a two-stage game theory model is constructed to analyze the effects of AS on three classic contracts: wholesale price, quantity discount and revenue-sharing contract. This paper also discusses the boundary conditions of whether a retailer should sell in advance. The conclusions of this paper are as follows: First, revenue-sharing contracts are superior to wholesale price and quantity discount contracts when retailers sell in advance, the wholesale price contract can perform better than the quantity discount contract in the presence of AS if the contract parameter is properly set. Second, a revenue-sharing contract that normally coordinates the supply chain can performs poorly when the retailer sells in advance that the social welfare would be higher if using a quantity discount contract instead. These conclusions have important implications for suppliers when retailers sell in advance. Such suppliers need to design appropriate contracts to distribute FAP that carefully take into consideration the AS activities in the market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Compared to sole crops, intercropping—especially of legumes and cereals—has great potential to improve crop yield and resource use efficiency, and can provide many other ecosystem services. However, the beneficial effects of intercrops are often greatly dependent on the end use as well as the specific species and genotypes being co-cultivated. In addition, intercropping imposes added complexity at different levels of the supply chain. While the need for developing crop genotypes for intercropping has long been recognized, most cultivars on the market are optimized for sole cropping and may not necessarily perform well in intercrops. This paper aims to place breeding targets for intercrop-adapted genotypes in a supply chain perspective. Three case studies of legumes and cereals intercropped for human consumption are used to identify desirable intercrop traits for actors across the supply chains, many of which are not targeted by traditional breeding for sole crops, including certain seed attributes, and some of which do not fit traditional breeding schemes, such as breeding for synchronized maturity and species synergies. Incorporating these traits into intercrop breeding could significantly reduce complexity along the supply chain. It is concluded that the widespread adoption and integration of intercrops will only be successful through the inclusion and collaboration of all supply chain actors, the application of breeding approaches that take into account the complexity of intercrop supply chains, and the implementation of diversification strategies in every process from field to fork.</jats:p>"

The main research method is content analysis of the relevant information sources. The role of regional government programs in regulation of regional energy development is specified. A review of the main state programs of the considered Arctic subjects of the Russian Federation is carried out. It was revealed that the tasks of energy supply development are unevenly distributed in the state programs of the constituent entities of the Federation, and program measures are differently detailed. The content of the analyzed state programs is compared with the factors of energy supply. It is shown that regional government programs are primarily compared with economic factors. As instruments of regional policy, the state programs of the regions act as legal factors. Factors of other groups are taken into account in state programs to a lesser extent.</jats:p>"

Especially in poor rural areas, the development of agriculture still stays at low-level manual farming. Therefore, with the help of the developed Internet of Things technology, it is necessary for digital technology to develop and reform the rural areas in poverty-stricken areas. This paper aims to promote the supply-side structural revolution of agriculture in poverty-stricken areas by digital technology based on intelligent environment of Internet of Things. Firstly, the KNN intelligent algorithm is improved to improve the accuracy and reduce the time complexity. Then, based on the data support of Internet of Things technology, a prediction model is built, and the parameters are optimized by particle swarm optimization, and finally the best prediction model with high prediction accuracy, good stability and reduced prediction time complexity is obtained. Taking the source area of the Danjiang River in the South-to-North Water Transfer Project as the research object, the total grain output and soybean production demand in this area from 2010 to 2018 were selected, and the change trend of soybean production and demand in this area from 2019 to 2021 was predicted. The experimental data show that the soybean output in this region has increased year by year, with a cumulative increase of 6,985.4 tons from 2010 to 2018. Soybean output sometimes exceeds demand, and sometimes it is less than demand. There will be an oversupply situation in 2019 and 2021, and an oversupply situation in 2020. Therefore, the prediction model of Internet of Things can effectively predict the supply and demand situation of soybean with an accuracy rate of over 90%, which can provide data support for the decision-making of structural change of agricultural supply side in poverty-stricken areas.</jats:p>",

We propose that the benefits of investments in higher education depend on the levels of innovation and economic growth in each national economy. We use a configurational method (Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis) to identify combinations of factors that lead to a high incidence of over‐qualification in 17 European countries. The results show that over‐qualification is greater in countries in which an increase in the number of graduates is accompanied by a failure to transition to a knowledge‐based economy and poor economic growth. Furthermore, a low weight of high‐tech manufacturing sectors in the GDP is a necessary condition for over‐qualification to occur. These arguments explain the more pronounced mismatch in Southern Europe and Austria compared to other European countries. As for policy implications, this study shows that investment in education did not lead to expected benefits in some countries because this investment did not boost competitiveness in high‐tech sectors. Thus, alternative policies must be implemented. Besides investment in education, some kind of industrial policy seems necessary in a number of European countries.</jats:p>",

The rapid development of smart grid imposes higher data monitoring and transmission requirements in terms of delay and energy efficiency. However, due to the severe electromagnetic interference (EMI) caused by massive electrical equipment, the transmission performance of IIoT becomes inferior. The traditional single-hop transmission mode evolves towards a multihop cooperation mode to satisfy differentiated quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we propose an upper confidence bound- (UCB-) based joint route and power selection optimization algorithm to support multihop cooperation mode evolution, which adopts a software-defined networking- (SDN-) enabled IIoT network framework to simplify network configuration and management. Compared with existing local-side-information-based route selection (LSI-RS) and random route selection (RRS) algorithms, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has superior performances in total delay, energy efficiency, and utility.</jats:p>",

Moreover, the existence of 1,2-DCA can do harm to human organs. Hence, it is urgent to develop an effective technology for the remediation of 1,2-DCA-contaminated groundwater. In this study, a calcium peroxide (CaO2) system activated by Fe(III) was applied to the degradation of 1,2-DCA and 83.3% of 1,2-DCA could be effectively removed within 3 h when the molar ratio of CaO2/Fe(III)/1,2-DCA was 30/120/1. The results of probe experiments, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detection, and scavenging tests demonstrated that both HO• and O2−• were the key factors for 1,2-DCA degradation. The released amount of Cl− (84.1%) revealed that most of the chlorine in 1,2-DCA could be dechlorinated. GC-MS was applied for the detection of intermediates during 1,2-DCA degradation and the possible degradation pathway was proposed that 1,2-DCA was first reduced to vinyl chloride (VC) and then oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Finally, 73.4% removal of 1,2-DCA could be achieved in actual groundwater when the molar ratio of CaO2/Fe(III)/1,2-DCA was 100/400/1, demonstrating that the CaO2/Fe(III) system has a remarkable prospect in 1,2-DCA-contaminated groundwater remediation.</jats:p>",

Disinfection and supply department is the premise and foundation of the hospital department, mainly responsible for the recovery, cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, storage, and distribution of medical devices. The cleaning and disinfection work is characterized by strong technicality and high requirements, and the work effect is directly related to the safety of patients' lives and the occurrence of hospital infections.

The traditional management mode has some drawbacks, which affects the actual work of the hospital. Disinfection and supply rooms are an important part of hospital infection control and an important department to ensure the quality of health care. An effective management mode can not only improve the efficiency but also the overall quality of work, and PDCA (plan-do-check action cycle) as an advanced management mode can effectively improve the quality of management.

Intermittent eruption and rise of the water-wing was observed, and the water-wing occasionally impacted on the structures above the chute. In order to investigate the mechanism of water-wing rise, model tests of the deep outlet have been conducted. High-speed camera, pressure sensors, and hot-wire anemometer are adopted to obtain the characteristics of cavity and water-wing. Several key parameters are measured, including air pressure in the cavity and air entrainment volume. It is found that variations of net cavity length, filling water length, and the height of water-wing rise increase with the angle ratio R, and a substantial jump occurs for all related parameters when R approaches 1.4. The rate of water-wing rise W is less than 10% for R &amp;lt; 1.4, while it suddenly increases to over 25% for R &amp;gt; 1.4. Correlations among inflow condition, jet impact angle, cavity deformation, pressure fluctuation in the cavity, and the rise of water-wing are studied, thus the underlying mechanism of abnormal rise of water-wing is proposed.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a method for power supply current sharing state estimation based on LSTM recurrent neural network is proposed. By taking advantage of subtle differences in the inherent spectral characteristics of SMPSs, this method only needs to detect the voltage ripple at the switching frequency of the load terminal to estimate the output current of each power supply branch. The verification experiment on the three-power redundant experimental platform shows that the estimation error is less than 10%. The method has the characteristics of simple structure, non-invasion, convenient deployment and maintenance, so it has high application and promotion value.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background. In recent decades, many studies have been carried out showing the relationship between the development, severity, frequency of exacerbations of various diseases and insufficient supply of vitamin D. There is more and more data on the role of vitamin D in lung maturation and surfactant formation, which is very important for children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which develops mainly in extremely premature newborns. The aim of the study is to establish the supply of vitamin D in extremely premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the perinatal period. Material and methods. We examined 75 extremely premature infants, determined the level of calcidiol in the blood serum at 1-2 days of life in all children, analyzed the maternal history of vitamin D intake. 38 infants developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (1 main group), the second group consisted of 37 premature infants who did not develop BPD. Results. We established the frequency of taking preparations containing vitamin D during the last month before childbirth (63.2% in group 1 and 84.7% in group 2) by women; and also the analysis of the received dosage of cholecalciferol was carried out: only 18.4% of women of the 1st group received vitamin D in a dosage of more than 1000 IU. The level of 25 (OH) D in blood serum in patients of both groups at birth was determined: 13.9 (6.4; 37.1) ng/ml and 30.6 (11.8; 54.3) ng/ml in groups 1 and 2, respectively, p=0.031. A negative correlation was found between the content of 25 (OH) D in blood serum at birth and the severity of BPD (rs = -0.39; p=0.013). Conclusions. The serum calcidiol content at birth in BPD patients is statistically significantly lower than in infants without BPD: 13.9 (6.4; 37.1 ng/ml) versus 30.6 (11.8; 54.3) ng/ml, p = 0.031. The median vitamin D content in children with severe BPD at birth was 8.5 (3.2; 20.9) ng/ml; with moderate BPD - 13.6 (6.4; 35.0) ng/ml; in newborns with mild BPD - 41.4 (16.3; 64.6) ng/ml, p &lt;0.05. The vast majority of mothers of infants with BPD (81.6%) received vitamin D at a dose of less than 1000 IU.</jats:p>",

The results of the first pot study showed significant interactive effects between P supply and salinity on Zn, Fe and Se accumulation. Increasing salinity at the same P supply level increased shoot Zn concentrations, but significantly decreased total shoot Zn amount owing to decreased aboveground biomass. An increased accumulation of total shoot Fe and Se in P-added treatments, relative to the no-P treatments, was mainly due to increased aboveground biomass. The results of the second pot study showed substantial genotypic variations in Zn, Fe and Se accumulation; principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that agronomic traits and nutrient accumulation were controlled by independent genetic mechanisms. These results indicated that the amount of P supply is a key factor regulating biomass and accumulation of Zn, Fe and Se in certain saline soils; the sizable genotypic difference in Zn, Fe and Se accumulation observed in salinised conditions has provided potential scope for genetic improvement by breeding strategies.</jats:p>"

The influences of the structural parameters of the micron-groove orifice (MGO), such as the groove cross-sectional shape, dimensional parameters and layout, on the static characteristics under high gas supply pressures are studied. The SST k- ω turbulence model can accurately simulate the pressure distribution of a gas film flow field under high gas supply pressures, and the MGO can effectively improve static bearing characteristics such as the load capacity and stiffness. The influences of the groove cross-sectional shape, groove depth, and groove width of the MGO are not significant, but the groove length, orifice diameter, and MGO layout have obvious impacts on the load capacity and stiffness of a bearing. Structural parameters should be reasonably selected in the bearing design process. </jats:p>",

Most practices of the olive oil supply chain have been associated with negative environmental effects, such as soil degradation, carbon dioxide emissions, air and ground pollution, and depletion of groundwater. The current work aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis, through a science mapping approach, coupled with a review on the life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of the olive oil sector, with relevance to the environmental impacts of agricultural and industrial practices of this food sector. A total of 110 documents published in 2008–2021 were analyzed and discussed. More than 78% of documents were released from 2015. The main Scopus categories relating to the topic analyzed were environmental sciences (25%), energy (18%), and engineering (17%). The most productive countries were Italy, Spain, and Greece. The cluster analysis identified three main research topics related to the “agricultural phase”, “oil extraction”, and “waste management and by-product valorization”. Most of the recent publications focused on the application of LCA to evaluate the environmental impact of innovative agricultural practices, sustainable control of parasites and weeds, wastes, and by-products valorization within a circular economy.</jats:p>"

In this study, the responses of phytoplankton functional groups (PFGs) to physicochemical variables and hydraulic regimes were investigated and used as ecological indicators in the Tri An Reservoir (TAR), a eutrophic tropical floodplain reservoir located in southern Vietnam. Altogether, 148 phytoplankton taxa were identified and assigned to 16 PFGs; the four predominant PFG groups were M (Microcystis spp.), MP (filamentous cyanobacteria: Oscillatoria spp., and some other diatoms: Gomphonema angustatum, Navicula sp.), J (green algae: Coelastrum spp., Cosmarium spp., Pediastrum spp., Scenedesmus spp., Staurastrum spp., Tetradesmus spp., Tetraëdron spp., and Xanthidium spp.), and P (Closterium spp., Aulacoseira granulata, Fragilaria spp., Pinnularia spp., and Desmidium baileyi). The average PFG biovolume ranged from 79.6 ± 20.2 to 230.1 ± 69.1 mg/L with M being the dominant group. The trophic state index (TSI) indicated that the water condition was light-eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic. It was found that the large water level fluctuation resulted in seasonal nutrient dynamics, with higher nutrient concentrations and higher turbidity during the low water level period and vice versa. The redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the nutrient concentrations, water level fluctuation, and mixing regimes were critical factors in the PFG selection in the TAR. Therefore, we assumed that water level fluctuation management coupled with biological competition have the potential to control toxic cyanobacteria in the TAR. In conclusion, the PFGs are suitable for examining the effects of environmental conditions on phytoplankton dynamics in tropical floodplain reservoirs, but their sensitivity to long-term changes in water quality and eutrophication requires further investigation.</jats:p>",

This paper constructs a competition model for the recycling of reverse supply chain considering the behavioral factors of recyclers. In accordance with the definition of the fixed point, we calculate the four equilibrium points of the system and also analyze the local and global stability of the system. Different from former researches, this paper emphasizes on the study of the impact on the long-term operation and profit of the system by those behavioral factors. The study shows that: those behavioral factors of the enterprise, like price adjustment speed, the fairness concern coefficient, and the trade-off coefficient of market share, have significant effects on the size of the stability region. Through some simulation methods like the system’s price bifurcation diagram, maximum Lyapunov exponent, price power spectrum and so on, the characteristics of the system with its chaotic dynamics will be illustrated in this paper. The paper also focuses on the study of the impacts on the system’s profits by heterogeneous behavioral factors. It is furthermore found that once some drastic pricing strategies are being adopted, both the profits of any party and the operating efficiency of the entire system will be damaged. </jats:p>",

The exact solution to the Riemann problem calculates the mass and momentum fluxes while considering the Brunone unsteady friction factor. One simple boundary treatment with double virtual cells is proposed to ensure the whole computation domain with second-order accuracy. Results of various transient free-surface flows achieved by the proposed models are compared with exact solution, experimental data, the four-point implicit Preissmann scheme solution, as well as predictions by the classic Method of Characteristics (MOC). Results show that the proposed second-order GTS UFMs are accurate, efficient, and stable even for Courant numbers less than one and sparse grid. The four-point implicit Preissmann scheme may produce severe numerical attenuation in the case of large time steps and unsuitable weighting factors, while the MOC scheme may produce severe numerical attenuation in the case of a low Courant number and could not maintain mass conservation. The numerical simulations considering the unsteady friction factor are closer to the measured water depth variations. The effect of unsteady friction becomes more important as the initial water depth difference increases significantly.</jats:p>",

However, due to the interference of external factors and the irregularity of its changes, this is still a ticklish problem, especially in multi-step forecasting. This article mainly studies two issues: we first analyze the lack of water quality data and propose to use the random forest algorithm to interpolate the missing data. Then, we systematically discuss and compare water quality prediction methods based on attention-based RNN, and develop attention-based RNN into a multi-step prediction for dissolved oxygen. Finally, we applied the model to the canal in Jiangnan (China) and compared eight baseline methods. In the dissolved oxygen single-step prediction, the attention-based GRU model has better performance. Its measure indicators MAE, RMSE, and R2 are 0.051, 0.225, and 0.958, which are better than baseline methods. Next, attention-based GRU was developed into multi-step prediction, which can predict the dissolved oxygen in the next 20 hours with high prediction accuracy. The MAE, RMSE, and R2 are 0.253, 0.306, and 0.918. Experimental results show that attention-based GRU can achieve more accurate dissolved oxygen prediction in single-neural network and multi-step predictions.</jats:p>",

New prospective (or ex ante) methods are needed to assess the impacts of these changes. Prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) can contribute by detailed analysis of environmental consequences. A new stream of research has taken up the challenge to create prospective life cycle inventory (LCI) databases, building on projections of integrated assessment models to describe future changes in technology use and their underlying environmental performance. The present work extends on this by addressing the research question on how to project life cycle impact assessment methods for water scarcity consistent with prospective LCI modeling. Water scarcity characterization factors are projected from 2010–2050 using the AWARE method, based on SSP‐RCP scenario results of the integrated assessment model IMAGE. This work is coupled with prospective LCI databases, where electricity datasets are adapted based on the energy component of IMAGE for the same scenario. Based on this, an LCA case study of water desalination for the steel industry in Spain is presented. The resulting regional characterization factors show that some regions (i.e., the Iberian Peninsula) could experience an increase in water scarcity in the future. Results of the case study show how this can lead to trade‐offs between climate change and water scarcity impacts and how disregarding such trends could lead to biased assessments. The relevance and limitations are finally discussed, highlighting further research needs, such as the temporalization of the impacts.</jats:p>",

Therefore, parallel push-pull ventilation was taken as the research object in this paper. The push-pull ventilation studied consists of a square uniform supply hood and a square uniform exhaust hood, and the side length of pull hood and pull hood was same. A workbench was set between the push hood and pull hood, and the source of toluene pollutions was set in the center of the worktable surface. The optimal k values for different distances between push hood and pull hood were studied by numerical simulation using Ansys Fluent, which were obtained base on the distribution of wind speed and toluene concentration. The results showed that parallel push-pull ventilation is not suitable for applications when L/a ≥ 6. The changing patterns of k value with L/a is proposed in the range of 1.5 ≤ L/a ≤ 5 for the parallel square push-pull ventilation, which can be used to estimate k value relatively accurately under the condition that L/a is known, so as to guide the determination of the exhaust air volume of the parallel push-pull ventilation system.</jats:p>"

A total of 98% of the net ECEs-PT is highly concentrated in coal mining and washing (Coalmin), metal smelting and rolling processing (MetalSmelt) and petroleum processing, coking, and nuclear fuel processing (RefPetraol). Moreover, the ECEs-PT driving forces were technology, structure, and scale. While trade expands, the pressure of CEs reduction is increasing. We discussed optimization for different types of sectors.

O tratamento convencional de água de abastecimento utiliza como agente oxidante e de desinfecção, o cloro. Apesar de ser o produto mais utilizado, seu uso está associado à formação de alguns subprodutos que podem ser nocivos à saúde, entre eles os trihalometanos, ácidos haloacéticos e as cloraminas. O presente trabalho avaliou o potencial do peróxido de hidrogênio (H2O2), com e sem radiação ultravioleta (UV-C), como agente oxidante no tratamento de águas de abastecimento com o intuito de prevenção de formação das cloraminas e de manutenção dos níveis de cloro residual. Diferentes dosagens de H2O2 e tempos de contato de UV-C foram testados. O tratamento utilizando apenas H2O2 foi eficiente na redução das concentrações desses compostos já nas dosagens mais baixas, tendo aumentado sua eficiência proporcionalmente ao aumento da dosagem de peróxido, bem como, mantendo o cloro residual. A maior eficiência de redução de cloraminas foi de 91,29% na dose de 1,5 mg/L de H2O2. Os tratamentos associando UV-C se mostraram menos eficientes na redução de cloraminas, sendo que, o tratamento durante 1 minuto de UV-C reduziu em 43,55% e o de 3 minutos, 18,06%, ambos na dose de 3 mg/L de H2O2. O tratamento utilizando apenas UV-C foi menos eficiente. Dessa forma, é promissor o uso de H2O2 como agente oxidante alternativo ao cloro.</jats:p>"

At the same time, through the absorption of foreign community governance experience, domestic research on community governance has also begun to be put on the agenda. This paper aims to study the innovative exploration of urban community governance mechanisms through key high-performance computing algorithms. To this end, this paper proposes a combination of the Bayesian algorithm and distributed high-performance computing to analyze and explore the governance and management methods of the community through its efficient and stable computing power, and derive the most suitable community governance mechanism. An experiment was also set up for comparative analysis. The experimental results show that the community governance mechanism derived from the key distributed high-performance computing algorithm improves the community governance capability by 19.4%, effectively improving the community governance and management issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The idea of distributed active filtration is to compensate for the currents of higher harmonics and undesirable components of the power of the main network with inverters of renewable energy converters of the connected microgrid, which have reserves of apparent power. For the convenience of distributed compensation, it is proposed to identify the sinusoidal mode of the three-phase four-wire power system, provided that the symmetric source is six mutually orthogonal components of the three-coordinate vector of line currents. The power of imbalance is shown to be due to four mutually orthogonal components of the three-coordinate vector of line currents with defined reference voltage vectors, each of which is proportional to a separate orthogonal component of the power of imbalance. Integral formulas for determining the scalar values of the four specified orthogonal components of imbalance powers have been obtained, which open the possibility of accounting for their contribution to the deterioration of the quality of electrical energy and the synthesis of control signals for active distributed filtration. The connection between the four specified orthogonal components of the power of imbalance and the parameters of the linear unbalanced load was established, which made it possible to verify these integral formulas using a computer experiment. It is analytically established and experimentally confirmed that the squares of the two orthogonal components of the imbalance powers associated with the current of the neutral wire are included in the decomposition of the square of apparent power and power losses with the multiplier, depending on the ratio of the resistances of the transmission line of the three-phase four-wire power system.

This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal water quality variations in the urbanizing Chongqing reach of Jialing River and its tributary using a 6-yr multisite dataset (January 2010–December 2015). Water quality variables including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate index (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) were deciphered. Results showed that the trunk river displayed respectively 1.2 and 39.8% higher pH and DO concentration but 66.9, 94.7 and 85.2% lower CODMn, NH3-N and TP concentrations relative to the tributary (P &amp;lt; 0.05), due largely to the dilution effects occurring in the trunk river. The dry season presented respectively 1.3, 18.2, 102.8 and 32.5% higher pH, DO, NH3-N and TP concentrations than those in the wet season (P &amp;lt; 0.05). DO concentration showed significant inter-annual variations (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and CODMn, NH3-N and TP concentrations all presented markedly declining trends from 2010 to 2015 (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Significant relationships among the study variables were found in different spatiotemporal scales (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Our results are valuable to optimize strategies for sustainable water quality management in rivers experiencing urbanization worldwide.</jats:p>",

Fracture of the primary barrier by the hydrodynamic load of the LNG CCS may lead to disasters because it is difficult to implement immediate safety measures in the marine environment, unlike on land. Hence, structural reliability of the LNG membrane is the most critical issue in LNG carrier CCSs, where thin and corrugated 304L stainless steel is often used as the primary barrier to prevent repeated thermal deformation from the temperature difference during loading (−163 °C) and unloading (20 °C) of the LNG. However, plastic deformation of the 1.2 mm-thick corrugated membrane of the LNG CCS has been reported continuously owing to its vulnerability to cryogenic hydrodynamic loads. In the present study, we conducted a parametric analysis to investigate the effects of the corrugation shape as a preliminary study of the primary barrier. Finite element analysis was conducted with a simplified plate to focus on the effects of corrugation. Furthermore, a two-step validation was conducted using the above experimental results to ensure reliability of the structural analysis. The results show that optimizing the corrugation shape could ensure better structural safety than the conventional design.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the carbon neutrality era, firms are facing increasingly intense environmental pressure and market competition. This paper considers two competitive supply chains with consumers’ low-carbon preference under the cap-and-trade regulation, each of which consists of one manufacturer and one retailer. Considering competition or integration in vertical and horizontal directions, four different supply chain structures are modeled. By applying a game-theoretical approach, the equilibrium pricing, carbon emission reduction (CER) level, profit, and social welfare are obtained. Through comparison and analysis, the economic and environmental impacts of supply chain competition are explored. The results show that (1) the carbon quota acts as a kind of financial subsidy and brings direct economic profit to the supply chain, which cannot be used to incentivize the firm to invest in CER technology; (2) the HCVI strategy can bring the highest CER level, the most market demand, and social welfare among the four strategies; (3) for the enterprise and the government, it is recommended to take measures and enact policies to strengthen the vertical integration and horizontal competition between supply chains. Our study can guide firms on how to cope with increasingly fierce industry competition and environmental pressure by adjusting their operational decisions and supply chain structure.</jats:p>"

The line sensitivity is much smaller than any relevant data so far reported. In addition, it has a very low temperature coefficient of 214 ppm/°C over a temperature variation from −50°C to 50°C. The circuit consumes a total power of 588 nW. The reported results are also studied at various process corners and under variable process parameters like oxide thickness and threshold voltage of transistors. A satisfactory behaviour of the circuit is obtained in all cases.

Perceived availability of drugs was reduced during the lockdown, and many PWUD switched to alternative substances when preferred drugs were not available. On average, participants used significantly fewer substances over the course of the study, from 3.5 substances in the preceding 14 days to 2.1 (aOR 0.92; 95% CI 0.90–0.94). Consumption of cannabis products declined significantly (aOR 0.89; 95% CI 0.84–0.95), likewise alcohol (aOR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88–1.0), diverted medicinal methadone (aOR 0.85; 95% CI 0.8–0.9) and diverted medicinal buprenorphine (aOR 0.91; 95% CI 0.84–0.99). PWUD cited fewer contacts with drug dealers, the lack of transportation, and the lack of conventional recreational environment as the main reasons for these changes. When access to sterile injection equipment was limited, PWUD exercised risk-containing injection behaviours, such as buying drugs in pre-filled syringes (aOR 0.88; 95% CI 0.80–0.96). Harm reduction and treatment programs managed to adopt flexible strategies to recover services that were affected during the initial stage of the pandemic.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>COVID-19-related restrictive measures mediated specific changes in supply models and drug-use behaviours.

The IPRV has the functions of developing a pressure-regulating scheme, equipment selection, pressure reduction potential analysis, etc. It can bring convenience to the field test of the water supply network. In the field test, an intelligent pressure-regulating device was used to obtain the network data in the pilot site called S-cell. After utilizing the intelligent management platform to analyze the measured data, the water usage pattern and pressure reduction potential of the S-cell were obtained, and an optimal pressure-regulating strategy was formulated. The water pressure at the critical node always met the water demand at the critical node during the field test. In addition, no complaints were received from other users. The results show that the IPRV is not only convenient for utility managers to make decisions on building pressure-reducing stations, but also meets user needs, realizing a win–win situation for both users and companies.</jats:p>"

While numerous quantitative trait loci for EL have been identified, few causal genes have been studied in detail. Here we report the characterization of ear apical degeneration1 (ead1) exhibiting strikingly shorter ears and the map-based cloning of the casual gene EAD1. EAD1 is preferentially expressed in the xylem of immature ears and encodes an aluminum-activated malate transporter localizing to the plasma membrane. We show that EAD1 is a malate efflux transporter and loss of EAD1 leads to lower malate contents in the apical part of developing inflorescences. Exogenous injections of malate rescued the shortened ears of ead1. These results demonstrate that EAD1 plays essential roles in regulating maize ear development by delivering malate through xylem vessels to the apical part of the immature ear. Overexpression of EAD1 led to greater EL and kernel number per row and the EAD1 genotype showed a positive association with EL in two different genetic segregating populations. Our work elucidates the critical role of EAD1 in malate-mediated female inflorescence development and provides a promising genetic resource for enhancing maize grain yield.</jats:p>",

This study analyses the spatial and temporal variations in key ESs in the Yangtze River Middle Reaches Urban Agglomeration to understand the relationship with human demand. First, the InVEST model is used to quantify the spatial and temporal changes in the key ESs from 2000 to 2019, and a supply–demand index is used to explore the supply–demand relationship at the county scale. Second, ES bundle is applied to analyse the relationships among ESs in different supply–demand balance areas. Finally, different ecological protection scenarios are proposed to simulate the supply–demand relationship in 2040. The results show that (1) the impacts of ecological factors on the ES supply are greater than socioeconomic factors, especially the precipitation and distance from the Yangtze River. (2) Regions of supply–demand imbalance are mainly concentrated in provincial centres and the surrounding cities, especially in the Wuhan city circle. (3) Each ES in regions of balanced supply and demand is well-balanced, and ESs in regions of supply-demand imbalance are dominated by one service. (4) Among the simulated scenarios, the climate regulation protection scenario in 2040 yields the optimal supply–demand result. This study can contribute to future management decision-making regarding the balance between the supply and demand of ecosystem services. </jats:p>",

The manufacturer provides national advertising in the first period to build the brand image and increase the awareness of the product.

The manufacturer and the online retail platform may choose different cooperative advertising strategies for national advertising and platform advertising, which are one-way subsidy strategy, two-way subsidy strategy, and revenue-share strategy. We formulate a Stackelberg game model to study the cooperative advertising problem by taking price and advertising effect into account and analyze how the profit is influenced in different cooperative advertising strategies. We find that under the revenue-share strategy, the manufacturer provides a higher subsidy rate for the online retail platform advertising than that in other cooperative advertising strategies. Interestingly, there are conditions where, while just the manufacturer contributes a percentage of the platform advertising and the online retail platform has no effort on the national advertising, the total profit would be better than that in revenue-share strategy even in revenue-share strategy, the cooperative relationship is closer between the manufacture and the online retail platform.</jats:p>",

The ultimate objective was to explore the alternative source of fresh water supply for the city dwellers–the urban poor. To determine the level of drinking water, a suitability analysis was performed in conjunction with the construction and calculation of a Water Quality Index (WQI) for two distinct seasons: Rainy and Winter. The IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Statistics version: 20 and CAP: version: 5.0.0.465 was used as a means to an end. The study reveals that water quality in sampled UWBs of CMC was found unsuitable (WQI value 237.11) for drinking in the Rainy season and very poor (WQI value 99.62) in the Winter. The eight (8) parameters that crossed the maximum permissible limit in the Rainy and Winter seasons include electrical conductivity (EC), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity and nitrate. The two biological parameters, i.e. total coliform (TC) and fecal coliform (FC) that stood alone in crossing the admissible limit, detected measured values 1100+ MPN- 100 mL−1 in Rainy and Winter seasons, against unit recommended value 50. Awareness building on water pollutants in both public and private sectors is required to improve public health service delivery.</jats:p>",

We propose that a dynamic supply of fuel could help achieve similar performance and reduce the amount of fuel used. The effect of the multiple dynamic fuel inlet rates (0.3 m/s, 0.2 m/s, and 0.1 m/s) was studied numerically using a validated CFD PEMFC model. A transient inlet condition was introduced to replicate the pulsating effect. It was observed that up to 66% of fuel could be conserved (compared to the constant fuel supply condition) while maintaining the stable performance of the PEMFC under conditions of a dynamic fuel profile. A drop of approximately 29% in PEMFC performance was observed under conditions of a low dynamic fuel profile. The results reveal that the concept of dynamic fuel supply can be exploited to sustain the performance of PEMFC and realize a threshold value of performance under conditions of reduced fuel input.</jats:p>",

The details of this important step in the global carbon cycle remain poorly resolved, largely due to the methodological challenges of studying a diverse pool of metabolites that are produced and consumed nearly simultaneously. In this perspective, a new compilation of published data builds on previous studies to obtain an updated estimate of the fraction of marine net primary production that passes through the labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. In agreement with previous studies, our data mining and modeling approaches hypothesize that about half of ocean net primary production is processed through the labile DOC pool. The fractional contributions from three major sources are estimated at 0.4 for living phytoplankton, 0.4 for dead and dying phytoplankton, and 0.2 for heterotrophic microbes and mesoplankton.</jats:p>",

As an important area of food safety research, the rice supply chain has attracted increasing attention. Based on blockchain technology, this study investigated problems of data privacy and circulation efficiency caused by complex rice supply networks, long circulation cycles, and various risk factors in each link. First, we deconstructed the quality and safety of each link of the rice supply chain at the information level and established a key information classification table for each link. On that basis, we built a rice supply chain information supervision model based on blockchain. Various encryption algorithms are used to secure the sensitive data of enterprises in the supply chain to meet regulators’ needs for efficient supervision. Moreover, we propose a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm that scores the credit of enterprise nodes, optimizes the selection strategy of master nodes, and ensures high efficiency and low cost. Then, we built a prototype system based on the open-source framework of hyperledger fabric, analyzed the model’s viability, and implemented the system using cases. The results indicated that the proposed system can optimize the information supervision process of rice supply chain regulators and provide a feasible solution for the quality and safety supervision of grain and oil.</jats:p>",

There is no authoritative answer whether there is a hydraulic connection between shallow and mid-layer water. Therefore, a clear understanding of hydrogeochemical characteristics and the water chemical connection of them is indispensable for groundwater protection and the safety of water supply. The results of the statistical analysis showed that shallow and mid-layer water were both neutral water. The content of SO42−, Cl− and Na+ in both exceeded the grade III standard limit in the Standard for Groundwater Quality of China. Piper diagram revealed shallow water was mainly of Na + Mg + HCO3− and Mg + Na + HCO3− type, and mid-layer water was mainly of Na + Mg + HCO3− + SO42− and Na + Mg + HCO3− type. Besides, using the coefficient variations method of comprehensive water quality index (pH, TDS, F−, and NO3−), it is found that except for a local area with thin thickness (less than 5 m) of the first aquiclude, the mid-layer water was not affected by shallow water in Sulin mining area. This study may be helpful for the safety of water supply in the study area and other mining areas in the Huaibei coalfield.</jats:p>",

The water resource vulnerability indicator in Guiyang ranged from 0.10 to 0.59, with an average value of 0.26. Yanglongsi Town, in Xifeng County, in the northern and main central urban area exhibited the highest water resource vulnerability, whereas Huaxi District in the south, and regions around Hongfeng Lake and Baihua Lake, in Qingzhen City, exhibited the lowest water resource vulnerability. Water resource vulnerability was predominantly mild, accounting for 35.85% of the total land area, followed by moderate (28.99%), with some non-vulnerable areas (13.60%) and very few extremely vulnerable areas (3.20%). Compared with traditional methods, the proposed index selection and assessment methods, based on GIS/RS, are both scientific and intuitive.

As is found in two oxidation states and most chemical tests for inorganic arsenic are focused on As(III), and few have been developed for As(V). We developed the simple analytical method for determining As(V) concentrations in groundwater using CeO2NPs and fluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNA. Prior to sample measurements, we investigated the key operational parameters that affect the sensing performance. The optimal CeO2NPs final concentration, FAM-labeled DNA final concentration, the sequence and length of FAM-labeled DNA, and incubation time were 15 μg/mL, 400 nM, 6-mer poly-cytosine sequence, and 6 min, respectively. After optimizing the parameters, the total analysis time was about 20 min and the limit of detection was 0.61 μM. This method has a high selectivity against the same concentrations of Cu(II), Cd(II), Hg(II) and Pb(II). Pretreatment by cation extraction to remove interfering ions was beneficial for determination of As(V) concentrations in groundwater containing a variety of metal cations at high concentration. We could determine As(V) concentration in groundwater. Modification of the reactions of the method is necessary. This study provides the first step in the development of a simple method for on-site As(V) analysis.</jats:p>",

Firstly, decision criteria are defined by literature research and expert group opinions. Secondly, the importance weights of these criteria are obtained by IF Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (IFDEMATEL). Followingly, the most suitable supplier is assessed by IF Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (IFTOPSIS). In the fourth stage, Sensitivity Analysis is utilized to analyze the effect of differentiation in criterion. Lastly, a comparative analysis is carried out. The results of the study has pointed that “Price” is the most important criterion in supplier selection and “Supplier 4” is the best alternative for this case. Main contribution of this study is to integrate IFDEMATEL-IFTOPSIS method for the first time in automotive supplier selection literature and propose a specific decision framework.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the advancement of urbanisation, the inflow of population in China’s large cities has been increasing and the demand for rental housing of “new citizens” with insufficient housing affordability has become increasingly strong. Therefore, the Chinese government proposes to provide government-subsidized rental housing (GSRH) different from public rental housing. At present, the supply mode of public rental housing in China is mainly government construction and operation, which has the problems of low supply efficiency and low service level. It is critical to explore an efficient supply model in the construction of the GSRH system. Therefore, this study, starting from the three supply subjects of government, market, and society, constructs an evolutionary game model and uses agent-based modelling simulation to explore how multisubjects achieve optimal collaboration in the supply process of GSRH. The results are as follows: First, the development of a collaborative supply system includes four stages: noncooperative behaviour, collaborative exploration, collaborative game, and three-subject collaborative supply. Second, the government is the core of realising multisubject coordination. Increasing government supervision will boost market participation, while increasing government subsidies can fully mobilise the enthusiasm of social subjects but cannot continuously improve the market’s enthusiasm. Third, increasing the participation ratio of social subjects will help mobilise the enthusiasm of other subjects to participate, while the excessive participation ratio of market subjects may cause an imbalance in the collaborative supply system. This study provides theoretical support for the efficient supply of GSRH.</jats:p>",

The ship analyzed in this work is a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV) used to support oil and gas offshore platforms transporting goods, equipment, and personnel. The proposed scheme considers the ship’s retrofitting. The ship’s original main generators are maintained, and the fuel cell and batteries are installed as complementary sources. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is pursued on the ship’s demand curve. The simulations used to calculate the CO2 emissions for each of the new hybrid configurations were developed using HOMER software. The proposed solutions are auxiliary generators, three types of batteries, and a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) with different sizes of hydrogen tanks. The PEMFC and batteries were sized as containerized solutions, and the sizing of the auxiliary engines was based on previous works. Each configuration consists of a combination of these solutions. The selection of the best configuration is one contribution of this paper. The new configurations are classified according to the reduction of CO2 emitted in comparison to the original system. For different demand levels, the results indicate that the configuration classification may vary. Another valuable contribution of this work is the sizing of the battery and hydrogen storage systems. They were installed in 20 ft containers, since the installation of batteries, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks in containers is widely used for ship retrofit. As a result, the most significant reduction of CO2 emissions is 10.69%. This is achieved when the configuration includes main generators, auxiliary generators, a 3,119 kW lithium nickel manganese cobalt (LNMC) battery, a 250 kW PEMFC, and 581 kg of stored hydrogen.</jats:p>"

Since the reservoir inflow is not measured directly but calculated based on the observed reservoir stage and the reservoir outflow, it always contains gross errors causing some inflow to be outliers. In this study, a robust error estimation method for real-time flood forecasting has been developed for reservoirs’ data processing. The method differs from the conventional flood forecasting method, in that it represses the gross errors by a robust loss function based on the real error distribution of measurements. Furthermore, a fluctuation coefficient has been proposed to quantify the degree of fluctuation of a jagged reservoir inflow. The performance of the method is evaluated by both synthetic data and real cases. By using floods generated synthetically by an ideal model in which the true values and errors are known, the method is shown to be efficient as theoretically expected. The results show that the method is efficient and universally applicable in different cases. And the degree of forecast improvement is positively related to the fluctuation coefficient of the floods. The more severe the fluctuation of the flood hydrograph, the more robust the method.</jats:p>",

The sustainable provision of FES has the potential to provide responses to major societal challenges, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, or rural development. To identify suitable strategies for the future sustenance of FES, we performed a solution scanning exercise with a group of transdisciplinary forest and FES experts from different European regions. We identified and prioritized fifteen major challenges hindering the balanced provision of multiple FES and identified a series of potential solutions to tackle each of them. The most prominent challenges referred to the increased frequency and impacts of extreme weather events and the normative mindset regarding forest management. The respective solutions pointed to the promotion of forest resilience via climate-smart forestry and mainstreaming FES-oriented management through a threefold strategy focusing on education, awareness raising, and networking. In a subsequent survey, most solutions were assessed as highly effective, transferable, monitorable, and with potential for being economically efficient. The implementation of the solutions could have synergistic effects when applying the notion of leverage points. Seven emerging pathways towards the sustainable supply of FES have been identified. These pathways build on each other and are organized based on their potential for transformation: (1) shifting forest management paradigms towards pluralistic ecosystem valuation; (2) using integrated landscape approaches; (3) increasing forest resilience; (4) coordinating actions between forest-related actors; (5) increasing participation in forest planning and management; (6) continuous, open, and transparent knowledge integration; and (7) using incentive-based instruments to support regulating and cultural FES. These pathways can contribute to the implementation of the new EU Forestry Strategy to support the balanced supply of multiple FES.</jats:p>\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphical abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>",

Using the theory and the Stackelberg game method, we derive the equilibrium decision of diverse government subsidy models on the carbon emission reduction efforts and marketing efforts of supply chain members when manufacturers are dominant. We found that government subsidies positively influenced the carbon emission reduction efforts and marketing efforts of supply chain members and could increase the overall profit of the supply chain and the overall welfare of society. Meanwhile, social welfare increased first and then decreased with the subsidy, and there was a maximum value. Within a certain threshold, when the market demand was sensitive to carbon emission reduction efforts, it was more beneficial to subsidize manufacturers, and when it was sensitive to marketing efforts, subsidizing retailers was more beneficial. Regardless of the subsidy situation, an optimal subsidy rate exists among supply chain members. Meanwhile, adjusting government subsidy measures can decrease the profit gap between supply chain members, and it provides potential possibilities for cooperation among supply chain members.</jats:p>"

Since grain cultivation consumes tremendous amounts of water, the inter-regional grain trade causes virtual water flow, increasing water stress in certain water-scarce regions. As the second-longest river in China, the Yellow River bears increasingly severe water stress. Considering water and food security, this study proposes a spatial equilibrium model (SEM) that combines partial equilibrium theory and transport models to maximize net social revenue and to balance grain supply and demand, thereby optimizing inter-regional grain trade to relieve water stress. According to different natural, technical and social conditions, we conceived five scenarios to predict regional water stress characterized with different water supplies, demographic structures, food demand compositions and water-saving technologies. Our simulation results suggest that the developed SEM can realize spatial equilibrium of food and water resources within the Basin, which is capable of resolving the problem of food demands in regions with varying extents (13%–55%), optimizing inter-regional grain trade and mitigating water stress. Finally, we recommend some constructive policies for different scenarios to relieve water stress.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the generation of a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW) has threatened the public environment and human health. The inefficient supply chain of CDW resource utilization hinders the green development of countries around the world, including China. This study aims to reveal the impact of information sharing regarding recyclers’ market demand forecast on the performance of CDW resource utilization supply chains. Therefore, this paper uses the incomplete information dynamic game method to establish and solve the decision-making model of the construction and demolition waste resource utilization supply chain under the conditions of recyclers sharing and not sharing their information. The paper then obtains the Bayesian equilibrium solution and the optimal expected profit for each party. Finally, a numerical simulation was used in order to verify the validity of the model and conclusions. The main conclusions are as follows. In the CDW resource utilization supply chain, if the recycler is more pessimistic about the market’s demand forecast, their information sharing makes the remanufacturer more motivated to improve their level of environmental responsibility. In addition, information sharing by recyclers is always beneficial in increasing the profit of the remanufacturer, but it also may make the recycler lose profit. When the efficiency of the environmental responsibility investment of remanufacturers is in a high range, information sharing increases the profits of recyclers. Conversely, information sharing has no significant effect on the profits of recyclers. The impact on the profits of the entire CDW resource utilization supply chain depends on the intensity of competition among channels, the market share of offline recycling channels and the efficiency of environmental responsibility investments.</jats:p>"

These components are to be maintained at a certain standard to boost the electricity supply power of a distribution network. The shunt capacitor placement technique is applied to achieve a sustainable electric power supply. The issue of power loss has been a major threat to the distribution network. A distribution network is expected to operate at a certain voltage level to meet consumers’ energy demand. Power flow studies have been conducted using Newton Raphson’s technique on the 30 bus, 11 kV Onuiyi-Nsukka distribution network. It was found that the voltage profile on buses 19 and 26 was critically violated with voltage amplitudes of 0.72 pu and 0.79 pu respectively. The feeder power quality was improved using a shunt capacitor placement technique and the installation of a 1200KVAr shunt capacitor to keep bus voltage amplitudes within the legal limit of (0.95-1.05) pu. The voltage profile, active and reactive power losses on the network were determined. Active power loss and reactive power loss are reduced from 0.27MW to 0.12MW and 0.76Mvar to 0.14Mvar, respectively. Therefore, the distribution network voltage profile is improved and the power loss on the network significantly reduced.</jats:p>",

Produced mostly from human blood, PDMPs production follows strict procedures for biological safety and traceability. It comes to albumin, immunoglobulins, coagulating fractions, antiprotease fractions as well as biological glues.  Resources and procedures: Our study aimed to define PDMPs management in Morocco, as well as their biological safety procedures, while specifying constraints related to their supply and traceability.  Results and discussion: Moroccan market supply by PDMPs is ensured by the National Blood Transfusion Center (NBTC) that shipments Moroccan collected plasma to the French Laboratory of Fractionation and Biotechnology (LFB). The latter produces PDMPs for the Moroccan market under an agreement signed in 1999 and PDMPs prices are fixed by a decree of the Ministry of Health. PDMPs production follows strict procedures for biological safety and traceability from blood donations collection to administration in patients, allowing their routes to be retraced in case of hemovigilance or pharmacovigilance alerts. In Morocco, only two traceability labels are provided on the primary packaging of PDMPs, unlike in some other countries where PDMPs are provided with three sticky labels, all essential for mastering products traceability. PDMPs shortages are due to insufficient amount of plasma sent to LFB, which is aggravated in case of batch recall.  Conclusion:PDMPs are indicated to support critical patients, which imply mastering biological safety and traceability from production to delivery, and optimizing their supply in order to ensure their availability by emergency times.</jats:p>"

The voltage and frequency of the line side converter are controlled with indirect vector control with droop characteristics. The setting of frequencies varies according to the battery energy level, which slows down when the battery is charged or discharged. The system can also work if the wind power source is not available. An Intelligent      Power Management System (IPMS) is developed to handle various changes in power supply and power demand by managing erratic power and providing a suitable control algorithm for the whole system. In order to test various power supply and power demand using a power system. The performed simulations confirm the ability of the IPMS to satisfy the load at all times using solar and wind power (which are unsteady renewables), through the support of batteries"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new multilayer inverter topology is proposed in this study. The cascaded feature is used in this innovative topology. In addition to the isolated DC sources seen in Cascaded H-bridge. The clamping diode in Diode and the multilevel inverter (CHB-MLI) Inverter with Clamped Multilevel (DC-MLI). With these advantages, an inverter topology with 18 total component counts when coupled had been discovered. This proposed topology has the potential to generate up to According to the ratio allocated to its DC sources, there are 17 output levels. Aside from increasing the number of output voltage levels, this study has a relatively low number of component counts. The THD limit defined by IEEE standard is also a goal (i.e. 5 percent) all voltage applications under 69kV.To ensure that the suggested topology is functional, it is being simulated in Matlab/Simulink with various modulation indexes. The amount of THD, the number of voltage outputs, and the RMS voltage are all being monitored and discussed. Finally, to assess the uniqueness of the suggested topology, a comparison study with recently disclosed topologies is being carried out.</jats:p>"
