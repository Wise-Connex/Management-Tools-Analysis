In this paper, the literature of approaches, techniques and criteria for SC performance evaluation are reviewed. For this reason, related works appeared in the international journals from 1998 to 2010 are gathered and analyzed. The paper attempts to response the following four questions: (I) Which SC approaches were prevalently applied? (II) Which techniques were used to facilitate the performance measurement? (III) Which evaluation criteria were paid more attention? The result of this review is contributed in recommendation of some possible future work. The other objective of this research is to aid the researchers and practitioners in applying the approaches, techniques and criteria effectively.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n2p94-113URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n2p94-113</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper explores the semiconductor industry and its supply chain characteristics in order to aid understanding of its overall trajectory. How can a country like Brazil produce such an insignificant amount of semiconductor components? What has led the country to this situation? The objectives of this paper are twofold: first, to describe the semiconductor supply chain in order to understand its majors elements; and second, to delineate the trajectory of this industry. More specifically, we draw on evolutionary theory to analyze three macro trajectories: economic, governmental and technological. We collected archival data about these macro drivers and conducted interviews with professors and professionals in the semiconductor field. The results show four major events in the trajectory of the Brazilian semiconductor industry: (i) investment in microelectronic laboratories; (ii) a policy of market protection; (iii) a policy of market openness to product imports: and (iv) public policies to help the development of semiconductor companies through incentives.Â DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n2p20-39URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n2p20-39</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Firms must be agile for the reason that being responsive is a crucial competency for them in present global economy. Organizations that are agile happen to be more successful. The agility of an organization is dependent on the agility of its supply chain. The main aim of this paper is to give a new dimension in explaining how Trust, Information Technology (IT) and agility can create sustained competitive advantage for firms and develop an integrated framework to facilitate this. For the literature review of the related academic articles for the previous studies has been taken by international journals in Logistics, Supply Chain Management and Operations Management. Achievement of supply chain agility (SCA) is linked to the other organizationâs resources, namely trust, IT and firm performance that play mediator role between them. IT is considered as a competitive tool by researchers and practitioners. Therefore, it is crucial for managers to apply their firms' IT and trust as lower-order organizational capabilities to improve agility as a higher-order organizational capability. Hence, the current article gives a conceptual framework to ascertain factors which affect SCA and finally firm performance. The findings of this study will present interesting information and insight about how to improve agility in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Moreover, the information presented in this study will be the foundation of future supply chain capability studies. To aid the study, this present study for develop the framework has been used the RBV theory. The paper also proposes the framework for future research in empirical investigation in companies. The study related the gap by developing a framework for measuring SCA, which enables any organization to identify critical success factors for sense and respond to market.Â </jats:p>"

It examines if supply risks, supplier relationship management capability, and endâcustomer orientation of supply management function are connected to the green supply management practices of a firm. These connections are studied using a survey data of 165 firms collected in Finland. The results of regression analysis show that the protection of a firm's reputation is highly related to the level of green supply management; consumer awareness of green requirements puts strong pressure on a firm's supply management to meet the endâcustomers' expectations, and the high the level of supplier relationship management capability in firms increases the adoption of green supply management. Furthermore, it finds that larger firms exploit green supply management practices more than the smaller ones, and green purchasing activities are not applied in highâvolumeâbuying Finnish companies.

The technological development made them actual miniature computers with significant computing capability and many diverse functions, which earned them the name âsmartphonesâ. They create new possibilities of application, also in business environments. As it turns out, already today smartphones are the most popular mobile devices used in supply chain management. Surely, as versatile and multi-functional devices, they will gain even larger share in the implementation of business tasks in the foreseeable future. The purpose of this paper is to describe the potential areas in supply chain management smartphones can be used in, compared to the current trends. The specified examples of application will be used to draw conclusions regarding the expected effects of use and most promising areas of implementation. These deliberations will be put in a wider social context, which is inevitable if we are to treat the consumer as the last link in the supply chain which, owing to the reported demand, is becoming a causative factor in all flows of goods.</jats:p>"

The current study aims to shed further light on harvesting decisions of private forest owners, by investigating optimal harvesting under uncertainty, when timber revenues are invested on financial markets and uncertainty is mitigated by news releases. By distinguishing between aggregate economic risk and sector specific risks, the model studies in great detail optimal harvesting-investment decisions, with particular emphasis on the non-trivial transmission of risk on optimal harvesting, and on the way private forest owners react to news and information. The analysis of the role played by information in harvesting decisions is a novelty in forest economic theory. The presented model is highly relevant from a policyâinformation is a commonly used forest policy instrumentâas well as a practical perspective, since the mechanism of risk transmission is at the basis of timber pricing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many manufacturing companies are facing uncertainties and stiff competition both locally and globally, intensified by increasing needs for sophisticated and high value products from demanding customers. These companies are forced to improve the quality of their supply chain management decisions, products and reduce their manufacturing costs. With todayâs volatile and very challenging global market, many manufacturing companies have started to realize the importance of the proper managing of their supply chains. Supply chain management (SCM) involves practices such as strategic supplier partnership, customer focus, lean production, postpone concept and technology &amp; innovation. This study investigates the importance of SCM on financial optimization. The study measures production or SCM managersâ perceptions regarding SCM and level of performances in their companies. The paper also specifically investigates whether supply chain performance acts as a mediating variable in the relationship between SCM and financial optimization. These associations were analyzed through statistical methods such as Pearsonâs correlation and a regression-based mediated analysis. The findings suggest that SCM has significant correlations with supply chain performance and financial optimization. In addition, the result of the regression-based mediated analysis demonstrates that supply chain performance mediates the linkage between SCM and financial optimization. The findings of the study provide a striking demonstration of the importance of SCM in enhancing the performances of Malaysian manufacturing companies. The result indicates that manufac-turing companies should emphasize greater management support for SCM implementation and a greater degree of attention for production integration and information flow integration in the manufacturing system in order to maximize profit and tzerimize cost.</jats:p>"

The efficient transport networking systems are determinant attribute towards container terminal in providing excellent services to their client. The paper focuses on the metamorphosis of the terminal efficiency and container movements at 6 major container terminals in Peninsular Malaysia. The aim is to measure efficiency of container terminals that contributes significant economic development for a nation. Non parametric approach under frontier method is used to analyse panel data from 2003 to 2010 in relation with container terminal equipments and throughput. The result shows no significant relationship between container terminal size and efficiency. Thus, efficiency is determined from allocation of resources efficiently by terminal operators and not by size of terminals.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n2p1-19URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n2p1-19</jats:p>"

FFM is a novel method of stabilizing water pretreatment designed to be free of the disadvantages of conventional methods of water scaling potential reduction which require expensive equipment, produce significant amounts of waste, have high reagent consumption or are strongly dependent on water composition. FFM was derived from anion exchange resin modified with phosphonate and polymer scale inhibitors. In order to choose the most suitable anion exchange resin for preparation of FFM, different types of resins were tested for sorption of phosphonate compounds. The effect of the anionic composition of water and the effect of the polymer inhibitor on the rate of phosphonate release were investigated. Finally, FFM was tested as a scaling reduction water treatment for a water heating process with heating coils and as a pretreatment before reaching the RO unit. In both cases the results obtained show great promise for the functionalized material in antiscaling water pretreatment.</jats:p>",

However, the characteristics of the technology allow for unconventional usage and subsequent supply chain support requirements. Therefore, it can be argued that the RM supply chain concepts have the potential room for further evolution. This research focuses on the possibility and structure of a business model tailored for the unconventional RM supply chain requirements. In this regard, the paper proposes the Virtual Trading System or VTS, which is an e-business platform that could potentially provide an alternative to the RM industry, in terms of supply chain functionality. The research outlines the structure of such a business model in detail, based on the requirements of the RM industry.</jats:p>",

Diese sollten bei der RisikoabwÃ¤gung mit berÃ¼cksichtigt werden, da sie sich unmittelbar und stark auf das Unternehmensergebnis auswirken kÃ¶nnen. Der folgende Beitrag gibt einen systematischen Ãberblick Ã¼ber finanzielle Risiken der Lagerhaltung sowie zugehÃ¶rige GegenmaÃnahmen.</jats:p>",

The possible <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> remediation of leaks while a pipeline is in service could reduce leaking at costs orders of magnitude lower than conventional pipe repair, rehabilitation, or replacement. Experiences of Roman engineers and recent field observations suggest that such processes can occur naturally or may even be engineered to ameliorate leaks, including those caused by metallic corrosion. Three mechanisms of <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> leak remediation (i.e., metallic corrosion, physical clogging, and precipitation) are described in this paper, in an effort to understand the role of physical factors (e.g., temperature, pressure, and leak size) and water chemistry (e.g., pH, alkalinity, corrosion inhibitors, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity) in controlling <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> remediation for both inert (plastic and aged concrete) and chemically reactive (new concrete, copper, and iron) pipe materials. Although there are possible limitations and uncertainties with the phenomenon, including the fraction of pipeline leaks to which it might apply and the durability/longevity of remediation, such approaches may prove useful in economically sustaining some aging drinking water infrastructure assets and reducing future failure rates.</jats:p>",

Retailers have been particularly active in setting food safety and quality systems for the development of their private labels. The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects of introducing measures that guarantee the environmental sustainability of food production on vertical dyadic relations. We focus our attention on the adoption of integrated pest management (IPM) systems that are designed by retailers to support private label products, with the aim of studying how these systems affect the governance structure of transactions between retailer and farmer/processor. Transaction cost analysis is used as theoretical framework to assess changes in vertical coordination after the adoption of an IPM system. Four case studies related to food retailers in Italy were analyzed to identify changes in transaction characteristics, costs, and governance that are related to the adoption of this system. The results show that the introduction of an IPM system leads to an increase of transaction asset specificity (i.e., especially of human and material asset specificity) among the agents of the supply chain, and a decrease of the degree of transaction uncertainty. The variations in transaction characteristics determine changes in transaction costs. These changes lead to new hybrid forms of transaction governance, namely dyadic contracts, and a centralized organization of vertical relationships.</jats:p>"

Moreover, inflationary pressure gets more momentum when money supply and budget deficits both increase together. The empirical evidence of Nepal also supports this hypothesis. Present paper re-examines this issue in the context of Nepal by using econometric analysis. The empirical results reveal that long run inflation is not only related with higher money supply but also to budget deficit. On the one hand, there is unidirectional causal relationship between money supply with inflation and similarly budget deficit with inflation. On the other, the supply of money has no causal connection with budget deficit. Hence the finding implies that both monetary and fiscal policies are important to control inflation in Nepal.</jats:p>"

Nonetheless, as sophisticated as these methods are, they all suffer from the same deficiency: they only consider the past. While the past is indeed a statistically significant indicator of what will happen in the future, it isnt the only indicator. In multi-echelon supply chain systems, there exists a plethora of highly relevant data that can be tapped into.We have built an Arena model to simulate our manufacturing plants supply chain. As we go forward, we will explain how this model was used to explore the significance of various external data sources such as DC and store inventory levels, open orders, and lead times. Using these findings, we derive a regression-based forecasting algorithm that improves accuracy by 35 percent. More accurate forecasts allow our company to maintain a higher service level, lower safety stock, and a more predictable transportation schedule, all of which lead to significant cost savings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Sediments are fundamental for the functioning of oligotrophic coral reef ecosystems, because they are major places for organic matter recycling. In Tayrona National Natural Park (TNNP), Colombian Caribbean, located between the population center Santa Marta (&gt;455 000 inhabitants) in the southwest and several river mouths in the east, coral reef sediments experience pronounced changes in environmental conditions due to seasonal coastal upwelling, but knowledge on relevant spatiotemporal effects on organic matter supply to sediments and recycling processes is not available. Therefore, sediment traps were monthly deployed over 14 months complemented by assessment of sedimentary properties and sedimentary O2 demand (SOD) at water current-exposed and -sheltered sites along distance gradients (12â20 km) to Santa Marta and the eastern river mouths (17â27 km). Findings revealed that seasonal upwelling delivered strong (75â79% of annual supply) pulses of labile organic matter mainly composed of fresh phytoplankton detritus (C : N ratio 6â8) to the seafloor. Sedimentary chlorophyll contents and SOD increased significantly with decreasing distance to the eastern rivers, but only during upwelling. This suggests sedimentary organic matter supply control by nutrient-enriched upwelling waters and riverine runoff rather than by the countercurrent-located city of Santa Marta. Organic matter pulses caused C turnover rates of 4.4% hâ1 that were more than 2-fold higher at water current-exposed compared to -sheltered sites. This indicates intense advective pore water exchange and ensuing rapid recycling of the supplied labile organic matter, particularly in the highly permeable water current-exposed silicate reef sands.\n                        </jats:p>"

This paper introduces the integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) model combined with a supply chain and a controlling system, along with its efficiency for alleviating the negative effects of delays caused by a lack of materials on construction sites. So, firstly the concept of feed-forward control is discussed as a prevention feature in a monitoring system. Then the integrating BIM model with a supply chain is introduced. Finally this case study has shown how the enhanced BIM model can incorporate the feed-forward control in order to decrease the risks of delays caused by a lack of materials in construction. Moreover, this case study might be used as a decision support system for managers to prevent a construction site from future delays by providing valuable information about the required materials in advanced</jats:p>",

Expected value and variability of supply lead time depend on the transportation means adopted, and influence the optimal values of order quantity, reorder level, and safety stock to be adopted. Fast transportation means allow reducing expected value of the lead time; they are characterized by the highest costs of externalities (i.e. air pollutant emission, noise, congestion, accidents). On the contrary, slow transportation means require high inventory level due to large order quantity; in this case costs of externalities tend to decrease. The Sustainable Order Quantity (SOQ) [1] allows identifying optimal order quantity, reorder level, safety stock as well as transportation means which minimize the sum of the logistic and environmental costs in case of stochastic variability of product demand. In this paper, the authors propose a new SOQ analytical model considering stochastic variability of supply lead time (LT). A solution procedure is suggested for solving the proposed model. The approach is applied to a real industrial case study in order to evaluate the benefits of applying it if compared with the traditional one.</jats:p>",

The power supply and storage capacity indexes of a Local Autonomy Control Region (LACR), which consists of DGs, ESSs and the network, are proposed in this paper to quantify the power regulating range of a LACR. DG/ESS and the network are considered as a whole in the model of the indexes, considering both network constraints and power constraints of the DG/ESS. The index quantifies the maximum LACR power supplied to or received from ADN lines. Similarly, power supply and storage capacity indexes of the ADN line are also proposed to quantify the maximum power exchanged between ADN lines. Then a practical algorithm to calculate the indexes is presented, and an operation optimization model is proposed based on the indexes to maximum the economic benefit of DG/ESS. In the optimization model, the power supply reliability of the ADN line is also considered. Finally, the indexes of power supply and storage capacity and the optimization are demonstrated in a case study.</jats:p>"

From a general point of view cooperation enables for small companies to realize orders that are too large for an individual producer, but contract negotiations, further scheduling and support of production are usually too difficult and complicated. This paper presents a proposition of an information system, that should make cooperation between companies more available. Such system should be distributed among cooperating producers, what is the reason for choosing of the agent technology as the main software paradigm. This system should also support interchanging of information in many norms and technical standards, what results in the use of ontology concerning metallurgy and heavy industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study provides managerial insight to pursue Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) or Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy for both the retailer and manufacturer under different supply chain settings. Discrete event simulation is used to investigate the cost benefits of CPFR and VMI strategies over Traditional Supply Chain (TSC) in a variable demand environment. The conceptual model is a two-echelon production-inventory system with a manufacturer and a retailer. The results from this study suggest that when compared to TSC, both VMI and CPFR achieve cost benefits in inventory management for both the manufacturer and retailer. Under most supply chain settings, higher cost benefits are achieved in CPFR compared to VMI. Also, CPFR achieves higher cost benefits when demand variability is high, production capacity is low, backorder penalty cost is high and delivery lead time is long. However, when production capacity is high and delivery lead time is short, the cost benefits of CPFR and VMI are significantly lower.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n2p59-73URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n2p59-73</jats:p>"

However, data is a double-bladed sword. Inappropriate access or use of data by the recipients may pose serious privacy issues that explicitly harm the data owners. In the past decade, swiftly increasing privacy concerns arise in many business processes such as supply chain management. How to protect the private information of different participants in the supply chain has become a key multidisciplinary research problem in information systems, production and operations management, computer science, and mathematics. Specifically, in the real world, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers commonly collaborate with each other to cater to the demands of supplying and marketing. In their traditional cooperation, all the parties completely share their proprietary information so as to jointly optimize their operations (e.g., maximize their profit or minimize their cost). Now, they realize that completely sharing such information would bring considerable negative impact to themselves. For overcoming this, some recent research results begin to make the following ideal occasion possibleâall the participants collaboratively solve a realistic problem without revealing any private proprietary information to each other.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, we primarily review the literature on the applications of privacy-preserving techniques to supply chain collaboration among multiple parties. We first identify various private proprietary information required in the supply chain collaboration, and discuss several potential privacy-preserving techniques. Then, we review the relevant research results from theory to applications. Since intensive collaboration in modern supply chains opens even more opportunities in both academia and industry, we finally outline the future research trend and the potential challenges in this promising area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last years, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become an important component of business activities for many companies in the world. Much attention has been devoted considering also supply chain perspective. Multinational corporations are not only responsible for sound environmental and social practices within their own premises, but increasingly also for sustainable performance of their suppliers, and ultimately for the entire supply chain which they lead as channel leaders. That is why, large buyers have recently come under pressure to increase monitoring ofÂ  suppliers' behaviours to bolster CSR compliance. This paper aims to presentÂ  a conceptual framework for analyzing the Sustainable Procurement practicesÂ  in global supply chains. An important aspect of implementing such supply chain CSR initiatives involves achieving supplier compliance. It also seeks to demonstrate how a specific consortium of Large European Telecommunications Companies, implements and manages together CSR practices, integrating social and environmental aspects at its suppliers based in Asia. This cooperation is an opportunity for members to collectively work on issues of common concern to find industry-wide solutions, aimed at jointlyÂ  auditing suppliers in developing countries on sustainable sourcing. The information collected and conclusions reached offer strategies for advancing CSR beyond the superficial and often ineffectual 'code of conduct' stage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Malaysia, the issue of financing gap in Small Medium Enterprise (SME) financing is common, but hardly discussed nor researched. The issue of financing gap or lacuna arises due to the mismatch between the demand and supply of institutional funds for SMEs. SMEs contend that finance for SMEs are abundant, however, the supply of bank financing is largely unavailable to them. Banks, on the other hand, maintain that lending to these SMEs remains low because of lack of qualified demand. This brought to the forefront the issue of financing lacuna; a perennial issue in many developing countries, including Malaysia. The objective of this paper is to discuss the financing lacuna in Malaysian SMEs, focussing on the supply side. This paper focuses on the supply perspective to fulfil the research gap in understanding the financing lacuna, which has often been overlooked due to the tendency to analyse financing lacuna from the demand side only. This has been based on surveyed data of SME entrepreneurs. This paper outlines the theoretical approaches and practices of SMEs financing in Malaysia, followed by an analysis of the factors that shaped the financing lacuna (gap).</jats:p>"

It is a standby UPS whereas if the main power source fails to supply power to loads, a battery powered inverter turns on to continue supplying power. The battery is charged by the PV using solar charger and transfer switch controlled by the microcontroller. The UPS was tested to a load of 240 V, 20 W AC aquarium water pump. The test result shows that the UPS perform well, when the main power source fails, the battery could power inverter and the microcontroller controls the transfer switch of the UPS inverter and the main power source.</jats:p>"

The article is based on a survey conducted among light vehicle manufacturers in South Africa with origins in Asia and Europe. Semi-structured interview questionnaire was used based on purposive sampling technique and the data was analysed using SPSS. The findings revealed that quality, final product delivery reliability and cost were highly rated and the most important indicators for the South African automotive market. Innovation (radical and incremental changes) was the least important among the indicators sampled. The article further revealed that there is a perceived difference on the importance of supply chain indicators between manufacturers of Asian and European origins. Final product delivery reliability and order delivery lead time tended to be more important to European manufacturers compared to Asian manufacturers. The article attests to the fact that competitiveness in cost, quality and product offerings are paramount to automotive manufacturers in todays turbulent environment. It also reveals key competitive criteria used by European and Asian manufacturers based in South Africa. The article contributes to literature on SCM and reveals the way in which vehicle manufacturers in South Africa do business.</jats:p>"

Associated with the different climate over the two regions, great discrepancies appear in the annual cycles of the moisture supply. Stationary moisture transport dominates externally imported moisture to a large extent, with transient transport being much weaker. The stationary moisture sink over southeast China is strong during spring and summer due to strong moisture input via the southern boundary and weak during fall and winter due to the offset between the output via the southern boundary and the net zonal boundary atmospheric flux. Zonal stationary moisture transport dominates the variation in moisture supply over southwest China. Negative net zonal boundary atmospheric flux countervails (collaborates) with positive meridional transport during the dry (wet) season.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Stationary moisture circulations dominate regional atmospheric moisture convergence anomalies over both southeast and southwest China. Weak cold air activity is favorable for a strong moisture sink over southeast China, while the reverse appears over southwest China in spring. The east-to-west location of the abnormal anticyclone determines whether strong moisture converges over southeast China or southwest China in fall. The anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the Philippine Sea, remotely forced by El NiÃ±o, is crucial to the strong moisture sink over southeast China from winter to spring, while it does not play a role in the abnormal moisture sink over southwest China.</jats:p>",

In this paper, Great Northern Wilderness beef cattle industry in Heilongjiang province is taken as an example for large-scale biogas electricity generation project. The supply and demand of funds in project operation are analyzed quantitatively by using system dynamics theory so as to do study and perform optimal analysis comprehensively on the economics of biogas project, and to explore the effective scheme of improving the proportion of income against cost. This study can provide scientific guidance for evaluating the construction and operation of large and medium-scale biogas project objectively and lay a solid theoretical foundation for the commercial operation in biogas industry.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lithium ion batteries are utilized in a range of applications including grid support and powering consumer electronics, medical devices, and electric vehicles. Advocacy for, as well as public and private investment in hybrid cars and electric vehicles has resulted in a surge in research and development (R&amp;D) to create more powerful and cost effective lithium ion batteries. This high level of interest has also led to rapid expansion of battery manufacture capacity and has resulted in the over-capacity and fragmentation of the industry. Due to the disjointed quality of the lithium-ion battery industry, opportunities for collaboration and growth, resulting from numerous innovations throughout the supply chain, are overlooked. [1] Although range anxiety is often portrayed as the primary reason electric vehicle adoption is not growing more rapidly by the general population, the cost of vehicles is actually the larger issue. At present, the battery pack is the highest cost component driving the price of EVs. A year-long study was conducted by NextEnergy to obtain a better understanding of the size, scope, and supply chain dynamics of the lithium ion battery and next-generation energy storage systems industries. One major objective of the study was to better understand and define areas of opportunity for cost reduction, the results of which are presented in this paper.</jats:p>"

Batch experiments were conducted to examine MS2 sorption to pyrophyllite. The influence of fluoride, a groundwater contaminant, on the removal of MS2 was also observed. Column experiments were performed with pyrophyllite to examine MS2 removal in the absence and presence of fluoride. Batch results demonstrated that pyrophyllite was effective in MS2 removal. The percentage removal of MS2 increased from 5.26% to 99.99% (4.0 log removal) with increasing pyrophyllite concentrations from 0.2 to 20 g/L. At fluoride concentrations of 5 and 10 mg/L, the log removals of MS2 by pyrophyllite were 3.05 and 2.54, respectively, which were lower than that with no fluoride present. The results suggested that the removal of MS2 by pyrophyllite was influenced by fluoride ions because fluoride ions could compete with MS2 for sorption sites on the pyrophyllite surfaces. Column results showed that pyrophyllite was effective in MS2 removal under flow-through conditions, with a removal capacity of 8.17 Ã 106pfu/g with no fluoride present and 4.70 Ã 106pfu/g with 5 mg/L fluoride present.</jats:p>",

In contrast, a lack of trust between them often increases transaction costs and results in inefficiency. The results of this research, based on multi-country surveys with 729 returns from France, Hungary, Korea, Tunisia and the United States on supply chain professionals, reveals a strong affect of transaction cost constructs (TCC) (asset specificity and behavioral uncertainty) and social exchange constructs (SEC) (replaceability, perceived satisfaction, partner reputation, and perceived conflict) on trust-commitment variables in partnership based supply chain relationships. This paper employed a structural equation model to extract information from the survey data. Among the findings, the research indicates that a firmâs trustcommitment in dealing with their supply chain partnership is highly associated with not only transaction cost, but more so with social exchange variables. This study may open a new research avenue in that there is another construct, SEC, beside TSC that influences the degree of trust and commitment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Companies are going abroad looking for advantages from alternative sources of supply. Primarily associated with the lack of local supplier or lower acquisitions costs, these reactive reasons have driven business to a more proactive perspective by the adoption of a Global Sourcing (GS). Companies from emerging countries are developing their own GS, just like multinational from developed countries. These \"late movers\" have a strategic motivation, and goals, to internationalize their activities. This paper reviews and integrates literature from Operations Management, Strategic Management and International Business areas to develop a framework that poses 13 theoretical propositions. Then, the paper presents a case study carry out in a Brazilian electro- electronics company that develops and manufactures its products overseas and distributes them in Brazil and other South American markets. This company replicates the strategy developed in its home country and spread value chain activities through global suppliers, especially those located in Asia. Findings reveal that the company has the capability to analyze its value chain to focus on the activities that add more value: those are product development and distribution in South America. Each proposition of the framework was illustrated by the empirical evidence from the case study. The findings provide insights to guide further research on the adoption of GS by companies from emerging countries. Some propositions of the theoretical framework were not found due to the size and strategy of the analyzed company and new propositions were developed based on the empirical findings for further research.DOI: 10.12660/joscmv6n2p114-127URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.12660/joscmv6n2p114-127</jats:p>"

The case study measures companyâs opinions of supply chain strategy implementation through utilization of Sense and Response methodology. Critical Factor Index (CFI), Balanced Critical Factor Index (BCFI) and Scaled Critical Factor Index (SCFI) are used in this study to represent the result of comparison between European and Asian companies. From the analysis of comparison of all Sense and Response models, it can be concluded that there are differences and similarities of critical attributes that affecting supply chain strategy implementation in Asian and European companies. There are two attributes that have consistent trend for both regions; innovation and organization structure. In this research the analysis of supply chain strategy implementation was made for the needs of manufacturing industry. Suggestions for future research are multiple case studies in different industry areas in global business environment. The results provide a guideline to the company to measure the right attributes for making the right decision in a dynamic environment. It also provides good knowledge for companies to implement supply chain strategies, the main approaches to implement it and the main challenges in supply chain strategy implementation. Supply chain strategy implementation was analyzed in the European and Asian companies. This research shows that there are several developing areas for companies when implementing supply chain strategies.</jats:p>",

Rain-fed plots were set as controls. Conditions during the first 40 days of the growing season had a decisive effect on yield and bulb size; warmer and dryer weather during this period resulted in lower yield. Colder and wetter weather conditions resulted in higher bulb yield, but also decreased accumulation of secondary metabolites. Dry matter content values ranged between 12% and 14% and were not influenced by the water supply. Storage carbohydrate-to-dry matter ratio was not changed by the water supply. Total flavonol contents (sum of the concentrations of nine individual flavonols) varied between 430 and 753 mgÂ·kg<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup> on a fresh weight basis.

Allocating water resources equitably amongst the numerous domestic and industrial consumers in these regions, while preserving or improving the environment and meeting economic goals, is a highly complex problem. Various researchers have addressed this problem using various models, but no model that satisfactorily optimizes the complex, interacting social, economic and environmental goals has been developed as yet. To contribute towards this goal, we present a bi-level optimization model that allocates water resources rationally between all sectors, and prevents overexploitation. It is based on the optimization of comprehensive social, economic, agricultural, environment and groundwater preservation benefits. Verified results obtained with the model indicate that it is capable of resolving the multi-dimensional water allocation problems rationally, both in the focal region and more generally, according to a flexible set of ordered, prioritized objectives.</jats:p>",

Less attention, however, has been paid to improving the process of managing a disruption from its discovery through to complete recovery. This entire process is not, in fact, fully understood. Clearer insights are needed surrounding the following issues: factors influencing the recovery process, how those factors interact to play a role in managerial decision making, and the company's actual ability to recover. While it is possible to determine basic recovery process factors, a more complete picture of disruption management can be built from analysis of data collected through qualitative inâdepth interviews. This research delivers insights around the interactions and relationships among factors, providing the foundation for a set of propositions useful for further investigation in the following areas: discovery of the disruption event, causes of the event, and recovery performance. One finding indicates that while internal disruptions are faster to recover from, they more likely lead to negative perceptions about the recovery performance outcome.</jats:p>",

Two implanted TEG modules were constructed and a boosted circuit with a highly integrated DC/DC converter was fabricated to stabilizing the energy output and improving the voltage output for the implanted TEG. According to the experiments, such a device combination was already capable of supporting a clock circuit in the in vivo rabbit whose power consumption is much higher than an ordinary cardiac pacemaker. Meanwhile, a close to reality theoretical model was established for characterizing the implanted TEG. This study is expected to serve as a valuable reference for future designs of the implanted TEG and its boosted circuit.</jats:p>",

Findings indicate that the majority of large Chinese metal companies are aware of SSCM, but the concept of SSCM needs to be further spread in Chinese metal industry. Four strategies of SSCM adopted by the leading metal companies include green procurement and supplier sustainability management, low-carbon logistics, green manufacturing, and green marketing.

In the first stage, the operational efficiency of water supply operators is calculated by implementing a conventional BCC DEA model, that uses both physical infrastructure and financial input and output variables to explore economies of scale. In the second stage, bootstrapped DEA and Tobit regression are performed to estimate the influence that a number of environmental factors have on water supplier efficiency. The results show that the integrated water provision industry in Italy is characterized by operational inefficiencies of service operators, and scale and agglomeration economies may have a not negligible effect on efficiency. In addition, the operator typology and its geographical location affect efficiency.</jats:p>"

A research framework of the identified GSCMP, enviropreneurship and sustainability performance is developed with a view towards suggesting how such research might systematically be carried out. Accordingly, such thought depends upon more detailed empirical research by using advanced structural equation modeling approaches.

Present research work was focused to examine such soil parameters collected from Kamerotar town planning area of Bhaktapur district of Nepal. Concentrations of these soil parameters measured in this study are found as: moisture content (18-77%), pH (3.0-9.3), resistivity (11600-71400 ohm.cm), oxidation-reduction potential (87-426 mV vs SHE), chloride (28-135 ppm) and sulfate (20-226 ppm). These soil parameters gave an indication of âmoderately corrosiveâ to âmildly corrosiveâ behavior of soils on the buried-galvanized steels and cast-iron pipelines used in the study area. It was found a good correlation between the soil resistivity and moisture content as well as the chloride content in soils. The soil resistivity was generally decreased with increasing both the moisture and chloride contents in soils.

This study aims to answer the following research questions: Do the environmental uncertainties a firm faces differ with the firm's position in the supply chain when going green?, Would the motivation of a firm for going green vary with uncertainties it faces in the supply chain? and Would green-related practices a firm accepts or executes vary with the firm's position in the supply chain? </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> â The case study method was utilized in this study. The main objects are firms in the high-tech industry of Taiwan, and 12 firms were selected for in-depth investigation. The unit of analysis was a firm. Face-to-face in-depth interviews, approximately 90-105 minutes for each, were conducted with each of the 12 cases. The respondents were middle- to high-level managers. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Additionally, second-hand information was acquired regarding each case through channels such as firm web sites, documents, and media reports. These integrated data were later utilized in the single-case and cross-case analysis stages. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> â In this study, firms of Taiwan's high-tech industry are divided into the upstream (raw material supplier), midstream (original design manufacturers/original equipment manufacturer), and downstream (brand company) categories. It is first found the uncertainties a firm encounters when implementing green practices are related to its position in the supply chain. The closer a firm is to the upstream of the supply chain, the higher the competitive uncertainty. In contrast, the closer a firm is to the downstream, the higher the demand uncertainty. Furthermore, the internal and external driving forces of firms in promoting green practices are related to the types of uncertainties the firms encounter in the supply chain. A firm's internal driving force is positively associated with the demand uncertainty it faces, however, negatively with the competition and supply uncertainties. On the other hand, a firm's external driving force is positively associated with the competition and supply uncertainties it faces, however, negatively with the demand uncertainties. Additionally, the association between firm willingness to promote green practices and its position in the supply chain is explored. It is found that, for firms located in the downstream of supply chain, it emphasizes more on the practices of green design, purchase, and internal environmental management. If a firm is located in the midstream of supply chain, it will focus more on the practice of green manufacturing and logistics. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> â This study has expanded the discussion of green supply chain management. It establishes the relationship between the uncertainties and the major driving forces of firms for implementing green practices. This approach is rare in previous literature. Furthermore, past literature has suggested that a specific relationship exists between driving factors and firm practices. The author believes that such a relationship must be based on the position of firms in the supply chain; thus, the author has identified the relationship between supply chain position and green practices.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

We also consider the case when the demand is price-sensitive deterministic and provide a unified framework for the model with additive errors. For both scenarios, we look at the case when the price is set before receiving the supply, called simultaneous pricing and the case when the price is set after receiving it, which is called postponed pricing. We develop a procedure for finding the optimal policy for the retailer with general distributions for the supply and the demand. To study the effect of supply uncertainty on expected profit, we conduct sensitivity analysis and develop results for both pricing scenarios and give insights. The results have important implications for a retailer in the supply chain, where a portion of the inventory may be lost due to variety of factors including mishandling and failure to meet quality standards. The findings shed light on the nature and role of prices and their relationship to supply and demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Technology is becoming pervasive across all facets of our lives today. Technology innovation leading to development of new products and enhancement of features in existing products is happening at a faster pace than ever. It is becoming difficult for the customers to keep up with the deluge of new technology.  This trend has resulted in gross increase in use of new materials and decreased customers' interest in relatively older products. This paper deals with a novel model in which the stationary demand is fulfilled by remanufactured products along with newly manufactured products. The current model is based on the assumption that the returned items from the customers can be remanufactured at a fixed rate. The remanufactured products are assumed to be as good as the new ones in terms of features, quality, and worth. A methodology is used for the calculation of optimum level for the newly manufactured items and the optimum level of the remanufactured products simultaneously. The model is formulated depending on the relationship between different parameters. An interpretive-modelling-based approach has been employed to model the reverse logistics variables typically found in supply chains (SCs). For simplicity of calculation a deterministic approach is implemented for the proposed model.</jats:p>",

This study examined vertical and horizontal differences in phytoplankton communities in a typical subtropical deep reservoir (i.e. Dongzhen Reservoir) from 2011 to 2012. Phytoplankton communities separated into four groups based on the biomass data, indicating that temporal differences in the community structure were greater than spatial differences. Autumn communities had the highest diversity measured by the Shannon-Wiener index (2.47Â±0.07), while summer communities had the lowest diversity (0.46Â±0.09). Both winter and spring communities were dominated by diatoms (90.4Â±1.7%), while cyanobacteria dominated in summer communities during our sampling period. In spring and summer, however, the three surface communities characterized by high biomass were most similar to each other, indicating that vertical variation was significantly higher than horizontal differences. Furthermore, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii accounted for over 96% of the total phytoplankton biomass in the summer surface water. The redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that the temporal factor (summer), the spatial factor (depth), and nutrients (nitrite and nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, phosphate phosphorus) were significant variables affecting the dynamics of phytoplankton communities. High temperature with stable thermal stratification might have been the cause of C. raciborskii dominance in Dongzhen Reservoir in summer. Regular and long-term monitoring of dominant species is urgently needed for water quality protection and sustainable reservoir management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The most distinctive characteristic of the Mediterranean climate is its strong seasonality, dry summers and intense rainfall episodes concentrated in spring and autumn. This changeability is translated into a wide variability of the water resources in terms of quantity and quality. Barcelona, located in the northeast extreme of the Iberian Peninsula, shows all the characteristics of the Mediterranean climate. The Llobregat River, which is the main conventional water source for drinking water production in Barcelona region, presents a poor and variable quality as well as high flow variability. This study is focused on testing ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, based on a submerged outside-in configuration, as direct pre-treatment of such water at demonstration scale. A prototype with ZeeweedÂ® 500D membranes was optimised for the different scenarios tested during 2 years of continuous operation. It was demonstrated to be able to stand the extreme feed quality limits, obtaining water yields in the range of 89â92% in all conditions used. The prototype worked better in terms of water production yield at high turbidity episodes (&amp;gt;70 NTU), probably due to a layer formation which prevented organic species and particles reaching the membrane. Permeate water was shown, in spite of feed water quality fluctuations, to be constant and appropriate in quality terms. Water quality results obtained are compared to the ones obtained in a conventional pre-treatment. The preliminary results of a technical comparison between direct UF and conventional pre-treatment are also detailed in the study.</jats:p>",

At four bus stoppages of Rokeya Shoronee observation and counting methods have used to determine demand and current supply of buses. An average bus size has been considered as a unit.

Simulation results show that the WITB affects particularly labour market participation of low- and medium-skilled lone-parents families. These positive effects on labour supply translate into higher after-tax incomes leading to a decline in low-income rates and low-income gaps. Our findings suggest that enhancing the WITB could provide additional income support to working Canadian families while reducing work disincentives for those trapped behind the welfare wall.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>JEL classification</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>C15, D33, D58, J08, I32, O51</jats:p>",

Our sample comprises almost 800 banks lending in the syndicated loan market to borrowers from 48 advanced and emerging market economies. To control for simultaneous changes in demand, we relate withinâborrower changes in bank credit from multiple banks to banks' exposure to liquidity risk. To capture banks' vulnerability to the liquidity shocks that occurred during 2007â2008, we use measures of preâcrisis reliance on wholesale funding. Our results suggest that banks that were more exposed to liquidity risk during the crisis reduced syndicated lending more than other banks. Our results are robust to alternate measures of vulnerability to liquidity risk, choice of sample period and simultaneous movements in exchange rates.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A central proposition in many macroeconomic models is price stickiness, while it is agreed that commodity prices are determined in auction markets, and are necessarily fully flexible. The overall price level is a weighted average of commodity prices and consumer prices. An exogenous increase in the money supply, keeping everything else constant, increases the overall price level proportionately. Because of stickiness of consumer prices, commodity prices overshoot the increase in the money supply. The purpose of this paper is to reâexamine the relations between the price of one specific commodity which is oil with <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> inflation, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> money supply and the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> dollar. One empirical fact is that during the sample period, global and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> demand shocks have raised oil prices immediately while their effect on consumer prices was delayed. This overshooting of oil prices is expected to occur in the short run and to wane in the long run as consumer prices fully adjust. The overshooting of oil prices is the mirror image of the overshooting of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> dollar. This is true for two main reasons. One, both oil and the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> dollar react in the same manner to money supply changes. Two, oil prices are quoted in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> dollars and a depreciation of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> dollar is instantly compensated by a rise in the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">US</jats:styled-content> price of oil. Additionally, the paper analyses and discusses the evidence on an <jats:italic>apparent</jats:italic> long run overshooting of oil prices and explains why it is just a statistical artefact that stems from the salient features of oil.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In current business management, knowledge is considered to be a strategic resource that can strengthen an organizationâs competitiveness. Today, under the process of continuous globalization, almost all companies are rapidly exposed to global competition regardless of their scale or type of business. However, multinational management is very complicated and uncertain and it is hard for multinationals to effectively coordinate and manage their global value chains. In light of this, the utility of multinational management based on knowledge is increased. The present study examines multinational firmsâ knowledge management systems, knowledge creation processes and global supply chain performance and attempts to reveal any significant linkages between these latent variables. For this research interest, we proposed 18 items to measure four types of knowledge creation processes (SECI) designed by Nonaka (1994) and revised by authors considering the global business environment, in particular involving the global supply chain management concept. Utilizing the confirmed SECI model, 128 sample companies were classified into four groups according to the levels of their knowledge creation processes. The empirical results of this study reveal important linkages between a multinational firmâs knowledge management system and knowledge creation process, as well as between its knowledge creation process and global supply chain management performance. In particular, the current work suggests that the creation and conversion of tacit knowledge as well as explicit knowledge can be effectively supported by information and communication technology.</jats:p>",

With the advent of materials science, this relation has become even more pronounced. The pivotal role of advanced materials in industrial economies has not yet been matched by the influence of advanced materials during the transition from agricultural to modern societies. The role of advanced materials in poverty eradication can be very large, in particular if new trajectories of social and economic development become possible. This is the topic of this essay, different in format from the traditional scientific review, as we try to encompass not only two infant technologies of solar energy conversion and storage by means of organic materials, but also the social conditions for introduction of the technologies. The development of organicâbased photovoltaic energy conversion has been rapid, and promises to deliver new alternatives to wellâestablished silicon photovoltaics. Our recent development of organic biopolymer composite electrodes opens avenues towards the use of renewable materials in the construction of wooden batteries or supercapacitors for charge storage. Combining these new elements may give different conditions for introduction of energy technology in areas now lacking electrical grids, but having sufficient solar energy inputs. These areas are found close to the equator, and include some of the poorest regions on earth.</jats:p>",

Thus, the behavior of its glaciers has a large impact on water resources for the arid flat plain below, providing water for residents, irrigation, and energy in Kyrgyz Republic and Central Asia. We investigated the recent glacier condition in the Naryn basin (Chon Naryn and Kichi Naryn catchments) using topographic maps of 1:25,000 scale and ALOS/AVNIR-2 satellite imagery. For the 45-year period 1965â2010, glacier area decreased by 17.4% in the Akshyirak massif, and by 20.8% in the Borkoldoy, 21.9% in the Jetim, 24.6% in the Jetimbel, 28.9% in the Naryn, 20.8% in the Sook, 20.9% in the Teskey (south-slope glaciers), and 17.8% in the Uchemchek mountain ranges. The dramatic shrinkage was greater for south-facing than for north-facing glaciers, with respective area losses of 23.6 and 19.8%. The glacier shrinkage might affect not only irrigation water withdrawals during summer but also the planning of four cascade power stations to be constructed in the Chon Naryn and Kichi Naryn catchments.</jats:p>",

This was quantified by building a mass balance model of the KirkwoodâCohansey aquifer, which is widely used for public water supply in New Jersey. This model was built by telescoping a calibrated regional threeâdimensional (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">3D</jats:styled-content>) <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">MODFLOW</jats:styled-content> model to the approximate capture zone of a single public supply well that has a history of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CE</jats:styled-content> contamination. This local model was then used to compute a mass balance between dissolved organic carbon (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DOC</jats:styled-content>), particulate organic carbon (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">POC</jats:styled-content>), and adsorbed organic carbon (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">AOC</jats:styled-content>) that act as electron donors and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DO</jats:styled-content>, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">CEs</jats:styled-content>, ferric iron, and sulfate that act as electron acceptors (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">EAs</jats:styled-content>) using the Sequential Electron Acceptor Model in three dimensions (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SEAM3D</jats:styled-content>) code. <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">SEAM3D</jats:styled-content> was constrained by varying concentrations of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DO</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DOC</jats:styled-content> entering the aquifer via recharge, varying the bioavailable fraction of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">POC</jats:styled-content> in aquifer sediments, and comparing observed and simulated vertical concentration profiles of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DO</jats:styled-content> and <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DOC</jats:styled-content>. This procedure suggests that approximately 15% of the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">POC</jats:styled-content> present in aquifer materials is readily bioavailable. Model simulations indicate that transport of perchloroethene (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PCE</jats:styled-content>) and its daughter products trichloroethene (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">TCE</jats:styled-content>), <jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>âdichloroethene (<jats:italic>cis</jats:italic>â<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DCE</jats:styled-content>), and vinyl chloride (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">VC</jats:styled-content>) to the public supply well is highly sensitive to the assumed bioavailable fraction of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">POC</jats:styled-content>, concentrations of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DO</jats:styled-content> entering the aquifer with recharge, and the position of simulated <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PCE</jats:styled-content> source areas in the flow field. The results are less sensitive to assumed concentrations of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DOC</jats:styled-content> in aquifer recharge. The mass balance approach used in this study also indicates that hydrodynamic processes such as advective mixing, dispersion, and sorption account for a significant amount of the observed natural attenuation in this system.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, more and more modern power grids have adopted dynamic pricing electricity supply model. When a data center or data server is equipped with temporary power storage devices such as a battery, it is feasible and important to study how to schedule power supply to reduce the overall power consumption cost. In this paper, we present a dynamic programming based scheduling strategy by considering the stochastic arrival nature of network load and characteristic of battery storage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using simulation based on real power price data and real-life network load data.</jats:p>"

Drawing upon <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">C</jats:styled-content>ontingency <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">T</jats:styled-content>heory, we posit that the appropriateness and effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies are contingent on the internal and external environments and that there is no oneâsizeâfitsâall strategy. While literature on risk management has proposed a variety of tools and techniques for effectively evaluating and managing supply chain risks, comprehensive assessment of the efficiencies of alternative risk mitigation strategies has not been addressed in the literature. Such an assessment will help managers select the appropriate mitigation strategy for a given decisionâmaking environment. To this end, this study is first of its kind in evaluating and proposing efficient supply chain risk mitigation strategies in the presence of a variety of risk categories, risk sources, and supply chain configurations. We combine an empirically grounded simulation methodology with data envelopment analysis and nonparametric statistical methods to analyze and rank alternative mitigation strategies. We find that the more efficient strategies focus on flexibility rather than on redundancy for supply chain failures. Our research presents several interesting and useful managerial insights for deciding what strategies are most capable of mitigating risks in a variety of contexts.</jats:p>",

The intrinsic characteristics and correlations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), algae biomass and other contaminants were investigated. Parallel factor analysis determined four CDOM components, and principal component analysis (PCA) identified three integrated principal factors. PCA Factor 1 had correlations with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (r = 0.798), UV254 (0.645), humic-like CDOM component C3 (0.892) and C4 (0.876), and Factor 2 correlated with in vivo chlorophyll-a (0.768), microcystin-LR (0.713), protein-like C1 (0.782) and C2 (0.759). Factor 3 had correlations with NH3-N (0.851) and total phosphorus (T-P) (0.716). The variation in PCA factor scores revealed that single PAC coagulation preferentially removed algal cells (Factor 2) but had little effect on NH3-N and T-P (Factor 3). Single UV-C treatment induced degradation of protein-like CDOM and decrease of algal biomass (Factor 2), followed by humic-like CDOM increase from ruptured cells (Factors 1 and 3). Compared with single PAC coagulation (20 mg Lâ1), the combined UV-C/PAC treatment (700 mJ cmâ2 + 20 mg Lâ1) enhanced the removal of PCA Factors 1, 2 and 3 (15%, 32% and 10%).</jats:p>",

The first sets the controls over the supply and the game parameters of gaming machines within the broader regulatory environment governing commercial gambling in Great Britain. This account notes the tensions that existed prior to the regime introduced by the Gambling Act 2005, but whose legacy continues to present both regulatory and commercial difficulties. Its second purpose is to indicate how these controls have shaped the gaming machine market and the debate around the ways in which the government could realise its policy of striking a balance between the interests of both operators and players. This paper does not address the regulation of online gambling; that is, âremote gamblingâ by means of âremote communicationâ (s. 4 of the Gambling Act 2005). Its third purpose is to provide a critical account of the regulatory regime governing the availability of gaming machines as the background against which the Responsible Gambling Trustâs other commissioned contextual papers may be read.The text falls into four sections:An overview of the regulation of machines under the Gaming Act 1968 and of the reasons underlying the structure of the new regimeA summary of the overall regulatory structure of the 2005 ActA descriptive account of the 2005 Actâs regulation of machinespreliminarycommon core definitional features of a âgaming machineâthe categories of gaming machinesgaming machine licences and permitsconditions and standards for their use4.Some concluding comments on how these arrangements have shaped both the commercial availability of gaming machines and the debate about how the interests of operators and of players can be accommodated</jats:p>"

Given the limitations of methodologies that use selfâreported or intended measures of purchasing behaviour, we use the loyalty card data of the largest supermarket retailer in the UK to measure the impact of carbon labels on sales by different consumer segments. The data show that the trial of carbon labels on supermarket own brand products has had no discernible impact on shifting demand to lower carbon products. In order to explore possible reasons for lack of impact, nine focus groups were held using purposive sampling by retailer consumer segments to allow an exploration of awareness, understanding and use of carbon labels. The findings from the focus groups identified possible reasons for this lack of impact: lack of awareness and understanding of carbon labelling; constraining or facilitating social and cultural influences; and the heterogeneous nature of consumers. As a result, a number of implications for stakeholders are discussed. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

Therefore to supply the spinning reserve of power system, a compromise between reliability and cost should be considered. In this study, by considering the value of lost load for each important customer, the spinning reserve capacity is determined based on minimisation of total cost of problem. In addition, to supply the spinning reserve of power system, a new market player called plugâin electric vehicles (PEVs) aggregator is proposed. In this base, the aggregator's selfâscheduling problem for participating in spinning reserve market is modelled using an agentâbased model and behaviour of the PEVs fleet is modelled from the aggregator's point of view. To improve the accuracy of results, the market players are considered as price makers and their offers to the market are modelled using a dynamic game theory simulation. The numerical results show that the presence of PEVs aggregator in spinning reserve market has desired impacts on power system reliability and total cost of system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper quantifies the effect of three policy levels on the water and energy futures of Melbourne, Australia. During a time of severe water shortages attributed to climate change, water strategies lacked consideration of energy consequences. Modeling, guided by urban metabolism theory, demonstrated that a compact urban form, reduced water consumption by 90 GL/a, compared with a sprawling city, and had greater water conservation impact than simulated demand management measures. Household water conservation, coupled with increased use of solar hot water systems, reduced grid energy use by some 30 PJ/a. Desalination, tripled water supply energy demand, growing to a total of 4.5 PJ/a, by 2045. While the increase is less than 1% of total Melbourne urban energy use, it contributes to a substantial increase in the energy bill for urban water provision. Importantly, the energy impact could be offset through demand management measures. Recommendations for the combined management of water and energy include improving energy characterization of the urban water cycle; impact-evaluation of regional plans; using total urban water and energy balances in analysis to provide context; and developing reporting mechanisms and indicators to help improve baseline data across the water and energy systems.</jats:p>",

Previous research has demonstrated that under the right conditions, biofiltration is an effective method to reduce fouling of low-pressure polymeric membranes. This study provides additional insight into the effect of biofiltration as a pretreatment for fouling reduction by using river water with different raw water quality characteristics than has been examined in previous studies. Two parallel pilot-scale dual media (sand/anthracite) biological filters were operated continuously over a period of 14 months. Liquid chromatographyâorganic carbon detection analysis confirmed that the parallel biofilters performed similarly with both averaging on 21% biopolymer removal. Raw and treated water biopolymer concentrations were correlated, with increased absolute removals occurring at higher raw water concentrations. Ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling experiments showed substantial improvement in performance following biofiltration pretreatment by reducing hydraulically irreversible and reversible fouling rates by 14â68% and 8â55%, respectively. The results also reaffirm the importance of biopolymers at concentrations as low as â¼0.1 mg/L on irreversible and reversible UF membrane fouling and a minimal impact of humic substances.</jats:p>",

The performance of the model lies in a supply chain and is based on real conditions and data. The main purpose of the model is to minimize the maintenance cost of the entire chain. However, if the good is perished before reaching the customer (the expiration date is over), the cost would be added to other costs such as transportation, production, and maintenance costs in the target function. As real conditions are required, some limitations such as production time, storage capacity, inventory level, transportation methods, and sustainability time are considered in the model. Also, due to the complexity of the model, the solution approach is based on genetic algorithm under MATLAB to solve and confirm the accuracy of the modelâs performance. As can be noted, the manipulation of parametric figures can solve the problem of reaching the optimum point. Using real data from a food production facility, the model was utilized with the same approach and the obtained results confirm the accuracy of the model.</jats:p>",

In contrast, a lack of trust between them often increases transaction costs and results in inefficiency. The results of this research, based on multi-country surveys with 729 returns from France, Hungary, Korea, Tunisia and the United States on supply chain professionals, reveals a strong affect of transaction cost constructs (TCC) (asset specificity and behavioral uncertainty) and social exchange constructs (SEC) (replaceability, perceived satisfaction, partner reputation, and perceived conflict) on trust-commitment variables in partnership based supply chain relationships. This paper employed a structural equation model to extract information from the survey data. Among the findings, the research indicates that a firmâs trustcommitment in dealing with their supply chain partnership is highly associated with not only transaction cost, but more so with social exchange variables. This study may open a new research avenue in that there is another construct, SEC, beside TSC that influences the degree of trust and commitment.</jats:p>",

However, it remains unclear how cells coordinate DNA synthesis with provision of new histones for chromatin assembly to ensure chromosomal stability. In this paper, we show that replication fork speed is dependent on new histone supply and efficient nucleosome assembly. Inhibition of canonical histone biosynthesis impaired replication fork progression and reduced nucleosome occupancy on newly synthesized DNA. Replication forks initially remained stable without activation of conventional checkpoints, although prolonged histone deficiency generated DNA damage. PCNA accumulated on newly synthesized DNA in cells lacking new histones, possibly to maintain opportunity for CAF-1 recruitment and nucleosome assembly. Consistent with this, in vitro and in vivo analysis showed that PCNA unloading is delayed in the absence of nucleosome assembly. We propose that coupling of fork speed and PCNA unloading to nucleosome assembly provides a simple mechanism to adjust DNA replication and maintain chromatin integrity during transient histone shortage.</jats:p>",

Aim: To compare parathyroid hormone levels measured by two assays in correlation with vitamin D supply. Method: Parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxi-vitamin-D were determined in 104 patients (31 patients with chronic renal failure without renal replacement therapy, 36 patients treated with peritoneal dialysis and 37 patients treated with hemodialysis). Results: Good correlation was found between results of the two parathyroid hormone methods, but the intact parathyroid hormone levels were higher than the biointact values. 87% and 13% of the patients had vitamin-D deficiency and insufficiency, respectively. The frequency of serious vitamin-D deficiency was higher in the peritoneal dialysis than in the hemodialysis group. Intact parathyroid hormone levels were different in dialysed patients having vitamin-D-deficiency and insufficiency, and the difference was higher for the biointact than intact values. Negative correlation was detected between biointact parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxivitamin-D in the hemodialysis group. Conclusions: Biointact parathyroid hormone levels better reflect the vitamin D supply and bone metabolism than intact levels, especially in hemodialysed patients. Orv.

Their efficient supply and management becomes a concern for both public authorities and individual users. This paper examines the role and objectives of social entrepreneurs in supplying temporary public spaces within an unstable setting and focuses on small group collective action. The mechanisms used to identify potential land, negotiate use-rights and promote these spaces are discussed for the case of Beirut, Lebanon, a society segregated by the effects of war and political upheaval. The case of an organic food market is used to illustrate temporary public spaces in the critical period of 2005â2007, when political instability reigned in the country and rendered conventional public spaces undesirable. The paper concludes by drawing lessons for land readjustment in crisis situations from the movement of temporary public spaces within a city while still attracting people that formerly had difficulties meeting elsewhere. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For Labor, the core approach to mitigating climate change is the pricing of carbon emissions. The primary purpose of this article is to defend this approach, specifically in the electricity sector and under Australian conditions. In so doing, it rebuts recent arguments to the contrary put by the Liberal National Party Coalition (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LNP</jats:styled-content>). The article underscores the longer run impact of emission pricing, and price expectations, when the key mechanism is about switching investment toward less emissionsâintensive technologies. This core approach of emission pricing is also supported by soâcalled âcomplementary policiesâ. These can assist in the costâeffective reduction of emissions, for example by addressing certain âimperfect informationâ, âmarket failureâ problems and institutional distortions, as well as uncertain expectations about future emission price trajectories. For the <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">LNP</jats:styled-content>, the core policy is presented as âdirect actionâ. However, at least some âcomplementary policiesâ can also be described as âdirect actionâ. Properly applied, selected âdirect actionâ policies (however labelled) can contribute to achieving emission targets at least cost, providing that distortions due to rentâseeking are avoided, notably through transparent, accountable and evidenceâbased policyâmaking.</jats:p>",

Manufacturers, retailers, software companies, and consultants are creatively discovering new applications of big data using predictive analytics in supply chain management and logistics. In practice, predictive analytics is generally atheoretical; however, we develop a 2Â ÃÂ 2 model to explain the role of predictive analytics in the theory development process. This 2Â ÃÂ 2 model shows that in our discipline we have traditionally taken one path to theory development, but that predictive analytics can be a salient component of a comprehensive theory development process. The model points to a number of research questions that need to be addressed by our research community. These questions are not just highly relevant to the academic community but also in urgent need of answers to help practitioners execute the right strategies with greater precision and efficiency. We also discuss how one disruptive trend, the maker movement, changes the nature of who the producers are in the supply chain, making big data even more valuable.

Later, in the postâconstruction phase of the project, those goals were undermined by the counterâtechnologies of upper caste households and the villageâscale institutions that supported them. The paper brings together geographic research on neoliberal water governance and caste processes in modern rural India to illuminate how neoliberal subjectivities deepened in the postâproject phase. It shows the ways that caste norms, village water governance and state power converged to produce ânewâ ways of thinking about water access and payment that undermined the social goals and the physical infrastructure of the project. The paper contributes to research on neoliberalisation and the creation of subjects by demonstrating the mutual constitution of caste inequalities and successfully marketised drinking water over the construction and postâconstruction phases of the project.</jats:p>",

DT-RMS is an upgraded version of the previously reported single-target rotation magnet sputtering system [Goto et al., J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 27, 653 (2009)] designed to expand deposition area. In DT-RMS, multiple moving plasma loops are excited at the dual-target surface. These plasma loops work to homogenize the properties of the films deposited on the substrates, with time-averaged homogenization of the plasma parameters at the substrate. As a result, film thicknesses and uniform distributions of the a-IGZO-film properties were obtained at an appropriate targetâsubstrate distance. In this configuration, the Xe-sputtered a-IGZO TFTs exhibited higher field-effect mobilities than conventional Ar-sputtered TFTs. When using the recycled Xe supplied from the Xe recycle-and-supply system, the field-effect mobility value was the same as for fresh-Xe sputtered TFTs, demonstrating the technique's potential as a low-cost alternative for providing the flat panel display industry with Xe.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused damages to coastal ecosystems and thus affected the livelihoods of the coastal communities who depend on services provided by these ecosystems. The paper presents a case study on evaluating and mapping the spatial and temporal impacts of the tsunami on land use and land cover (LULC) and related ecosystem service supply in the Phang Nga province, Thailand. The method includes local stakeholder interviews, field investigations, remote-sensing techniques, and GIS. Results provide an ecosystem services matrix with capacity scores for 18 LULC classes and 17 ecosystem functions and services as well as pre-/post-tsunami and recovery maps indicating changes in the ecosystem service supply capacities in the study area. Local stakeholder interviews revealed that mangroves, casuarina forest, mixed beach forest, coral reefs, tidal inlets, as well as wetlands (peat swamp forest) have the highest capacity to supply ecosystem services, while e.g. plantations have a lower capacity. The remote-sensing based damage and recovery analysis showed a loss of the ecosystem service supply capacities in almost all LULC classes for most of the services due to the tsunami. A fast recovery of LULC and related ecosystem service supply capacities within one year could be observed for e.g. beaches, while mangroves or casuarina forest needed several years to recover. Applying multi-temporal mapping the spatial variations of recovery could be visualised. While some patches of coastal forest were fully recovered after 3 yr, other patches were still affected and thus had a reduced capacity to supply ecosystem services. The ecosystem services maps can be used to quantify ecological values and their spatial distribution in the framework of a tsunami risk assessment. Beyond that they are considered to be a useful tool for spatial analysis in coastal risk management in Phang Nga.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of synchronization of ruminal energy and nitrogen (N) supply on in vitro microbial protein synthesis (MPS) and rumen fermentation pattern. Commonly used tropical feeds and fodders(sorghum grain, maize grain, wheat bran, mustard cake, groundnut cake, maize fodder, oat fodder and wheat straw) were first evaluated in sacco for their organic matter and N degradation characteristics. The protein sources (mustard and groundnut-cake) had faster N degradation rate while energy source (sorghum grain) had faster whereas the other (maize grain) had slower rate of energy release. By varying the proportion of feed ingredients, 6 isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets were formulated and their synchrony index (SI) was calculated using in sacco degradability kinetic data. The diets were classified as high(HS), medium (MS) and low(LS) synchronous based on their SI with 2 diets in each category. These diets were evaluated for rumen fermentation parameters by in vitro gas production technique. The total gas production from HS and MS diets was significantly higher indicating higher fermentation while any specific trend in methane production was not observed. Degradability of HS and MS diets was significantly higher than that of LS diets. The NH3-N content in HS and MS diets was significantly lower indicating higher uptake of N from these diets while TCA-ppt N and total N content was significantly higher from these diets in comparison with LS diets. The TVFA and propionate production was higher in HS and MS diets while acetate production was higher in LS diets. Acetate: propionate ratio was significantly lower in HS and LS diets. The HS and MS diets produced significantly higher amount of microbial N with greater efficiency of MPS. It was concluded that due to synchronization of energy and N supply, the in vitro rumen fermentation was improved with higher MPS and efficiency of N capture.</jats:p>"

Instead of regulating the supply modulator's output in accordance with a given reference signal, the system utilizes a lookâahead window and synthesizes pulses for the supply modulator such that its output tracks the envelope of the radio frequency signal amplified by the power amplifier, while minimizing its switching rate. Simulation results for a 5âMHz Long Term Evolution signal with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation indicates that the proposed technique provides very high average efficiency (84%) while maintaining a very low ratio between the switching frequency and the envelope bandwidth.

ConclusionsThis study shows that DITI system could be used in evaluation of flap vascularity with ease, quickness and safety for patient and flap. Thus, it could be used clinically for the prediction of flap survival. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Dhaka, a rapidly urbanizing mega city, different private car friendly policies and infrastructure development encourage more people to own and use private. This large number of cars require huge parking space. On-street car parking is now creating severe transportation problems in major roads of Dhaka city, like Mirpur road, which is lined with numerous office and commercial spaces and shopping centers. This paper aims to explicate the parking scenario of the major shopping centers of Dhaka through analyzing the parking and demand supply of New Market, which is a very popular shopping center of this city. The study tried to explore the possibilities of moderating the present parking problems of this market, for which a site-specific study was conducted rather than a city-or nation-wide determination of parking characteristics. Required data has been collected from two parking surveys â parking space inventory and parking usage survey by patrol, conducted on two separate working days each covering five hour periods. The study found that the average duration of parking in New Market area is around 45 minutes and a considerable portion of cars occupy the parking area up to 3 to 5 hours which lessens parking turnover. Through analyzing the parking demand and supply of a prominent shopping center of Dhaka city, this study invokes parking characteristics which is a common feature observed in other shopping centers or even in other land uses. Therefore, the findings can be used to provide targeted solutions by addressing specific problems in the parking tendencies.\nJournal of Bangladesh Institute of Planners, Vol. 6, Dec 2013, pp. 161-172</jats:p>"

In the early postoperative period ischemic colitis was found in 8 patients (4.1 %), and more than a third of them (37.5 %) developed infarction in the left side of the colon with a lethal outcome. To objectify the intraoperative assessment of the blood supply in the left colon after elective AAA repair the methods of direct manometry and ultrasonography were used in 41 and 40 patients, respectively, and both methods were applied in 21 patients.

Mello and Hunt ([2009] <jats:italic>Transportation Journal</jats:italic>, 48:20â39) were the first to suggest using formal controls to influence truck drivers' behavior. Extending the salesperson control literature, they documented an underresearched method of formal control that we term technology control, whereby firms use onâboard and communications technology to influence drivers. We build on their work by investigating the contingent effects of formal controls that influence the behavior of truck drivers and thereby influence the operational performance of firms in the U.S. motor carrier industry. Our work integrates the monitoring aspect of agency theory with the theory of operant conditioning and the theory of psychological reactance to develop a rationale for hypothesized contingent effects of formal controls on motor carriers' operational performance. We collected primary data pertaining to the controls used to influence truck drivers' behavior from a large sample of U.S. motor carrier firms. The results of our analyses using nonlinear structural equation modeling suggest a complex set of relationships between formal controls and operational performance. Our results shed light on scenarios where using technology to monitor driver behavior can result in positive and/or negative organizational outcomes.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, poor adherence, especially of immigrants from Africa, leads to a high rate of treatment failures. Our study looked whether direct monthly ART supply in our AIDS centre has an effect on adherence and outcome. A total of 385 HIV (clade C) immigrants from Africa that were treated with ART for &gt;2 years prior to the initiation of the study were evaluated. During the first 2 years, ART medications were supplied by local pharmacies. Thereafter (next 2 years), all patients received medications, monthly at our centre. Adherence, immunological (CD4) and virological (VL) outcome at the end of the two study periods were determined. At baseline, only 75% of the patients attended more than 90% of scheduled visits with 57% treatment adherence. Virological failure (VL &gt;40 copies/ml) was observed in 53% of the patients. As a result of our intervention (2 years of direct monthly ART supply), visits and treatment adherence significantly increased (90% and 84%, respectively; pâ&lt;â0.001). Concomitantly, virological failure rate significantly dropped to 28% ( pâ&lt;â0.001).
