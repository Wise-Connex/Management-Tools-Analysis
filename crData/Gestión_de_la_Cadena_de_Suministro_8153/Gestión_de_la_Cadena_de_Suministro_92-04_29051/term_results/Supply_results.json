The model is derived using a multiproduct restricted cost function with adjustment costs. The Euler equations are used to estimate the convenience yield from holding inventories. Short-run petroleum product prices are closely related to crude oil costs but the responses vary by product. Shipments and inventory levels are also important factors in short-run price determination. An examination of the distillate fuel oil price surge of December 1989 and the Exxon Valdez accident of March 1989 suggest that shifts in the derived demand for crude oil may be a major factor in the transmission of demand shocks to product prices. </jats:p>",

The primary cause of the incident is believed to have been a fuel rich SVG stream that was rapidly introduced into the incinerator creating a “puff.” This “puff” allowed flame from the natural gas ring burner to blow back into the windbox igniting the fuel rich SVG. The combustion of gas in the ducting then created a pressure wave that blew apart the flame arrestor and caused the remainder of the damage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Hepatic O2 consumption (VO2) remains relatively constant (O2 supply independent) as O2 delivery (DO2) progressively decreases, until a critical DO2 (DO2c) is reached below which hepatic VO2 also decreases (O2 supply dependence). Whether this decrease in VO2 represents an adaptive reduction in O2 demand or a manifestation of tissue dysoxia, i.e., O2 supply that is inadequate to support O2 demand, is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the decrease in hepatic VO2 during O2 supply dependence represents dysoxia by evaluating hepatic mitochondrial NAD redox state during O2 supply independence and dependence induced by progressive hemorrhage in six pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Hepatic mitochondrial NAD redox state was estimated by measuring hepatic venous beta-hydroxybutyrate-to-acetoacetate ratio (beta OHB/AcAc). The value of DO2c was 5.02 +/- 1.64 (SD) ml.100 g-1.min-1. The beta-hydroxybutyrate-to-acetoacetate ratio was constant until a DO2 value (3.03 +/- 1.08 ml.100 g-1.min-1) was reached (P = 0.05 vs. DO2c) and then increased linearly. Peak liver lactate extraction ratio was 15.2 +/- 14.1%, occurring at a DO2 of 5.48 +/- 2.54 ml.100 g-1.min-1 (P = NS vs. DO2c). Our data support the hypothesis that the decrease in VO2 during O2 supply dependence represents tissue dysoxia. </jats:p>",

The presence of K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> in the medium did not affect N‐uptake. Among the soluble N‐containing compounds nitrate, ammonium and 8 amino acids were quantified. It was found that assimilation of nitrate can cope with the uptake of NO<jats:sup>−</jats:sup><jats:sub>3</jats:sub> under all circumstances. Neither free nitrate nor ammonium or amino acids accumulated to an extent exceeding the values of water‐grown seedlings. On the other hand, in case of high ammonium supply considerably more nitrogen was taken up than could be incorporated into nonsoluble N‐containing substance (‘protein’). The remaining nitrogen was found to accumulate in intermediary storage pools (free NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub><jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, glutamine, asparagine, arginine). Part of this accumulated N could be incorporated into protein when potassium was offered in the nutrient solution. It is concluded that potassium is a requirement for a high rate of protein synthesis not only in crop plants but also in conifers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> During waning flood flows in gravel‐bed streams, finegrained bedload sediment (sand and fine gravel) is commonly winnowed from zones of high shear stress, such as riffles, and deposited in pools, where it mantles an underlying coarse layer. As sediment load increases, more fine sediment becomes available to fill pools. The volume of fine sediment in pools can be measured by probing with a metal rod, and, when expressed as the fraction (V*) of scoured residual pooi volume (residual pool volume with fine sediment removed), can be used as an index of the supply of mobile sediment in a stream channel. Mean values of V* were as high as 0.5 and correlated with qualitative evaluations of sediment supply in eight tributaries of the Trinity River, northwestern California. Fine‐sediment volume correlated strongly with scoured pool volume in individual channels, but plots of V* versus pool volume and water surface slope revealed secondary variations in fines volume. In sediment‐rich channels, V* correlated positively with scoured pool volume; in sediment‐poor channels, V* correlated negatively with water‐surface slope. Measuring fine sediment in pools can be a practical method to evaluate and monitor the supply of mobile sediment in gravel‐bed streams and to detect and evaluate sediment inputs along a channel network.</jats:p>",

After an initial slaughter of 12 of each breed, a complete straw-based pelleted diet (122 g crude protein and 10·4 Mj metabolizable energy per kg dry matter (DM)) was offered ad libitum to a further 29 of each which were slaughtered at a range of live weights between proportionately 0·35 andl -00 of ML W. As well as these groups undergoing normal growth (NG), the remaining lambs were given the same diet at a level sufficient to maintain constant live weight (LW) for 3 months. Eight of each breed were then slaughtered and the remaining 29 of each offered the diet ad libitum for a period of post-restricted growth (PRG); these 29 were also slaughtered between 0·35 and 1·00 of MLW. During the periods of ad libitum food supply, voluntary food intake was greater in BH than WM lambs (BH: 38·3, WM: 35·3 g DM per kg LW, P &lt; 0·01) and during PRG as compared with NG although this result was due to a response only in WM lambs (NG - BH: 38·0, PRG-BH: 38·5, NG - WM: 33·3, PRG - WM: 37·2 g DM per kg LW, breed × pattern of food supply interaction, P &lt; 0·05). Daily live-weight gain (LWG) was greater during PRG than NG in both breeds (NG: 3·15, PRG: 4·80 g/kg LWper day, P &lt; 0·05). This effect was greatest in the first 8 weeks of growth but persisted into the period 16 weeks to maturity. WM lambs had overall slightly leaner carcasses and a lower proportion of protein in the fleece-free empty body than BH when compared at the same proportion of MLW; particularly during PRG. The protein in the carcass-weight gain (CWG) was greater in WM lambs during PRG than during NG (NG: 98, PRG: 123 g/kg, P &lt; 0·05), but did not differ significantly in BH (NG: 106, PRG: 118 g/kg). The proportion of fat in CWG was concomitantly smaller during PRG. There are thus breed differences in the performance and carcass composition of lambs during compensatory growth. Genotypes to be finished by continuous feeding or a regimen incorporating food restriction should be carefully chosen for date offinishing in relation to desired carcass composition.</jats:p>",
