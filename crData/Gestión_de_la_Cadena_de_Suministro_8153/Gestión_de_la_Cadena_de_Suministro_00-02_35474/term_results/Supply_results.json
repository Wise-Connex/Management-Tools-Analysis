A dynamic model is presented which builds on the impact of the evolving interactions of competitors’ activities and the learning which emanates over time. This dynamic model can be used by organizations to determine the level of expenditure necessary to remain competitive. In addition, this model brings out the fact that the systems’ learning will always lead to greater automation in the management of materials; however, the cost would vary according to the interplay of these two factors. This model should also help logistics managers design more effective information systems for their supply chains.</jats:p>",

The benefits and costs associated with electronic commerce are highlighted using results from a survey and follow‐up cases. Analysis showed that the main benefit is faster transactions. Additionally, better  co‐operation between trading partners, reduced administration costs and improved accuracy resulted. The impact of the Internet on electronic commerce, including possible future directions, is then discussed.

A glass parallel plate, continuous observation flow cell placed on a phase contrast microscope was used to monitor bacterial behaviour on the surface under defined flow and mass transfer conditions. Shear stress was held constant at 3 N m−2. Images were taken every 15 minutes, and digital image analysis was used to quantify specific growth, detachment and accumulation rates for the attached organisms. An observable parameter proportional to the nutrient depletion at the surface was used to determine the effect of nutrient depletion on detachment rates. Increases in the depletion parameter corresponded with increases in detachment rate after the cells were rod, but the depletion parameter was not scaleable between different experiments. These experiments showed that as nutrients were depleted, detachment increased. If the detachment mechanism postulated in this work is more universal and applicable to other microbial species, new methods of detachment control through dynamic changes of nutrient supply might be devised.</jats:p>",

In a field experiment two grapevine varieties characterized by higher (White Riesling B 7) and lower (Kövidinka K 8) water requirement were compared on the basis of N, P, K concentrations of leaf blades, petioles and berries. A different water supply of the vineyard was achived by striped coverage of the soil with plastic foil to exclude rainfalls from the beginning of May to ripening. Humidity of the soil decreased as the vegetative phase advanced. Soil cover resulted in 25-30% decrease of the water content in the soil at flowering but this difference gradually disappeared till veraison (i.e. the start of intense growth of the berries). The water consumption in the White Riesling B 7 plantation was more intensive. Mobility and availability of N, P, K in the soil was restricted by water exclusion (i.e. plastic soil cover) at flowering. Nitrogen was slightly affected, whereas P and K were in a higher extent. Comparing the transport of nutrient elements in the two varieties, leaf blades of Kövidinka K 8 contained less N and more P and K than White Riesling B 7 at flowering and more N and P and less K at ripening. Water deficiency inhibited K accumulation in the berries of White Riesling B 7, while this effect did not appear in Kövidinka K 8.Water exclusion decreased the yield of White Riesling B 7 already at lower bud loading, the yield of Kövidinka K 8 was affected only at higher bud loading. The higher yields of the treatments in Kövidinka K 8 plantation support the superior performance of this variety under the hot and dry climate of the Hungarian Great Plain.</jats:p>"

Moreover this concept is relatively new in Asia. This paper presents an overview of the issues that impact the success of a strategic partnership between manufacturing firms and global logistics services providers (GLSPs).

Demand for physicians and dentists was based on the objective of having a physician-to-population ratio of 1: 650, and a dentist-to-population ratio of 1: 5000. Analysis of the current workforce and projected graduates in the period 1998-2005 indicated that the supply of Bahraini medical doctors and dentists until the year 2005 will not be sufficient to meet the projected demand in these categories. By the year 2005, Bahraini doctors and dentists will provide 82.5% and 75.9% of medical and dental demands respectively. The remaining 17.2% of physicians and 24.1% of dentists will have to be recruited from abroad. Thus, the prospect of oversupply of Bahrainis among these categories until the year 2005 is highly unlikely</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Clothing supply chains are subject to increasing global dispersal. Though primarily cost driven, this process impacts on the full range of business functions and activities. However, many dimensions of that impact have as yet received little investigation. The research described in this paper examines the impact of international sourcing strategies on the quality control or assurance function in the clothing industry. The paper establishes a theoretical framework within which observed changes in this area may be analysed. This framework focuses in particular on information costs and flows. The paper reports some preliminary empirical findings derived from a series of semi‐structured interviews conducted with representatives of UK firms deploying international sourcing strategies. A number of supply‐chain case studies are modelled using a diagrammatic methodology which allows the determinants of their configuration, performance and evolution to be explored. The paper concludes by describing the next stage to be undertaken in this research project.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, these analyses suggest that the predam river in Glen Canyon was not supply‐limited to the same degree and that the degree of annual supply limitation increased near the head of Marble Canyon. The predam Colorado River in Grand Canyon displays evidence of four effects of supply limitation: (1) seasonal hysteresis in sediment concentration, (2) seasonal hysteresis in sediment grain size coupled to the seasonal hysteresis in sediment concentration, (3) production of inversely graded flood deposits, and (4∥ development or modification of a lag between the time of a flood peak and the time of either maximum or minimum (depending on reach geometry) bed elevation. Analyses of sediment budgets provide additional support for the interpretation that the predam river was annually supply‐limited with respect to fine sediment, but it was not supply‐limited with respect to fine sediment during all seasons. In the average predam year, sand would accumulate and be stored in Marble Canyon and upper Grand Canyon for 9 months of the year (from July through March) when flows were dominantly below 200–300 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/s; this stored sand was then eroded during April through June when flows were typically higher. After closure of Glen Canyon Dam, because of the large magnitudes of the uncertainties in the sediment budget, no season of substantial sand accumulation is evident.

The present study examines these parameters during coronary artery bypass surgery. We used a voltammetric microelectrode technique to assess regional variations in myocardial tissue partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and myocardial tissue perfusion (MTP) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. A total of 29 myocardial regions were studied in 17 patients to assay tissue PO2, and 13 regions in 10 patients to measure MTP. There was an increase in MTP from 53±9 ml·min-1·100 g-1 before cardiopulmonary bypass to 72±13 ml·min-1·100 g-1 after (means±S.E.M.; P = 0.05). Tissue PO2 showed an overall increase from a baseline level of 45±8 mmHg to a final level of 88±10 mmHg (P&lt; 0.0001). Following release of the aortic cross-clamp there was a variable time delay before a change in tissue PO2 was observed. There was an immediate response in five regions, whereas in 20 regions the response was delayed by between 0.5 and 32 min. In the remaining four regions there was no change in tissue PO2. The duration of the delay in response was correlated positively with the cross-clamp time (r = 0.45, P &lt; 0.05) and negatively with the final tissue PO2 (r =-0.5, P &lt; 0.05). Voltammetric methods for monitoring changes in oxygen supply and utilization offer new insights into the changes that occur during ischaemia and reperfusion. A delay in the delivery of oxygen to the myocardium occurs in many patients following coronary artery bypass surgery.</jats:p>",

Treatments consisted of two different N rates applied as urea and manure (100 and 800 mg N kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and a control. Ion exchange membrane probes were used to measure plant-available N supply rate. Canola was grown under the same environmental conditions to determine plant N uptake. Additions of fertilizer and manure significantly increased the supply of plant-available N measured in the soil. Over an 84-d period the available N supply in the manured soil was about 40% lower than in the urea-fertilized soil at equivalent rates of total N addition due to incomplete mineralization of organic N in the manure. However, plant N uptake was similar between manure and urea-treated soils, which was attributed to other nutrients present in the manure that may have enhanced root growth and plant N uptake. High proportions of ammonium N were measured initially, especially at the high rates of urea and manure. However, inorganic N in the form of ammonium rapidly decreased with time and nitrate N became the main inorganic N form supplied. Overall, there was good correlation (r value 0.79 to 0.96) between plant N uptake and available N supply rate in the soil as measured by ion exchange membrane.

Systematic changes in bed elevation and systematic coupled changes in suspended‐sand concentration and grain size result from this supply limitation. During floods, sand supply limitation either causes or modifies a lag between the time of maximum discharge and the time of either maximum or minimum (depending on reach geometry) bed elevation. If, at a cross section where the bed aggrades with increasing flow, the maximum bed elevation is observed to lead the peak or the receding limb of a flood, then this observed response of the bed is due to sand supply limitation. Sand supply limitation also leads to the systematic evolution of sand grain size (both on the bed and in suspension) in the Colorado River. Sand input during a tributary flood travels down the Colorado River as an elongating sediment wave, with the finest sizes (because of their lower settling velocities) traveling the fastest. As the fine front of a sediment wave arrives at a given location, the bed fines and suspended‐sand concentrations increase in response to the enhanced upstream supply of finer sand. Then, as the front of the sediment wave passes that location, the bed is winnowed and suspended‐sand concentrations decrease in response to the depletion of the upstream supply of finer sand. The grain‐size effects of depletion of the upstream sand supply are most obvious during periods of higher dam releases (e.g., the 1996 flood experiment and the 1997 test flow). Because of substantial changes in the grain‐size distribution of the bed, stable relationships between the discharge of water and sand‐transport rates (i.e., stable sand rating curves) are precluded. Sand budgets in a supply‐limited river like the Colorado River can only be constructed through inclusion of the physical processes that couple changes in bed‐sediment grain size to changes in sand‐transport rates.</jats:p>",

However, large local‐scale variations in lens depth and width are also observed that are not related to morphology. We conclude that magma supply contributes to the regional characteristics of the magma lens beneath a ridge segment, with large variations within a segment due to local processes of magma eruption and delivery. A negative correlation between zero‐age extrusive layer thickness and morphology is found with a thinner extrusive layer along the southern segment. In this innermost axial region above the magma lens, factors such as magma pressure, not magma volume in the lens, may govern the thickness of extrusives that accumulate. The width of the zone over which the extrusive layer is built is positively correlated with morphology with a wide zone where extrusives approximately triple in thickness characterizing the southern segment (5–8 km), and a narrower zone (2–5 km) of minor thickening (less than double) along the northern segment and toward ridge segment ends. This relationship could reflect changes in lava flow characteristics in these areas of contrasting magma supply. We find a close correspondence between discontinuities in the narrow axial summit trough and changes in magma lens presence and geometry, indicating a genetic link between the finest‐scale tectonic segmentation of the ridge and segmentation of the magma lens. In several locations, discrete magma lenses at different levels within the crust (offset by several hundred meters) are imaged beneath adjacent fourth‐order ridge segments.</jats:p>",

Ten arbitrarily selected mRNAs representing various unrelated metabolic activities remained unaffected. Comparative analysis of acyl-CoA oxidase and chalcone synthase with respect to mRNA expression modes and gene promoter structure and function revealed close similarities. These results indicate a fine-tuned regulatory network integrating those functionally related pathways of primary and secondary metabolism that are specifically required for protective adaptation to UV irradiation. Although the response of parsley cells to UV light is considerably broader than previously assumed, it contrasts greatly with the extensive metabolic reprogramming observed previously in elicitor-treated or fungus-infected cells.\n          </jats:p>",

Thus, changes in the carbon cycle in wetlands could have significant impacts on climate. The effect of raised supply of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> on the annual CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> efflux from the lawn of a boreal oligotrophic mire was investigated over two years. Ten study plots were enclosed with mini‐FACE rings, five vented with CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐enriched air and the other five with ambient air. In addition, five plots were sprayed with NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> so that the cumulative addition of N was 3 g m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> y<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; and five plots were controls. The CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> enrichment (target concentration 560 ppm<jats:sub>v</jats:sub>) increased CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> efflux about 30–40%, but half of this increase seemed to be caused by the air‐blowing system. The increasing atmospheric concentration of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> would promote CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> release in boreal mires, but the increase in CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> efflux would be clearly smaller than that reported in studies made in temperate or subtropical temperature conditions. Addition of N enhanced the annual release of CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> only slightly. At least over the short‐term, the increase in N deposition would have little effect on CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> effluxes. The increase in CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> release would probably increase radiative forcing and thus accelerate climate change. However, CH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> effluxes are only a small part in the whole matter balance in mires and thus further studies are needed to define the net effects of raised supply of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or N for carbon accumulation, trace gas fluxes and radiative forcing.</jats:p>",
