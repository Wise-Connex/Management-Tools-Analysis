The sector reform not only requires a significant amount of working capital, but also people's willingness to pay for the improved infrastructure. This paper serves two purposes – first, it explains the meaning of ‘full-cost of water services’ in urban areas and attempts to provide a framework to value economic and environmental externalities for the urban water supply and use through a case study of India's capital city – Delhi. The second part uses contingent valuation method to establish people's willingness to pay from a survey of 1,100 households for water supply with better quality and reliability. Policy implications are subsequently discussed, keeping in mind cost of provision of water supplies. Also included is the assessment of the cost of unreliable supply (coping cost), which otherwise households are spending in the absence of a reliable supply. The paper shows several instances of reciprocal externality wherein the residents themselves absorb the cost of over-extraction, in terms of declining water tables, and cost of salinity in terms of decentralised treatment cost.</jats:p>",

To do so we posit a theoretical framework that integrates the heretofore distinct operational make–buy literature and the behavioral decision‐making literature. Within the framework three factors influencing the make–buy decision are brought into account: the decision‐maker's perception of supply risk or “strategic vulnerability”, the degree of core competency represented by the product component under consideration and the formality of the information about supply alternatives. The results of a controlled experimental survey show that: strategic vulnerability and core competency do influence the make–buy decision, strategic vulnerability has greater influence than core competency and information formality moderates the make–buy decision when the strategic vulnerability and core competency conditions are mixed. The practical implications of these results include the notion that management can ensure a more rational make–buy decision if they understand the biases that influence the decision and point these biases out to the decision maker.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The design has the groundwater of the New Zealand Canterbury Plains in mind, but would be appropriate for almost any region. In our market design, a market manager will operate a hydrology model and a Linear Program (LP), based on widely available software. The hydrogeology model calculates the effects of users' proposed abstraction rates. The LP finds allocations that maximise the sum of buyer and seller surplus, while satisfying environmental constraints expressed in terms of hydraulic heads and gradients in specific locations. The model produces a price for every location of interest. The price at a given location is the shadow price on the associated user's supply of water. Users are then charged their allocation times the market price at their location, and the market clears. We have written the software and are beginning testing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of the research was to evaluate in-line coagulation to improve performance during ultrafiltration (UF). In-line coagulation means use of coagulants without removal of coagulated solids prior to UF. Performance was evaluated by removal of contaminants (water quality) and by resistance to filtration and recovery of flux after hydraulic or chemical cleaning (water production). We hypothesized that coagulation conditions inappropriate for conventional treatment, in particular under-dosing conditions that produce particles that neither settle nor are removed in rapid sand filters, would be effective for in-line coagulation prior to UF. A variety of pre-treatment processes for UF have been investigated including coagulation, powdered activated carbon (PAC) or granular activated carbon (GAC), adsorption on iron oxides or other pre-formed settleable solid phases, or ozonation. Coagulation pre-treatment is often used for removal of fouling substances prior to NF or RO. It has been reported that effective conventional coagulation conditions produced larger particles and this reduced fouling during membrane filtration by reducing adsorption in membrane pores, increasing cake porosity, and increasing transport of foulants away from the membrane surface. However, aggregates produced under sweep floc conditions were more compressible than for charge neutralization conditions, resulting in compaction when the membrane filtration system was pressurized. It was known that the coagulated suspension under either charge-neutralization or sweep floc condition showed similar steady-state flux under the cross-flow microfiltration mode. Another report on the concept of critical floc size suggested that flocs need to reach a certain critical size before MF, otherwise membranes can be irreversibly clogged by the coagulant solids. The authors were motivated to study the effect of various coagulation conditions on the performance of a membrane filtration system.</jats:p>",

Residential consumers' low sensitivity to prices reduces the effectiveness and desirability of using price signals as a conservation tool. We hypothesize that consumers' sluggish response to prices is partly due to the fact that price information is not conveniently available to them. If the hypothesis is true, including clear price information on water bills should reinforce consumers' sensitivity to price and therefore increase the power of price-based policies in demand management strategies. A standard aggregate water demand model is augmented with qualitative variables describing the informational content of bills and estimated using a cross section of US utilities. Our results indicate that a utility that spells out unit prices on the water bill can achieve the same level of conservation as others with a thirty to forty percent lower rate increase. We find no evidence that non-price information such as history of use or conservation messages has a significant effect on demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the Netherlands, water company sales are being driven down by water conservation measures adopted in households and by the emergence of feasible alternatives to mains water. Because the cost structure is largely fixed, prices are rising as a result. These developments are at odds with the community responsibility which water companies bear in their capacity as quasi-monopolists in relation to those of their customers who do not have access to alternative sources. A number of water companies are therefore working on new pricing structures with which they are seeking to stabilise their income and to reduce the financial appeal of switching to substitutes for mains water. At the same time, incentives designed to ensure sparing use in the consumer market should not disappear. Waterleiding Maatschappij Limburg is working on two new pricing structures. A cost allocation method has been developed for bulk users which can be used as a basis for setting customer-specific water tariffs. In addition, a generic structure is being developed to boost revenues from standing charges. More than previously, this structure makes earnings more dependent on the supply capacity installed on a customer's premises. In this article we discuss the background to these new structures and our initial experience. These pricing structures can also be employed in situations and countries where no noticeable reduction of sales has occurred yet, in order to keep ahead of the developments that are sketched here.</jats:p>",

In addition to reproducing old insights about income effects and marriage market effects on welfare dependency, the model offers new insights regarding the effects on welfare dependency of sex ratios, divorce laws, cohort size, and traditional expectations about marriage and family. The model helps understand why welfare is more common among black women in the USA and offers a new interpretation for past trends in American women's welfare dependency: the big increase in welfare dependency in the late 1960s is interpreted as a baby‐boom phenomenon and recent reductions in welfare dependency are partially seen as the expression of young women's better marriage market opportunities.</jats:p>",

Simplified sewerage is often institutionally and professionally acceptable to sewerage authorities simply because it is a sewerage system, albeit different from conventional sewerage in that it uses small-diameter sewers laid at shallow gradients (e.g., 100-mm sewers at 1 in ∼200). The success of simplified sewerage in Latin America, principally Brazil, has to be replicated on a truly huge scale in Africa and Asia where most of those without adequate sanitation live.

Using as a reference the standard methodology applied by the European Commission to define its intervention rate in a project, this paper focuses on the economic rationale and risks behind the investment subsidies in the sector. The questions asked are (a) what is the economic justification of this kind of investment subsidy and who are the target beneficiaries; (b) what factors may cause these subsidies to reach other economic agents; and (c) what measures would prevent those unexpected transfers of taxpayer resources. The results of the analysis indicate that, although the underlying methodology is economically sound, there is a significant risk that part of the subsidies may end up benefiting economic agents other than those originally targeted. However, this risk can be easily mitigated with some basic checks and balances during the calculation of the intervention rate. The views expressed in this paper are strictly personal.</jats:p>",

In der Automobilbranche, die über feste Lieferantenstrukturen und eingespielte Prozesse verfügt, wird sie in den nächsten zehn Jahren auf voraussichtlich nur noch 23 Prozent sinken [2]. Dies hat relevante Auswirkungen auf die Frage, wie Qualität über die gesamte Supply Chain sichergestellt werden kann. War früher die Qualitätssicherung ein eher unternehmensinternes Thema, gilt es nun, die vom Endkunden geforderten Qualitätsstandards in unternehmensübergreifender Zusammenarbeit in der Wertschöpfungskette sicherzustellen. Dies gilt insbesondere in Zeiten hoher Dynamik und starken Wettbewerbsdrucks, in dem gerade Qualitätsmängel vom Markt nicht mehr toleriert werden und ein großes Risiko für das Unternehmen darstellen.</jats:p>",

It is important to understand the level and pattern of water use in various sectors across the regions for any measures being put into effect. The aim of this study is to enhance the understanding of the factors that influence water demand by examining closely the water use in domestic, industrial and agricultural sectors. Using province level panel data from 1997 to 2003, the examination shows that the regional disparity in the level and pattern of water uses is considerable. The estimation of water demand shows that both economic and climatic variables have significant effects on water demand. The results suggest an income elasticity of 0.42 for the domestic sector, an output elasticity of −0.32 for industrial water use (per unit of output), and an output elasticity of −0.23 for irrigated agriculture (per land area).</jats:p>",

The results show that using a menu of contracts may improve the overall social welfare derived from irrigation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As the socio-economic structure of Tokyo has changed over the last few decades, the water demand also has changed significantly. The bulk customers who use larger amounts of water gradually diminish, and the number of single and small households has increased dramatically. Analysis of the impact of such changes is necessary to give a clearer idea on the future water demand. In this paper, the effects of water tariff revision in 1994 on water consumption were analysed. Using the data obtained from Tokyo Metropolitan Waterworks, it was proved that the total annual water consumption after the change of water tariff structure in 1994 decreased significantly compared to the preceding years. The decreasing trend, however, started two years before the water tariff revision, which coincides with the downturn of the Japanese economy. In order to further analyse the contribution of customers classified by monthly water consumption, the numbers of customers in all water consumption classes were analysed for the years 1994 and 2001. The analysis on changes of the numbers of customers in each water consumption class revealed that the most significant reduction in water consumption took place in a water consumption class IV (31–100 m3/month), which comprises small businesses and large families. The reduction of water consumption by bulk customers with monthly water uses greater than 100 m3 was not so significant. The reduction in water consumption by medium to large users was partly augmented by the increasing number of single and small family users.</jats:p>",

Managers and analysts used this prepackaged multiobjective decision-analysis procedure in facilitated workshops to analyze mid-level supply-chain configuration decisions based on 22 considerations covering cost, quality, customer responsiveness, strategic issues, and operating constraints. These multiattribute utility analyses incorporated uncertainty through expert estimates of probabilities and were implemented in a spreadsheet environment. We applied the approach to five IBM supply-chain decisions, and the results satisfied internal stakeholders that the analysis correctly included financial and nonfinancial considerations along with the associated risks and provided a useful audit trail for executive management. IBM now views this decision-support system as a potential template for future supply-chain decisions. </jats:p>",

All costs and benefits of management scenarios are estimated in terms of the value of wetland functions, which are indirectly valuated with a Contingent Valuation of goods and services they provide. The social impact of introducing the scenarios is also investigated with a stakeholder analysis, based on a survey. Scenario plausibility and acceptability are examined based on the results of the stakeholder analysis; on the other hand, the assessment of the scenarios, using cost-benefit analysis and multi-criteria analysis, provides quantitative performance indicators adequate to incorporate uncertainties and mutable policy objectives. This framework is applied to assess three management scenarios for a Greek wetland. The results indicate that the continuation of existing management practices is the most efficient alternative unless interventions for the restoration of wetland functions are conservatively budgeted, while a wetland drainage scenario performs poorly both in terms of economic efficiency and social impact.</jats:p>",

There are two minimum flow series exhibiting significant downward trend (Maas and Thames) and five exhibiting upward trend (Danube, Elbe, Weser, Reuss and Rhone). Monthly flow series are examined with seasonal Kendall test. A significant downward trend is observed in the monthly flow series of Maas, whereas a significant upward trend is observed in the monthly flow series of Rhone. Meanwhile, significant heterogeneity in trends among different months is observed in three Alpine rivers (Inn, Reuss and Rhone). ADF and KPSS tests which originate from econometrics are introduced to test for nonstationarity in streamflow series at three characteristic timescales.

Tainan County, Taiwan was employed as a case study, and 34 monitoring wells were sampled for routine lab analysis. Lab data of groundwater quality including pH, EC, hardness, chloride, sulfate, ammonia, nitrate, Fe, Mn, As, Zn, TOC and TDS were subjected to factor and cluster analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to reflect those chemical data with the greatest correlation, whereas cluster analysis (CA) was used to evaluate the similarities of water quality in groundwater samples. By utilizing PCA, the identified four major principal components (PCs) representing 78.8% of cumulative variance were able to interpret the most information contained in the data. PC 1 reflects the dominance of salinization, which was characterized by the elevated concentrations of EC, hardness, chloride and sulfate in groundwater. PC 2 with the positive loadings of TOC and pH but negative loading of nitrate is thought to be representative of organic pollution within the aquifer. PC 3 is regarded as mineralization factor on the basis of the loadings of manganese and zinc. PC 4 shows a strong monotonic relationship with ammonia concentration in the groundwater revealing the linkage with agricultural activity. CA results illustrated that coastal area was partially salinized as a result of seawater intrusion and part of salinization zone was also subjected to the impact of mineral dissolution.</jats:p>",

In this experiment, we studied the nutrient supply reaction of four apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Idared and Jonathan Csány) under different N and NPK doses. The following fruit quality parameters were studied: fruit diameter, fruit height, fruit weight, flesh firmness, colour-coverage and we studied the density of foliage.The research results showed that N fertilization has a great effect on fruit quality. This is shown in the cases of increase of fruit size (fruit diameter, fruit height, fruit weight). The increase is proportional with the N doses, accordingly the highest positive difference was observed by using 100 kg/ha N doses. It is important to note that moderate N doses (75 kg/ha) plus P and K additions also had positive effects. There approached the values of 100 kg/ha N, and even exceeded its values in the cultivar Golden Reinders. The increased N doses enlarged the standard deviation, on the other hand, this parameter was low in the cases of balanced NPK fertilization. The nutrient supply increased the vegetative area (density of foliage) in addition to the generative parts, in particular only N fertilizer. However the denser foliage hindered the growth of fruit weight and colour-coverage, and also decreased the fruit quality and the flesh firmness of cultivars, which have a negative effect on storageability.A linear correlation was demonstrated between the fruit weight and colour-coverage, or between fruit weight and flesh firmness. The character of their relationship was similar, but the direction differed: high fruit weight was with high colour-coverage, but with low flesh firmness.</jats:p>"

Results show that data of most studies fitted well in the first-order Chick-Watson disinfection kinetics. Viruses require the highest UV fluence and the double-stranded DNA adenovirus is by far the most persistent species with an UV fluence requirement of 125 mJ/cm2 for 3 log inactivation. Translation of these k-values to full-scale UV systems requires accurate fluence assessment in these continuous flow systems with fluence distribution, variations in water quality (UV transmittance) and operational aspects like lamp age and fouling. Determination of the reduction equivalent fluence or REF with seeded model organisms is an accepted methodology to validate UV systems. Frequently used model organisms F-specific RNA phage MS2 and spores of Bacillus subtilis have low k-values. For validation of systems with low fluence requirement to inactivate UV sensitive organisms, alternative model organisms are suggested. Further research is needed to verify the potential of REF verification of full-scale systems by monitoring inactivation of indigenous spores (anaerobic or aerobic) with large volume sampling.</jats:p>",

The results show that nitrate at 30 mg/L could be removed from solution within 30 min under the conditions of 2 g/L Fe0 and 200 mL/min CO2 flow rate. Additionally, nitrite was not detected in treated solution, whereas ammonium is the predominant nitrogen-containing species. The normalized residual nitrate concentration decreased with increasing nitrate concentration (2.18–24.19 mg N/L). Nitrate removal was inhibited significantly in the presence of humic acid. Comparing operation modes, NO3− reduction efficiency with increasing number of batch operations in Mode 2 (treated solution was emptied and refilled with freshly prepared solution for the next batch treatment, containing the same level of nitrate as the previous batch) is better than that with Mode 1 (treated solution was retained in the reactor and spiked with concentrated nitrate solution to raise nitrate concentration to a level close to the one in the previous batch). However, to guarantee satisfactory nitrate removal in batch operation mode, zero-valent iron supplementation needs to be taken into consideration. For example, the nitrate removal efficiency without Fe0 supplementation is decreasing in the third batch, compared with those with supplements of 0.25 and 1 g/L. According to a preliminary study, the undesired end-product ammonium can be removed from solution by about 95% within 22.5 h with an air flow rate of 500 mL/min and a solution pH around 12; the ammonium concentration decreased from 6.4 to 0.3 mg 12 N/L. Stripping time can be further shortened by increasing air flow rate and using an efficient air diffuser.</jats:p>",

Based on the results of extensive simulation experiments, we proposed a number of changes. We recommended that the army should open the existing fuel-supply system and that it establish commercial use in peacetime to obtain additional operating revenue. New trigger levels (or fuel-replenishment policies) for wartime allow the fuel-supply system to survive much longer even in the most severe war conditions.

First, the ion exchange equilibrium data of As(V) and NO3− on a strong anionic resin in chloride form were obtained and described with a model based on the mass action law. Namely, assuming ideal behaviour for both solution and resin phase, the thermodynamic constant of the As(V)/Cl− and NO3−/Cl− ion exchange equilibria were estimated by fitting of experimental data. Then, these equilibrium constants were used to predict the ion exchange behaviour of the ternary system As(V)/NO3−/Cl−, providing a rather good agreement with experimental results. The ion exchange equilibria involving sulphate ions were also studied, showing a very high affinity to the resin phase. This behaviour did not allow a quantitative robust modelling of the equilibrium pattern. The results discussed in this paper represent a first step toward the development of a comprehensive modelling of the ion exchange process for the removal of As(V) from surface and groundwater in the presence of competitive, naturally occurring anions.</jats:p>",

In the same literature, average annual operating costs are reported to be 3.8% of replacement costs. However, if a long-term interest rate of 3% is consistently applied, this value increases to 4.7% for small countries and 5.5% for large ones. Assuming that alternative wastewater systems will only be accepted if their costs are similar to existing ones, the possible investments for alternative wastewater treatment technologies are calculated. Between 640 and 2,170 US$/cap can be invested in new technologies for scenarios without a sewer system. The corresponding figures for scenarios with sewer systems are between 260 and 680 US$/cap.

These interactions include steric and electrostatic effects that depend on compound properties (e.g., molecular weight (MW) and ionic charge) and membrane properties (e.g., molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) and surface charge (zeta potential)), with the added influence of membrane operating conditions (e.g., recovery). This paper summarizes the rejection trends by several NF and RO membranes for a wide range of organic micropollutants based on hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (octanol-water partition coefficient, KOW) and charge (neutral or negative), and a more narrow range of inorganic micropollutants in the form of oxyanions (chromate, arsenate and perchlorate) of varying MW and charge. While RO provided greater rejections of micropollutants than NF, observed NF rejections were, in many cases, significant. For oxyanions, rejection was mainly influenced by ionic charge and MW. RO properties generally had little influence while MWCO and zeta potential were both significantly influential for NF. For organic micropollutants, with exception of RO versus NF classifications, membrane properties were less influential than compound properties with greater rejections generally observed with increasing MW, KOW, and (negative) charge.</jats:p>",

This paper outlines a quick and practical method for assessing economic intervention frequency (and associated budgetary and volumetric parameters) for an active leakage control policy based on regular survey. Calculations are based on three key parameters: natural rate of rise of unreported leakage, marginal cost of water, and cost of intervention. It is hoped this will encourage Utilities that do not currently undertake active leakage control to adopt an ongoing basic active leakage control policy which can be simply demonstrated as being economic for their own situation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection has increasingly been used as an alternative method to replace conventional chlorine disinfection as it has been found to be a more efficient disinfection method. As UV disinfection only damages the nucleic acids of the microorganisms to prevent replication, there is a possibility of microorganisms repairing the damage sites. As few studies have investigated the reactivation of microorganisms after exposure to medium-pressure UV disinfection, it is essential for reactivation related to medium-pressure UV disinfection to be studied as medium-pressure lamps are gaining in popularity. Besides, disinfection by-products (DBPs) produced by UV disinfection have been discovered recently and may serve as a carbon source in the finished water, resulting in regrowth of the bacteria. It is therefore important to know the regrowth potential of bacteria with the existence of DBPs. In this study, the repair and regrowth of Escherichia coli after UV disinfection were investigated. Results showed that E. coli underwent photo repair (up to 5 log under fluorescent light conditions) more significantly than dark repair (up to 0.8 log in terms of bacterial count increase). The repair was generally found to be higher at low doses. At the same UV dose, it seems medium-pressure UV irradiation is able to control the repair to a lesser extent. In addition, the bacterial regrowth potential was studied with the addition of DBPs typically found in UV processes, such as acetic acid and formaldehyde. The maximum increase in bacterial count was found to be 0.3 log. Generally, the level of regrowth was insignificant compared with the increase of bacterial count due to bacterial repair.</jats:p>",

In the DOPFR, ozone is dosed by intensively mixing a dissolved ozone water flow (side stream) with a test water flow (mainstream). The side stream is pre-treated to remove bromide and DOC and to lower the pH. For full-scale application of the DOPFR concept, it is most cost effective to apply the smallest possible side stream. This research is done to establish the effect of decreasing the ratio of the dissolved ozone side stream to the mainstream from 1:10 to 1:25, by increasing the ozone concentration and decreasing the flow of the side stream. The results show that the dosing ratio has no influence on the bromate formation in the ozone dosing range of 0.7–1.4 mg/l. The gross ozone dosages that are currently applied at the drinking water treatment plant Leiduin are 0.8–1.0 mg/l. This means that for application of dissolved ozone dosing at Leiduin the amount of ozone that can be dissolved in the side stream will be the limiting factor for the minimal flow of the dissolved ozone side stream.</jats:p>",

This work evaluates the applicability of the ion exchange membrane bioreactor (IEMB) concept for their removal. The IEMB concept combines the transport of anionic pollutants, through a dense mono-anion permselective membrane, with their simultaneous biodegradation to harmless products by a suitable microbial culture in a separated biocompartment. The transport of the pollutant counter-ions (anions) is governed by the Donnan equilibrium principle and, therefore, it is possible to enhance it by using a more concentrated driving counter-ion (e.g. chloride) added to the biocompartment. The IEMB process proved to selectively remove nitrate and perchlorate to concentrations below the recommended levels of 4 ppb for ClO4− and 25 ppm of NO3−, from a model polluted stream containing 100 ppb of ClO4− and 60 ppm of NO3−. Transport studies, made under Donnan dialysis conditions, showed bromate fluxes comparable to those obtained for nitrate under similar experimental conditions. However, the rate of biological reduction of bromate was about one order of magnitude slower than that of nitrate.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, as firms move towards closer and more integrated supply chains it is argued that socialization is an increasingly important mechanism in facilitating and enhancing the supply integration process. This paper has taken these activities and embedded them in the theory of ‘socialization’ and supply chain integration. The authors propose and test a model on how buyers can use the concepts of supply chain integration and socialization to achieve improved supplier communication and operational performance, and therefore, to improve the buyer's perceived level of the supplier's contractual conformance. The findings reveal that socialization is essential for the development of any significant business relationship and the enhancement of a supply integration strategy.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Our analytical modelling framework incorporates optimal pricing and stocking decisions for both echelons in the presence of stochastic demand and random delivery times. We focus on understanding how these decisions for the chain are affected by its management paradigm (centralized or decentralized), and its business characteristics—price sensitivity, demand uncertainty, and delivery time variability. A novel combination of transformations enables us to analyze the framework and determine the unique optimal choices for centralized and wholesale price-based decentralized supply chains. More detailed investigation reveals that, in general, the business characteristics influence both the behavior and the optimal values of the decision variables, while the management paradigm primarily governs the optimal values. We illustrate the significance of these results in terms of how managers should tailor their decisions to align with their business requirements. Subsequently, comparison of the optimal profits between the channel partners and the management paradigms provides implications for decentralization strategy. A decentralized chain is most inefficient for moderately price-sensitive customers and uncertain environments, but is relatively more effective when dealing with mature products. We propose a contracting scheme that can improve the decentralized chain profit in reliable delivery time settings. The salient modelling insight of this paper is that ignoring the randomness of delivery time trivializes the interaction between pricing and stocking decisions. On the other hand, from a managerial viewpoint, we establish that optimal pricing policies provide the means to increase revenue and also act as strategic tools for tackling uncertainty. </jats:p>",

Agriculture is the main consumer of water worldwide but in many countries it is also a very fragile socioeconomic sector. Within this sense, the paper examines the effect of irrigation water pricing on water demand and on farmers' income. The derivation of a demand function through a linear programming model is the most common approach as it is relatively easy to be implemented and has limited data requirements. However, this method does not allow for a possible reduction of water consumption from the maximum level of water productivity in order to attain the maximum economic outcome. Thus, a non-linear model was formulated in order to estimate the best allocation of water and land resources for each crop. The results show significant differences between the two models (the linear and the non-linear), especially at high water prices.</jats:p>",

The 10,000 MWCO membrane removed less virus than the two 100,000 MWCO or the 300,000 MWCO membranes. The data from this study suggests that MWCO and specific flux may not, in all cases, be a good predictor of virus removal.</jats:p>",

Up to date, drinking water pricing policy has been based only on the recovery of the economic cost and in some cases neither this. Therefore, domestic water is not priced taking into account its real cost. Based on data provided by 74 DEYA representing 2.10 million inh, the average water price is estimated to be 1.19 €/m3. Analysis of these data reveals a deviation of 41.67% from the real cost. The relation of consumers with the Enterprise, but also that of management and employees, should be a bidirectional relation, in order to be comprehensible by all. Thus, an agreement that will point out that the most excellent quality of water presupposes water policy which will consider sustainability and the current requirements of the Enterprise and of course the consumers should be established between them.</jats:p>",

Research by the CMP group identifies that in any particular context there are multiple exchange paradigms present. That is, different combinations of marketing practices are possible. The food supply chain is characterized by highly interdependent partnerships and a span of relationship types (Hogarth-Scott, 1999). The aim of this study is to compare and contrast transactional and relational marketing practices within the Dutch pork supply chain and to consider the contextual factors influencing such practices. The year of reference for this study is 2003-2004. Using a case study approach, we identify that all chain players practice transactional and relational marketing practices concurrently. Previous studies have indicated that the Dutch pork supply chain can be characterized by general mistrust; our study indicates that the lack of trust is primarily towards slaughterhouses and retailers. In line with the literature on business relationships this can be explained by a power imbalance and information asymmetry in the supply chain. </jats:p>",

Students responded favorably to the on-line simulation and were very willing to reflect on what they learned about how they made decisions, how worked under conditions of uncertainty, how they treated information and how they worked in the supply chain environment.

For comparison, a coagulation process was also used as a pretreatment of UF or MF membrane filtration. Moreover, the membrane fouling potential was identified using different fractions and molecular weights (MW) of organic matter. From the removal property of MW organic matter by the coagulation process for the sample water NOM and AOM, the removal efficiencies of high MW organic matter were much higher than those of low MW organic matter. It was shown that the removal efficiency of high MW organic matter (more than 10 kDa) was lower than that of low MW organic matter for the MIEX® process. For the change of permeate flux by the pretreatment process, the MIEX®-UF process showed high removal efficiency of organic matter compared with the coagulation-UF processes, but a high reduction rate of permeate flux was presented through the reduction of removal efficiency of high MW organic matter. From sequential filtration test results to examine the effect of MW of organic matter on membrane fouling, we found that the membrane fouling occurred with high MW organic matter, and the DOC of organic matter less than 0.5 mg/L was acting as the membrane foulant. In sample water composed of low MW organic matter (less than 10 kDa), because the low MW organic matter of less than 10 kDa has a high removal efficiency by MIEX®, a low reduction rate of permeate flux is obtained compared with the coagulation-UF processes. In summary, research on the physical/chemical characteristics of original water is needed before a membrane pretreatment process is selected, and a pertinent pretreatment process should be used based on the physical/chemical characteristics of the original water.</jats:p>",

Its worldwide trading is increasing, especially in the US and European markets who pay a high price but demand a better quality and higher standards. While the Pakistani mango production is increasing, the export stands at a negligible 4.5% and that too to the low paying markets of Gulf states specially Dubai. This paper explores why Pakistani mangoes fail to be exported to high paying markets. The focus of this research is the application of Michael Porter’s Value Chain Model to analyze the value chain mechanism from the production to end consumption of mangoes. Out of the five value chain components, two components, Operations and Outbound logistics, have nbeen analyzed through quantitative research techniques and the rest through qualitative. Action research methodology was adopted to develop this case study. Results of this research show that the weak value chain mechanism that exists in Pakistan has hindered in meeting international mango demand. Recommendations have been made to improve the value chain mechanism that may assist Pakistani producers and marketers to meet the quality standards and play a more forceful role in the mango market in the US and Europe.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply chain management has seen a wide application since the 1990s in satisfying diversified customer demands. To remain competitive on a global scale, manufacturing companies greatly increased the scope of their outsourcing activities. Consequently, supplier selection has become a highly prioritized activity with major significance to companies. Previous studies of supplier selection show that there are commonly accepted supplier selection criteria. However, there are insufficient studies on the association between the manufacturer's criteria of supplier selection and why it wins orders from its customers. Studies on the differences of supplier selection criteria among manufacturers from different countries are insufficient either. Through empirical study this paper tries to find out the association between manufacturer's criteria in supplier selection and how it wins orders. Considerations of supplier selection criteria in different national background are compared and the consistency of supplier selection criteria and competitive priority is analyzed. </jats:p>",

Case presentation: A succesfully treated case of a 45-year-old mother of 2 children with Bland-White-Garland syndrome and concomitant severe mitral regurgitation is presented. Subsequent therapy consisted of ligation of the anomalous origin of the left coronary artery, anastomosis of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending branch and mitral valve replacement. Continuous blood flow from the left coronary artery ostium during extracorporeal circulation and aorta clamping suggested systemic collateral supply. Conclusions: Recognition and diagnosis of Bland-White-Garland syndrome is important due to its potentially life-threatening complications.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

In this context, contingent valuation method (CVM) is applied to evaluate a policy of providing better water supply with improved quality and reliability in unplanned settlements of Delhi. Willingness to pay (WTP) questions are used to value a specific outcome of a policy intended to assure a reliable water supply that has no health risk of contamination. The estimation from linear utility models assert that the proposed changes would provide positive net benefits to customers who are otherwise incurring considerable amounts of “coping cost” in the absence of a reliable water supply.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The evaluation of water bodies “at risk” of not achieving the Water Framework Directive's (WFD) goal of “good status” begs the question of how big a risk is acceptable before a programme of measures should be implemented. Documentation of expert judgement and statistical uncertainty in pollution budgets and water quality modelling, combined with Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian belief networks, make it possible to give a probabilistic interpretation of “at risk”. Combined with information on abatement costs, a cost-effective ranking of measures based on expected costs and effect can be undertaken. Combined with economic valuation of water quality, the definition of “disproportionate cost” of abatement measures compared to benefits of achieving “good status” can also be given a probabilistic interpretation. Explicit modelling of uncertainty helps visualize where research and consulting efforts are most critical for reducing uncertainty. Based on data from the Morsa catchment in South-Eastern Norway, this paper discusses the relative merits of using Bayesian belief networks when integrating biophysical modelling results in the benefit-cost analysis of derogations and cost-effectiveness ranking of abatement measures under the WFD.</jats:p>",

This research aims to investigate this issue by comparing case study sites in the US (Poudre River, Fort Collins, Colorado) and the UK (Albert Reservoir, Halifax) across periods of elevated organic levels. During the period of April to June 2004 in raw Poudre River water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels increased rapidly from 3.5 to 7.4 mg L−1 as a direct result of the spring snowmelt runoff, whereas at Albert reservoir, which is a moorland peat catchment, DOC concentrations varied between 7.8 and 10.1 mg L−1 during the period of January to March 2004. NOM is a highly heterogeneous mixture of organic compounds that vary with regards to acidity, molecular weight, hydrophobicity and charge density. XAD resin adsorption techniques were employed to fractionate the water into its hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. Results revealed that NOM composition and characteristics can vary both temporally and spatially, with increased DOC concentrations associated with both an increase in hydrophobic content and charge density. Optimising coagulation based on a zeta potential range (−10 to +5 mV) produced stable average DOC residuals for both locations, although the exact value is also dependent on the hydrophilic composition of the water and the coagulant used, with alum removing approximately 0.5 mg L−1 less DOC compared with ferric.</jats:p>",

The magnitude of this contribution has become more evident over that same time period with the observed magnitude of the low‐energy ionospheric supply increasing as the measurement techniques improved. Estimates based on Dynamics Explorer measurements in the mid‐1980s suggested that the ionospheric plasma supply is sufficient to populate the plasmasphere, plasma trough, plasma sheet, and magnetotail lobes. Recent measurements from the Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment on the Polar spacecraft have been used in conjunction with an ion trajectory model to reexamine the process and magnitude of the ionospheric supply of magnetospheric plasma. These measurements reveal the energy, pitch angle, and flux characteristics of the upward flowing polar wind over broad regions of the high‐latitude ionosphere. Onboard measurement of spacecraft potential is found to be a fundamental element in interpreting the measured ion outflow. Newly derived polar wind fluxes are determined to be near 6.0 × 10<jats:sup>7</jats:sup> ions cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 5000 km altitude during local winter and magnetically quiet conditions. Using the measured ionospheric source characteristics in combination with the trajectory code reveals the nature of the ionospheric/magnetosphere filling process and shows that the ionospheric source is sufficient to supply the observed densities and energies of the plasma sheet and magnetotail lobes. Many of the ionospheric particles are further transformed to ring current energies and locations after circulation through the plasma sheet. This measurement/calculation approach is able to show which regions of the high‐latitude ionosphere are important for plasma sheet/ring current filling. The ionospheric sources used in the calculations include the dominant polar wind, the cleft ion fountain, and the auroral zone.</jats:p>",

Using the <jats:italic>beer distribution game</jats:italic> in a controlled laboratory setting, we test four behavioral hypotheses – bounded rationality, experiential learning, systems learning, and organizational learning – by systematically manipulating training and communication protocols. We find that order variability decreases significantly in a setting in which participants start with hands‐on experience, and are then allowed to formulate team strategies collaboratively. This result indicates that while training may improve individuals’ knowledge and understanding of the system, it does not improve supply chain performance unless supply chain partners are allowed to communicate and share this knowledge. Our results indicate that the bullwhip effect is, at least in part, caused by insufficient coordination between supply chain partners.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The objectives of this study were to use the NRC-2001 model with inputs based on in situ and mobile bag techniques to (1) predict the potential nutrient supply to dairy cows using an exampled feed- whole lupin seeds that were systematically toasted and (2) quantitatively determine the effects of toasting (which shifted degradation of protein from the rumen to the abomasum and small intestine without changing intestinal digestion) and optimal toasting conditions by the NRC-2001 model. The quantitative predictions were made in terms of: (1) rumen undegraded and degraded feed protein, (2) truly absorbed undegraded protein, (3) potential microbial protein synthesized in the rumen from rumen available protein or (4) from total digestible nutrients (TDN), (5) truly absorbed rumen synthesized microbial protein, (6) truly absorbed rumen endogenous protein, (7) total metabolizable protein (MP), as well as (8) the protein degradation balance (PDB). The results show that using the NRC-2001 model with inputs based on in situ and mobile bag techniques, the predicted PDB and MP supply to dairy cattle was significantly improved. However, no optimal condition could be obtained from this study due to high PDB values (&gt;48 g kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DM) in all the treatments, predicted by the model. With toasting, temperature and/or duration could go still higher than 136°C and/or longer than 15 min to further prevent potential N loss in the rumen if total tract digestion is not depressed. More study is needed. However, the results differed from that published with the DVE/OEB system (a non-TDN-based model) although the two models had significant correlations with high R (&gt;0.99) values. Using the NRC model, the overall mean for MP was higher (+10 g kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DM), but the PDB values were lower (-12 g kg<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup> DM) in comparison with that predicted by the non-TDN based model for the whole lupin seeds.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            The mammalian fetus is unique in its dependence during gestation on the supply of maternal nutrients through the placenta. Maternal supply and fetal demand for nutrients need to be fine tuned for healthy growth and development of the fetus along its genetic trajectory. An altered balance between supply and demand can lead to deviations from this trajectory with long-term consequences for health. We have previously shown that in a knockout lacking the imprinted placental-specific\n            <jats:italic>Igf2</jats:italic>\n            transcript (P0), growth of the placenta is compromised from early gestation but fetal growth is normal until late gestation, suggesting functional adaptation of the placenta to meet the fetal demands. Here, we show that placental transport of glucose and amino acids are increased in the\n            <jats:italic>Igf2</jats:italic>\n            P0\n            <jats:sup>+/-</jats:sup>\n            null and that this up-regulation of transport occurs, at least in part, through increased expression of the transporter genes\n            <jats:italic>Slc2a3</jats:italic>\n            and\n            <jats:italic>Slc38a4</jats:italic>\n            , the imprinted member of the System A amino acid transporter gene family. Decreasing fetal demand genetically by removal of fetal\n            <jats:italic>Igf2</jats:italic>\n            abolished up-regulation of both transport systems and reduced placental System A amino acid transport activity and expression of\n            <jats:italic>Slc38a2</jats:italic>\n            in late gestation. Our results provide direct evidence that the placenta can respond to fetal demand signals through regulation of expression of specific placental transport systems. Thus, crosstalk between an imprinted growth demand gene (\n            <jats:italic>Igf2</jats:italic>\n            ) and placental supply transporter genes (\n            <jats:italic>Slc38a4</jats:italic>\n            ,\n            <jats:italic>Slc38a2</jats:italic>\n            , and\n            <jats:italic>Slc2a3</jats:italic>\n            ) may be a component of the genetic control of nutrient supply and demand during mammalian development.\n          </jats:p>",
