      "abstract": "<jats:p>A closed-circuit system is described which has been designed for testing the transonic blading of turbomachinery. The system is installed as the principal faci ity at the S.R.C. Turbomachinery Laboratory. A 1 ½-MW motor-driven compressor installation can be run continuously to produce air speeds up to Mach 1.35 in cascades of 80-cm2 throat area. The overall design of the buildings in relation to the problems of noise and vibration is considered. The choice of plant components and the typical operation of the system are described, including the flexibility achieved by running the compressors singly, in series or in parallel. A PDP-12 computer is used for on-line data analysis, with presentation of compressor characteristics. Details are given of the instrumentation employed including double-pass Schlieren, remote-controlled probe-traversing gear, and the scanning of transducer signals. Typical results from the testing of transonic linear cascades of turbine blades are given. The testing of annular cascades of vibrated blades is also described.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Symptoms of iron deficiency appear very frequently in the calcareous soils which represent a major part of the agricultural soils of Israel; therefore a search for novel carriers of iron is constantly conducted. Previous studies showed that Cu, Zn, and Mn, attached to modified montmorillonite, can effectively replace salts and chelates as carriers for micronutrient elements for plants.</jats:p><jats:p>In this research, the effect of iron attached to montmorillonite clay on element uptake and yield of plants was compared to that of commonly used iron sulphate or EDTA and EDDHA chelates. In the greenhouse, beans (<jats:italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</jats:italic> L.) were grown in two calcareous, (Rendzina), iron deficient soils and were treated with either FeSO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, Fe<jats:sup>+3</jats:sup>‐EDTA, Fe<jats:sup>+3</jats:sup>‐EDDHA, or Fe<jats:sup>+2</jats:sup> bound to montmorillonite clay. The rates of iron added varied from 15 to 60 mg Fe/kg soil for the salt and 3 to 12 mg Fe/kg soil for the chelates and the clay forms. It was found that Fe<jats:sup>+3</jats:sup>‐clay and Fe<jats:sup>+3</jats:sup> in chelates, added at equivalent rates, supplied iron in comparable amounts; FeSO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>, added at the conventional rates which are five to ten times higher than that added as clay‐ and chelate‐bound iron, caused similar or lower uptake and yields. Moreover, the slow release of iron from Fe‐clay, even when supplied in high rates, prevented excessive iron uptake which otherwise, as in the case of the chelate FeEDDHA, interfered with plant development. It is suggested that iron attached to mortmorillonite clay can be used as an efficient source of iron for plants grown in calcareous soils.</jats:p>",

Three elements — Cu, Zn, and Mn — in combination in various rates, and in three forms, as sulphates, EDTA chelates, or attached to montmorillonite clay, were applied to two micronutrient deficient sandy soils. Tomato (<jats:italic>Lycopersicum esculentum</jats:italic> Mill.) and beans (<jats:italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</jats:italic> L.) were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions in the treated soils. The application of micronutrient elements, in all of the forms used, significantly increased plant yields. In addition, the supply of micronutrients significantly increased the elemental concentrations of the plants. However the highest concentration of elements found in the plants did not always correspond to the highest yields. Generally the lower levels of addition of combined micronutrients improved the growth conditions considerably and the higher ones were less effective. The clay carrier was similar to the expensive chelates and generally more efficient than the salts in element supply and this resulted in better yield responses. The optimal rate of application of the combined elements for dry yield production in tomato plants in the soils studied appeared to be: 0.5 mg Cu, 1.6 mg Zn, and 2.5 mg Mn per kg of soil for the clay and chelate forms and somewhat higher for the salts.</jats:p>",
