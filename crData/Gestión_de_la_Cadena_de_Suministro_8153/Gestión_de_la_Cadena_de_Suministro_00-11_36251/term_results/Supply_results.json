      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Denmark has a well-developed natural gas distribution grid and during the last decade a large number of decentralised CHP-plants (&amp;gt; 2000 MW total capacity) have been built around the country for industrial applications and district heating. The largest small scale CHP has an installed electrical capacity of 99 MW, while most of the plants have capacities from some hundred kW to 10 MW. The larger plants are all based on gas turbines while the smaller plants predominantly use lean-burn reciprocating engines. On the whole this development has been very successful and is supported by tax incitements for small power producers. Lean-burn engines have, however, some problems, e.g. with regard to UHC, so the emergence of small and micro-gas turbines from a number of producers offers an interesting possibility to extend the use of gas turbines down to the smaller plant sizes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Two cases have been investigated involving smaller industries with a process steam demand.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The energy systems investigated are based on a 100 kW recuperated gas turbine (Turbec T100) and a 600 kW simple cycle gas turbine (Volvo Aero VT600). The steam and hot water is produced in a Waste Heat Recovery boiler (WHR). To obtain the sufficient steam production and sufficient steam quality it is necessary to use supplementary firing.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The analysis shows that a recuperated gas turbine has no particular advantages for industrial steam production plants. The low exhaust temperature after the recuperator is not sufficient to produce steam of proper quality.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>When comparing a CHP plant with a natural gas fired steam boiler, it is found that a simple cycle gas turbine is more suitable for steam producing industrial energy supply systems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Even if the net electric efficiency is lower for a simple cycle gas turbine, one can get a quite high, marginal net electric efficiency of about 60% (LHV) when replacing a gas fired boiler with a steam producing industrial CHP-plant. The marginal net electric efficiency is based on comparing the actual CHP plant with an existing gas fired steam producing boiler with an efficiency of 90% (LHV). This is a very high net electric efficiency compared to a centralised power plant.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The study shows that there is little doubt that CHP systems based on gas turbines are functional, efficient and environmentally friendly, but it is very difficult to achieve a satisfactory economy with the present relations between gas costs, electricity prices and gas turbine prices.</jats:p>",

The conceptual framework is generated and based on the empirical findings from a case study of a Swedish car manufacturer in the automotive industry. Step two is deductive in terms of testing in other industries the generated conceptual framework that originates from step one. The conceptual framework consists of two dimensions, namely categories of disturbance and sources of disturbance. Principally, categories of disturbance are divided into quantitative and qualitative disturbances. Sources of disturbance are divided into atomistic (direct) and holistic (indirect) disturbances. In addition, the specific criteria of an inbound logistic flow indicate how vulnerability in supply chains is proposed to be analysed according to the developed conceptual framework of vulnerability.</jats:p>",

It tests various different strategies for improving customer service via the MIT Beer Game. Four distinct strategies are considered. “Electronic point of sales (EPOS)”, where marketplace information is forwarded to all players throughout the supply chain; “Excel”, where the stock levels in all echelons are controlled by the factory; “Emergency transhipments”, where an express transportation route bypassing an echelon in the supply chain is permitted; “Eliminate”, where an echelon is removed from the supply chain. The Beer Game strategies are also studied via a simulation exercise. Results show that the Excel strategy is flawed, whereas the EPOS strategy has a strong impact on inventory cost, Emergency transhipments has a strong impact on customer service level and Eliminate results in less stock for an improved customer service level. Combinations of the three viable strategies are also tested. This paper concludes that the three strategies can be integrated to significantly improve supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

The first production mode is relatively cheap but requires a long lead time while the second is expensive but offers quick turnaround. We focus on contracts of the form (w<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, w<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, b) where w<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> is the wholesale price offered for production mode i and b is a return price offered for items left over at the end of the season. We find that such a contract can coordinate the manufacturer and distributor to act in the best interest of the channel. The pricing conditions needed to ensure an efficient solution vary depending on the degree of demand forecast improvement between periods and the manufacturer's access to forecast information. We also examine whether these conditions ensure a Pareto optimal solution with respect to two traditional production settings. </jats:p>",

Goals also included increasing revenue, positioning for managed care contracting, improving access to supplies and medications, use tracking and inventory adjustment, documenting and tracking, accurate charging, and enhancing patient and staff member satisfaction. Space efficiencies achieved via automated distribution enabled planners to save one OR, which generates approximately $1 million in revenue annually.

Up until now, we have been discussing hardware product realization, based upon our traditional concept that their functions remain fixed all through their life cycles. But if we look at software products, they are constantly customized and kept up to date. In other words, their functions are growing even after they are delivered to the customer. If such concepts as CALS, Rapid Prototyping, etc can be integrated into this concept and merged into one, then we would be able to realize value chain management in this sense.</jats:p>",

If the relationship is too restrictive, flexibility will be difficult to achieve and, if it is too lenient the risk of opportunism will be present. This paper provides a framework for understanding how buyer‐supplier relationships have evolved over the past two decades from transaction processes based on arms‐length agreements to collaborative processes based on trust and information sharing. To achieve this objective, buyer‐supplier relationships are reviewed from the perspectives of transaction cost theory, strategy‐structure theory and resource‐based theory of the firm. Findings from early supply chain research are contrasted with the findings of more current research to provide a better understanding of how these relationships have changed. Current theory is extended by offering two proposals that test the influence of trust and information sharing and a third proposal that rejects the notion that supply chain alliances lead to monopolistic practices.</jats:p>",

Implementing and managing an alliance is harder than deciding to collaborate. This paper explores the topic empirically through a study of one form of alliance – supply chain partnering. It presents an interaction model of partnering which shows seven contextual factors that shape, and are shaped by, human action. This context can both help and hinder the emergence of co‐operative behaviour. The model is illustrated through a case study of two organizations (customer and supplier) attempting to co‐operate more closely. The case shows how the cultural and other differences between the parties at first caused difficulty. Actions were taken to change aspects of the context to facilitate more co‐operative behaviour. Improving interpersonal relations led to further actions to create more formal mechanisms which would support future co‐operation. These appear to have contributed to the relationship exceeding the initial expectations of the partners. The interaction model illuminates both the content and process of supply chain partnering.</jats:p>",

Our results, from an analysis of 212 Québec IPOs between 1983 and 1997, indicate that the choice of an auditor at the time of an IPO is significantly affected by the company's risk, size, and geographical dispersion. They also suggest that the Québec audit market is segmented between three types of service providers: the Big Six, the National firms and the Local firms. Local firms audit small local companies with low risk, National firms audit large local companies with moderate risk, and the Big Six audit large geographically dispersed companies with high risk.</jats:p>",

Intervening periods of lower lake levels and relative sand starvation apparently permitted forestation and soil development at the sites we studied. While late Holocene lake-level change led to development and preservation of prominent foredunes along the southern and southwestern shores of Lake Michigan, the modern dune landscape of the eastern shore is dominated by perched dunes formed during ∼150-yr lake highstands over the past 1500 yr.</jats:p>",

Aortic balloon occlusion during CPR may also augment myocardial and cerebral blood flow and can be used as a central route for the administration of resuscitative drugs. We hypothesized that, as compared with intravenously administered vasopressin, the administration of this drug above the site of an aortic balloon occlusion would result in a greater increase in cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during CPR and after restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Twenty piglets were subjected to 5 min of ventricular fibrillation followed by 8 min of closed‐chest CPR and were treated with 0.4 U kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> boluses of vasopressin intravenously (the IV‐vasopressin group with sham aortic balloon) or above the site for an aortic balloon occlusion (the balloon‐vasopressin group). The aortic balloon catheter was inflated in the latter group 1 min after commencement of CPR and was deflated within 1 min after ROSC. Systemic blood pressures, cerebral cortical blood flow, cerebral tissue pH and PCO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> were monitored continuously and the cerebral oxygen extraction ratio was calculated.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> During CPR, arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure were greater in the balloon‐vasopressin group, as compared with the IV‐vasopressin group. These pressures did not differ between the groups after ROSC. Cerebral cortical blood flow was not significantly greater in the balloon‐vasopressin group during CPR, whereas significantly higher cortical blood flow levels were recorded after ROSC. Cerebral tissue pH decreased in the IV‐vasopressin group during the post‐resuscitation hypoperfusion period. In contrast, decreasing pressures during the hypoperfusion period did not result in increasing tissue acidosis in the balloon‐vasopressin group.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> During CPR, intra‐aortic vasopressin combined with aortic balloon occlusion resulted in significantly greater perfusion pressures but not in greater cerebral cortical blood flow. After ROSC, however, a greater increase in cortical blood flow was recorded in the balloon‐vasopressin group, even though the aortic balloon was deflated and perfusion pressures did not differ between the groups.

The objective is to quantify these contributions. We examine the effect of urban sprawl and car ownership growth on the share of trip market between public transport and car. In the Lyon Conurbation, during each of the last two decades, the development of localisation of trips explains a decrease of 6 to 9% of the share of public transport depending on decade and study area ; while the increase in car ownership (with a fix spatial structure of flow) explains a smaller decrease between 1 to 4%. This quantification can inform decision-makers about probable changes in the market share of public transport and the importance of certain factors in these changes. It makes it possible to construct more realistic modal split scenarios and assess the scale of the effort that is required if only to maintain the car in its present position with a view to achieving sustainable development.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">A l'heure où de nombreuses agglomérations en Europe cherchent à réduire ou à contenir la place de la voiture en ville pour répondre à des objectifs environnementaux ou économiques, cet article vise à quantifier la contribution de certaines tendances lourdes à l'évolution du partage modal entre les transports collectifs et la voiture. Nous examinons l'incidence de l'étalement urbain et de la croissance de la motorisation sur la part de marché des transports collectifs et de la voiture particulière. Sur l'agglomération lyonnaise, au cours de chacune des deux dernières décennies, l'évolution des localisations a été synonyme, selon la décennie et la zone d'étude, d'une perte de 6 à 9 % sur la part de marché des transports collectifs tandis que l'évolution de la motorisation (à structure spatiale des flux stable) a signifié une perte plus modérée de 1 à 4 %. Cette quantification permet d'éclairer les décideurs sur les évolutions probables de la part de marché des transports collectifs et sur l'importance de certains facteurs dans ces évolutions. Elle permet de bâtir des scénarios plus réalistes en matière de partage modal et de mesurer l'importance des efforts à consentir, ne serait-ce que pour contenir la place de l'automobile dans une perspective de développement durable.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> \n  Selective epitaxial growth of Si using a Si<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> mask has been carried out by ultrahigh-vacuum chemical vapor deposition with an alternating supply of disilane (Si<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>) and chlorine (Cl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) gases. In the present gas supply method, selectivity of Si to Si<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> is attained mainly by etching of poly-Si deposited on Si<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> with Cl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, while grown film structures depend on the substrate temperature and the total supply of Si<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and Cl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> gases. The passivation effect of chlorine on growing film surfaces dominates at a low growth temperature (600°C). On the other hand, the passivation effect weakens with increasing temperature and thus the epitaxial film thickness is determined by both the growth rate with Si<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>H<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> and the etching rate with Cl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> on Si. \n  </jats:p>",

This study was designed to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of HIV subtypes in US blood donors over the last two decades.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:</jats:bold> Three groups were studied: hemophiliacs infected by clotting factor concentrates in the early 1980s (n = 49), blood donors retrospectively identified as being seropositive in 1985 (n = 97), and blood donors identified as seropositive between 1993 and 1996 (n = 405). Subtype assignment was based primarily on heteroduplex mobility analysis (HMA) of HIV‐1 <jats:italic>env</jats:italic>, with DNA sequence confirmation of selected specimens. HIV peptide‐based EIA serotyping was used to rule out HIV‐2 and group O infections and to serotype HMA‐refractory specimens.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> Of 551 specimens, 535 (97%) were assigned subtypes; 532 (99%) of these were subtype B. Three postscreening donations (1%) were assigned non‐B subtypes (2 A, 1 C). Two of these three donors were born in Africa; the third was born in the United States and reported no risk factors other than heterosexual activity. HMA distribution plots showed an increase in <jats:italic>env</jats:italic> diversity among HIV‐1 group B strains over time.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> The results support the need for continued surveillance of HIV subtype diversity and ongoing validation of the sensitivity of HIV diagnostic assays to non‐B subtype infections.</jats:p>",
