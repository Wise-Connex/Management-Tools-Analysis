(2) The arterial pattern in newborn infants is not identical to that of adults. Obliteration of the umbilical artery in older infants carries with it obliteration of some of its branches, especially at their origin from its distal part, with a resulting change of arterial pattern. (3) The middle vesical artery is a fairly constant branch of the umbilical artery, supplying the bladder neck and the front of the bladder above the neck. (4) The urachal and middle vesical arteries, when unilateral, occur with equal frequency on both sides. (5) The anastomosis between superior vesical and inferior epigastric arteries was confirmed in the subperitoneal tissues, but was very rare in the wall of the bladder, occurring only when an abnormal obturator artery was the source of a superior vesical branch. (6) The constancy of the vesiculo-deferential artery is confirmed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seeds from L. angustifolius grown at three levels of applied sulphur contain similar amounts of protein whereas the ratio of total nitrogen to total sulphur in the whole seed and in the extracted protein is greatly increased under sulphur deficiency. This large change in nitrogen to sulphur ratio is accompanied by suppression of the synthesis of conglutins α and γ which usually contain most of the sulphur-containing amino acids found in these seeds. This is balanced by synthesis of an increased amount of conglutin β which normally contains no methionine and a lower proportion of cystine. Studies of the protein subunit composition show that the overall molecular weight distribution of the polypeptides is independent of the level of sulphur, but under sulphur deficiency the higher molecular weight subunits do not contain the disulphide linkages normally present. It is not known whether these higher-molecular-weight conglutin β subunits are normally absent or present only in trace amounts in the seeds. </jats:p>"

There were no substantial differences between plants raised in a glasshouse and under three temperature regimes in growth cabinets in their responses to light level and CO2 concentration. Large variations in the rate of photosynthesis were observed in plants raised under any environmental regime, this being due in part to the effects of leaf age. It was concluded that the greatest rate of photosynthesis observed in a series of experiments represented the best approximation to the rate attainable in the absence of limitations imposed by factors extraneous to the experiment concerned. The temperature responses of net photosynthesis, dark respiration and transpiration were influenced by growth regime temperature; the leaf temperature at which photosynthesis was maximal increased with growth regime air temperature up to at least 33°C. Plants transferred from one temperature regime to another exhibited the behaviour characteristic of the new regime within one day and two nights of the transfer. Estimates of gas diffusive resistances indicated that both the stornatal and CO2 mesophyll (residual) resistances adapted to changed temperature conditions after about one thermoperiod. The temperatures at which these diffusive resistances were minimal varied in the same sense as the changes in growth regime temperature. The roles of these aspects of behaviour in the adaptation of A. lappacea to its environment are discussed. </jats:p>"

Initiation of electrolysis will be obtained normally by switching on the primary high voltage supply and restricting the initial discharge current to less than 750 μA. As soon as this current is indicated, the required preset stabilised current can be switched on and accurately timed. Precise stabilisation of the current enabled the quantity of electricity passed in very short electrolyses to be measured with accuracy.</jats:p>",

Under a regime of low Ca and high Mn, IBN symptoms developed late in the second growing season on the scion barks but not on the rootstock bark. Both the degree of severity and the incidence of the disorder increased with increasing K levels. Low Ca and high Mn concentrations in the barks are apparently necessary for the development of IBN, and under these conditions K affects the degree of severity. It is suggested that the higher K concentrations enhanced Mn toxicity by lowering the threshold for Mn-induced IBN, while Ca responded as a detoxifying agent. Low concentrations of B and P may contribute to IBN development, while Mg and Fe were not related to symptom development.</jats:p>",
