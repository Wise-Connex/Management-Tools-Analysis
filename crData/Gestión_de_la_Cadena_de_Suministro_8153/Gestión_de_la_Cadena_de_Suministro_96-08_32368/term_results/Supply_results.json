Vertical co‐ordination has seen an accelerated introduction in the context of UK food retailing and the major food retailers are increasingly demanding dedicated supply as their influence grows. Looks at three main players: J Sainsbury, the second largest UK grocery retailer; Mack Multiples, an operating division of M &amp; W Mack, the UK’s largest privately‐owned importer and distributor of fresh produce; and Noboa, a major family‐owned plantation business in Ecuador.</jats:p>",

Describes the origins and development of transaction cost analysis and explains the key concepts of the framework. Discusses the potential effects of transaction costs on vertical co‐ordination within an industry and, hence, on supply chain management. Finally, suggests methods for empiricizing transaction cost analysis, resulting in recommendations for closer co‐operation between researchers and business managers.</jats:p>",

However, managers have not yet been provided with the concepts, frameworks, theories and best practice examples to help them know how to manage these relationships in different circumstances. Investigates one particular set of circumstances, namely international differences between relationships. Using field research in the European automotive aftermarket, makes comparisons between UK and Spanish relationships on what is expected by customers in those relationships, how good the understanding is between supplier and customer and how satisfied customers are. Many similarities between the relationships in the two territories are evident but the main difference is that the Spanish relationships are closer, more trusting and friendly than those in the UK. However, this appears to have little effect on the amount of misunderstandings in those relationships and the amount of customer dissatisfaction. Concludes, therefore, that trust, friendliness and other features of longer‐term co‐operative relationships will not guarantee greater understanding and greater satisfaction but rather that we have to understand the gap between expectations and perceptions of performance in relationships to make improvements that count.</jats:p>",

Survey data on 146 Finnish forest owners and their timber sales in 1987-1991 is used. Prior to estimation, forest owners are classified into four groups according to their ownership objectives by K-means clustering. Dummy variables indicating cluster membership are included in the supply function. According to the results, \"multiobjective owners\" harvest significantly more (m³/ha/yr) than the other owner groups (self-employed owners, recreationists, and investors), ceteris paribus. The results further indicate that the multiobjective owners' harvesting policy can be described as present-value maximizing while the other (single-objective) groups' harvesting behavior seems to reflect the effect of market imperfections, as assumed by the theoretical model of the study.

Reduced wholesaling costs, increased margins by which organic wholesale price exceeds nonorganic price, and higher consumer income stimulate both farm price and output. Increasing the nonorganic farm price decreases equilibrium quantity of organics. Market expansion strategies should target consumers and wholesalers.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews critical features of the supply of and demand for literacy instruction, drawing on recent state and national surveys of service providers, literacy performance levels, and adult literacy participants. Attention is given especially to the types of data that are required for modeling of supply-demand equations. The paper concludes that the supply of literacy instruction needs to be defined in terms of different layers of service providers, with adjustments for the estimated impact of technology-based service delivery. Future demand, on the other hand, should be estimated from current demand and not from perceived literacy needs in the population. </jats:p>",

To eliminate repeated topdressing, to decrease the amount of N to apply, and to save farming labor, a new fertilization method using MEISTER was studied. Since MEISTER is an excellent controlled fertilizer, the new method can apply all N necessary to grow strawberry plants almost for a year only by a single application (no N fertilizer is applied to the greenhouse soil). The experimental plots basically consist of two kinds of treatment: changing ratios of soil volume per pot or per plant (50 to 800 ml/pot) and kinds and levels of fertilizers (conventional fertilizer and two kinds of MEISTER). The experimental results showed 1) soil of ≥200 ml/pot is necessary to grow strawberry seedlings in summer when the soil is subjected to drying, 2) a blended material of two MEISTER products with sigmoid dissolution can supply N for the whole growing season, and 3) MEISTER application can reduce 40% of the total N conventionally applied.</jats:p>",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exercise trained 5 days/wk for 12–14 wk with exercise bouts consisting of a combination of high intensity (32 m/min on a 15% incline) and long duration (90 min/day). On completion of high-intensity endurance training (HIET) or cage activity [sedentary (Sed)], rat hindquarters were vascularly isolated and perfusion fixed with a modified Karnovsky's fixative. Capillary supply was measured in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles by using Olympus Cue 2 image-analyzer software. Capillary supply was reflected in measurements of capillary-to-fiber ratio, capillary numerical density, capillary surface area density, and capillary volume density on transversely cut tissue sections. HIET increased citrate synthase activity by 20 and 42% in the medial and long heads of the triceps brachii, respectively. Sarcomere lengths were similar in gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of Sed and HIET rats after fixation. All four indexes of capillary supply were significantly greater throughout the gastrocnemius muscle of HIET rats compared with Sed values. The relative increase in capillarity was greater in white than in red gastrocnemius muscle of HIET rats. HIET also increased capillary supply of soleus muscle. However, only capillary numerical density was statistically greater (19%) in HIET soleus compared with Sed. These results support the hypothesis that this training program would produce an increase in capillary supply in all extensor muscles. </jats:p>",

Dogs have relatively more muscle per unit body mass than goats (37 versus 26 %), but the maximal rate of oxidation per gram of muscle is still larger in the dog by a factor of 1.55. The maximal rates of substrate supply from the circulation are similar in both species. We predict that these differences in physiological parameters should be matched by proportional differences in structural capacity. We find that capillary volume and surface area are matched to maximal oxygen demand. The rate of vascular substrate supply is proportional neither to the capillary surface area nor to the length of intercellular junctions. The sarcolemmal surface area per gram of muscle is the same in both species. Using the physiological data presented in the companion papers of this series, we have calculated the maximal flux densities of circulatory glucose and fatty acids across the capillary wall and the sarcolemma. We find, for both substrates, that the flux densities across the sarcolemma reach a maximum at nearly the same level and at low exercise intensities in both species. In contrast, the flux densities across the capillary surface and the endothelial junctions are higher in goats than in dogs. We conclude that the capillaries are designed for O2 supply up to maximal rates of oxidation but not for the supply of the substrates (glucose and fatty acids) at the rates required at high exercise intensities. These are limited by the transport capacities of the sarcolemma.</jats:p>",

The studies compared dogs and goats exercising at different intensities and combined physiological, biochemical and morphometric investigations. In both species, the rate of fatty acid oxidation reached an upper limit at low exercise intensities, and only glucose consumption was increased at higher exercise intensities. The supply of both glucose and fatty acids from the capillaries reached maximal rates at low exercise intensities; this limitation is related to the design of the sarcolemma as calculations suggest that the endothelium introduces only a small resistance to substrate flux. From these findings, it appears that the capillaries are designed to satisfy O2 supply up to maximal O2 demand. The increase in substrate supply to the mitochondria at higher exercise intensities is achieved by drawing on intracellular stores of glycogen and lipids. The size of these stores is larger in dogs than in goats, providing the athletic species with twice the fuel reserves. These findings are interpreted on the basis of a network model with fluxes partitioned between direct and indirect pathways and with some structures shared by more than one function. Whereas O2 is supplied through a direct pathway, the supply of both substrates is split temporally to allow, during exercise, immediate fuel supply to the mitochondria from intracellular stores; these are replaced from the vasculature, during periods of rest, to a size commensurate with high rates of combustion. Considering this complexity, we conclude that the results are compatible with the principle of symmorphosis applied to a network structure and that the adjustment of design to functional demand involves different structures for O2 and for substrates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Seedlings of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsugamenziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western redcedar (Thujaplicata Donn ex D. Don) were subject to three nutrient treatments varying the rate of application of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) over the growing season. A control treatment provided seedlings with a constant supply of N and P. A high–low treatment reduced the rate of N and P supply after mid-July. A low–high treatment initially supplied seedlings with low amounts of N and P, and then increased the rate of supply after mid-July. Foliar nutrient concentration of seedlings of each species from each nutrient treatment was measured in September and the following April. Cold tolerance of seedlings was assessed five times over the winter season by freeze-induced electrolyte leakage and twice by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Nutrient treatment did not significantly affect foliar nutrient concentration in either species. Height of Douglas-fir seedlings was also unaffected by nutrient treatment, but western redcedar seedlings in the control treatment were 6.3 cm taller than those in the high–low treatment. Interpolated damage at −13 °C from freeze-induced electrolyte leakage indicated that Douglas-fir seedlings from the control treatment had 19.8% less damage than high–low seedlings in October, 18% less damage in November, and 1.6% less damage in December. The same trend was evident, although not always significant, in western redcedar. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses of Douglas-fir in October and November showed freezing and melting curve onset and peak temperatures to be, on average, 2.3 °C and 0.4 °C warmer, respectively, in control seedlings than in high–low plants. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>This paper quantifies the structures involved in the transport and oxidation of carbohydrates and fatty acids within the muscle cell. The structural capacity is measured on whole-body random samples of the musculature of dogs and pygmy goats and compared with maximal rates of oxygen consumption and substrate oxidation. Comparing dogs and goats of the same body size provided a 1.55-fold difference in the maximal rate of oxidation when related to muscle mass. As in previous studies, we found that the volume of mitochondria was approximately proportional to aerobic capacity. The maximal glucose flux from intracellular stores to mitochondria is 1.6 times greater in the dog than in the goat; we find that the amount of glycogen stored in the muscle cells is 4.2 times as great in the dog, but part of the intracellular glycogen pool is used for anaerobic rather than for oxidative metabolism. The maximal fatty acid flux from intracellular stores to mitochondria is 1.5 times larger in the dog, and the amount of lipid stored is 2.3 times as great in the dog. Every lipid droplet is in direct contact with the outer membrane of a mitochondrion and the contact surface area is 3.6 times greater in the dog than in the goat. Additional measurements are needed to investigate the role of structural limitation at this step. The amount of substrates stored intracellularly in the muscle cells of the dog is about twice as much as would match the differences in the maximal rates of utilization. This allows the endurance-specialized dogs to run for longer periods at higher rates of oxidation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of the n-3 series that have beneficial effects on mammalian heart function are typically found at high levels in fish tissues. The effects of dietary fatty acid composition on cardiac function were investigated in the sturgeon. When compared with sturgeon maintained for 1 yr on a diet enriched with saturated fatty acids (SFA) (the coconut oil-supplemented diet, COD), sturgeon maintained on a diet enriched with n-3 PUFA (the fish oil-supplemented diet, FOD) had higher myocardial 20:5(n-3) and lower 20:4(n-6) content with a consequent decrease in the n-6-to-n-3 ratio (from 0.86 to 0.25) and a lower intrinsic in vitro heart rate (22.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 29.9 +/- 1.0 beats/min) and cardiac power output (PO) (0.33 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.03 mW/g), but had a greater in vitro scope for cardiac work (almost twice the maximal-to-basal PO ratio). Reducing the oxygen supply to the hearts significantly decreased, by approximately 40%, the maximal in vitro PO in the COD group of animals but had no effect in the FOD group. These differences in performance were not reflected in heart rate or blood pressure in vivo, either in normoxia or hypoxia. Addition of vitamin E as an antioxidant to the diets reduced intrinsic heart rate by approximately 25% but did not influence the effects (dietary fatty acid composition on in vitro cardiac performance. The results indicate that dietary n-3 PUFA can have beneficial effects on the resistance of the fish heart to environmental stressors such as hypoxia. </jats:p>",

        "Held, upholding the submissions: (1) that if the expert could not be sure that heroin caused the deceased’s death, the jury could not be and (2) that the alternative submission was well-founded. Regard was had to Cato (1976) 62 Cr App R 41 and Dalby (1982) 74 Cr App R 348: the facts proved were closest to Dalby. Notes and queries 1 In R v Dalby [1982] 1 All ER 916, the defendant supplied drugs to the deceased who consumed them with fatal consequences. The Court of Appeal allowed Dalby’s appeal, inter alia, on the ground that the act of supply did not cause ‘direct harm’ to the deceased. This aspect of the decision was subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal in R v Goodfellow (1986) 83 Cr App R 23. For extracts from these cases see further Chapter 15. 2 In R v Kennedy [1999] Crim LR 65 the defendant, at the request of the deceased, supplied the deceased with a syringe containing heroin. The deceased proceeded to injected himself with the mixture and died from the effect of the drug shortly afterwards. The defendant’s appeal against his conviction for manslaughter, based on the contention that the deceased has caused his own death by self-injection, was dismissed. The Court of Appeal sought to distinguish the case from Dalby on the basis that the defendant had not simply supplied the drug but had also prepared the syringe and handed it to the deceased. The decision is, with respect, highly questionable. What the deceased did was to deliberately risk his own life – this is not an unlawful act. Hence the defendant could not be said to be assisting or encouraging an unlawful act. 3 In determining whether self-administration of drugs by the deceased is a novus actus interveniens to what extent should the courts take into account the knowledge of the deceased? How should the courts view the self-administration where the deceased is a child, a mental defective, or an adult who has been misled as to the nature of the substance? The victim’s actions in seeking to escape from the defendant"
