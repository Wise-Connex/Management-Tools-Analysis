As we see it, the key issue of\n      developmental policy centres about the question of balanced growth of\n      the two main sectors: the industrial sector and the agricultural sector.\n      The identification of this as the key issue is not at variance with the\n      Pakistan Government's official position which aims at a \"substantial\n      increase in industrial production\" over the next five years, while, at\n      the same time, attaching the \"highest priority to increasing\n      agricultural production\".1 In view of this dual aim, a consistent\n      theore¬tical framework is needed to facilitate rational planning by\n      pointing up the various facets of the balanced growth\n      problem.</jats:p>"
