      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Global sourcing has impacted inventory levels, lead times and the availability of working capital, affecting the standard financial flow of a supply chain. Poorly managing the link between the financial and physical supply chains could therefore lead to unnecessarily high inventory investments or to a short supply of inventory, affecting cash flow, working capital, sales and, subsequently, a firm’s profitability.Objectives: The aim of this generic qualitative study was to explore how firms manage their financial supply chain alongside their physical supply chain.Method: Data were collected from 12 semi-structured interviews with senior managers across six small- to medium-sized enterprise (SME) importing firms in various industries.Results: The research finds that the buyer is the driver of both upstream and downstream financial supply chain management (FSCM) as SME importers in Gauteng are proactively managing their financial alongside their physical supply chains. Through the continuous evaluation of sourcing strategies, exchange rate risk management strategies and inventory investment management strategies, firms can align their physical and financial supply chains.Conclusion: This study highlights the lead time and disruption risks and costs of global sourcing and identifies FSCM tools that can be used to alleviate the financial burden associated with long lead times.</jats:p>"

Chapter 6 looks to build upon structure and activity by specifically focusing upon one, and the main, type of activity in which gangs are found to operate within. This is illegal drug supply. By doing so chapter 6 adds the relevance of context to the book discussion. The chapter opens by re-examining the supply of illegal drugs into the British Isles, and more specifically the research context (i.e. Scotland). The chapter then proceeds to outline how drug supply works in relation to context and specific level of gang organisation. YSGs are found to mainly be engaged in the social supply of drugs. YCGs are found to be involved anywhere between retail-level and wholesale drug supply. OCGs are found to be involved in importation and high-end wholesaling of drugs in the county. In addition, OCGs are also found to engage in illegal-governance and thus control to varying degrees the activities of lesser gang types within drug markets.</p>",

The terms of contracts between traders and consumers for the sale and supply of goods, services, and digital content are discussed together with remedies for breach of contract. Rights to ownership and possession of goods, and when rights may be transferred from a seller to a buyer are explained. General rules on delivery of goods, the duties of a seller and buyer, and the remedies available for breach are discussed. Finally, the terms of business to business contracts for the supply of goods and services, hire of goods, and hire purchase are discussed.</p>",

The study explores the relationships among supply chain risk and environmental uncertainty, and the moderating role of supply chain flexibility by employing data of 91 manufacturing companies and develop a structural equation modelling.&#x0D;\nResults: Developing economies are contributing well in the global trade and are responsible for 50% of the generated global output. They present future prospects for economic growth and pose challenges mainly because of immature supply chain operations. Considering the critical role of emerging economies in global supply chain, such as India and China, it is also important to observe the moderating and driving supply chain risk factors in these regions. It is assumed that this study will not only fill the existing gap in the literature of SCRM but will assist researchers and practicing managers, by enabling them to fully understand certain types of supply chain flexibility, thus reducing the SCR under business environments.</jats:p>"

The main equations describing the dependence of the water temperature in the supply line on the outside air temperature are analyzed, and a review of possible ways of regulating the heat supply and preventing \"overflows\" near the beginning and the end of the heating period is carried out, taking into account the requirements of the current regulatory documents of the Russian Federation. Calculations are made to determine the required proportion in the mixture for water consumption after the heaters of hot water supply in the conditions of the application of the scheme of connection of buildings to the heating network. The analysis of obtained results is given, and conclusions are drawn concerning expediency of application of the considered scheme. It is established that, from the power point of view, mixing of wastewater after heaters of DHW in the calculated quantity will allow to provide reliability of heat supply of the main group of residential buildings and safety of activity of people at high temperatures of outside air. It is shown that, at the same time, that the higher the current outdoor temperature, the greater the share of wastewater in the mixture, with the above dependence close to linear, and its numerical coefficients associated only with the calculated outdoor temperature in the construction area for the cold season. It is noted that the introduction of the proposed scheme is possible with a minimum reconstruction of existing units and structures without significant capital costs, and also gives a system-wide effect in the form of increased electricity generation in thermal power plants on thermal consumption.</jats:p>"

We propose an approach to worker-driven monitoring and introduce a set of core elements that should form the basis of this new approach to monitoring labour conditions in global supply chains. We argue that supply chain workers’ participation in labour monitoring systems cannot be confined to the moment of factory inspection. Instead it must be understood as part of a larger process which incorporates workers from the point of designing the systems that will be monitored through to the point of remediation. We conclude that such a systematic and comprehensive approach is necessary to ensure that monitoring processes are meaningful and place the rights of workers at their core. </jats:p>",

In addition, supporting the resource-based view perspective, the results show a positive indirect effect of supply chain integration on the supply chain and firm performance improvements, enabled by the Additive Manufacturing adoption. This helps to explain some inconsistent findings in previous research regarding the impacts of supply chain integration on performance.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The results of this study support the view that Additive Manufacturing can make a positive contribution to the supply chain, but this is not achieved solely by the technologies alone. Many of the traditional activities of supply chain management (i.e. integration) are still needed when using Additive Manufacturing, and research needs to understand whether Additive Manufacturing adoption will necessitate changes to the way these traditional activities are undertaken. Building on the findings of the current study, much more work is therefore needed to understand how operations within the supply chain may be changed, and how this may affect the integration and performance of the supply chain.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study provides quantitative evidence to show that the adoption of Additive Manufacturing has the potential to affect both firm and supply chain performance. This is significant for those companies considering the adoption of Additive Manufacturing, and may serve as a valuable insight in the strategic decision-making process. For those already using Additive Manufacturing, this study serves to underline the potential for firm performance to be influenced, by focusing on improvements to their production strategies and policies.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This study provides an initial insight into some fundamental supply chain concepts within an Additive Manufacturing context, which have received very little research attention. It develops a novel conceptual model, and through a large-scale industry survey provides quantified evidence of the impact of Additive Manufacturing on the supply chain. To date, much of the supply chain research is exploratory and qualitative; the quantitative evidence presented in this work, therefore, makes an important and original contribution to both research and practice.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>",

Even though SCRM is an important component in supply chain management research, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the term and the concept to develop advantageous SCRM. In the literature of SCRM, different aspects have been discussed, for instance, risk identification, risk assessment, risk management strategies, risk monitoring, and contingency plans. Supply chain risks are increasing because of multiple outsourced partners linked with each other making it more complex, along with this, business is also uncertain, so these scenarios increase supply chain risks. Knowledge management has been used to know about the market scenarios and the information of trading partners and supply chain managers from different firms to know about the uncertainty or risks. However, the discussion shows that the efficient implication of KM capabilities on the SCRs and SCRM is still lacking.

In order to solve the structural problems of China’s economic development, since 2015, the government has made major theoretical innovations and decision-making arrangements for supply-side structural reform. Electric power industry is the key area and important support of supply-side structural reform. In order to simulate and forecast the electric power supply situation under the structural reform of supply side, this paper uses Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model to construct the energy processing conversion module, and optimizes the power generation module based on the principle of minimum cost. In this model, power generation capacity, electricity generation and carbon emission is calculated under both basic and active supply side structural reform scenarios. Under the active supply side structural reform scenario, the results show that China’s power generation capacity and electricity generation will reach 5949 GW and 16.1 billion MWh in 2050 respectively, and the proportion of clean energy for both power generation capacity and electricity generation increased significantly. China’s carbon dioxide emissions from energy combustion will peak in 2023, with a peak of about 9.87 billion tons.</jats:p>",

For a closed-loop supply chain network consisting of multiple manufacturers, multiple retailers, and multiple consumer and recycling markets, we assume that retailers are responsible for the recycling of used products, manufacturers use raw materials to produce new products and recycled products for remanufacturing, and government departments subsidize all manufacturers and retailers for GSC technology investment. Then, the equilibrium conditions of manufacturers, retailers, demand markets, and recycling markets are obtained by using the variational inequality method, complementarity theorem, and Nash equilibrium theory, and the variational inequality model of the closed-loop supply chain network multiphase equilibrium is established. Based on numerical simulation, the optimal technology investment decision of green supply chain under different government subsidy rates, and the influence of market structure and enterprise cost asymmetry on the equilibrium solution of supply chain network are analyzed. The results show that government subsidies can effectively promote enterprises to upgrade their level of GSC technology investment. The intensification of enterprise competition and the asymmetry of enterprise costs will affect the composition of enterprise profits and the allocation of profits between enterprises, and the former will weaken the effect of government subsidies.</jats:p>"

Supplier management must be handled systematically, and maintaining a good relationship between manufacturer and supplier is vital. Therefore, it is critical for the supplier in making a well-informed decision. As an alternative, firms should consider developing a local supplier in making sure the availability of fast and reliable supplies to meet global requirement. The criticality is due to supplier selection contributes to overall supply chain performance.

Findings:- The study identified a positive relationship between IT supply chain applications and performance. As noted by Lummus and Vokurka (1999) and Childerhouse and Towill (2000), much of the benefit attributed towards adopting supply chain management (SCM) systems, centre around the ability of information systems to speed up decision-making; increase visibility of value chain enablers; manage customer expectations better; reduce process cost; and increase the level of control available to management. Originality / value:- This study provides insightful findings in understanding the application of IT in SCM. This article also explains the benefits derived due to the use of IT in SCM. In spite of the limitations of the research, the study identified the potential benefits gained by scm members.</jats:p>"

Uniqueness should also be emphasized in order to increase the attractiveness of rural tourism in Hungary.  From a professional point of view, the necessity of supplying basic service items (ubiquity) and the special elements (uniqueness) are unquestionable in national rural tourism, but their actual optimal proportion is undetermined. The aim of the research is to investigate the uniqueness of rural tourism products, to identify which ones are the general and the specific elements of supply. The questions of the exploratory research will be answered by analysing a database of registered service providers of FATOSZ (Hungarian National Association of Rural and Agrotourism) based on a set of criteria designed to measure uniqueness. Data from the primary observation were analysed using descriptive statistical methods and contextual analysis. The main findings of the research were related to the experience content, which are closely related to the accommodation, environment and tourists’ activity during the stay.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An increasingly large quantity of primary mineral resource is being converted into manufactured products and destined for solid waste disposal. This material can be reclassified as &amp;ldquo;anthropogenic mineral reserves&amp;rdquo; and be a potential source of metals for a range of manufacturing uses. China is implementing a range of policy interventions which can lead to such a classification that will raise the profile of recycling programs as a means of metal supply. China is not only a major producer of consumer products and importer of secondary metals, but also has a major urban infrastructure footprint. Here we consider three product groups, 30 products, and imports, and map the recycling potential of anthropogenic mineral and 23 types of the capsulated materials by targeting their evolution from 2010 to 2050. Total weight of anthropogenic mineral on average in China reached 39 Mt in 2010, but it will double in 2022 and quadruple in 2045. Stocks of precious metals and rare earths will increase faster than most base materials. The total economic potential in yearly-generated anthropogenic mineral is anticipated to grow markedly from 100 billion US$ in 2020 to 400 billion US$ in 2050. Anthropogenic mineral of around 20 materials will be able to meet projected consumption of three product groups by 2050, due to high availability of recycled content and gradual saturation of consumption. Durability of material usage and the concomitant stock of the anthropogenic mineral remain major challenges in determining the viability of this supply in the second half of the coming century.</jats:p>"

It can be produced in large quantities near energy sources, transmitted to large distances, easily distributed between consumers and converted into mechanical, thermal, and light energy. Ensuring reliable and economical quality electric energy supply to mining enterprises with the optimal use of energy resources is one of the most important tasks facing the country's energy sector. In the Russian Federation, high degree of concentration of generating capacities at power plants has been achieved. The main capacities are concentrated in power plants with installed capacity of more than 1 million kW. High importance of the electric power industry is determined by the infrastructural nature of the industry and the direct relationship between the country's economic growth and the level of its development effectiveness. One of the most pressing problems of modern electricity supply is the problem of ensuring the quality of electric energy. The main reason for the deterioration in the electricity quality is widespread non-linear loads that create non-sinusoidal currents and voltage unbalance during their operation. The voltage unbalance is most often caused by the presence of an unbalanced load. Unbalanced load currents flowing through the elements of the power supply system cause unbalanced voltage losses in them. This results in appearance of unbalanced voltages on the terminals of electric apparatus. The voltage deviations at electric apparatus overdriven phase may exceed the normally acceptable values, while the voltage deviations at electric apparatus other phases may remain within the normal limits. In addition to the deterioration of the voltage mode at electric apparatus under the unbalanced voltage conditions, the operating conditions of both the electric apparatus and all the network elements are significantly worsened, and the reliability of the electrical equipment and the power supply system as a whole decreased. The paper considers the issues of reducing the voltage losses in power supply networks by improving quality of electric power.</jats:p>"

By constructing the dynamic differential game model, the paper discusses the differences in the optimal effort level, green degree of product, reputation and the optimal benefit under the three situations of noncooperation, government promotion and collaborative cooperation. The results show that the optimal effort level, green degree of product, reputation and the optimal benefit in collaborative cooperation are obviously higher than the situations of non-cooperation and government promotion, and the cooperation of the three parties can promote the development of green supply chain. Government promotion is better than noncooperation. The government plays an active role in improving the optimal benefit and reputation of green supply chain. Finally, the reliability of the proposed proposition is verified by an example analysis, which provides an important reference for improving the efficiency of green supply chain.</jats:p>",

However, the existing supply-chain ontologies have several gaps with respect to completeness, logical consistency, domain accuracy, and the development approach. In this work, we propose a new, supply-chain, reference ontology that is 1) based on an existing top-level ontology and 2) developed using a collaborative, ontology-development, best practice. We chose this approach because empirical studies have shown the usefulness of adopting a top-level ontology both for improving the efficiency of the development process and enhancing the quality of the resulting ontology. The proposed proof-of-concept reference ontology is developed in the context of the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF). IOF is an international effort aimed at providing a coherent set of modular and publicly-available ontologies for the manufacturing sector. Although the proposed reference ontology is still at the draft stage, this paper shows that it has already benefited from the collaborative development process that involves inputs from the other working groups within IOF. Additionally, as a way to validate the proposed reference ontology, an application ontology related to a supplier discovery and evaluation use case is derived from the reference ontology and tested.</jats:p>",

For a sustainable construction process, economically, environmentally, and socially friendly practices are essential, and reverse logistics is one solution that can provide such an approach. In reverse logistics, obsolete products are reused in a new production, while reducing negative effects to the environment. In this study, we assess the current state of research on reverse logistics practices in the construction industry. The study presents a comparative data mining analysis, followed by a content analysis. The results show that the construction industry literature ignores the impact of reverse logistics practices on upstream construction activities. We argue that industry practitioners must take reverse logistics decisions in the early phases of the construction process by considering both upstream and end-of-life construction activities, and we recommend a reverse logistics decision framework for successful reverse logistics implementation. The findings of this research are significant for decision-makers in the industry. We urge that sustainable practices be employed in the industry. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is suggested to strengthen the arguments made in this article.</jats:p>"

Flexibility in supply chain management creates an opportunity for the firms to improve its operational scope in order to achieve competitive advantage. Adoption of the flexibility strategies helps companies to increase their market share and growth and stay in competitive business. Some of the flexibility measures include product development cycle time, product variety and customer requirements disparity. The study seeks to determine the supply chain flexibility drivers and the extent to which these drivers have influence on the supply chain performance in the bottling water industry in Ghana. Questionnaires were employed as a tool to collect the primary data from the field and the secondary data were collected from Internet and articles.  Both qualitative and quantitative methods were adopted. The study was limited to the bottling water industry in the Kumasi Metropolis due to its geographical location and availability of market. The findings indicated that existing products must be modified to attract customers. The study recommends among others that there should be product modification, avoiding shortage of raw materials and customer complaints should be handled tactically in order to attract customers and increase sales.&#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

When firms’ cash flows are independent of each other, they are more likely to hedge with a larger market size.

Our research deals with this question and explains the future prospect of Iran-European Union cooperation in energy sector. Our main hypothesis in this research is then formulated as follows: Iranian media has been mostly captured by pro-pipe line officials who see great fortune in the possible economic benefits for them in this. However, for petroleum products, as long as Iran enjoys good relationship with Europe, it can play an important role in the oil sector. In fact, we will show that the linguistic aspect is vital as it help depict a different picture for the general public, bringing about different expectation among the youth and nationalists.

In an example where EMS improves the environmental performance of the organization, previous research suggests that improvements not only occur within the limits of the organizational operation but also need to be extended throughout the supply chain. The effectiveness of EMS implementation in the green supply chain boosts the environmental performance of the organization. Ultimately, EMS and GSCM practices are complementary to each other. Organizations that implemented EMS have more signs of improving the environment not only at the boundaries of their organizations but also across their network of buyers and suppliers. This research explains the debate by empirically assessing the relationship between EMS and GSCM practices.</jats:p>"

GSCM is a converging sustainability approach that integrates environmental thinking and initiatives into the traditional supply chain management (SCM) practices. However, despite having various benefits, this approach has not been widely implemented. Therefore, this paper aims to reveal the challenges faced by Malaysian construction companies in implementing GSCM. A total of 160 questionnaires were distributed among contractors and consultants in Malaysian Construction Companies. Only 50 questionnaires completed by the respondents resulting in a response rate of 32%. The research found that leadership and commitment from top management as the main challenges among construction players in implementing GSCM, in addition to changing mindset and culture and government support and regulation. This finding will allow practitioners to acknowledge and prioritize the challenges embedded with GSCM implementation, thus come out with strategies to overcome the challenges. This research can be further enriched by including an in-depth study on the GSCM challenges through qualitative research.</jats:p>"

In the simulation part of the proposed approach, the drawdowns at given monitoring points and times are calculated by considering the Theis and Hantush approaches for confined and leaky confined aquifers, respectively. This simulation part is then integrated to a newly proposed hybrid optimization approach, namely DE–Solver, which integrates the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and generalized reduced gradient (GRG) method of the spreadsheet Solver add-in. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated by considering two pumping test data for confined and leaky confined aquifers. Identified results indicate that the proposed approach provides better results than those obtained by using different approaches in the literature.</jats:p>",

The findings revealed that almost all participants sampled have no prior knowledge about the existence of the logic. This notwithstanding, Practitioners based on knowledge acquired during the interview process were optimistic that applying service dominant logic to supply networks can lead to improvements in business performance. The paper thus addresses the deficiency of service dominant logic’s dissemination to academics and practitioners in the Ghanaian context, whilst providing support for its significance in improving performance when applied to supply networks.</jats:p>"

Secondly, both the manufacturer’s and retailer’s fairness concerns reduce carbon emissions dramatically to nearly the same extent. Thirdly, the effect of the manufacturer’s fairness concern on the retail price is so tiny that it can almost be ignored, while the retailer’s fairness concern changes the retail price remarkably.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The closed-loop supply chain management model is an effective way to promote sustainable economic development and environmental protection. Increasing the sales volume of remanufactured products to stimulate green growth is a key issue in the development of closed-loop supply chains. By designing an effective warranty strategy, customer’s perceived value can be enhanced and market demand can be stimulated. This study cuts through the warranty period of closed-loop supply chain products. Based on the perspective of consumer behavior, game theory is used to construct the optimal decision-making model for closed-loop supply chains. The optimal warranty decision making for new products and remanufactured products under centralized and decentralized decision-making models is discussed. Further, the impact of the closed-loop supply chain system with warranty services and the design of contract coordination is also shown. We show that consumer preference has a positive impact on the sales of remanufactured products and the profits of enterprises; with the extension of the new product and remanufacturing warranty period, the profit of the supply chain system first increases and then decreases, and the value is maximized at the extreme point in the manufacturer-led decision-making model. Furthermore, the leader gains higher profits with bargaining power, but the profit of the supply chain system under decentralized decision model is less than that of the centralized decision model, reflecting the double marginalization effect. The revenue sharing contract and the two-charge contract designed in this study coordinate the closed-loop supply chain system with warranty services, so that the member companies in the supply chain can achieve Pareto improvement.</jats:p>"

For this, a 13 physico-chemical parameter data set at 14 sampling locations for a period of over 25 years was assessed. The correlation was statistically examined amongst parameters. A five-factor model is proposed which explains over 89.11% of total groundwater quality variation. Three semi-variogram models, namely exponential, Gaussian, and spherical, fitted well for the data set and are cross-validated using predictive statistics. Spatial variability maps of all the parameters and factor scores are generated and are in good agreement with each other. The variation seen in groundwater quality is mainly due to various hydrogeochemical, anthropogenic, and geogenic processes occurring in the region. Thus, this study indicated that there is need to treat the industrial and municipal wastewater before discharging it (directly/indirectly) into nearby streams and pits and to encourage sustainable agricultural practices to prevent adverse health effects and minimize further environmental degradation in the study region.</jats:p>",

The optoelectronic contactless voltage relays were tested in laboratory conditions to obtain an input-output characteristic and a form of capacitance voltage. Based on the improvement of the proposed circuit, a circuit of an optoelectronic contactless voltage relay is developed and provide a high degree of reliability. The simulation of the proposed voltage relay circuits is performed using the MATLAB R2014a program, the results of which show that changes in the shape of the output voltage curve are close to a sinusoid and coincide with the results obtained analytically. As a result the obtained conditions of use make it possible to obtain a voltage with a sinusoidal shape on the load and achieve a relay return coefficient close to unity.</jats:p>"

The paper shows different case studies where the benefits of applying blockchain technology in supply chain management are appealing that has shown many benefits. It highlights the cases that have reduced fraud and errors; mitigate risks and provide data transparency and privacy, etc. The paper shows the creation of a general blockchain network and the information passing mechanism which is used to pass the information among the participants across the supply chain.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing water demand due to urbanization creates a need to develop schemes for managing water supply networks (WSNs). In recent years, hydraulic modeling of WSNs has been used to assess the state of networks in terms of leakage analysis and pressure control. These models are based on demand-driven modeling (DDM) analysis and pressure-driven modeling (PDM) analysis. The former assumes that the nodal demand is fulfilled consistently regardless of the nodal pressure head. The latter appraises the demand as a function of the available pressure head at the nodes. In a previous paper by Adedeji et al. (2017), an algorithm was presented for background leakage detection and estimation in WSNs. The results demonstrated that the algorithm allows the detection of critical pipes and the indication of the nodes where such critical pipes are located for possible pressure control. However, such an algorithm assumes a demand-driven condition of WSNs. In this paper, a pressure-driven modeling is integrated into the developed algorithm with emphasis on its impact on the background leakage estimate. The results obtained are compared to the demand-driven analysis using two WSNs as case studies. The results presented, which consider pipe and node levels, demonstrate that the reliance of the nodal demand on the available pressure head at the node influences the magnitude of the background leakage flow. It is conceived that this investigation might be crucial for the background leakage estimation while considering WSNs operating under pressure-deficient conditions. In this paper, the solution time for both simulation scenarios is also presented.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The human rights of foreign workers in global supply chains are routinely violated, yet the problem so far has largely evaded a legal solution. Economic analysis shows why domestic tort liability can partially address this problem. Many consumers in developed countries have a lower willingness-to-pay for products produced by global supply chains that systemically subject foreign workers to egregiously dangerous working conditions in gross violation of their human rights. This attribute of consumer demand provides a basis for subjecting the domestic chain leader to domestic tort liability for the bodily injuries suffered by these foreign workers, including those employed by independent suppliers. Chain leaders, like other product sellers, are obligated to warn about foreseeable safety risks that are not known by consumers and would be material to their decision about whether to purchase or use a product. The tort duty also requires sellers to instruct consumers about the ways in which the purchase or use of the product might foreseeably harm third parties. A domestic seller that is the chain leader of a global supply chain would breach this duty by not warning domestic consumers that the product is produced by foreign workers who are systemically subjected to working conditions that are so unsafe as to amount to a gross violation of their human rights. Because the purchase of the product foreseeably exposes foreign workers to this ongoing risk of physical harm, they are protected by the tort duty and can recover for its breach. Causation can be established by the logic of the breached tort duty. If consumers had been warned that the product is produced in such a systemically unsafe work environment, a substantial number of them would not have purchased it – they would instead have purchased the same product at the higher price necessary to protect the foreign workers from these ongoing safety violations. By distorting consumer demand in this manner, the domestic product seller’s failure to warn domestic consumers of these human rights violations in the global supply chain proximately caused injury to these foreign workers, entitling them to compensation. By remedying these human rights violations, domestic chain leaders would satisfy the reasonable expectations of domestic consumers who have altruistic preferences to rescue foreign workers from extreme dangers within the production process. Tort law cannot redress the full range of human rights violations in global supply chains, but consumer demand provides a sound basis for tort liability that addresses a limited, though important component of the problem.</jats:p>",

The vibration-based real-time leakage monitoring method of the pressurized water pipeline was studied. During the test, the leakage was simulated by opening a spherical valve in the middle of the pipe, and an FOH was placed right above the pipe wall to detect the vibration signal along the pipe. The FOH analysis software was used to monitor the pipeline operation status in real time and acquire data. Then, the data were processed by a self-developed post-processing program, and the parameters were optimized through back-calculation. The test results reveal that the leakage positioning error lay between ±0.07 m, and real-time monitoring (i.e., early warning alarm and leakage positioning) of the FOH for the pressurized water pipeline was feasible.</jats:p>",

Methodology: The fashion industry is one of the dynamic industries, which undergoes rapid transformation in both the demand and flexibility. A review of the earlier relevant research in the area has been included in the research paper along with an analysis of HSC in comparison to other commercial supply chains. This research paper goes over the definition of SHSC, development, and hurdles in its design, identification of research limitations and development of a model and hypothesis. Statistical analysis for example surveys, sample design, data assembling, variables/measure of identification, bias/pre-testing has been included to support the claims made in the paper. Results: The firms operating in the manufacturing of Indonesia are chosen as the sample of the study. Employing the survey-based methodology, the SEM-PLS technique is used to test the hypothesized relationships. So, the current study has used SEM-PLS as a statistical tool to answer the research questions raised in this study and research objectives envisaged in the current study. The findings of the study have provided support to the theoretical foundation and proposed hypothesis of the current study. Current study will be helpful for policymakers and practitioners in understanding the issues related to supply chain risk, supply chain integration and supply chain performance. In the author's knowledge this is among very few pioneering studies on this issue.</jats:p>"

The formation and retention of the market may be complicated for local producers; therefore it is advisable to take the creation of supply chains into consideration. Constant feedback and evaluation is highly important to maintain successfully operating short supply chains and supplier evaluation forms could act as the starting point of these chains. These forms reflect the strengths and weaknesses of suppliers, based on which the correction of mistakes can be done and the performance of suppliers may be enhanced. The aim of this study is to examine the role of supplier evaluation form and relationships between customers and suppliers in short supply chains, from a local producer’s point of view through a case study. The scientific relevance of this study is to draw particular attention to short supply chains which are and will be of high importance considering local economies. As the case study reveals, it is recommended for the members of short supply chains to use supplier evaluation forms.</jats:p>",

We provide here a historical explanation of this behaviour as we consider it represents an evolutionary load of formerly tree-nesting species. Basically, from this perspective, facultative tree/cliff-nesting species reproduce the nests they used to build originally on top of trees, but on cliffs. Facultative species (likely evolved in forested areas) that supply their cliff nests with sticks include Pandion haliaetus, Haliaetus albicilla, Milvus migrans, Circaetus gallicus, Buteo buteo, Aquila fasciata, A. pennata, A. chrysaetos, A. heliaca, Gypaetus barbatus Gyps fulvus and Neophron percnopterus. On the contrary, the only Falco species that solely nests in cliffs (F. eleonorae)) and does not supply its nests with sticks and should be considered a true cliff-nester, likely evolved in non-forested areas. All other Falco species that do not supply their cliff nests with sticks but can make use of tree nests made by other non-raptorial species, should also be considered as true cliff-nesters, likely evolved in more forested areas or times. Milvus milvus, Elanus caeruleus, Accipiter nisus, A. gentilis, Pernis apivorus, Aquila adalberti, A. clanga, A. pomarina and Aegypius monachus are true tree nesters, likely evolved in forested areas, which did not evolve the plasticity to nest directly on cliffs.</jats:p>"

In this study, we point out that the hydrodynamic interaction between the HVCs and the Galactic disk is not considered in the traditional method of estimating the infall rate, and therefore the true supply rate of fuel from HVCs can be different from the suggested value depending on the physical configurations of HVCs including density, velocity, and distance. We choose 11 HVC complexes and construct four different infall models in our simulations to give an idea of how the fuel supply rate could be different from the traditional infall rate. Our simulation results show that the fuel supply rate from HVC infall is overestimated in the traditional method and can be lowered by a factor of ∼0.072 when the hydrodynamic interaction of the HVC complexes and the disk is considered.</jats:p>",

This balance is achieved through operational actions, many of which require the application of forecasting concepts and tools. In this article, recent research on urban water demand forecasting employing artificial intelligence is reviewed, aiming to present the ‘state of the art’ on the subject and provide some guidance regarding methods and models to research and professional sanitation companies. The review covers the models developed using standard statistical techniques, such as linear regression or time-series analysis, or techniques based on Soft Computing. This review shows that the studies are, mostly, focused on the management of the operating systems. There is, therefore, room for long-term forecasts. It is worth noting that there is no global model that surpasses all the methods for all cases, it being necessary to study each region separately, evaluating the strengths of each model or the combination of methods. The use of statistical applications of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methodologies has grown considerably in recent years. However, there is still room for improvement with regard to water demand forecasting.</jats:p>",

Such modules are made with the help of encapsulation technology with a polysiloxane compound, which improves the performance of solar modules and increases their service life. For autonomous power supply of mobile and compact electrical devices in the field, folding and sectional solar modules are proposed, which, when parallel-sequential switching, allow to gain the necessary power. For architectural solutions, solar roofing panels are presented, which along with electrogeneration make it possible to generate heat energy, and the base can be made of recycled plastic, which has a positive effect on the environment. To reduce the number of solar cells used, a concentrating solar roofing panel has been proposed, which allows the use of thermal energy. For the cogeneration of electric energy and thermal energy, a concentrator solar photovoltaic thermal module with a paraboloid type concentrator is also proposed. Each type of solar modules is used in a stationary heat and electric power supply and mobile power generation.</jats:p>",

A recent study suggested a cross-basin correlation between the Colorado River and its neighboring Great Salt Lake (GSL). Following that study, the feasibility of using the previously developed multi-year prediction of the GSL water level to forecast the Colorado River WS was tested. Time-series models were developed to predict the changes in WS out to 10 years. Regressive methods and the GSL water level data were used for the depiction of decadal variability of the Colorado River WS. Various time-series models suggest a decline in the 10-year-averaged WS since 2013 before starting to increase around 2020. Comparison between this WS prediction and the WS projection published in a 2012 government report (derived from climate models) reveals a widened imbalance between supply and demand by 2020. Further research to update similar multi-year prediction of the Colorado River WS is needed. Such information could aid in management decision making in the face of future water shortages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Britain’s imperial and commercial success rested on maritime links. Whether trading wool across the Channel to Europe, seeking spices in South Asia or importing sugar from the Caribbean, shipping was an essential resource. Yet, to undertake these trades, merchants required naval supplies – finished ships, timber to build them and stores to fill them – that were not always easily accessible. This challenge was particularly apparent in the early seventeenth century for trading corporations whose specific needs demanded innovative approaches to the naval supply problem. This article examines the responses of English corporations to the challenge of supplying its international shipping by focusing on activities on each side of the Atlantic. First, it assesses the development of the East India Company’s docks at Blackwall and Dundaniel, before turning to a detailed study of ship-building and supply in Virginia and New England. In doing so, this article highlights the importance of naval supply to Britain’s north Atlantic empire, both in terms of the rhetorical support for empire and the economic incentives of participants. This reveals how traditional interpretations of Britain’s naval development have too often focused on state-driven activities (particularly from the very end of the seventeenth century) and failed to examine the complex, sometimes chaotic attempts by private individuals and corporations to overcome the naval supply challenges common to this early period of globalisation. </jats:p>",

The data collected was subjected to completeness checks, before it was cleaned, coded, and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) for the generation of both descriptive and inferential statistics. The results show that Supplier integration (?1, = 0.276; p value=0.000), customer integration (?2, = 0.119; p value=0.016) and internal integration (?3, = 0.232; p value=0.000) have a significant effect on operational performance. The R2was 0.429, indicating that 42.9% of the variation in operational performance is explicated by the variation of Supply chain integration dimensions.  This implies that all three supply chain integration dimensions significantly influence operational performance. The study concludes that the government needs to internally integrate and embrace forward and backward integration with the customers and suppliers to leap the full benefits of an integrated health sector to accomplish the universal health care goals.</jats:p>"

We establish instantaneous restricted (fixed reserves) and unrestricted NRR supply functions. The supply of a NRR at any date and location depends not only on the local contemporary price of the resource but also on prices at all other dates and locations. Besides the usual law of supply, which characterizes the own‐price effect, cross‐price effects have their own law. They can be decomposed into a substitution effect and a stock compensation effect. We show that the substitution effect always dominates: a price increase at some point in space and time causes NRR supply to decrease at all other points. Our new—although orthodox—setting takes into account not only NRR supply limitations but also the heterogeneity of NRR deposits, and the endogeneity of their development and opening. Our analysis extends to NRRs the partial‐equilibrium analysis of demand and supply policies. Thereby, it provides a generalization of results about policy‐induced changes on NRR markets.</jats:p>",

In this industry, preventing membrane fouling is of utmost importance. Many studies on the relationship between raw water components and membrane fouling have been performed in laboratory conditions. However, very few studies have analyzed the components of foulants on the fouled membrane as operated in actual drinking water treatment plants. By analyzing these components in plant-conditions, membrane fouling will be more effectively prevented. In this study, we analyzed the components of foulants extracted with 0.1 N NaOH from a fouled membrane operated in a drinking water treatment plant in Japan. Our analysis revealed that the main foulants were humic substances. In order to dissolve the accumulated humic substances, additional chemical cleaning was attempted with 500 ppm sodium hypochlorite. As a result, it was found that humic substances were dissolved and filtration resistance significantly decreased. Additionally, the removal of inorganic foulants was also greater after chemical cleaning with 500 ppm sodium hypochlorite, as inorganic foulants trapped within humic substances were released to the membrane surface as hydroxides by the additional sodium hypochlorite cleaning and were dissolved by the periodic citric acid cleaning.</jats:p>",

Then, “Adjusted” contracts are introduced and proved that only adjusted revenue-sharing contract can coordinate the supply chain. Considering the profit redistribution proposition of the two-part tariff contract, the study introduces combined contracts, which are found capable of obtaining supply chain coordination as well as a win-win outcome.</jats:p>",

This is startling in light of policies underpinning product liability and private laws.

In this research, the author develops a mathematical model to find the effect of delay in payment on emissions costs without ignoring the economic performance of a supply chain. The author develops four different scenario models. Furthermore, numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis tests were conducted.

At the generation and transmission level, effort is made to ensure status monitoring and fault detection on the power network, but at the distribution level, particularly within domestic consumer communities there are no fault monitoring and detection devices except for HRC fuses at the feeder pillar. Unfortunately, these fuses are sometimes replaced by a copper wire bridge at some locations rendering the system unprotected and creating a great potential for transformer destruction on overload. This study is focused on designing an on-site power system monitoring device to be deployed on selected household entry power cables for detecting and indicating when phase off, low voltage, high voltage, over current, and blown fuse occurs on the building’s incomer line. The fault indication will help in reducing troubleshooting time and also ensure quick service restoration. After design implementation, the test result confirms design accuracy, device functionality and suitability as a low-cost solution to power supply system fault monitoring within local communities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) are products or services other than timber that is produced in a forest and of course, are indispensable parts of the livelihood strategy of the forest’s adjoining communities. Their economic potentials necessitated the need for research to be carried out on its production and constraints facing its supply in the study area. Therefore, constraints to NTFPs’ supply in Ago-Owu forest reserve and its environment were investigated. Three communities (Mokore, Ajegunle and Alabameta) were randomly selected communities of the identified study area (Mokore, Ajegunle, Alabameta, Elewe, Alaguntan and Okodowo) identified communities in the study area. Their populations were sought for and samples were drawn in proportionate to their sizes: Mokore (50), Ajegunle (40) and Alabameta (20). This gave a total number of 110 respondents from which 105 questionnaires were derived for the investigations. A set of questionnaire was used to obtain data on source of NTFPs, commonly sourced NTFPs and constraints facing its supply in the study area. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logit regression at α0.05. Majority of the respondents were male (69.1%) and 64.8% of them were within the age of 30-50 years. Also, most of the respondents were married (78.1%) and less than half of them (41%) had no formal education, but were predominantly farmers (72.4%). The major source of NTFPs in the study area was forest reserve (70.5%), while a total of seventeen (17) different NTFPs commonly sourced were documented. Constraints facing the supply of NTFPs included Climate change, Lack of finance for smooth running of the activities involved in the products’ supply and price fluctuation with odds-ratio of 9.87, 5.66 and 1.92 respectively. The study established the significance of the Ago-Owu forest reserve to the livelihood of the forest dwellers. However, there is need for the establishment of new plantations to fostering production of the products as well as serving as adaptation strategies against climate change. There is also an urgent need for the State Forestry Service/government to address their areas of concern pointed out in this study for bio-prospecting, economic well-being of forest dwellers and great advantage of boost in revenue propensity of Osun State.</jats:p>"

Optimal operation of pumps in these utilities is paramount to enable water companies to achieve energy efficiency in their systems. The Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) is used to rank the Pareto solutions found by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) employed to solve the multi-objective problem. Various scenarios are evaluated under leakage uncertainty conditions, resulting in fuzzy solutions for the Pareto front. This paper shows the suitability of the approach for quasi real-world problems. In our case-study, the obtained solutions for scenarios including leakage represent the best trade-off among the optimal solutions, under some considered criteria, namely, operational cost, operational lack of service, pressure uniformity and network resilience. Potential future developments could include the use of clustering alternatives to evaluate the goodness of each solution under the considered evaluation criteria.</jats:p>",

One of the causes of the decline in plywood production in several industries is the supply chain management of raw materials. This study aims to determine supply chain mechanisms related to the flow of product, flow of financial and flow of information at the plywood industry in South Sulawesi. Data collection techniques are carried out with initial observations, field surveys, interviews, and literature studies. Data analysis was performed using qualitative and quantitative descriptive analysis. The results show that the supply chain in plywood mills has a fairly complex link starting from product flow, financial flow and information flow related to raw material supply, inventory and sales. This company needs to implement an integrated supply chain management to help maintain the sustainability of plywood production so as to increase the company’s performance.</jats:p>",

The features of this method have been considered from the standpoints of the equilibrium and dynamics of surfactant accumulation on floated air bubbles with different sizes. Within a certain ratio of dimension and quantity of air bubbles in their stream transferring adsorbed surfactants from the water bulk into the bubble-film extractor, the productivity of the process increases many times. The effect is ensured by a collective fusion of big and small air bubbles in their close-packed state (embedded system) inside the bubble-film extractor. The driving forces are impulses of capillary waves initiated at the bursting of big air bubbles as constituent ‘destructive’ units of that system.</jats:p>",

Using a sample of S&amp;P 500 firms, we find that board gender composition and board independence are positively associated with sustainable supply chain responsibility (SSCR). We also identify three channels (CEO duality, sustainability committee and sensitive industries) through which board gender composition and board independence affect SSCR, where board gender composition consistently explains SSCR, but the effect of board independence is less pronounced in firms with CEO duality and firms with a sustainability committee. Finally, we explore the reason for the less‐pronounced findings for board independence in our subsample analyses and find that, compared with independent female directors who continue to display significant associations with SSCR, independent male directors do not engender SSCR across the three subsample tests.</jats:p>",

The re-mining of the tailings by hydrometallurgical methods was considered, in order to satisfy these two enounced conditions - metals demand and environmental risk, aiming for the sale of the metal to pay the environmental intervention.

At very low SC density levels, the design model will reduce the number of open facilities largely leading to only one facility open at each echelon; therefore, shortage occurs and vulnerability to disruption increases.

Optimization has become one of the high technology in planning and management in the supply chain. Supply chain networks as logistics and production process from network that is connected between organizational units that operate from suppliers to the community. The supply chain of fish resources is very complex because it is caused by number of factors, such as the diversity of products from fish resources and short expiration periods.

This is especially true of the population in rural districts and small towns where water supply is mostly not centralized. Studies have revealed a significant excess of standards for sanitary-chemical and microbiological indicators due to the high content of iron, nitrates, magnesium, manganese and sulphates, increased rigidity, the presence of coliform bacteria. The main causes of non-compliance of drinking water with regulatory requirements are identified. Measures to be done to bring the quality of drinking water in line with existing requirements are recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A microgrid can be partitioned into several autonomous sub-microgrids in case of multiple faults in natural disasters. How to guarantee the supply adequacy of critical loads in sub-microgrids is a problem that should be considered at the planning stage. This paper proposes a microgrid planning model considering the supply adequacy of critical loads under the uncertain formation of sub-microgrids. The proposed model minimizes the total cost during the project life, which includes the construction cost and operation cost for the candidate distributed energy resources (DERs). The supply adequacy of critical loads in sub-microgrids is taken into account in the model. As we only know the critical load areas, the locations of switches which divide the microgrid into sub-microgrids are unknown at the planning stage. Considering this uncertainty, the microgrid planning issue is finally formulated as a robust model against the worst formation of sub-microgrids. The developed model is tested on two systems: IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus distribution systems. Simulation indicates (1) the proposed method is more robust than deterministic strategy as critical load loss is intolerable in sub-microgrids; (2) the investment cost is the same with that of the deterministic case when the number of sub-microgrids is within two.</jats:p>"

During the last three decades, few efforts have been devoted to developing a visualization tool to display the relationship between the failure cause and its consequences. This study proposes two visualization methods to effectively show the relationship between the two failure entities: A failure cause–impact–duration (CID) plot, and a bubble plot. The former is drawn for an effective snapshot on the range (extent) of failure duration and the impact of different failures, whereas the latter provides failure frequency information. A simple and practical failure classification system is also introduced for producing the two proposed plots effectively. To verify the visualization schemes, we collected records of 331 WSDS component failures that occurred in South Korea between 1980 and 2018. Results showed that (1) the proposed CID plot can serve as a useful tool for identifying most minor and major WSDS failures, and (2) the proposed bubble plot is useful for determining significant component failures with respect to their failure consequences and occurrence likelihoods.</jats:p>"

In Muyuka, Cameroon, though there exist public taps littered “here and there”, the population most often find themselves fetching water from nearby streams raising to surface the question of sustainability of the available water systems which was the aim of this study.&#x0D;\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional, analytic study targeting household heads and water committee members in the rural communities of Muyuka. Three communities were randomly selected and from each, five quarters were randomly selected. In the quarters, convenience sampling technique was used for the household heads while snowball sampling technique was used to get the water committee members. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used and data analyzed using R.&#x0D;\nResults: A total of 371 persons participated in the study. The average number of years lived in the community was 22.08 (SD=10.61) and ranged from 10 to 66. Only 13.00% of the participant didn’t see the water system as challenging while 81.5% finds it to be severely problematic. Utilization of water averaged far less than the 50L/person/day and the situation worsened as the household size increased. Close to half (49.6%) of participants did not participate at any stage in the development of the water system. According to the participants, water systems breaks down averagely 3 times in a year and last for about 67 days before being repaired. Water committee members reported difficulties in accessing spare parts and inadequacy in their training.   &#x0D;\nConclusion: Frequent breakdown of the water schemes compounded by the unavailability of spare parts and hence delays in repairs, and in expansion, user dissatisfaction and unwillingness to pay their bills; inadequacy in training of water committee members, has resulted in poor sustainability of the water system.</jats:p>"

Though Africa is rich in a wide range of energy resources including solar, bio, natural gas, oil, coal and Uranium, the continent is far from energy self-sufficiency. Addressing climate change will require deep and quick reductions in fossil fuel use so that the systems developed around producing, transporting, and consuming energy are decarbonized by the middle of the century. In the ongoing age, sustainable power source has taken another swing to limelight on the planet, particularly in developed and emerging nations, as it assumes a noteworthy part both in economy and the general job of the world. Significantly, Nigeria an oil-rich country, comes as no surprise that almost all of her energy consumption comes from non-renewable energy sources as coal, natural gas and oil, and as such it is highly vulnerable to shocks due to overdependence on the fossil sources; often time is controlled by the international market. On the whole, the fossil fuel is expected to span only but a millennium (1700-2700) of human civilization while the imperative of an energy shortage situation is felt in every sector of the country considering the poor electricity consumptions in the country, which has reflected on the country’s economy and productivity rate. In revamping the economic sectors in Nigeria, the need for an alternative energy sources that is augmentable in supply keeping in view sustainable development as the hallmark for all sector development. Thus far, Nigeria ought to likewise be opened to universal investments as this would help support the improvement of its assets. This paper, therefore, supports no other sources but renewable energy in promoting the countries productivity at all segments. It further stressed on the implementation of the country’s Renewable Energy Master Plan (REMP) to meet global competitors by the year 2030. Similarly, senior political figures, policymakers and CEOs should engage in a policy dialogue by identifying unique opportunities and best practices for developing and investing in Nigeria and in Africa’s energy markets for “…without this energy supply, the sophisticated skills of the industrial world are merely a burden in the struggle for survival.”</jats:p>"

The power supply adoptes OZ8027 as the main control chip in the critical conduction mode, which uses the peak current control method. A wide range of input voltage of 85~265V is designed, the output current is 200mA, and the actual output power target value is 13W. It is suitable for an AC input type for flyback constant current driving circuit whose light source board owns LEDs for 2-series and 5-parallel.

The potential for the use of solar radiation in the region was analyzed. Accordingly, when the solar photovoltaic batteries in the region are used (coefficient of efficiency-18%), the technical potential of the region is 41 TWh/year. Wind speeds and wind energy potential data were collected over eight years (2011-2018) and were calculated using the monthly wind speed data measured every 30 minutes at a height of 10m. During the estimation of wind energy potential we were used two parameters Weibull and Rayleigh distribution functions. The density power and energy values of the wind flow at various heights were evaluated using the extrapolation method. In accordance with that, on height of 10m it makes 41.19 W/m2 and 361.48 kWh/m2, on height of 50m 117.23 W/m2 1026.96 kWh/m2, and on height of 100m 192.76 W/m2, 1688.59 kWh/m2. The wind energy gross, technical and economic potential of the region has been evaluated. In addition, the potential and prospects of using hybrid (wind and solar) power stations for the supply of uninterrupted and reliable power supply to consumers in the region were analyzed</jats:p>"

As a result, an understanding of trends in fluvial sediment supply to deltas is critical for understanding the potential of different deltas to adapt to the threat of drowning. Here trends of sediment supply to three of the world’s deltas (the Ganges-Brahmaputra, Mahanadi and Volta) are considered and the prospects for the future of these and other deltas discussed, focusing on how human activity can be modified to promote a more sustainable future for at-risk deltas.</jats:p>"

The predominant goal of this article is to empirically identify the level of engagement of entities operating in the tourism-oriented branch of industry concerning the satisfaction of end-customers with the offered tourism-related services and products. Within the scope of this study, the statistical relevance of elements of active cooperation within a tourism-specific supply chain was analyzed. Empirical examinations covered the assessment of the cooperation within the framework of the tourism-oriented supply chain and its impact on consumer satisfaction. A research questionnaire was utilized to meet examination-specific goals. Theoretical considerations and the analysis of branches of industry in relation to the available statistical data showed that tourist-oriented supply chain covers various entities, the engagement of which may have a factual impact on the efficiency of managing the entire chain, as well as on the overall client satisfaction, improving tourism sustainability. The obtained results clearly showed that the examined entities considered the analyzed cooperation aspects to be very important with regard to the supply chain management. Said aspects included the total length of cooperation within the framework of a particular supply chain, which, according to the examined entities, directly translated into the quality of cooperation—to either significant or very significant extent, as well as making it much easier to solve certain problems that were strictly connected with the provision of tourism-oriented services. Yet another aspect of cooperation that was touched upon was the transfer of the so-called know-how between the entities engaged in a given supply chain. As proven by the examination, 70% of the surveyed entities claimed that it was of significant or very significant importance. The last analyzed aspect of cooperation were relations between the supply chain-specific partners and their impact on the satisfaction of end customers. According to over half of the sample (61.54%), decent relations between supply chain participants affected the satisfaction of end customers to a notable extent.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to verify the effect of social preferences on transactions in supply chains, using Brazilian individuals with the purpose of comparing the results with those obtained in other countries. The methodology proposed in this study was quantitative, as variables already studied by previous studies were investigated. An experiment was conducted with three handlings (normal, status and relationship) simulating buying and selling situations in a supply chain. The results indicated that highlighting the performance status of a supply chain improves the efficiency of the chain when compared to normal transactions, or when there is a relationship between the links.</jats:p>"

First, the ordering quantity under 3PL financing service is larger than that under two firms are well-funded when the transportation fee or carbon emission is less than a certain constant. The variable transportation fee strategy and members’ carbon emission reduction behavior are beneficial to each supply chain participant. Second, the carbon emissions of members decide whose capital constraint is more beneficial to 3PL firm, and 3PL prefers to cooperate with a medium rich manufacturer (rich supplier). Third, the external financing modes are analyzed to get the 3PL financing service can create new value for the manufacturer and 3PL if the transportation fee is below a threshold, and this threshold increases with the manufacturer’s carbon emission. When the transportation fee is larger than a threshold, a capital-constrained supplier will choose bank financing, and this threshold decreases with the supplier’s carbon emission. Finally, we demonstrate that the manufacturer’s loss aversion (carbon cap) can increase (decrease) its bankruptcy threshold.</jats:p>"

In this paper we address an optimal design of a multi-echelon supply chain problem with various commodity that is of significance to the business enterprise, along with the associated inventory systems. By using the guaranteed service approach to model the multi-echelon inventory system, we develop an MINLP model to simultaneously optimize the transportation, inventory and network structure of a multi-echelon supply chain which involve multi commodity. The optimization model is then solved using a strategy of releasing nonbasic variables from their bounds, combined with the “active constraint” method.</jats:p>",

The study employs the latest operative climate projections from 10 general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) to drive a hydrologic model (VIC) in generating runoff projections through 2099. Changes in peak runoff, peak timing, seasonal (major water supply season April–July) runoff, and annual runoff during two future periods, mid-century and late-century, relative to a historical baseline period are examined. Trends in seasonal and annual runoff projections are also investigated. The results indicate that watershed characteristics impact runoff responses to climate change. Specifically, for rain-dominated watersheds, runoff is generally projected to peak earlier with higher peak volumes on average. For snow-dominated watersheds, however, runoff is largely projected to peak within the same month as historical runoff has, with little changes in peak volume during mid-century but pronounced decreases during late-century under the higher emission scenario. The study also identifies changes that are common to all study watersheds. Specifically, the temporal distribution of annual runoff is projected to change in terms of shifting more volume to the wet season, though there is no significant changing trend in the total annual runoff. Additionally, the snowmelt portion of the total annual runoff (represented by April–July runoff divided by total annual runoff) is projected to decline consistently under both emission scenarios, indicative of a shrinking snowpack across the study watersheds. Collectively, these changes imply higher flood risk and lower water supply reliability in the future that are expected to pose stress to California’s water system. Those findings can inform water management adaptation practices (e.g., watershed restoration, re-operation of the current water system, investing in additional water storage) to cope with the stress.</jats:p>"

Therefore, well managed inventory is a main trigger to increasing profitability. In this regard, the present study attempts to explore the readiness of a leagile manufacturing company to embrace consignment stock model, in order to reduce inventory value for raw materials and packaging, as well as to avoid forecast accuracy problems and cash-flow issues. The methodology includes a brief analysis of different types of inventory models, focusing on consignment stock approach and proposes an exploratory case study, represented by a successful implementation of a consignment stock program in a multinational company, having already leagile prerequisites. Using as a basis the insights and learning from the real case, the aim of the study is to develop a business processes framework, accommodated with the IT support software, to serve as a guideline for future implementation of such programs.</jats:p>",

The basic requirements for the design of floating devices are formulated: reduction of hydraulic losses (streamlining of pontoons and fenders) increase of stability, durability, maneuverability of conditions for installation on water ensuring the water tightness of hermetic compartments, the possibility of balancing and repair, increasing functional reliability and efficiency. A fundamentally new design of the structural elements of the water supply channel has been proposed to help reduce the flow of both bottom and suspended sediments to the mainstream of the water supply channel.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The choice of suitable semiconducting metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors for the detection of a specific gas or gas mixture is time-consuming since the sensor’s sensitivity needs to be characterized at multiple temperatures to find its optimal operating conditions. To obtain reliable measurement results, it is very important that the power for the sensor’s integrated heater is stable, regulated and error-free (or error-tolerant). Especially the error-free requirement can be only be achieved if the power supply implements failure-avoiding and failure-detection methods. The biggest challenge is deriving multiple different voltages from a common supply in an efficient way while keeping the system as small and lightweight as possible. This work presents a reliable, compact, embedded system that addresses the power supply requirements for fully automated simultaneous sensor characterization for up to 16 sensors at multiple temperatures. The system implements efficient (avg. 83.3% efficiency) voltage conversion with low ripple output (&lt;32 mV) and supports static or temperature-cycled heating modes. Voltage and current of each channel are constantly monitored and regulated to guarantee reliable operation. To evaluate the proposed design, 16 sensors were screened. The results are shown in the experimental part of this work.</jats:p>"

Drawing principally on interviews with local drug-involved adults, this article is the first to undertake in-depth analysis of their experience of risky street-level labor in “host” towns. Findings suggest that despite violence and intimidation, many saw county lines labor as preferable to other income generating activity, and contrary to popular enforcement narratives, they often became involved though constrained choice. As such, it is argued that the policy response might resemble one of building resilience through multiagency support, which better equips “structurally vulnerable” populations to exit exploitative relationships. </jats:p>",

There has been little work directed towards the large-scale possibilities of decentralised water systems and their implications on the functioning of the centralised (potable) water system. This study includes both a historical and future (scenario) analysis of decentralised developments. Integrated morphological socio-technical scenarios are combined with quantitative water flows for a case study (the Province of Limburg, the Netherlands) and examined by a transdisciplinary group of experts. The study shows how SUWM measures which focus on climate adaptation and circularity can have a significant impact on existing centralised potable water systems. In turn, influencing the total water and peak demands and thus resulting in different utilisation rates. This can result in more system failures (e.g., longer residence time, bacterial growth, reduced self-cleaning capacity), significant changes in the centralised infrastructure (e.g., more wells), increasing water bills (e.g., inequalities), and the preservation of aquifers for future generation. Different scenarios either have regime-reproducing or regime-diversifying impacts. SUWM measures are studied in isolation and thus externalities are not fully considered. Therefore, when planning for decentralised SUWM solutions, a systems thinking approach is recommended, which takes into account externalities.</jats:p>"

Another advantage of this study is related to the solution approach, the game theory. Twofold of the games theoretical, i.e. cooperative (in three forms) and non-cooperative are considered, because of their importance. Three types of non-cooperative games are presented as follows: Nash equilibrium – each echelon decides respectively and simultaneously; manufacturer-Stackelberg – the manufacturer has more power than the agent and the agent has more power than the customer; and customer-Stackelberg – customer is leader of the agent and the agent is the leader of manufacturer.

Our objective was to determine diet quality and quantity of cattle (Bos taurus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus; deer), and elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in late-summer in response to early-summer forage utilization by cattle and elk in two consecutive years. Four 2.25 ha enclosures were constructed in previously logged mixed-conifer rangelands dominated by grand fir (Abies grandis [Douglas] Forbes.), and within each enclosure, a 0.75 ha paddock was either: 1) ungrazed, 2) grazed by cattle, or 3) grazed by elk in mid-June and mid-July at a moderate utilization level (31.9 &amp;plusmn; 2.7%). After grazing treatments, each paddock was subdivided into three 0.25 ha sub-paddocks and sixteen 20-minute foraging bouts were conducted in each sub-paddock using elk, deer, and cattle (n = 4). Within an animal species CP in diets did not differ (p &amp;gt; 0.05) between ungrazed paddocks and grazed paddocks; however, diet CP and IVDMD of each species was higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) on cattle grazed paddocks compared to elk grazed. Regardless of treatment, cattle diets contained lower CP, IVDMD (p &amp;lt; 0.05) than did deer or elk diets, and relative to elk, deer consistently selected diets which contained higher CP (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In response to grazing, intake rate of DM, CP, ME did not change (p &amp;gt; 0.05) for any of the ungulates. The study revealed that early-summer grazing by cattle or elk at a moderate utilization level has minimal effect on the subsequent nutrient intake rate of cattle, deer, and elk foraging in mixed-conifer forests. </jats:p>"

Data were collected using six semi-structured interviews, walkthroughs, and written documents available from a blood centre and four associated hospitals in Yogyakarta. Template and within-case analyses were then used to analyse the data and, subsequently, to identify and categorise themes emerging from the data. Governmental and organisational policies, costs, donor management, stock management, and facilities are the main factors emerging from the data. These factors are interrelated and, collectively, they influence blood safety and availability across the blood supply chain.</jats:p>",

Literature studies and expert surveys are carried out and produce eleven indicators. Interpretative Structural Modelling is used as a method for modelling the relationships between these indicators and results in six indicators at the first level, namely water usage (G1), material usage (G9), global warming potential (G4),% CPO certified (G8), energy usage (G2),% product with take-back policies (G11); four indicators are at the second level: waste generated before recycled (G3), acidification potential (G10), COD (Chemical oxygen demand) (G6),% waste reused (G7); third level one indicator, namely (biological chemical demand) (G5). Meanwhile MICMAC Analysis was used to classify eleven performance indicators and produced nine indicators into cluster I, autonomous indicators, namely: energy usage (G2), waste generated before recycled (G3), BOD (biological chemical demand) (G5), COD (Chemical oxygen demand) (G6),% waste reused (G7),% CPO certified (G8), material usage (G9), acidification potential (G10),% product with take-back policies (G11). One indicator is cluster II, autonomous indicators, namely global warming potential (G4). For cluster III, linkage indicators, there are no indicators included in it at all. The last one indicator entered cluster IV, independent indicators, namely water usage (G1). In the end, this study give contribution to expand the using of ISM modelling especially for palm oil industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, to satisfy diversified customer needs in the target market, an increasing number of brands have launched mass customization (MC) programs as one of their core operations strategies. The production process flexibility and personalization degree of customized products (i.e., the MC products) have thus become key to the success of MC schemes. In the meantime, however, considering the high market uncertainty in consumer preferences and the challenges from the production process, there are plenty of risks in MC operations. Hence, in this paper we develop a game‐theoretic model consisting of an MC brand and an upstream manufacturer to identify the influences of supply chain finance (SCF) on MC programs. The influences brought by the risk attitudes of both MC brand and manufacturer are analyzed. Besides, an extra interest rate for raising the working capital for production (e.g., from the bank) at the manufacturing level is also considered in this paper to address the impact of cash flow shortage. We find that when the positive sensitivity of the market demand with respect to the modularity level of the MC product is sufficiently high, the optimal product modularity level of the MC product increases with the MC brand's degree of risk averse. In addition, it can also be observed that when both the market demand's positive sensitivity to the modularity level of the MC product and the MC brand's opportunity cost rate for placing the advance order are sufficiently high, any increase in the risk‐averse degree of the MC brand or the manufacturer will lower the manufacturer's optimal wholesale price of the MC product as well as the MC brand's optimal rate of the advance order. Furthermore, the higher the interest that the manufacturer needs to pay (such as to the bank) for raising the working capital for the MC production process, the lower the optimal wholesale price of each finished MC product will be to help the manufacturer raise more money through the advance order placed by the MC brand. These observations complete the findings in the extant literature and provide important managerial insights into managing MC operations.</jats:p>",

This bundle is offered to customers under the dual-channel supply chain (DCSC) structure. By PSS concept, it is expected that the products sold will increase, then the products or services that are not selling well can be bundled with goods that sell well, so as to reduce overstock or deadstock in the inventory. In terms of distribution, using the DCSC structure, sales can increase by 20% from the previous one. This research will be conducted by combining the PSS concept in the DCSC distribution structure, in terms of inventory management. Model is developed of inventory cost minimization for DCSC-PSS by considering order quantity as a decision variable. Afterwards, the model will represent two scenarios of game theory for decision making practice DCSC-PSS, Stackelberg Leadership and Vertical Nash. The initial result of the numerical experiment was DCSC’s total inventory cost, Stackelberg Leadership scenario is IDR 556,642,465.40 greater than Vertical Nash, IDR 468,614,127.10. Afterwards, sensitivity analysis based on customer acceptance (ρ) and percentage of PSS (φ). At last, it was concluded that Vertical Nash was better than Stackelberg Leadership for decision making in inventory management</jats:p>",

It’s assumed that lead time length is limited. The quality of the product from vendor is not always 100% perfect, so imperfect quality product always exist due to specific probability rate. Pareto optimal concept has been used to find the weighted sum of the players’ objectives. Karush – Kuhn – Tucker (KKT) criteria is applied to determine the optimum value of decision variables and also minimum value of total cost as objectives function.

Each application requires a power supply particularly adapted to the plasma reactor type used. If the first applications of these discharges were designed mostly for reactor types with high volume discharge capabilities, and the power supplies were simple and robust generating high power using industrial frequencies, in time the reactors decreased significantly in size and the power supplies used were working on higher frequencies. This trend was adopted on one hand out of the need for energy optimization of the power supplies used, and on the other hand for obtaining a better homogeneity of the treatment. This paper aims to provide a comparison of few AC and pulsed power supplies, working at different frequencies, with respect to the electrical parameters, from the point of view of active species production. The measured electrical parameters of the electrical discharges are the power and the specific energy. Also the results obtained for treatment of distilled water using three types of plasma reactors (classic GlidArc, Mini-torch plasma and Gliding Spark) will be shown. The analysis focus on the modification of pH of the distilled water in time after the plasma treatment.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated study which uses antecedent-practices-performance principles in order to determine the drivers of SSCM practices, and the impact of these practices on sustainable supply chain performance.

The survey instrument was conceptualised from an in-depth study of literature and was employed to conduct a survey of 211 operations and supply chain managers and functional heads from the Indian manufacturing industry.

Despite the sheer abundance of data that companies might use to measure and drive improvement in on-farm sustainability, they have struggled to collect data suitable for such purposes. Attention to the different kinds of distance and diversity across which metrics are supposed to govern suggests reasons why they may fail to do so, even when wielded by otherwise powerful corporations. </jats:p>",

Yet, despite the enormous amounts of larvae produced, larval dispersal from a single spawning event and the reliability of larval supply are highly dependent on vagaries of ocean currents. However, colonies from the same population will occasionally spawn over successive months. These split spawning events likely help to realign reproduction events to favourable environmental conditions. Here, we show that split spawning may benefit corals by increasing the reliability of larval supply. By modelling the dispersal of coral larvae across Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, we find that split spawning increased the diversity of sources and reliability of larval supply the reefs could receive, especially in regions with low and intrinsically variable connectivity. Such increased larval supply might help counteract the expected declines in reproductive success associated with split spawning events.</jats:p>"

Inside the water supply systems and the biofilms, Legionella interact with other bacteria and free-living amoeba (FLA). Several amoebas may serve as hosts for bacteria in aquatic systems. This study aimed to investigate the co-occurrence of Legionella spp. and FLA in drinking water supply systems. Materials and Methods: A total of 268 water samples were collected from apartment buildings, hotels, and public buildings. Detection of Legionella spp. was performed in accordance with ISO 11731:2017 standard. Three different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols were used to identify FLA. Results: Occurrence of Legionella varied from an average of 12.5% in cold water samples with the most frequent occurrence observed in hot water, in areas receiving untreated groundwater, where 54.0% of the samples were Legionella positive. The occurrence of FLA was significantly higher. On average, 77.2% of samples contained at least one genus of FLA and, depending on the type of sample, the occurrence of FLA could reach 95%. In the samples collected during the study, Legionella was always isolated along with FLA, no samples containing Legionella in the absence of FLA were observed. Conclusions: The data obtained in our study can help to focus on the extensive distribution, close interaction, and long-term persistence of Legionella and FLA. Lack of Legionella risk management plans and control procedures may promote further spread of Legionella in water supply systems. In addition, the high incidence of Legionella-related FLA suggests that traditional monitoring methods may not be sufficient for Legionella control.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Harvesting mountain pine beetle-infested forest stands in the northern Colorado Rocky Mountains provides an opportunity to utilize otherwise wasted resources, generate net revenues, and minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Timber and bioenergy production are commonly managed separately, and their integration is seldom considered. Yet, degraded wood and logging residues can provide a feedstock for bioenergy, while the sound wood from beetle-killed stands can still be used for traditional timber products. In addition, beneficial greenhouse gas emission (GHG) savings are often realized only by compromising net revenues during salvage harvest where beetle-killed wood has a relatively low market value and high harvesting cost. In this study we compared Sequential and Integrated decision-making scenarios for managing the supply chain from beetle-killed forest salvage operations. In the Sequential scenario, timber and bioenergy production was managed sequentially in two separate processes, where salvage harvest was conducted without considering influences on or from bioenergy production. Biomass availability was assessed next as an outcome from timber production managed to produce bioenergy products. In the Integrated scenario, timber and bioenergy production were managed jointly, where collective decisions were made regarding tree salvage harvest, residue treatment, and bioenergy product selection and production. We applied a multi-objective optimization approach to integrate the economic and environmental objectives of producing timber and bioenergy, and measured results by total net revenues and total net GHG emission savings, respectively. The optimization model results show that distinctively different decisions are made in selecting the harvesting system and residue treatment under the two scenarios. When the optimization is fully economic-oriented, 49.6% more forest areas are harvested under the Integrated scenario than the Sequential scenario, generating 12.3% more net revenues and 50.5% more net GHG emission savings. Comparison of modelled Pareto fronts also indicate the Integrated decision scenario provides more efficient trade-offs between the two objectives and performs better than the Sequential scenario in both objectives.</jats:p>"

The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks arranged in a 4 × 2 factorial design with four replicates. The treatments consisted of four N doses (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha-1) combined with the presence or absence of foliar application of a plant growth regulator. The application of 150 g ha-1 of trinexapac-ethyl at the flower differentiation stage reduced plant height and lodging. In addition, this treatment promoted increased 100-grain mass. The use of N doses in topdressing increased plant heights and grain yield. The plant growth regulator did not interfere with the milling yield of upland rice.

The questions that come to mind, among several others are; what is the situation of the villages especially in the area of social infrastructures, particularly electricity? Can restoration of power and building of skill acquisition centre guarantee their sustainable reintegration? Drawing upon several past studies undertaken in post-conflict communities in many other countries, this paper provides empirically-based responses to these questions. Responses from returning migrants which serve as results of the findings in this study show that sustainable reintegration and meaningful rural development cannot be achieved unless power (electricity) is restored to the post-conflict communities where the forced migrants are set to return. This is because it will serve as a catalyst to social and economic development in the post-conflict agrarian communities.</jats:p>",

This concept in line with sustainable construction and lean construction concept. In the Project Life Cycle (PLC), green construction is related to the construction phase. However, accomplishment in this stage cannot be separated with previous stages that are planning and design phases. Therefore, an integrated green concept is needed to assemble the continuity of each stage in PLC thus reducing the fragmented nature of the construction industry. Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) concern to sustainable practices along the supply chain. Management of materials and information flow, in addition energy consumed and waste generated reduction in every stage makes GSCM worth to considered as a concept to integrated all stages in PLC into a green spirit. This study aims to identify the indicators of green construction concept as part of GSCM. The result of this study is a framework for implementing green construction that consists of four dimensions, 25 elements, and 42 indicators.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to show what farmer characteristics present negative correlation with slaughterhouses’ information asymmetry advantages. By slaughterhouses’ advantages, the authors refer to slaughterhouses’ opportunistic appropriation of value due to hidden information, such as quality measurement and remuneration of difficult-to-measure attributes.

These findings suggest that a possible value appropriation from buyers’ information asymmetry is a problem for several types of producers, even varying size, family tradition in the activity or transaction costs to collect price information (e.g. lack of transparency). Initiatives should try to reduce this problem to these farmers to avoid value appropriation resulting from information asymmetry problems, especially in the lack of transparency.</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n<jats:p>This paper adopts a survey about information asymmetry in cattle supply transactions in Brazil, which is well known as one of the most relevant producer and consumer of meat.

Ihiala LGA is a case under study. Since the creation of Ihiala local government area in Anambra State of Nigeria, there is the need for underground water resource development for effective water supply system towards sustainable housing in the area due to population increase, and development of more residential buildings. By using Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) technique in geophysical survey of the subsurface, it was discovered that there are about six litho-logical units in the area. The subsurface litho-logy, aquifer depth and their dispositions, were probed using Abem Tetrameters 300 SAS and Geographic Information System equipments to identify the resistivity of the formations. In the area, sand stone deposit is prominent at the upper levels between 3 to 27 meters. Aquifer depth is located within 75 to 120 meters. The saturated sand stones significantly occur within the 3rd and 5th layers of the litho-logical horizons. The aquifer is mostly semi confined, and composed of sand, silty sand and sand-stone mineral aggregates. Subsurface water resources exploitation using borehole facility in the area therefore should reference these discoveries for easy and sustainable underground water resource development, to meet the people daily need for good water in the study area.</jats:p>"

In this paper, total dissolved solids (TDS) of the groundwater aquifer in Tabriz plain is estimated by groundwater physicochemical parameters including Na, HCO3, Ca, Mg, and SO4 in the eastern region of Urmia Lake. For this purpose, four soft computing approaches, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM), and gene expression programming (GEP) were used to predict TDS for a period of 10 years (2002–2012). Data were collected from the East Azerbaijan Regional Water Organization, which totaled 1,742 samples. In the application, of the whole data set, 70% (1,220 samples) was used for training and 30% (522 samples) for testing. In the following, the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) statistics were used for evaluating the accuracy of the models. According to the results, MLP, ANFIS, SVM, and GEP models could be employed successfully in estimating TDS alterations. A comparison was made between these soft computing approaches that corroborated the superiority of the GEP model over MLP, SVM, and ANFIS models with RMSE = 58.93, R = 0.998, and MAE = 5.21.</jats:p>",

Whilst industrialized nations already started to decrease associated carbon emissions in many business sectors, e.g., by substituting combustion engines with battery-powered vehicles, less developed countries still lack broad coverage of reliable electricity supply, particularly in rural regions. Progressive electrification leads to a need for storage capacity and thus to increasing availability of advanced battery systems. To achieve a high degree of sustainability, re-used batteries from the electromobility sector are appropriate, as they do not consume further primary resources and still have sufficient residual capacity for stationary electrical storage applications. In this article, a blueprint for the electrification of a remote region by utilizing second-life lithium ion traction batteries for an integrated energy system in a stand-alone grid is presented and the implementation by the example case of a Tanzanian island in Lake Victoria is demonstrated. First, economic potentials and expected trends in the disposability of second-life lithium ion batteries and their foreseeable costs are outlined. Subsequently, key decision variables are identified to evaluate logistic aspects and the feasibility of the implementation of an off-grid electrical system in remote areas for economically and geographically unfavorable environments. The practical realization is pictured in detail with a focus on technical performance and safety specificities associated with second-life applications. Therefore, a new type of battery management system is introduced, which meets the special requirements of climate compatibility, low maintenance, enhanced cell balancing capability and cell configuration flexibility, and combined with a fiber-optical sensor system, provides reliable status monitoring of the battery. By carrying out on-site measurements, the overall system efficiency is evaluated along with a sustainability analysis. Finally, the socioeconomic and humanitarian impact for the people on the island is debated.</jats:p>"

The Yongding River has been cut off all year around and the ecological environment has continued to deteriorate. Therefore, a series of river ecological restoration projects of ‘Five Lakes on One Route’ have been implemented. In order to characterize the physico-chemical properties of groundwater and evaluate the effects of these projects on groundwater quality, by using principal component analysis, this study analyzed spatial and temporal variation on the basis of 11 water quality parameters at 10 monitoring sites of ‘Five Lakes on One Route’ for Yongding River during April and September of 2011 and 2016. Principal component analysis demonstrated that relatively poor groundwater is mainly distributed in Fengtai District residential and industrial land, and the groundwater in Mentougou District woods is generally better. The groundwater quality at eight monitoring sites kept the same level or became better, and the construction of the river ecological restoration projects of ‘Five Lakes on One Route’ is important for protecting the groundwater resource.</jats:p>",

To achieve this aim, a survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire. Drinking water samples were collected from the point of supply and the storage containers to assess the microbiological quality of drinking water in both rural and urban areas. Results of this study revealed prominent residential segregation between rural and urban communities, whereby the houses in the rural areas were generally constructed with corrugated iron sheets, or mud brick and mortar whereas conventional brick-and-mortar construction was used to build those in the urban areas. All of the urban households had flush toilets in their houses (100%), while 98.2% of the rural households were relying on pit latrines and 1.8% were reported to defecate in an open field. The District unemployment rate was at 58.1% in rural areas and none among the urban community. Results also showed that only 13.6% of the rural dwellers completed their secondary education compared to 70.4% of the urban areas. The diarrhoeal episodes were high in rural areas (34.1%) while none of these episodes was reported in urban areas. Great disparity in the water supply persists between rural and urban communities. For the former, the standpipes located outside their homes (90.9%) remain the sole mode of access to drinking water, while in the urban area, all households had pipes/taps inside their houses. Assessment of the drinking water quality revealed only the stored drinking water used by the rural community of Ugu District was contaminated. High prevalence of E. coli ranging from 63.3 % to 66.7% was recorded only in stored water after the sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Species-specific PCR primers exposed the presence of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli at a rate ranging between 1.4% and 3.7% in this water Overall, this study has been able to highlight the disparity left by the legacy of racial segregation in the Ugu Municipality District. Therefore, the local government must intervene in educating homeowners on safe water storage practices.</jats:p>"

Analyses were carried out at the Adolfo Lutz Institute between February and December 2016, and included physicochemical (chlorine, pH, color, turbidity and nitrate), and microbiological parameters (total coliforms and Escherichia coli), as well as P. aeruginosa, with susceptibility tests to antimicrobial agents and biofilm production capacity by the strains isolated. In total, 251 water samples were evaluated and 19 (7.6%) presented P. aeruginosa. No significant differences were observed between the physicochemical parameters found in the positive and negative samples for this bacterium, but the samples containing total coliforms were also those with the highest positivity for P. aeruginosa. All samples with P. aeruginosa reported chlorine concentrations between 0.2 and 2.0 mg/L, as required by Brazilian legislation, demonstrating this bacterium's resistance to conventional water treatment processes. Although not resistant to the antimicrobials tested, most strains isolated were classified as strong biofilm producers, emphasizing the need for further studies involving water supply quality.</jats:p>",

We draw on a limited sample of about 470 South African wines sold in Connecticut and New Jersey in the fall of 2016; about 90 of them are certified FT. For these wines we have free on board export prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices, which allows us to compute wholesale and retail margins and analyze the FT treatment effect. We run OLS, 2SLS, and propensity score matching models and find evidence of asymmetrical pricing behavior. While wholesalers seem to fully pass-through the FT cost effect, retailers appear to amplify the cost effect. As a result, at the retail level, FT wines yield significantly higher margins than their non-FT counterparts. (JEL Classifications: L11, L31, L43, L81, Q17)</jats:p>",

Bullwhip effect is distortion information between inventory and demand in the whole supply chain stages. This problem has not solved in the business recently, although there are many studies discussed this issue. Bullwhip effect gives a negative impact on the performance of the inventory system. This impact can reduce using Centralized Demand Information (CDI). This research aims to analyze the bullwhip effect that happens in between a manufacturer, distribution, and retailers to minimize inventory cost. This research aim is achieved by: i) Calculating the amount of bullwhip effect of PT. X that occurs in the bottled drinking water distribution system; ii) Implement the centralized demand information method to reduce the bullwhip effect on the supply chain water supply network; iii) Comparing inventory costs before and after cutting the bullwhip effect on the supply chain. The data such as time series, data in 12 periods (monthly), data on raw material procurement, holding cost and stockout costs. The reason for using CDI for calculating the bullwhip effect and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) to calculate the inventory cost. Research findings show that using CDI will decrease the bullwhip effect and the impact is reducing inventory cost.</jats:p>",

Demand is sensitive to both retail price and advertising expenses of the retailer. With a wholesale price contract, we analytically derive the Stackelberg equilibrium with respect to pricing by both parties and advertising by the retailer. Our results show that the retailer with less initial capital prefers to invest full initial capital in advertising irrespective of the advertising elasticity or the interest rate charged by the supplier. The retailer with more initial capital only invests part of initial capital in advertising. The retailer’s advertising policy under different initial capital levels always benefits the supply chain and the supplier.

Water supply systems are commonly designed to ensure adequate behaviour under the worst conditions, such as maximum consumption, which leads to overestimation in supply tanks and energy waste. While overestimation should be considered, to account for unpredictable demands and emergency scenarios, we advocate that a detailed understanding of consumption patterns enables an improvement in water management and is additionally beneficial to correlated resources such as electricity. A novel framework to detect water consumption patterns is developed and applied to an urban scenario.

The building, comprising 32 apartment units and currently under construction, has been designed to minimize thermal energy demand, while ensuring comfort and quality of the internal environment for the social housing occupiers. The selection of the heating and hot water energy systems has been carried considering a life cycle perspective both for environmental and economic impacts. Different alternatives have been analysed which compare conventional gas boiler installation, which has been the norm for this type of social housing for the last decades, with various options based on heat pump technology. Life cycle analysis of the environmental effects of electrification of the thermal energy demand through heat pumps show a potential for reducing life cycle CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. The economic evaluation done through life cycle costing, comparing investment, maintenance, replacement and operational costs of gas boiler with aerothermal and geothermal heat pump solutions, have shown however that gas heating solutions are still the most competitive economically. Increasing the overall efficiency of those heating and hot water systems that include heat pump technology, while reducing their uncertainty in operation is a key element to ensure competitiveness of heat pumps in the current market.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a novel high voltage low current transformerless step-up dc-dc converter is presented. The proposed design consists of two step-up dc-dc converters with negative feedback signal and 15 stages of Cockcroft-Walton (C-W) voltage multiplier. The dc input voltage of 5 V triggers the first step-up dc-dc converter circuit to generate 30 V dc voltage and the second step-up dc-dc converter circuit boosts up to 100 V dc voltage. Further, diode-capacitor multiplier circuit is connected at the final stage to achieve 1.6 kV dc output voltages at 200 kHz switching frequency. The simulation results indicate that the proposed dc-dc converter can generate 1.548 kV dc voltage with a load current of 0.16 mA at 10 MΩ load resistor. Meanwhile, the experiment results show that the proposed dc-dc converter can generate 1.475 kV dc voltage with 80 % efficiency. The results validate both the simulation and experimental of the proposed high dc voltage power supply module.</jats:p>"

Nearly the third quartile (74.5%) of the households had access to water within a distance of 1.5 km or less from dwelling. Majority (86%) of households had no access to water within a time of 30 minutes or less. Nearly 92.3% of the households used less than 20 liters per capita per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"abstract\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; There was a significant gap in accessing water supply for the community within 1.5 km in the district. Nearly half of households used protected well water sources. The per capita water consumption of the households were extremely low. Hence local administrator should expand protected well in all members. The community participation should be encouraged to prepare and maintain the water sources.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The biorefinery would supply SAF to the Nashville, Tennessee international airport. Supply chain activities include pennycress production, transporting oilseed to a crushing facility, processing of oilseed into bio-oil, and transporting bio-oil to the biorefinery. The analysis shows profit potential for economic agents in the prospective supply chain. Estimated breakeven cost (profit = 0) of growing, harvesting, and transporting oilseed to a crushing facility is 17.7 ¢ kg−1. A crushing facility can pay up to 23.8 ¢ kg−1 for pennycress oilseed during the first year of production and provide investors 12.5% annual rate of return. Therefore, a profit margin of up to 6.1 ¢ kg−1 is available for the crushing facility to induce prospective pennycress producers to supply oilseed for SAF production. However, the estimated profit margin was sensitive mainly to uncertain oilseed yields, changes in field production costs, and pennycress meal and bio-oil prices. A spatial biorefineries sitting model, the Biofuels Facility Location Analysis Modeling Endeavor, estimated that the least-cost supply chain configuration is to establish three crushing facilities located in Union City, Huntington, and Clarksville, TN, to supply bio-oil to the biorefinery, with the biorefinery sited in an industrial park about 24.14 km from the Nashville international airport aviation fuel storage. Estimated total costs of bio-oil at the biorefinery plant gate are between 83 and 109 ¢ kg−1 if crushing facility oilseed procurement costs are between 17.7 and 23.8 ¢ kg−1 for oilseed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The increasing need of decarbonising energy intensive processes has risen the demand for biomass. Biomass production, distribution and use for energy generation involve several supply chain systems of which understanding requires a comprehensive analysis of the biomass supply chain management. The present article maps the volume and diversity of research carried out in the production and management of biomass supply chains for energy generation. It critically evaluates how well studies have captured multidimensional issues pertaining the supply chain management of biomass used for energy production and identifies future research trends in this field. The VOSviewer (Center for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) and SciMat (University of Granada, Spain) tools are employed for the construction of scientific maps that demonstrate the evolution of research in the biomass supply chain management area for energy production. The results revealed that research on the biomass supply chain for power generation is booming, especially in the United States, England and Italy. However, in developing nations such as Brazil, India and China, studies are still at an infant stage. There is a rising concern about the emerging new trends related to biomass supply chain management for energy generation, especially if clean energy aims to be a prominent place in the global energy matrix. </jats:p>"

It was observed that the removal of RhB could be significantly enhanced with Cu2+ compared with that of the case without Cu2+. In addition, the reaction reduced the RhB by 96% within 10 min, and meanwhile reduced the Cu2+ by 60% within 120 min. Investigation of the mechanism revealed that, on the one hand, Cu2+ species could be turned into Cu0 and Cu+ species; on the other hand, PS and Cu2+ could first accelerate the corrosion of ZVI to release Fe2+. Then, in situ generated Cu+ and Fe2+ further decomposed PS to produce ·SO4− and ·OH, which could take part in the removal of RhB. In addition, the ZVI/PS/Cu2+ system also showed a wider pH working range than the ZVI/PS system. Our study proved that simultaneous removal of heavy metal and organic compound in the ZVI/PS/Cu2+ system was feasible.</jats:p>",

These specifications are considered as random functions of the power supply interruptions duration. A feature of the specifications considered is the presence of finite jumps when the power supply exceeds the critical values. Generalized theoretical equations are obtained for continuous functions of mathematical expectation and variance of process downtime and damage when there is any number of finite jumps of certain implementations and there is consideration of the discontinuity points as random variables with different distribution laws. The obtained specifications are used to optimize the cost of creating power supply systems considering their reliability.</jats:p>",

Most US beekeeping operations have not expanded their colony numbers at the current levels of almond pollination fees. Thus, as almond acreage has increased, the marginal supplier of colonies has moved further away from California, increasing interstate shipments. We provide a conceptual representation of the supply and demand of U.S. colonies for almond pollination, and utilize the relatively inelastic demand for colonies to explore spatial elasticities of supply. We combine colony shipment data from 2007 to 2018 provided by the California Department of Food and Agriculture with projected prices from the California State Beekeeper's Association pollination fee survey. We use a geographically weighted regression to estimate supply elasticities for each state, and provide supporting regional estimates. The eastern United States, where beekeepers have hesitated to participate in almond pollination due to relatively high transportation costs and the potential for local honey production at the time of almond bloom, have some of the highest price elasticities of supply. This suggests that beekeepers in areas with low transportation and/or opportunity costs have supplied all available colonies, and increases in almond pollination fees have had little effect. We estimate that Florida, Georgia, and Texas had the largest number of colonies that did not participate in almond pollination in 2017, so further increases in supply are likely to come from those states.</jats:p>",

To achieve this, measurements of the actual level of HH and other unified power quality indexes were conducted, and oscillograms of the network mode parameters and HH spectrum were constructed. The measurement of unified power quality indexes was carried out with certified and calibrated power quality analyzers Metrel 2792A. These instruments satisfy the effective world standards on power quality and other reference documentation. Resonance frequencies where resonance modes emergence is possible were determined by calculation. Maximum overvoltage ratios for different points of the examined PSS were also determined.</jats:p>",

A case study using dynamic building simulation and static as well as dynamic emission factors for the year 2017 shows deviations of 3.4 % in the building’s GHG emissions. Furthermore, two emission factors for 2030 and 2050, which reflect the national 80 % carbon dioxide reduction target, are developed and applied to the case study. For these emission factors, the overall building’s GHG emissions decline drastically, whereas the deviation between the LCA using static or dynamic emission factors increases significantly. It can be seen that the application of a more dynamic approach for LCA adds substantial value to the investigation. However, further investigation on a broader set of dynamic input parameters for the LCA of energy efficient buildings seems to be reasonable.</jats:p>",

The electricity company produces electricity equipment. The four types of electricity equipment are cartridges, thermocouples, tubular and mica heaters. Some of them have stochastic demand. Each of them has three components of the same raw material and used to make the product. However, the company cannot fulfil the demand because raw materials are not available, so consumers are looking for items elsewhere. This delay occurred because of the delay in sending raw materials, so the company has to wait until the ordered items arrive. This problem is being more complicated by the differences in parameters for each supplier such as price differences and lead time of arrival. Therefore, the company must determine the optimum scheduling and safety time by minimizing inventory costs as a result of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) being used in resolving these problems.</jats:p>",

At the same time, with the reduction of energy storage (ES) costs and the gradual maturity of technology, user side ES, especially Battery ES, has become an effective means for enhancing users’ power supply reliability and reducing electricity bills. Battery ES, as the standby power supply, has a vast user side application. The configuration of ES can help users to ameliorate power quality and reduce electricity cost. It is a critical strategy for electricity sales companies to improve their competitiveness as well. Firstly, this paper analyzes the user side ES and introduces the user side ES development status and relevant policies. Then, we establish an ES configuration optimization model based on the cost–benefit system. To determine the optimal ES capacity of the system’s storage capacity, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with elite strategy (NSGA-II) is used as the method solving model. Finally, according to the cost-effectiveness of ES and the period of a contract signed by users, a price package with ES configuration is designed for users to choose.</jats:p>"

The numerical system used is the ECOS (Easy Coupling Oil System) oil spill model coupled to the three-dimensional hydrodynamic model Telemac-3D. The hydrodynamic results were analysed considering wind velocity fields and currents, which are the dominant forces in the displacement and behaviour of the oil. The reproducibility of the oil leak was confirmed by comparing the results of the simulations with the official environmental emergency report of the accident. The strong correlation between the simulation and the report showcases the capacity of the simulation methodology to reproduce real case scenarios of oil spills.</jats:p>"

Standard water quality parameters such pH, iron concentration experiments, experimental manganese, aluminum and experimental testing ammoniacal nitrogen were computed as comparison. Nanotechnology system water produces better quality when comparing to the pipe water as its pH value shows 6.62. From the experiments the concentration of iron, manganese, aluminium and ammoniacal nitrogen shows 0.08-, 0.07-, 0.05-, and 0.01 mg/L respectively which all the values are in compliance with the National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). As for water from reverse osmosis system and pipe water supply both its pH is 6.2 and 6.4 correspondingly which both are not concurrence with National Drinking Water Quality Standards. However, iron content for water from reverse osmosis (0.30 mg/L) is higher than water supply pipe (0.12 mg/L) and both are in the standard range.

This study can illustrate the movement and transportation of analysed heavy metals, and can be used for baseline information. Results from the study revealed that the concentration in the river water samples (in μg/L) varies: Cr (5.07 to 6.85), Co (3.47 to 6.07), Ni (5.23 to 9.38), Cu (4.56 to 10.11), Zn (2.13 to 60.91), As (3.97 to 5.7) and Pb (4.04 to 9.92). This study also revealed that these higher concentrations can be attributed to effluents from small-scale industries, unnoticed irrigation processes, and domestic wastes. The San Juan, St Joseph and Arouca rivers were found to be the most polluted, and Cu, Pb, Zn and As were the most abundant metals in the study area. Heavy metals analysed from most of the river-bed and river-bank positions showed very good correlation with respective river water samples (0.98 for river bed and 0.83 for river bank).</jats:p>",

A multi-proxy approach helps ensure rigour in how provenance data are interpreted. U–Pb geochronology of refractory zircon and relatively less stable apatite, and Pb isotopic analysis of labile K-feldspar are employed in this study to reassess the provenance of Triassic sandstones in the Slyne Basin, offshore western Ireland. This approach aims at reducing the potential bias in each method, producing a complementary dataset. U–Pb zircon and apatite geochronology yields Archean–Paleoproterozoic ages, Caledonian ages and previously unrecognized Permo-Triassic ages. Pb isotopic analysis of K-feldspar does not identify the Permo-Triassic as a source. The detection of Permo-Triassic-aged detritus may suggest that volcanism was more widespread than previously recognized. These results support the hypothesis of a Triassic drainage divide between the basins offshore western Ireland and those onshore Britain and in the Irish Sea. Sand supply was dominantly from the north, with significant input from the flanks of the basin, and previously unrecorded sources, such as Permian-aged rocks, playing an important role. The provenance signal is consistent and homogenized throughout the sampled sequence indicating that the drainage system was long-lived.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p content-type=\"supplementary-material\">\n            <jats:bold>Supplementary material:</jats:bold>\n            Details of laboratory and sample preparation, data tables and summary pie charts for each sample are available at\n            <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" specific-use=\"dataset is-supplemented-by\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4571096\">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4571096</jats:ext-link>\n          </jats:p>",

However, we lack a thorough understanding of which of these is the dominant driver of channel bed elevation change. This lack hampers flood hazard prediction, as changes to the bed elevation can either augment or reduce flood heights. Here, we explore the drivers of channel change using multidecadal time series of river bed elevation at 49 United States Geological Survey (USGS) gage sites in the uplands of Washington State, USA. We find that channel bed elevations at many of the gages change remarkably little over &gt;80 years, while others are highly unstable. Despite regionally synchronous decadal fluctuations in flood intensity, there is a lack of regional synchrony of channel response at the decadal scale. At the monthly scale, the magnitude of antecedent high flow events between gage measurements does not predict either the direction or magnitude of shift in channel bed elevation. That variations in flood magnitude are insufficient to explain changes in bed elevation suggests that fluctuations in sediment supply, rather than variation in peak flows, are the primary driver of change to river bed elevation. In this region, channels downstream from glaciers have statistically significantly greater variability in bed elevation compared to those lacking upstream glaciers. Together, these findings suggest that aggradation and incision signals in this region predominately reflect fluctuations in sediment supply, commonly associated with glaciogenic sources, rather than response to high flow events.</jats:p>",

Therefore, supplier assessment has then become critical decision‐making support for identifying and addressing inefficiencies of food providers, which ends up reducing the variation of several key logistics parameters for upstream members of the food supply chain. In addition, such assessment is of multicriteria nature given the presence of several criteria from different domains and various food suppliers. With these considerations in mind, this paper proposes a hybrid approach integrating the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision‐making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for evaluating the performance of pork suppliers. Thereby, the economic and operational burden caused by the bullwhip effect throughout the pork supply chain can be alleviated. AHP was first used to determine the criteria and subcriteria weights. Then DEMATEL was applied to assess the interdependence and feedback between the decision elements. Finally, TOPSIS was implemented to discriminate between high‐performance and low‐performance pork suppliers. A case study from the Colombian pork supply chain is presented to validate the proposed approach. The results of this study evidenced that the most important criterion was the “service level” and the most influencing factor was the “financial profile.” In addition, based on the supplier assessment results, improvement plans, and new negotiation, strategies were established for each supplier in order to diminish the bullwhip effect along the pork supply chain.</jats:p>",

We performed a comparative analysis of microbial communities and methanogenesis rates in 14 lake sediments along gradients of pH and primary productivity. Variation in methanogen community composition and non‐methanogen microbial community composition was best explained by pH and sediment organic matter content. However, these regulators of methanogen community structure were not associated with differences in methanogenesis rates. Instead, variation in lake methanogenesis rates was best explained by proxies for organic matter supplied to sediments (lake chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> concentration and sediment pore‐water total phosphorus) and the composition of the non‐methanogen microbial community.

Material flow data in this industry are still unsatisfactory, especially related to unused extraction materials, quarry wastes, and water consumption, aspects which usually are not included in environmental analysis studies. The aim of this study is to conduct a material flow analysis (MFA) of the Brazilian concrete and mortar supply chain to quantify material use efficiency (ME) and dematerialization potential. The MFA includes extraction, production, and construction stages for the following indicators: i) unused extraction; ii) quarry waste; iii) water consumption; iv) material wastage; v) raw material consumption; vi) energy carriers; and vii) atmospheric emissions. The results demonstrated that the primary raw material footprint is about 456 million metric tons (Mt) corresponding to a metabolic rate of 2.2 metric tons/capita (t/capita). After including unused extraction, quarry wastes, water consumption, and secondary materials this value increases to 4.1 t/capita corresponding to a total material consumption of 840 Mt. Concrete and mortar can be produced using two routes—mixing on site or industrial mixing. We conclude that the industrial scenario allows for dematerialization by about 8% for concrete and 24% for mortar, by mass; and the average material use efficiency is low, at about 53% for concrete and 34% for mortar.</jats:p>",

Especially in Emergency Departments, which are very crowded in terms of the number of applicants, patients wait for a long time without any treatment. Long waiting times between stations affect the total length of stay of the patients in this department. In this case, it directly affects patient safety. Furthermore, patients can leave from hospitals because of not to take effective and rapid treatment or lack of resource. Patient satisfaction is negatively affected and the brand value of these hospitals may decrease. All these events trigger hospital budget also. Hospital managers who faced these problems before, should first review all their existing processes, identify roadmaps and plan improvements. They are able to make use of advanced technologies and make investment decisions for improvement processes. However, investment decisions can be quite costly and can effect of hospital budget economically. Therefore, the use of simulations to compare the results of investment decisions can provide much more accurate decisions. The purpose of this study is to support hospital managers in making decisions by monitoring the impact of investment decisions (technology or resource investment) on the hospital budget. Both investment decisions will be simulated comparatively, patient processes and resource planning will be improved by creating a sustainable management model with RFID Technology.</jats:p>"

If a firm decides to implement ex post production strategy (PS), it can delay the production until the market acceptance uncertainty of its product is resolved. Otherwise, ex‐ante production strategy (AS) is implemented. We find that, due to the co‐opetition, PS does not always benefit either the manufacturer or the OEM, because the value of delayed production is diminished as the competitor may commit a production quantity earlier under AS. Further, firms’ decisions on production timing are dependent on the degree of market acceptance uncertainty of their products and competition intensity. We find that both firms choose PS when uncertainty is high, while only one of them chooses PS when uncertainty is moderate or low. Interestingly, when the competition is intense, the manufacturer tends to choose PS, which can benefit from both the resolved market acceptance uncertainty and OEM’s early commitment of production quantity. </jats:p>",

This paper aimed to develop a strategy for reducing GHGE in the Swedish school food supply while ensuring nutritional adequacy, affordability, and cultural acceptability. Amounts, prices and GHGE-values for all foods and drinks supplied to three schools over one year were gathered. The amounts were optimized by linear programming. Four nutritionally adequate models were developed: Model 1 minimized GHGE while constraining the relative deviation (RD) from the observed food supply, Model 2 minimized total RD while imposing stepwise GHGE reductions, Model 3 additionally constrained RD for individual foods to an upper and lower limit, and Model 4 further controlled how pair-wise ratios of 15 food groups could deviate. Models 1 and 2 reduced GHGE by up to 95% but omitted entire food categories or increased the supply of some individual foods by more than 800% and were deemed unfeasible. Model 3 reduced GHGE by up to 60%, excluded no foods, avoided high RDs of individual foods, but resulted in large changes in food-group ratios. Model 4 limited the changes in food-group ratios but resulted in a higher number of foods deviating from the observed supply and limited the potential of reducing GHGE in one school to 20%. Cost was reduced in almost all solutions. An omnivorous, nutritionally adequate, and affordable school food supply with considerably lower GHGE is achievable with moderate changes to the observed food supply; i.e., with Models 3 and 4. Trade-offs will always have to be made between achieving GHGE reductions and preserving similarity to the current supply.</jats:p>"

E-commerce channel (e-channel) has become an important retail channel. The multi-period closed-loop supply chain network of electronic channels (E-CLSCN) is studied. Moreover, this study considers the influence of consumers’ preference for products and artificial intelligence push (AI-push) on network balance under the conditions of dynamic and static. The network consists of manufacturers, remanufacturers, and demand markets. Remanufacturers are responsible for collecting and remanufacturing. The multi-period E-CLSCN model is established through variational inequalities. The study finds that whether dynamic or static, consumers’ preference for new products (NP) has positively correlated with the profits of manufacturers and the whole E-CLSCN. Consumers’ preference for remanufacturer products (RP) has only positively correlated with the profits of remanufactures. In the aspect of AI-push, the manufacturers’ AI-push has positively correlated with the profits of the entire players of E-CLSCN, while the remanufacturers’ AI-push has only positively correlated with the profits of the remanufacturers. Also, considering the multi-period, the sensitivity of the demand markets for the investment of manufacturers’ and remanufacturers’ AI-push gradually reduces, and the marginal benefit of AI-push gradually decreases. Finally, this paper addresses interesting managerial insights from the perspective of government and enterprises. Under the dual objectives of environmental protection and economic interests of enterprises, this study provides a reference for governments and enterprises to develop relevant dynamic policies. Namely, the government formulates dynamic environmental protection measures, and enterprises formulate dynamic strategic plans and implement government policies. While promoting the management level of E-CLSCN, it effectively boosts the development of the remanufacturing industry and recycling sustainable economy.</jats:p>"

In Greenland fluvial transported RF from the inland ice sheet sediments in riverbeds and marine outflows. This fine‐sized RF (50% &lt; 9.8 µm) has a high reactivity and may therefore potentially be used to rejuvenate nutrient poor soils and provide nutrients to plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of a RF from Greenland to supply P, K, Mg, and S to plants. A double‐pot system was used, in which ryegrass (<jats:italic>Lolium perenne L</jats:italic>.) could take up nutrients from both a hydroponic solution and a soil‐compartment with or without RF amendment; a soil mixture or pure sand was used in the soil‐compartment to estimate RF‐soil interaction effects. Omission of single nutrients from the hydroponic solution allowed assessment of which nutrients the RF in the soil‐compartment was able to supply. Ryegrass biomass was harvested four times during 62 days. We found that RF could supply K continuously to plants grown in soil or sand, but insufficient to fully circumvent K deficiency. During 62 days 5.8% and 4.3% of the applied K from RF was accumulated in the aboveground plant tissue in soil and sand, respectively. Mg was supplied from RF to plants in sand, but no significant effects were observed in soil, possibly due to background soil Mg availability. The amounts of P and S supplied to plants were insignificant. These results indicate the potential of Greenland RF to act as a slow release K and Mg fertilizer.</jats:p>",

We analyzed the plant mass, inoculant colony forming units and rhizosphere communities on 15, 22, 29 and 43 days after sowing. Selective plating showed that the bacterial inoculants had a good rhizocompetence and accelerated shoot and root growth and nutrient accumulation. 16S rRNA gene fingerprints indicated changes in the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. Amplicon sequencing revealed that rhizosphere bacterial communities from plants treated with bacterial inoculants were more similar to each other and distinct from those of the control and the Trichoderma inoculated plants at harvest time, and numerous dynamic taxa were identified. In conclusion, likely both, inoculants and the rhizosphere microbiome shifts, stimulated early plant growth mainly by improved spatial acquisition of available nutrients via root growth promotion. At harvest, all tomato plants were P-deficient, suggesting a limited contribution of inoculants and the microbiome shifts to the solubilization of sparingly soluble soil P.</jats:p>",

Thus, the Chinese government is increasingly exploring sustainable development of wildlife resources, and has implemented a series of measures, such as the modification of the Wildlife Protection Law (WPL), implementation of captive breeding licenses, an animal marking system, forest certification, and other actions to regulate captive breeding and utilization of wildlife. At the same time, the government tries to meet the Chinese traditional demand for wildlife products. We first introduce wildlife utilization as an internationally accepted conservation tool, and describe market‐based wildlife farming as a legal substitute for wild‐hunted animals. Second, we highlight the importance of wildlife products in Chinese culture and economy and review some successful examples of wildlife utilization in China, showing that the supply‐side approach is a viable alternative to classical conservation. Subsequently, we outline benefits of, and drawbacks to, China's ‘conservation through utilization’ approach, resulting in the implementation of China's new, revised WPL. We discuss merits and shortcomings of China's revised WPL and respond to recent national and international criticism on China's supply‐side approach to conservation. We strongly propose that captive breeding is a feasible approach to China's wildlife conservation–utilization dilemma, and much work is needed to promote the progress, such as legislation restructure, government attention, duties clarification, and so on. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We study the impacts of retail bundling on a supply chain with a manufacturer and a retailer. The retailer orders a primary product from the manufacturer before demand uncertainty materializes, and can retail it in a bundle with a secondary product afterwards. Our findings reveal three effects of bundling. First, bundling can help a retailer mitigate the adverse consequences of demand uncertainty in the primary product and price‐discriminate customers of the secondary product. Second, bundling can lower the retailer’s wholesale‐price elasticity and partition the retailer’s ordering decision into bundling and no‐bundling regions, between which there is a marked drop in the retailer’s optimal order quantity. Third, bundling affects the manufacturer’s wholesale price decision in an unexpected way: The manufacturer may lower the wholesale price when the retailer bundles. Our analysis shows bundling benefits the manufacturer, but can sometimes hurt the retailer. Further, when uncertainty in retail order is considered, while the manufacturer always benefits from retail bundling in expectation, it might be worse off with bundling depending on the realization of the uncertain market size. This explains why retail bundling has been a concern to some major manufacturers whereas they do not prohibit bundling up front. </jats:p>",

Here we combine hydrological and climate model simulations to evaluate risks to the water supply under projected shifts in the climate at the Paris Agreement warming levels. Modelling the primary surface water sources for Melbourne, Australia, we project that the risk of severe water supply shortage to the climate-dependent portion of the system increases substantially as global warming increases from 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C. Risks are further exacerbated by increases in water demand but substantially ameliorated by supply augmentation from desalination. We demonstrate that reductions in precipitation, rising temperature and growth in water demand combine to substantially amplify the risk of severe water supply shortage under near-term global warming in the absence of a climate-independent supply. This risk amplification is not as apparent in assessments based on meteorological drought alone. With the diminishing opportunity of meeting the 1.5 °C Paris target, our study highlights the need to accelerate greenhouse gas mitigation efforts to reduce risks to climate dependent water supply systems.</jats:p>",

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and β-tubulin sequences were used to confirm the species and determine the phylogenetic relationship among the isolates, while aflatoxin biosynthesis genes (aflR, aflP (omtA), aflD (nor-1), aflM (ver-1), and pksA) were targeted in a multiplex PCR to determine the toxigenic potential. A total of 76 and one isolates were confirmed as A. flavus and A. tamarii, respectively. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree resolved the species into two different clades in which all A. flavus (both aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic) were grouped in the same clade and A. tamarii was grouped in a different clade. The aflatoxin biosynthesis genes were detected in all aflatoxigenic A. flavus while the non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus failed to amplify at least one of the genes. The results indicated that both aflatoxigenic and non-aflatoxigenic A. flavus could survive in imported peanuts and, thus, appropriate storage conditions preferably with low temperature should be considered to avoid the re-emergence of aflatoxigenic A. flavus and the subsequent aflatoxin production in peanuts during storage.</jats:p>"

This study investigated the potential relationship between the alteration of phenolic compounds in lettuce induced by reduced nitrogen supply and its anti-proliferative effects on Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells. Our results showed that phenolic extracts from lettuce grown under low nitrogen conditions (LP) exhibited better anti-proliferative effects against Caco-2 cells, in part, by interfering with the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis, compared with those from lettuce supplied with adequate nitrogen. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and correlation analysis indicated that the better anticancer activity of LP may be not only related to the increased phenolic content, but also associated with the increased percentage contribution of quercetin to total phenolics. Taken together, alteration of phenolic composition by reduced nitrogen supply can be an effectively strategy for the development of healthy vegetables as anticancer products.</jats:p>"

Thus, managed aquifer recharge projects were built in the western Jinan spring catchment to protect the water supply of the spring. Yufuhe River was selected as the study area to compute the effective recharge rate into karst aquifers. This strong seepage zone has a large gradient and undergoes a specific hydrogeological condition in which two strata of a gravel layer and limestone change to three strata of gravel, impermeable clay shale and limestone at the open window of the karst aquifers. A hydraulic model called HEC-RAS was applied to simulate the river stage, and a numerical groundwater model called HYDRUS-3D was adopted to simulate the groundwater mound dynamics and estimate river flow seepage into the aquifers. The effective recharge rates are 64.9%, 65.2% and 68.1% when the buried depths of groundwater are 40, 30 and 25 m. An analysis of the electric conductivity, water table, temperature and water volume data found an effective recharge rate of 68.3%. Results of field monitoring confirmed the accuracy of the numerical simulation and showed that most of the recharged water in the study reach can be effectively recharged into the karst aquifers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sourcing new products in advance entails significant risks for a buyer. To reduce the possibility of bringing a mediocre item to the market, buyers can build a large supply base and pick the best available products after uncertainties have materialized. Designing such a supply base is a challenging task: the buyer needs to decide how many suppliers to recruit, and how to split them across potential groups, such as product types or geographies. In this study, we propose a framework to design optimal supply bases when multiple items must be sourced from potential suppliers that are subject to uncertainties on the profitability of their supplies. We start with the case of independent supplier profits: we characterize the optimal supply base size and find that it is optimal to recruit a much larger number of suppliers compared to the number of products needed, which increases in the riskiness of supplier designs so as to better exploit the potential upside in profitability deviations. We then study the case where different supplier groups are correlated. While the exact solution can be obtained in simple cases, the general stochastic problem can only be solved numerically. Hence, we propose three approximations that provide excellent solutions, especially when the number of products to source is large. Our framework thus provides guidelines for buyers that want to control their sourcing risks through supply base design and to improve their profits by exploiting the option value of diversification. </jats:p>",

The lubrication region of this piston ring–cylinder liner is divided into inlet, core lubrication, and outlet regions, with the oil supply being converted into an oil film. The impact of the width of the core lubrication region on squeezing of the oil is considered. To verify the model, friction force measurements are performed in a reciprocating bench test under fully flooded conditions, and the model is further validated by comparing the minimum oil film thickness with data from the literature. The model is applied to the top ring of a two-stroke marine diesel engine, and the impacts of the oil supply and its design parameters are analyzed. </jats:p>",

Fossil fuels have been utilized since the beginning of the twentieth century for electricity generation. However, fossil fuels depletion at the escalating pace as well as their formidable negative implications upon ecosystem contributed to increasing interest in harnessing renewable energy sources for producing electric power to meet the growing demand worldwide. In Iraq, the electrical supply is not sufficient to supply 12 hours a day of electricity. Many rural areas, particularly their schools are suffering from the electricity shortage such as Umm Qasr Primary School that located 20 km away from the city centre of Karbala city in the middle of Iraq. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid system which relies on renewable resources and the local grid to electrify Umm Qasr Primary School. Various combinations of energy resources have been analysed by using HOMER software to estimate an optimum hybrid system. The analysis illustrates that the optimal configuration of the projected system is composed of 22.4 kW PV modules, 59 batteries, and 5738kWh purchased from the local grid which has reduced the net present cost(NPC)from US$ 163791 the current situation to US$60,420 for the proposed system. The simulation findings also demonstrate that detrimental emissions have been reduced significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

The paper compares the stress field that occurs in the elbow when it is free, buried in the ground, and when it is anchored in a massive concrete block. Furthermore, we investigate how a crack appears and propagates in the elbow. This happens especially for the elbow buried in the ground where the stress and strain are higher than when the elbow is anchored in concrete.

Recent studies have identified the characteristics of the gut microbiota in patients with RA. However, it is still unclear how the microbiota can be modulated to slow down disease progression. In the present study, berberine, a modulator of gut microbiota with substantial anti‐RA effect, was chosen to explore the mechanisms by which the microbiota modulators ameliorate RA. The results showed that oral administration of berberine alleviated collagen‐induced arthritis (CIA) in rats in a gut microbiota‐dependent manner. Berberine down‐regulated the diversity and richness of the gut bacteria, reduced the abundance of <jats:italic>Prevotella</jats:italic>, and elevated the abundance of butyrate‐producing bacteria in CIA rats as determined by the 16S rRNA gene sequence, which might function through limiting the generation of nitrate and stabilizing the physiologic hypoxia in the intestine. Moreover, berberine treatment significantly increased the intestinal butyrate level and promoted the expression and activity of butyryl‐CoA:acetate‐CoA transferase (BUT). The coadministration of a BUT inhibitor largely diminished the adjustment of intestinal environment and the antiarthritic effect of berberine. In conclusion, modulators of the gut microbiota might serve as therapeutic agents for RA by inducing the butyrate generation through promoting the expression and activity of BUT.—Yue, M., Tao, Y., Fang, Y., Lian, X., Zhang, Q., Xia, Y., Wei, Z., Dai, Y.

In this study, a three-dimensional numerical wave tank was established to simulate the wave-float interaction based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations and the Realizable K-Epsilon Two-Layer turbulence model was applied. Firstly, convergence studies with respect to the mesh and time step were carried out and confirmed by the published analytical and numerical data. Then, the resonance condition of a particular float was solved by both numerical and analytical methods. The numerical and the analytical results are mutually verified in good agreements, which verify the reliability of the analytical process. Furthermore, a wave energy converter (WEC) consisting of a single float without damping constant was adopted, and its hydrodynamic performance in different wave conditions was investigated. It was found that the damping factor can affect the motion response of the float and the wave force it receives. Under a certain wavelength condition, the WEC resonates with the wave, at which the wave force on the float, displacement of the float and other parameters reach a maximum value. Finally, the influence of linear damping constant on the power take-off (PTO) was studied. The results show that the damping factor does not affect the wave number turning point of the optimal damping constant.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the good practices of seafood storage in the 21st DSup, identify issues of non-compliance that compromise food quality, and propose solutions. The system was evaluated, applying a checklist (RDC 275/2002) to evaluate the percentage of requirements in compliance with good practices. The 21st DSup was classified in Group 3, with 41% of items in conformance (&lt; 50%), and we found that there is no hygienic-sanitary self-control program for storing cold seafood and other food supplies. The cold stores’ temperatures are not able to maintain products within the required standards of conservation. The seafood cold storage protocol of the 21st DSup does not guarantee temperature conformity. It is necessary to implement a hygienic-sanitary self-control program for food supply storage, which should begin with the development of a food safety culture.</jats:p>"

In this study, we integrate stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) technique and data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology and propose a model, named “two‐stage SMAA‐DEA,” for efficiency evaluation and ranking of two‐stage supply chains (e.g., supplier–manufacturer) with stochastic criteria values. Two stochastic efficiency measures are defined for supply chain efficiency evaluation in the model. The maximum efficiency is the best efficiency score based on the optimistic criterion. The average efficiency is the expected efficiency score based on the average criterion. In addition, the model provides rank acceptability and holistic acceptability index for the supply chain ranking. The developed two‐stage SMAA‐DEA model has several advantages. First, it extends two‐stage DEA models to handle uncertain or imprecise inputs, intermediate measures, and outputs using stochastic distributions. Second, it allows for variable process weights and does not need any prior preference information on processes. Our study extends network DEA to address uncertain or stochastic measures, and the model can be considered as a multicriteria decision‐making method with a two‐stage additive DEA value function. An empirical study evaluating 27 supply chains is presented to illustrate the proposed models.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a simple model framework is developed to describe the interactions and feedback of the three categories of components within the regional water system. Taking Huainan City in Anhui Province of China as an example, a model is established with the system dynamics method to discuss its coevolution process. The results show that the development direction of Huainan City is consistent with the planning direction. The comprehensive effectiveness of the policies for developing water-saving technologies, supporting socio-economic development and ensuring food supply could be acceptable. Moreover, the improvements of water-saving technologies for agriculture and domestic water use need to be accelerated. The support for industrial development and the restrictions on pollutant emissions need to be strengthened. Therefore, the model could help decision-makers to understand the status of the water system, modify policies and make further planning. The coevolution of the regional water system is jointly dominated by the positive feedback loop aimed at productivity and the negative one aimed at sustainability.</jats:p>",

Carbon fibers are, by far, the most widely used fiber in high-performance applications. This important technology has huge potential for the future and it is expected to have a significant impact in the manufacturing industry within Europe and, therefore, coordination and strategic roadmapping actions are required. To lead a further drive to develop the potential of composites into new sectors, it is important to establish strategic roadmapping actions, including the development of business and cost models, supply chains implementation, and development, suitability for high volume markets and addressing technology management.

The respective effects are also employed as management options to improve nutrient acquisition and to minimize nutrient losses in cropping systems. However, surprisingly little is known concerning the interactions with rhizosphere biota. In this study, we investigated the effects of selected bacterial and fungal inoculants with proven plant growth‐promoting and phosphate (P)‐solubilizing potential (plant growth‐promoting microorganisms, PGPM) in maize with nitrate or stabilized ammonium supply, on soils with limited P availability and sparingly soluble rock phosphate (Rock‐P) applied as P fertilizer. The combination of the bacterial inoculants <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic> sp. DSMZ 13134 (Proradix) and <jats:italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</jats:italic> FZB42 with ammonium sulphate fertilization, stabilized with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4‐dimethylpyrazole‐phosphate (DMPP), resulted in a superior shoot biomass production (79–111%) and shoot P accumulation (109–235%) as compared with nitrate supply. This effect could be partially attributed to (1) ammonium‐induced rhizosphere acidification <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> increased root extrusion of protons, (2) promotion of root hair elongation, and (3) increased shoot concentrations of hormonal growth regulators (indole‐3‐acetic acid, zeatin, gibberellic acid). The effects, induced by the microbial inoculants were mainly related to increased root length development (43–44%), associated with a 60% increase in auxin production potential. No inoculant effects were detected on root hair elongation or on chemical modifications of the rhizosphere involved in P solubilisation, such as rhizosphere acidification, release of carboxylates or secretory phosphohydrolases. However, the ammonium‐induced stimulation of root hair elongation increased preferential sites for root colonization by the selected inoculants, which may explain the increase in rhizosphere abundance of PGPMs, exemplarily recorded for the fungal inoculant <jats:italic>Trichoderma harzianum</jats:italic> OMG16 (210%). The presented data suggest a network of positive interactions between stabilized ammonium fertilization and plant growth‐promoting functions of various bacterial and fungal PGPM inoculants. This offers perspectives to increase the efficiency and the reproducibility of PGPM‐assisted fertilization strategies.</jats:p>",

Each agent has two independent decision cores for buying and selling energy. These cores are developed based on a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e. Q‐learning algorithm, due to its high efficiency and appropriate performance in multi‐agent methods. Based on the proposed method, agents can buy and sell energy with the cost minimisation goal, while they should always have enough energy for the trip, considering the uncertain behaviours of EV owners.

However, the controls of sediment transported to deep‐lacustrine environments are comparatively understudied. In this study, we utilize field‐based outcrop data to investigate the variability of sediment distribution and its controlling factors in the Lower Cretaceous synrift Xiguayuan Formation in the Luanping Basin. Two fan‐delta systems with variability dominate the measured outcrop sections. At the lithological scale, the ratio of conglomerate to strata in the Xiyuan fan‐delta system is 87%, and the average thickness of individual coarse‐grained layers is ~1 m; the corresponding values in the Caoying fan‐delta system are 52% and 0.4 m. In addition, sand‐rich gravity‐flow deposits are developed in front of the Xiyuan fan delta, whereas mud‐rich mass transport deposits (i.e., sliding block and slumping debris) are found in front of the Caoying fan delta. At the stratigraphical scale, a delta succession in the Xiyuan section characterized by sand‐rich facies from proximal to distal parts is developed in a relatively steep slope setting. In the Caoying section, however, a delta succession characterized by sand‐rich facies in the proximal to middle parts is found in addition to a mud‐rich distal part developed in a gentle slope setting. Differential sediment supply resulted in significant variation in the sediment distribution pattern. In particular, the grain size of the fan‐delta front controls that of the deep‐lacustrine gravity‐flow deposits fed by them. This study highlights the variability of sediment supply and their control on sediment partitioning in continental rift and marine basins.</jats:p>",

Placental cells (trophoblasts) invade both into the tissue of the uterus and into the maternal blood vessels nearest to the site of implantation (the spiral arteries (SAs)) and transform these allowing a relatively high and steady flow of nutrient-rich blood to perfuse the placenta. Trophoblasts also form plugs that occlude SAs, preventing maternal blood flow to the placenta until the late first trimester, at which point these plugs dislodge or disintegrate. Here we present an agent-based model of trophoblast migration within plugged SAs to tease apart the impact of chemical signals and mechanical factors on trophoblast behaviour. The model supports our previous<jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic>hypothesis that plugging of the maternal arteries in early pregnancy can act to promote trophoblast invasion by providing a ‘low flow’ environment and extends our understanding by suggesting ‘weak spots’ in plug structure can lead to plug degeneration, allowing increased blood flow through the materno-fetal circulation.</jats:p>",

The adsorption process was further investigated using kinetics, isotherms and thermodynamic methods. The kinetics and isotherms studies showed the adsorption of Ni(II) on CAMCBs was fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isothermal adsorption model, respectively. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic at lower temperature, and the entropy of the adsorption process was negative. In the study of regeneration, it was confirmed that under the temperature of 60 °C, the desorption agent of CaCl2 with concentration of 3 g·L−1 was more conducive to the desorption of Ni(II) from CAMCBs. Both adsorption capacity and mechanical strength of the used CAMCBs could be basically recovered to the level of fresh CAMCBs after desorption. The prepared CAMCBs had a good property of adsorption of Ni(II) and an excellent regeneration performance.</jats:p>",

Herein, annual and monthly interactions in the Taoer River alluvial fan were calculated for the 1956–2014 period using the surface water balance method and the groundwater balance method, and a statistical model of interaction was obtained. The SGW interaction is shown in terms of the recharge of groundwater by surface water. From 1956 to 2014, the amount of SGW interaction in the study area varied greatly, averaging 27,848.4 × 104m3 annually. SGW interaction decreased gradually from the 1950s to the 1980s, and increased gradually from the 1980s to the present. During an individual year, SGW interaction increases gradually from January to July, peaking in July, and decreases gradually from August to December. An annual and a monthly multivariate regression statistical model were established. R2 was 0.697 for the annual model and 0.405 for the monthly model; the annual interaction model is more reliable. The model can be used to predict future trends in SGW interaction, which could be of great significance to the management of groundwater resources in the study area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>CNC machine is an industrial manufacturing machine that is used to improve quality and productivity of a product. Good tool life and surface finish of this CNC machining product are produced by applying wet cooling technique. However, this technique had affected the workpiece, tooling, health and environment. Also, there is only 10% to 15% of coolants used from the total amount of supply in the system and this lead to waste and increase productivity cost. Hence, the idea of using Programmable Logic Control (PLC) that inspired the control system of coolant supply plays an important role in developing the modern technology and industry for machining. The purpose is to develop a time-based automated coolant supply system and to test the system performance through evaluation of the roughness of the workpiece surface. The adjusted device to control the coolant supply employed a washing machine inlet control valve. Basically, the used of PLC is able to fulfil the function of the valve operation to control the flow of the coolant through the ON-OFF sequence based on time. Results from the experiment prove that better surface roughness is achieved through the application of automated coolant supply system. Hence, relationship between surface roughness and reduction in consumption of coolant in this system is also obtainable.</jats:p>"
