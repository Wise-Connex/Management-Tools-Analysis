      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Groundwater is effluent to rivers on Prince Edward Island. An approximate annual hydrologic balance can be made for various river basins, but the range in annual precipitation shows that this balance may vary widely. The movement of groundwater is permitted both\nby intergranular permeability and inter joint flow in the bedrock. Excellent supplies of groundwater are available and towns and industries obtain their water supply from well fields. Salt-water contamination occurs in a few wells close to the seashore, and may be the main water supply problem if\nlarger well fields are constructed for industrial and municipal growth.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The Future Gas Requirements and Supply Committee has been formed and staffed by the petroleum industry to provide a continuing long-range study of the future of the gas industry. Many factors bringing pressures to bear on the gas industry make possible a realistic self-appraisal of its future. After witnessing a period of unprecedented growth, investors, producers, consumers and regulators are seeking a clarification of the future of the industry to aid them in their planning. Equally important is the growing awareness that the industry itself is best equipped and qualified to forecast its own future. The Future Gas Committee, staffed from within the industry by marketing experts, geologists and engineers, can do much to meet this need. This paper deals with the development and philosophy of the Future Gas Requirements and Supply Committee and presents the results of its first studies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Why Are We Making This Study?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The industry is presently confronted with a confused picture of the future gas situation. During the past few years, there have been heard some highly conflicting and diametrically opposed predictions about the future of the business. Some have warned that this nation is going to run completely out of gas the day after tomorrow-while others have assured us that there are uncountable trillions of cubic feet of gas just waiting to be tapped. During the past 15 years at least 45 studies of the nation's gas supplies have been made. Conclusions of these studies of future gas supply, adjusted for production to Jan. 1, 1965, range from 0 to 3,000 trillion cu ft of gas. It is a certainty that both extremes of these opinions cannot be correct. It is not known which of these many studies is correct. What really matters is just what will factual study reveal. All of us believe that the gas business has a lot of growth left in it. But a more accurate measure of just how much and how fast it will grow in the next 5, 10, even 20 years, is needed. Unbiased estimates based on the combined knowledge of many of the most informed people throughout the entire industry is necessary. Help is needed from men who have a storehouse of data at their fingertips and the experience and know-how to do the job. Certainly this process will provide results that should become more widely accepted than the individual opinion. With a view to obtaining this information through a more unified, industry-sponsored effort, many of the leaders of the natural gas industry expressed a strong desire for a continuing long-range study of the requirements and supply of natural gas in the United States. As a result, in 1960 plans to form such a committee were made and in 1962 the Future Gas Requirements and Supply Committee was organized under the auspices of the American Gas Association. It later became an independent committee to permit expansion of its activities outside the U.S. Since that time both the Requirements Div, and the Supply Div. have published their first reports covering the U.S. Future reports of the two divisions will be consolidated to show the relationship between requirements and supply. In mid- 1965, the Colorado School of Mines agreed to sponsor the committee. This sponsorship has accelerated original plans to include Canada, Mexico and Alaska in the studies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Gas Supply Committee</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Organization</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Gas Supply Committee consists of nearly 100 committee and subcommittee members. There are 12 committee members, each of whom is chairman of a subcommittee responsible for estimating the future gas supply available under existing economic and technological conditions in his assigned subdivision of the U. S. Subcommittee members intimately familiar with specific portions of the working area are selected by the subcommittee chairman and each subcommittee consists of as many members as deemed necessary by the chairman to adequately determine the future gas supply of his assigned area.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>General Procedures</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The committee and its subcommittees work continuously with private information obtained on a confidential basis from many sources. Continuation of the committee's important task and the value of its estimates depend on the availability of such data. Each member is fully aware of and respects the confidential nature of both the data and the estimates made available to him. Subcommittees met and discussed assignments prior to the commencement of studies, and as often thereafter as necessary. Each subcommittee member bas made detailed studies of his assigned area using data and manpower available to him. Upon completion of various phases of studies by members, the subcommittees met and analyzed the individual estimates and each committee then prepared a report for its area.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>P. 43ˆ</jats:p>",

The ability of these measures to predict the supply of potassium was tested by growing subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) in pots and determining its potassium content at successive harvests. The soil's buffering capacity was found to affect the supply of potassium even when uptake was small. It is suggested that this was partly because buffering capacity affects the rate of supply by diffusion to plant roots. As the uptake of potassium became progressively larger, the potential became increasingly unsuitable as a single index of availability, but a multiple regression containing terms for potential and for buffering capacity continued to account for a large proportion (89%) of the variation. The relationship obtained can be used to indicate the amount of potassium required to bring a deficient soil to a desirable status.</jats:p>"

In each experiment, increase in phosphate supply led to increases in total dry weight production. As phosphate deficiency became more acute in the Dwalganup strain, the leaf concentrations of two isoflavones, formononetin and genistein, increased as much as twofold; a third isoflavone, biochanin A, showed little change. In the Mt. Barker strain the concentrations of genistein and biochanin A increased about twofold with increasing severity of phosphate deficiency, while those of formononetin increased at least fourfold. It is suggested that isoflavone formation in clover leaves increases under phosphate deficiency, and that this is associated with increased carbon substrates in the leaf cells. The relations between isoflavone levels and oestrogenic potency are discussed. Phosphate deficiency may be indirectly related to oestrogenic potency through its influence on isoflavone levels.</jats:p>"

When sheep consumed wheaten straw ad libitum, and a quantity of coarsely ground wheaten straw equal to 140% of the VFC during a control period was given intraruminally, VFC ceased and digesta accumulated in the rumen. VFC decreased when indigestible materials were introduced into the rumen. The voluntary consumption of lucerne hay decreased by 15% when sawdust was introduced into the rumen at a rate equivalent by weight to 17% of the VFC during a control period ; decreases of 7 and 9% were found when finely ground polyvinyl chloride was introduced at rates equivalent by weight to 25 and 50% respectively of VFC during control periods. The voluntary consumption of wheaten hay decreased by 16 and 19% when sawdust was introduced into the rumen at rates equivalent by weight to 25 and 18% respectively of VFC during control periods. Intraruminal infusions of acetic acid, propionic acid, or a mixture of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids providing 290–510 kcal of energy daily were accompanied by decreases in the voluntary consumption of lucerne hay and wheaten hay; the decreases ranged from 0.29 to 0.86 g dry matter per kcal of energy infused; similar decreases were obtained when propionic acid was infused into the abomasum of sheep given lucerne hay. The intake of lucerne hay was 9% higher when given alone than when supplemented with 6% propionic acid.

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate methods developed for calculating the supply of ions to the root by mass‐flow and by root interception. Root interception values were calculated by assuming that all the exchangeable and soluble ions were in the pore space and that the roots intercepted an amount in proportion to their volume. Mass‐flow was calculated by multiplying the amount of water uptake of the plant by the concentration of ions in this water as determined from analysis of a saturation extract.</jats:p><jats:p>Contributions of mass‐flow were varied by creating three rates of transpiration. The results indicated that mass‐flow was significant for supplying Ca and Mg but was of little importance for Na and K in the soil used. Increases in mass‐flow of Ca and Mg were highly correlated with increases in the uptake of Ca and Mg by the plant.</jats:p><jats:p>In a second experiment, root interception of Ca and Mg was varied by using soil‐sand mixtures varying from 100% soil to 20% soil and 80% sand. Mass‐flow was minimized by leaching the soil before use.
