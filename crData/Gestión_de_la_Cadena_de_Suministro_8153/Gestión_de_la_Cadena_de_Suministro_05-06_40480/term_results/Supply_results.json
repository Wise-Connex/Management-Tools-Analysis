Buoyant estimates suggest that the natural gas market share will increase dramatically by the year 2020.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Natural gas demand will be greatly influenced by the developed economies, namely the United States, Japan and Europe, the emerging energy super-consumer China and the rapidly developing economies of some of the world's most populous nations such as Brazil and Mexico.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper focuses on Mexico. Mexico's trillion-dollar economy has resulted in its becoming the second largest US trading partner. The purpose of this work is to generate a framework wherein Mexico can develop its internal energy market and still be a strategic partner for energy with the United States. Strategies such as (a) interconnecting pipelines with the United States, (b) exporting LNG, (c) increasing the gas-to-oil ratio from its existing portfolio, and (d) increasing dry-gas exploration efforts are some of the different options that are considered and outlined in this work.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding of construction procurement within the supply chain management framework and develop a model for information flow. This paper adheres to the supply chain perspective and integration as theoretical point of departure, typically the role that information plays in a complex network such as construction procurement. The co‐ordination within partners and the integration across partners are critical in effective project management. Sharing information is a key component for tight integration to optimize the chain‐wide performance. It helps produce highest quality, low cost and minimum time to service. The tender offer from the procurer or invitation from a supplier triggers the requirement process. In response to the requirements there has to be an opposite flow of information, termed the fulfilment flow in the model described. The requirement information from a procurer is broken down to the project requirements for various partners in the project. Once the supply chain is identified in the postcontracting phase, information regarding specific tasks, materials, and so on, are communicated to the project partners. Information must be managed to bring in value. The quality of information received, the timeliness of the manner it is received and the costeffectiveness in obtaining the information determine the efficiency of a project partner. Another classification considered is that of the changing role of the partner with regard to information handling, i.e., the project partner as a recipient, decision‐maker and communicator of information. All these factors jointly contribute to increasing efficiency in construction procurement. This framework needs to be explored in future research to define subsequent steps in construction supply chain management, as the challenge is to adapt a totally integrated supply chain.</jats:p>",

Also, labor supply generates the basis for tax revenue. Secondly, married women are the most responsive component of the labor force with respect to changes in incentives. As we illustrate in this chapter, their behavior turns out to be crucial in designing and evaluating tax-transfer policies. Taxes are collected in order to finance government spending. Many trends contribute to increasing demand for government spending. The fact that individuals are living longer, and that cohorts born in the late 1940s and 1950s were rather large, imply that in the coming decades there will be an increasing number of ageing individuals.</jats:p>",

This pattern is consistent with microeconomic predictions: economic models of fertility behavior predict in fact that an increase in women’s schooling levels and wage rates leads to an increase in their labor supply and to a reduction in fertility. The existence of an inverse relationship between fertility and participation was theoretically established by Becker and Lewis (1973) and Willis (1973) and empirically documented by Butz and Ward (1979) for the United States and Mincer (1985) on a cross-country basis. A negative relationship between women’s labor market participation and fertility is a cause of concern for several reasons.</jats:p>",

We consider a two-stage supply chain model in which a retailer serves autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) demand and a manufacturer fills the retailer’s orders. We characterize three types of situations based on the parameters of the demand process: (i) the manufacturer benefits from inferring demand information from the retailer’s orders; (ii) the manufacturer cannot infer demand, but benefits from sharing demand information; and (iii) the manufacturer is better off neither inferring nor sharing, but instead uses only the most recent orders in its production planning. Using the example of ARMA(1,1) demand, we find that sharing or inferring retail demand leads to a 16.0% average reduction in the manufacturer’s safety-stock requirement in cases (i) and (ii), but leads to an increase in the manufacturer’s safety-stock requirement in (iii). Our results apply not only to two-stage but also to multistage supply chains. </jats:p>",

We propose a single-period inventory modelling framework with two ordering opportunities. The second order reflects updated demand information and potentially capitalizes on supply chain flexibility. We consider two complementary forms of flexibility: quantity flexibility in production and timing flexibility in scheduling. In this framework, we analyze the total inventory cost of a firm for alternate demand types. We model functional products through the standard assumption of independent demand over the period, fashion-driven innovative products through a Bayesian model, and innovative products with evolving demand through a Martingale process. The three demand processes exhibit very different behavior with respect to the value of the alternate forms of flexibility. We observe that quantity flexibility is of moderate value for functional goods and of high value for fashion-driven products for all lead times. Quantity flexibility is of low value for goods with evolving demand with long lead times but of high value for short lead times. Alternately, we observe timing flexibility is of highest value for functional goods, especially for cases of high holding cost, and is of lesser value for fashion-driven goods. It is of least value for goods with evolving demand. Both quantity and timing flexibility capabilities are required to significantly reduce the relevant supply chain costs for evolving-demand innovative goods when the lead times are long. </jats:p>",

Industry has expressed a need for robust concurrent product development (CPD) practices to include supplier issues. Unfortunately, most of the practices currently available provide little to quantitatively analyze the product development process and to identify risk as a direct result of supplier interactions. This study develops metrics that characterize product development project risk that results from supplier interactions by using the concepts of degree of design customization (DoDC) and coupling ratio (CR). A correlation analysis based on HP LaserJet development projects demonstrates that the proposed metrics for DoDC and CR are good indicators of the likelihood of product development efficiency. Furthermore, there was enough evidence to use the interaction term, the CR multiplied by the DoDC, as a risk index. An important implication of using the coupling assessment as part of the project risk assessment is that the same process can address both project and product risks. </jats:p>",

We argue that total chain performance can be enhanced by designing and operating supply chains in ways that provided enduring positive signals from the environment to minimize adverse perceptions of powerlessness, coercion and unfairness and increase members' perception of their identity with the organisation. We also explore the interaction between these perception factors and the human factors of opportunism, bounded rationality and risk aversion on the one hand and the environmental factors on the other. </jats:p>",

A key part of this new freedom is the ability to employ personal assistants (PAs) on terms laid down by the direct payments user. While endorsing the basic principles underpinning direct payments, this article raises questions over whether the employment market in suitably skilled and competent PAs has been sufficiently well researched. For example, with demand set to grow, will there be an adequate supply of reliable workers to employ? It is possible that raised expectations will not be able to be met adequately. The article also raises questions about regulation and training, particularly in relation to how best to ensure that the needs of vulnerable people are met, that risk is managed effectively and that the principle of leaving key decision making with the employer is retained.</jats:p>",

However, quantitative assessments of changes in the annual and seasonal discharge regime of (Sub‐)Arctic rivers resulting from climate change are still far from accurate. The sensitivity of discharge to potential changes in climate in two river catchments of intermediate size (10<jats:sup>4</jats:sup>–10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>), the Tana River in northern Fennoscandia and the Usa River in northern Russia, both draining into the Barents Sea Basin, was evaluated using a spatially distributed water balance model. The tentative results show that discharge amounts during peak flow might remain more or less the same or show a slight increase. However, peakflow events are expected to occur about 20 days or more earlier in spring. Concerning annual discharge amounts a strong increase of 25% for the Usa River and even 39% for the Tana River is simulated in conformity with projected increases in precipitation. Obviously, the resulting increases of the annual freshwater influx from the Tana River (from 5.3 to 7.3 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) and that of the Usa River (from 42 to 52 km<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) into the Barents Sea are insignificant in absolute terms. But in relative terms they agree remarkably well with earlier estimates of changes in freshwater inflow by the very large (Sub‐)Arctic rivers. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Bidimensional time-dependent equations have been solved by using a semi-implicit finite-element code. The model has been developed in the frame of the local thermodynamic equilibrium hypothesis. After validation by using experimental data from the literature, this model was applied to analyze the effects of some key parameters such as frequency for an ac arc current and the ratio cycle parameter for square arc-current wave form on the convective process. The results obtained have been used to analyze the dynamic thermal behavior of high-pressure mercury plasma (pressure equal to 0.3 MPa) working under currents widely different in frequency and wave form.</jats:p>",

The objectives of this study were to investigate P and K efficiency of faba beans (<jats:italic>Vicia faba</jats:italic> L.), to determine their root growth and root turnover, and to assess the relevance of root turnover on P and K uptake at limited supply. Faba beans were grown as part of a long‐term fertilization experiment on fertilized plots (control) and plots that had not received any P or K fertilizer for 16 years (P0, K0). Although the unfertilized soils were low and very low in their P‐ and K‐supply level, respectively, no differences in shoot‐dry‐matter production occurred compared to the control. However, relative K concentration in dry matter of the K0 plants (control plants = 100) decreased during the experiment and was only 60% of the control at the final harvest. This indicated a high K‐utilization efficiency of faba bean. Relative phosphorus concentration increased in the P0 treatment and was not different from the control at the last harvest, indicating an improvement in P‐uptake efficiency with time. The size of the standing root system determined by sequential auger sampling (net development) was not influenced by P and K supply. Total root production as measured by the ingrowth‐core method was about 6 times higher than the average size of the standing root system and even increased under low‐K conditions. This indicated a fast root turnover. Modeling soil nutrient transport and uptake revealed that calculated uptake of the control was up to 48% higher when root turnover was taken into account, compared to calculations based on the net development of the root systems. This is due to a better soil exploitation. Under K shortage, root turnover resulted in a 117% higher calculated uptake, which was close to measured K uptake. Root turnover was also of benefit for P uptake, but calculated P uptake was significantly less than measured, indicating that root turnover was of little importance for P uptake of faba beans.</jats:p>",

Irreducible uncertainties regarding the dose–response curve prevent us from quantifying the minimum effective release.

Reconstructions of the relative motion of the Australian and Pacific plates reveal divergence in the central Southern Alps prior to ∼20.1 Ma (chron 6o), followed by increasing average rates of convergence, with a marked increase after ∼6 Ma (late Miocene). A strike–slip component existed prior to 33.5 Ma (chron 13o) and perhaps as early as Eocene (45 Ma). However, rapid strike–slip motion (&gt;30 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) began at ∼20.1 Ma (chron 6o). Since ∼20.1 Ma there has been no significant change in the strike–slip component of relative plate motion.</jats:p><jats:p>Sedimentation rates are calculated from individual sequence volumes that are then summed to represent sequence groups covering the same time periods as the tectonic reconstructions. Rates are relatively high (&gt;22 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), from 15 to ∼11.5 Ma (sequence group 1). Rates decrease to a minimum (&lt;15 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) during the ∼11.5–6 Ma interval (sequence group 2), followed by increased rates during the periods of ∼6–2.6 Ma (21 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; group 3) and 2.6–0 Ma (∼25 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>; group 4). Good agreement between sedimentation and tectonic convergence rates in sequence groups 2–4 indicates that tectonism has been the dominant control on sediment supply to the Canterbury basin since ∼11.5 Ma. In particular, high sedimentation rates of 21 and ∼25 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in groups 3 and 4, respectively, may reflect increased plate convergence and uplift at the Southern Alps at ∼6 Ma. The early‐middle Miocene (∼15–11.5 Ma) high sedimentation rate (22 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) correlates with low convergence rates (∼2 mm yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and is mainly a response to global climatic and eustatic forcing.</jats:p>",

Characterizing the supply of propagules is key to understanding invasion risk and developing effective management strategies. In coastal ecosystems, ships' ballast water is an important transfer mechanism (vector) for marine and freshwater species. Commercial ships exhibit a high degree of variation in ballast water operations that affect both the quantity and quality of propagule supply, and thereby invasion risk. The per-ship inoculation size from ballast water depends upon both the volume discharged and the organism density. Moreover, propagule quality will vary among source regions (ports) and voyage routes, due to differences in species composition and transport conditions, respectively. We show that significant differences exist in (i) the frequency and volume of ballast water discharge among vessel types, (ii) the frequency of vessel types and routes (source regions) among recipient ports, and (iii) the transit success (survivorship) of zooplankton in ballast tanks among voyage routes. Thus, propagule supply is not a simple function of total ship arrivals. For ships, as well as other vectors, variation in propagule quantity and quality must be explicitly considered to estimate invasion risk and advance predictive ability.</jats:p>",

The contributions of the other two enzymes were also demonstrated; however, these were observed only in the absence of the critical contributor, which was supported by complementation for some <jats:italic>pos5</jats:italic> phenotypes by the overexpression of <jats:italic>UTR1</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>YEF1</jats:italic>. The viability of the triple mutant suggested that a ‘novel’ enzyme, whose primary structure is different from those of all known NAD and NADH kinases, probably catalyses the formation of cytosolic NADP in <jats:italic>S. cerevisiae</jats:italic>. Finally, we found that <jats:italic>LEU2</jats:italic> of <jats:italic>Candida glabrata</jats:italic>, encoding β‐isopropylmalate dehydrogenase and being used to construct the triple mutant, complemented some <jats:italic>pos5</jats:italic> phenotypes; however, overexpression of <jats:italic>LEU2</jats:italic> of <jats:italic>S. cerevisiae</jats:italic> did not. The complementation was putatively attributed to an ability of Leu2p of <jats:italic>C. glabrata</jats:italic> to use NADP as a coenzyme and to supply NADPH.</jats:p>",

Fish were fed from the onset of exogenous feeding at 7 to 37 d post‐hatch with five isoproteic and isolipidic compound diets with different levels of EPA and DHA. Diet names indicated the percentage of EPA and DHA contained in the phospholipids (PL) and neutral lipids (NL), as follows: PL5, PL3, PL1, NL1, and NL3. Histological observations showed different patterns of lipid absorption and accumulation in the intestinal mucosa depending on the level and nature of the dietary lipid fraction. Fish fed high levels of neutral lipids (11%, NL3 diet: 2.6% of EPA+DHA in the NL fraction) showed large intracellular and intercellular lipid deposits in the anterior intestine, but no such lipid accumulation was detected when larvae were fed with low and moderate levels of EPA and DHA in the phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions of the diet (PL and NL1 diets). PL were preferentially absorbed in the postvalvular intestine, and the accumulation of marine PL was inversely correlated to their dietary level. The postvalvular intestinal mucosa and liver showed signs of steatosis; large lipid vacuoles were observed in this region of the intestine and in the liver and were inversely correlated with the level of dietary neutral lipids. The best results in terms of growth, survival, and development (maturation of the digestive system and histological organization of the liver and intestinal mucosa) were obtained in the group fed with 2.3% of EPA and DHA in the PL fraction of the diet (PL3 diet), revealing that European sea bass larvae use the LC‐PUFa contained in the PL fraction more efficiently than those from the NL fraction of the diet.</jats:p>",

A pellet size controlling bioreactor has been used successfully for the production of the anti‐tumor polysaccharide of <jats:italic>S commune</jats:italic>. The average pellet size of mycelia in a bubble column bioreactor was around 20.5 mm in a typical run without using pellet size control. By forcing the fermentation broth through a pellet size control device with a stainless screen at five different fermentation times ranging from 1.0 to 4.5 days in each batch, different fungal pellet sizes ranging from 12.3 to 3.0 mm were achieved. The formation of anti‐tumor polysaccharide, schizophyllan (SPG), was significantly associated with the pellet morphology and oxygen supply rate. An optimal product yield of 0.29 g g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> glucose was obtained when the pellet size was controlled at 12.3 mm. Oxygen transfer limitation inside the pellets was responsible for the formation of entrapped polysaccharide. Maximum entrapped SPG yield (<jats:italic>Y</jats:italic>p/s entrapped) of 0.88 g g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> glucose occurred at the optimal pellet size of 12.3 mm.

Abundance of all life history stages (zoeae, megalopae, juveniles and ovigerous females) was sampled approximately biweekly at each site from June 2001 to June 2002. The reproductive season, based on the presence of ovigerous females, is ∼5 months (June to October) at both sites. Zoeae-I were collected from June to July 2001 and in June 2002 at Terence Bay, and from June to August 2001 at Benacadie Pond. We did not collect later zoeal stages at either site. Megalopae were collected from September to October 2001 at Terence Bay, and from August to September 2001 at Benacadie Pond. Juveniles 1–6 mm carapace width (CW) were present throughout the summer at Terence Bay, and only in autumn at Benacadie. Juveniles 6–12 and 12–27 mm CW were present throughout the summer and autumn at both sites. At Terence Bay, densities of 1–6 and 12–27 mm CW juveniles did not vary among intertidal zones. In contrast, the 6–12 mm CW size-class appeared to move higher in the intertidal through the season, possibly due to effects of predation.</jats:p>",

Second, we tested whether we could reproduce the influence of increased myocardial fatty acid (FA) metabolism on cardiac efficiency in the isolated working mouse heart model, which has already been documented in large animal models. The hearts were perfused with crystalloid buffer containing 11 mM glucose and two different concentrations of FA bound to 3% BSA. The initial concentration was 0.3 ± 0.1 mM, which was subsequently raised to 0.9 ± 0.1 mM. End-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships were assessed by temporarily occluding the preload line. Different steady-state PVA-MV̇o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>relationships were obtained by changing the loading conditions (pre- and afterload) of the heart. There were no apparent changes in baseline cardiac performance or contractile efficiency (slope of the PVA-MV̇o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>regression line) in response to the elevation of the perfusate FA concentration. However, all hearts ( n = 8) showed an increase in the y-intercept of the PVA-MV̇o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>regression line after elevation of the palmitate concentration, indicating an FA-induced increase in the unloaded MV̇o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. Therefore, in the present model, unloaded MV̇o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>is not independent of metabolic substrate. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a PVA-MV̇o<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>relationship in ex vivo perfused murine hearts, using a pressure-volume catheter. The methodology can be an important tool for phenotypic assessment of the relationship among metabolism, contractile performance, and cardiac efficiency in various mouse models.</jats:p>",
