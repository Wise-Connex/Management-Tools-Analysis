      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Considering a supply chain with a supplier subject to yield uncertainty selling to a retailer facing stochastic demand, we find that commonly studied classical coordination contracts fail to coordinate both the supplier's production and the retailer's procurement decisions and achieve efficient performance. First, we study the vendor managed inventory (VMI) partnership. We find that a consignment VMI partnership coupled with a production cost subsidy achieves perfect coordination and a win‐win outcome; it is simple to implement and arbitrarily allocates total channel profit. The production cost subsidy optimally chosen through Nash bargaining analysis depends on the bargaining power of the supplier and the retailer. Further, motivated by the practice that sometimes the retailer and the supplier can arrange a “late order,” we also analyze the behavior of an advance‐purchase discount (APD) contract. We find that an APD with a revenue sharing contract can efficiently coordinate the supply chain as well as achieve flexible profit allocation. Finally, we explore which coordination contract works better for the supplier vs. the retailer. It is interesting to observe that Nash bargaining solutions for the two coordination contracts are equivalent. We further provide recommendations on the applications of these contracts. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics 63: 305–319, 2016</jats:p>",

However, the current levels of service coverage and quality are still far from adequate, as acknowledged by local authorities and international agencies. Thus, an assessment of how much Cape Verdean households are willing to pay (WTP) for service improvements is a fundamental ingredient informing sector policy formulation going forward. This is the focus of this study. Valuation functions were estimated using suitable estimation methods. The results show that, taking into consideration their current levels of expenditure with this service, households would in general not be WTP more for significant improvements in their current water supply services, and that household income and the age of the head of the household both have significant effects on their WTP.</jats:p>",

A consortium of Harris Corporation, Nexen Energy ULC, Suncor Energy, Inc., Devon Canada Corporation, and Alberta's Climate Change and Emissions Management Corporation (CCEMC) are developing Effective Solvent Extraction Incorporating Electromagnetic Heating (ESEIEH™). The ESEIEH process integrates electromagnetic heating with solvents to reduce energy consumption and to eliminate the need for added water (steam) when compared to SAGD. Further to the operational benefits are the reduction of surface facilities and the option to economically export undiluted bitumen without the added cost of diluent recovery units. This paper summarizes an initial case study aimed at forecasting the supply cost of a notional 10,000 barrel per day (bpd) ESEIEH demonstration project in Alberta's oil sands.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Utilizing Harris' Coupled Electromagnetic Reservoir Simulator (CEMRS), the ESEIEH process is first simulated as a single well pair. Applying a field scheduling tool, the resulting reservoir run is then duplicated in time until sufficient wells are in place to establish a sustained field level oil production rate of 10,000 bpd. Various scenarios will be assessed and their corresponding capital requirements estimated; these scenarios include a green field with dilbit export, a green field with undiluted rail export, and an ESEIEH pad added adjacent to an existing SAGD cogeneration facility with available low water cut produced fluids handling capacity. For each of these scenarios a cash flow analysis is performed, supply cost estimated, and basic sensitives performed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The technology, which began development in 2010 and recently commenced the second technical demonstration phase in July 2015 is expected to be economically viable in a sustained sub-$60 WTI (USD) oil price environment.</jats:p>",

Operators discovered 2.8 billion bbl of crude oil and liquids last year, the lowest volume since 1954, according to a new report by consultancy IHS. Most of the reserves were found in deep water, which take years to bring on to production.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Two other recent reports were much-discussed during last month’s Offshore Technology Conference in Houston. Global deepwater spending continues to fall because of the oil price crash, with the Americas and Africa the only bright spots, according to a new study by Douglas-Westwood. A year ago, the consultancy saw 210 potential projects for installation in the next 5 years but now expects only 118 projects to be installed during 2016–2020.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>E&amp;P capital spending will be led by investments in the Americas and Africa, which combined will account for 87% of expenditures. The development of east Africa’s gas basins and several US Gulf of Mexico plays will keep those centers as deepwater hubs. The Gulf of Mexico projects include Shell’s Appomattox field, its largest floating platform offshore US; Anadarko’s subsea tiebacks at three fields; Chevron’s Jack/St. Malo floating production system; and BP’s Mad Dog phase 2 development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Wood Mackenzie is warning that the steep drop in production could lead to critical shortfalls in the future. It expects the industry to spend USD 40 billion/yr on exploration and appraisal from 2016 to 2018, less than half of what was spent during 2012–2014, and that number could be lower depending on what oil prices do. The consultancy sees a shift to smaller, near-field operations in the immediate future, with the industry eschewing high-dollar complex projects that potentially bring more lucrative output. Even many medium-term discoveries made before the price downfall are being delayed because of company budget cuts. Those factors contribute to its prediction that continued poor exploration results could lead to a 4.5-million-B/D shortfall in the industry meeting demand by 2035, although a lot of variables could change in 19 years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Consultancies are not the only ones worried about coming supply shortfalls. Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard, speaking to investors about the company’s first quarter earnings, said E&amp;P investment likely will not meet future global energy demand unless something changes. “I think we will need significant increases in E&amp;P investment,” he was quoted as saying. “If you look at new investments that are relatively short cycle, there are two sources of that. It is going to be the conventional land international and it is going to be the unconventional land in North America. …So I think the sources of additional production for 2017 are limited to these items. Beyond that, I think we need a widespread, significant increase in E&amp;P investments to get supply back to where it can meet growing demand.” JPT</jats:p>",

These efforts have featured installing solar power and micro hydropower generation facilities at our purification plants and distribution reservoirs. The Yokohama water treatment facilities include purification plants based on gravity systems (Nishiya and Kawai plants) and pumped systems (Kosuzume plant). As the purification plants employing gravity systems place a smaller load on the environment, we use them as effectively as we can. When it was time to refurbish the distribution pumps, we reviewed the pump control system and identified initiatives for reducing pumped system power consumption.</jats:p>",

Water shortages are a major concern, and this problem is expected to be exacerbated in the future. An exploration program was undertaken to investigate the groundwater occurrence in areas of the Chubut River basin in order to provide new supply options for pastoral farming. The investigation involved the drilling of exploration holes and construction of bores for long-term monitoring. Water quality and hydraulic test data were also collected. Findings from the study indicate that alluvial sediments extend to a maximum of 45 m below the surface, and are underlain by a sequence of clays and subordinated sands that exceed 100 m in thickness. The bulk of groundwater lies within the shallow sediments, which act as an unconfined aquifer. Hydraulic conductivities up to 10 m/day were estimated from pumping tests, although granulometric analyses indicate that higher values may occur. Chemical characterization indicates that waters are typically fresh, low in sodium, and largely suitable for stock-grazing or horticulture. Anomalous salinities at one of the sites are likely due to the effects of a nearby waste dump. Even though further work is required, the study contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of the hydrogeological system in the basin under a warming climate, and provides useful information for the expansion of economic activities in remote communities of Argentina.</jats:p>"

Given the enormous value embodied in these systems, and an environment increasingly characterized by uncertainty and vulnerability, it is not surprising that concern about supply chain security has intensified. Concern takes many forms. For example, how supply chains might be used as vehicles for criminal activity (smuggling, trafficking of narcotics and importing counterfeit goods) or acts of terrorism (radio-active materials, bombs, even nukes in containers). Technology-based threats to supply chains, such as cybercrimes, data breaches and IT failures, now appear more frequently in the literature on supply chain security. These threats could result in substantial disruption to supply chains and damage to companies and their customers.Clima But larger storms are brewing, whose menace to supply chain security is greater still – and where actions to protect supply chains move more slowly. These include the continued deterioration of transportation infrastructure, a new posture on trade which views supply chains as threats to jobs and wages, and the impact of climate change. These threats do not lie off in the distant future; they are threats of today and tomorrow.</jats:p>"

Performance measurement should be done in a particular context, the analysed dimensions of indicators resulting from the purpose and focus of the survey should be determined. The article reviews Polish and foreign literature in terms of the proposed framework and methods for measuring the performance of the supply chain and the indicated categories (dimensions) of indicators. The authors approach the subject of evaluation of the performance of the supply chain in very different ways. Indicators are divided according to the level of the decision-making process: strategic, tactical, and operational. They are also divided into cost and non-cost or financial and non-financial ones. There are also approaches using the already well established methods and models.

The timing and amount of rainfall is critical in determining both the yield of sugar and scheduling of harvesting operations. Rainfall forecasts issued through the Australian Bureau of Meteorology are based on general circulation models (GCMs) and have a poor skill levels. They are also limited in utility to end-users such as farmers as they cover very broad geographical areas and are only issued as probabilities above or below median. This paper presents an alternative approach for forecasting monthly rainfall with up to 12 month lead-time based on machine learning, in particular neural networks. Monthly rainfall forecasts have been developed for the eight locations in Eastern Australia at 3 and 12 month lead-time. The accuracy of the forecasts has been assessed relative to a skill scale with 0% representing climatology (the long term average) and 100% representing a perfect forecast (observation). On this scale, neural network forecasts are typically in the range 39.9–68% for all months using a single month optimization. This compares very favorably with forecasts using GCM from the Bureau that have skill levels only in the range −20% to 20%.</jats:p>",

The water request at network nodes reflects the behavior of the residential users, and a proper characterization of their water use habits is vital for the hydraulic system modeling. This study presents a stochastic approach for the characterization of the daily residential water use. The proposed methodology considers a unique probabilistic distribution – mixed distribution – for any time during the day, and thus for any entity of the water demanded by the users. This distribution is obtained by the merging of two cumulative distribution functions taking into account the spike of the cumulative frequencies for the null requests. The methodology has been tested on three real water distribution networks, where the water use habits are different. Experimental relations are given to estimate the parameters of the proposed stochastic model in relation to the users number and to the average daily trend. Numerical examples for a practical application have shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach in order to generate the time series for the residential water demand.</jats:p>",

The Submerged Pond Sand Filter is built inside a pond and has a vertical as well as a horizontal flow of water through a sloped filter opening. The filter provides treated drinking water to a rural Indian village. The filter has functioned with minimal maintenance for five years without being subject to the typical scraping off and changing of sand as needed in traditional slow sand filters every few months. This five-year study showed bacterial removal efficiency of 97% on average with a level of faecal coliforms of 2 ± 2 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL measured in the treated water. Turbidity was visibly removed during treatment. When water was retrieved from the filter through a manual pump for long consistent time intervals (60 min), faecal coliform counts increased from four to 10 CFU/100 mL on average compared to shorter pumping intervals (5 min). Though the treated water did not comply with the World Health Organization standards of 0 CFU/100 mL, the filter significantly improved water quality and provided one of the best sources of drinkable water in a water-depleted area, where only surface water was available. Furthermore, it is a sustainable treatment method due to low maintenance requirements.</jats:p>"

While the former competence refers to production and supply management related activities, the latter refers to distribution and demand management related activities. The current investigation further explores how well supply chain management processes are internally executed by the firm’s employees i.e. process compliance is observed as an enabler (moderator) on the relationship between supply chain competences and supply chain innovation. Further the model also explores the moderating influence of environmental uncertainty on the linkage between supply chain innovation and firm performance. The model is empirically validated based on perceptual data collected from 166 supply chain professionals through web based survey.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industrial production output is generally correlated with the state of the economy. Nonetheless, during times of economic downturn, some industries take the biggest hit, whereas at times of economic boom they reap most benefits. To provide insight into this phenomenon, we map supply networks of industries and firms and investigate how the supply network structure mediates the effect of economy on industry or firm sales. Previous research has shown that retail sales are correlated with the state of the economy. Since retailers source their products from other industries, the sales of their suppliers can also be correlated with the state of the economy. This correlation represents the source of systematic risk for an industry that propagates through a supply chain network. Specifically, we identify the following mechanisms that can affect the correlation between sales and the state of the economy in a supply chain network: propagation of systematic risk into production decisions, aggregation of orders from multiple customers in a supply chain network, and aggregation of orders over time. We find that the first effect does not amplify the correlation; however, the latter two intensify correlation and result in the amplification of correlation upstream in supply networks. We demonstrate three managerial implications of this phenomenon: implications for the cost of capital, for the risk-adjusted valuation of supply chain improvement projects, and for supplier selection and risk.</jats:p><jats:p>Data, as supplemental material, are available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2187 .</jats:p><jats:p>This paper was accepted by Serguei Netessine, operations management.</jats:p>",

One was filled with Jordanian zeolite-seawater and the second was filled with seawater only. This work is focused on CFD analysis validation with experimental data conducted using a model of phase change interaction (evaporation-condensation model) inside the solar still. A volume-of-fluid (VOF) model was used to simulate the inter phase change through evaporation-condensation between zeolite-water and water vapor inside the two solar stills. The effect of the volume fraction of the zeolite particles (0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 0.05) on the heat and distillate yield inside the solar still was investigated. Based on the CFD simulation results, the hourly quantity of freshwater showed a good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The present study has established the utility of using the VOF two phase flow model to provide a reasonable solution to the complicated inter phase mass transfer in a solar still.</jats:p>",

To face the competition, the accuracy of the strategy undertaken by a company is one of the key success factors of the company. The strategy is to focus on the important factors that affect the performance of the company. In this case, two functions that are key to the creation of value-added are marketing and operations functions. Operations and marketing capabilities are important factors to obtain superior performance. Integration of marketing and operations (operation capabilities, marketing capabilities) is believed to be a synergy to achieve the company's competitive advantage.On the other hand, Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a key strategic factor to improve the company effectiveness. While an effective supply chain process is based on cross-functional collaboration of the company including operations and marketing capabilities. Thus, the main concern of this study is to focus on the influence of operationand marketing capabilities in supply chain integration and the firm performance, as well as the effect of supply chain integration on the firm performance. The results of this study based on regression analysis show that the regression coefficient of each independent variable on the dependent variable is positive. This means that the marketing and operation capabilities have positive effects on the firm performance, as well as having a positive impact on the supply chain integration. On the other side, the supply chain integration also has a positive effect on the firm performance.&lt;/em&gt;</jats:p>"

In this paper, we developed a method for P extraction from agricultural soil and suspended sediment by combining ultrasonic treatment with extraction by 0.1 molL−1 NaOH solution. The extraction process is less time-consuming and technically simpler than alternative conventional chemical methods. The high correlation (r = 0.97) between P extraction with the ultrasonic treatment and the conventional extraction methods suggests the new technique is a promising method for quantifying BAP in agricultural soils and suspended sediments. The method should be tested in soils and sediments that possess different characteristics to confirm the range of its applicability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Australian federal government introduced the deregulation of the wheat export market in 2008, as a means of creating a competitive wheat industry. However, this initiative did not sufficiently consider the potential for agricultural corporations to proactively seek to shape their environment. Utilizing resource dependency theory, this article analyses the strategies employed by agricultural corporations, such as acquisitions, integration and geographic expansion, to develop control of supply chains and markets, and mitigate risks associated with resource supply and competition. Despite leading to a concentration of markets and consolidation within supply chains, agribusiness corporations manipulate discourse around food to promote these strategies as necessary to enhance global food security. Furthermore, this article analyses the use of political lobbying by agricultural corporations to create a regulatory environment, which enables integration and expansion. This article enables resource dependency theory to be more directly observable, through analysing tangible examples of these associated practices, implemented by agricultural corporations. In addition, this article contends that through heightening awareness of how firms respond to deregulation, resource dependency theory provides the tools to reflect critically on the aims and methods of government deregulation initiatives. </jats:p>",

In the present study a commercial monolithic adsorber (MA), originally developed for gas treatment, was examined for the removal of OMP from drinking water. As a promising advantage, the adsorber can be introduced into existing pipes without causing substantial pressure losses. The MA was first characterized with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Weight loss during incineration at 550 °C indicated an activated carbon content of around 25%. Adsorption isotherms were recorded with milled material of the MA to estimate the capacity of the embedded adsorbent. Long-term flow-through experiments with two different flow rates were conducted to estimate the in-line removal efficiency. At low flow rates removals of 60% benzotriazole, 40% carbamazepine and 30% diclofenac were observed initially followed by a linear increase of effluent concentrations. Calculated loadings after 60 days of operation were e.g. 30 μg benzotriazole per g adsorber or 110 μg benzotriazole per g activated carbon as constituent of the adsorber. For specific applications, MA might be useful for the in-line elimination of OMP within drinking water distribution systems.</jats:p>",

Since the pressure-driven analysis (PDA) of WDNs produces more accurate results than the demand-driven analysis, the new indices are proposed based on the PDA. In the proposed measures, nodal pressures, nodal available discharges and the energy loss per unit length of pipes are considered as the main factors influencing the reliability of WDNs. The introduced network reliability index is a combination of two indices named total nodal reliability and total pipe reliability. These indices are equal to the weighted average of all of the nodal and pipe reliabilities, respectively. A sample network is used to evaluate the new proposed index and some of the available indices and to compare their efficiencies in assessing the reliability of WDNs. The results show that the new proposed index is more efficient and outperforms the others. The introduced index is normalized and is independent of the WDN size. This index considers the qualitative aspects of WDNs besides the hydraulic aspects in evaluating reliability.</jats:p>",

However, few studies have addressed how the orderly arrangement of crop vegetation affects the resistance of the surface to overland flow. In the present study, we consider that flow resistance has anisotropic attributes. We have also performed a flow resistance experiment using rigid and simulated partially submerged crop vegetation. The simulation replicated water flow in different directions over the same crop vegetation and overland surface. The angles of flow direction and the crop rows were arranged as 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 90 °. The results show that the flow resistance of partially submerged crop vegetation is composed of surface resistance ns and vegetation resistance np. Vegetation resistance np is linearly proportional to the submerged vegetation height h, and the proportionality coefficient α (Δn/Δh) varies with the angle θ of the flow direction and the crop rows under the same water depth conditions, n15 &amp;gt; n30 &amp;gt; n45 &amp;gt; n90. Further regression analysis revealed that the relationship between the coefficient α and vertical projection width of crop stems in the flow direction is a power function.</jats:p>",

The ultimate goal is to bring the product/goods to the end customer/consumer as soon as possible, on time, at the lowest cost, in perfect condition and in the appropriate quantity. The mutual coordination and cooperation of all participants in the supply chain can result in a satisfied end-user/customer. The development of information – telecommunication technologies – will greatly affect the future development and efficiency of the supply chain by finding new transport solutions that would mostly affect city centers.

However, the promising industry faces financial deficits because of difficulties in collecting straw from farmers. To determine strategies for overcoming the biomass supply problem, we apply Stackelberg game theory in modeling the Chinese biomass supply chain and design incentive scenarios under stakeholder risk perception. We illustrate the proposed methodology through an empirical case study on China and demonstrate the effects of incentives on farmers and middlemen. Results show that with incentives, straw quantity and stakeholder profit are expected to increase. Incentives exert a particularly remarkable effect on farmers, with such inducements producing the highest social welfare. Moreover, perceived risk dramatically affects stakeholder profit. Mitigating the risk perception of farmers is expected to significantly advance the development of the biomass power generation industry, increase stakeholder profit, and decrease the amount of incentives needed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Energy and food security are two key national policies and agenda of Thailand. The Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), Ministry of Energy has modified a 15-year (2008-2021) Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP). According to the modified AEDP, the share of renewable and alternative energy consumption should increase to 25% by 2021. The latest policy aims to promote the biodiesel consumption and production by 5.97 million liters/day within 2021, up from its previous plan of 4.50 million liters/day while nowadays production capacity is 1.62 million liters/day. The current and anticipated production of biodiesel require raw materials, notably crude palm oil (CPO) from oil palm plantations. This paper presents a feasibility study, with respect to the AEDP plan, for biodiesel production by using domestic fresh fruit oil palm as a raw material. Demand and supply are analyzed based on statistical modeling and forecasting techniques, as well as GIS spatial analysis. The results show that the domestic CPO consumption for cooking palm oil will be 1.02 million tons/year, while biodiesel production will be 1.67 million tons/year in 2021. This corresponds to an oil palm plantation area of 11,152 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in 2021. Based on GIS spatial analysis along with land-use database and other relevant databases, it was found that the suitable area for palm oil plantation in Thailand is 14,639 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, which is sufficient for domestic demand and consumption. The suitable area consists of 9,664 km<jats:sup>2 </jats:sup>for quite suitable and 4,975 km<jats:sup>2 </jats:sup>for medium suitable. However, the government should provide the guidelines, along with pro-active and supportive policies for worst case scenarios, e.g. drought and flood leading to the insufficient raw material, in order to reduce the negative impacts of biodiesel production for domestic demand and consumption.<jats:italic /></jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is important to determine the assembly configuration of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) because assembly configuration influences their fate and transport behavior in the aquatic environment. Aggregated particles are more subject to segregation upon changes of environmental conditions (and vice versa) than agglomerated particles. As a strategic tool for investigating the time-resolved reversible segregating and assembling behavior of ENMs and thus estimating their assembly configuration, a controlled sonication process was proposed. It was hypothesized that the unique colloidal response of ENMs to sonication, with respect to changes in size, might be their intrinsic property associated with assembly configuration. As a model ENM, three different TiO2 particles with unique properties (commercial P-25 and UV 100 and home-made (HM) TiO2) were examined with programmed sonication processes under various environmental settings. When they were dispersed in water, all TiO2 particles tested obviously assembled to form much larger clusters. Size of P-25 decreased immediately upon sonication and did not change under the subsequent quiescence step while sizes of UV 100 and HM gradually decreased and then slowly recovered back to their initial sizes. The trend was generally observed in all conditions tested. The unique colloidal response of TiO2 could be explained by its properties associated with assembly configuration.</jats:p>",

A sample of 300 women having eight years education was taken randomly and formal questionnaire was constructed for this purpose. Ordinary Least Square method was applied for estimation of parameters. The results of our empirical study show that various variables have expected signs in analysis. We found that joint family setup, family expenditures, number of dependent, working days and wage rate impact positively and significantly to the working hours of women. In contrast, number of children, nuclear family size, etcare inversely related to the women working hours. Therefore, we suggest that there should be provision of better education for women to improve their working hours and participation rate in labor market.</jats:p>"

Through 24 months of monitoring, a number of key observations were made. Incorporation of a biological treatment step reduced the overall dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loss through the PDS by reducing biodegradable DOC (BDOC) within the water prior to distribution. In the absence of chlorine residuals, the proliferation of culturable organisms was favoured with considerably higher heterotrophic plate counts in samples at the outlet of the PDS. Despite different bacterial cell counts (measured by flow cytometry) entering each PDS from the four treatment streams, equivalent outlet cell numbers were achieved in all systems after 8 months' operation; however multi-step treatment streams took longer to reach equilibrium.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper analyzes the influence of the supply chain management on the environmental impact of a 2400 L waste disposal container used in most cities of Spain. The studied functional unit, a waste disposal container, made up mostly of plastic materials and a metallic structure, and manufactured in Madrid (Spain), is distributed to several cities at an average distance of 392 km. A life cycle assessment of four different scenarios (SC) has been calculated with the software EcoTool v4.0 (version 4.0; i+: Zaragoza, Spain, 2015) and using Ecoinvent v3.0 database (version 3.0; Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories: St. Gallen, Switzerland, 2013). The environmental impact has been characterized with two different methodologies, recipe and carbon footprint. In order to reduce the environmental impact, several end of life scenarios have been performed, analyzing the influence of the supply chain on a closed-looped system that increases recycling. Closed loop management of the waste and reuse of parts allows companies to stop selling products and start selling the service that their products give to the consumers.</jats:p>"

However, the role of supply chain management in proposing products which meet customers’ needs has not, up to now, been definitely-set, well-established or thoroughly investigated because of a lack of readily-made-available data. There is an obvious need for an appropriate framework for KSA’s food retail sector for the purpose of studying the roles and impacts of the various divisions of the supply-chain process.

The EC model outputs the method of EC based on pollutant properties. A generalized form of EC model is proposed and tested with a demonstrative project. The rapid prediction formulas of emergency control parameters (ECPs) are proposed under different states of water diversion. The closing times of check gates and the pollution range are calculated by the rapid prediction formulas of ECPs. A case study is examined under the scenario of a sucrose spill in a demonstrative project conducted in the Fangshui to Puyang channel of the Beijing–Shijiazhuang Emergency Water Supply Project in the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The relative errors of peak concentration and arrival time of peak concentration are less than 20%. However, we could not use an actual toxic soluble pollutant to validate the EC model, so we performed the experiment with sucrose to test the EC model based on its concentration variation. The final result shows that the model is able to play a fundamental role in the decisions involved in the Emergency Environmental Decision Support System.</jats:p>",

The scheduling problem is first formulated as a non‐convex mixed‐integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, accounting for flow rates in pipes, operation profiles of pumps, water levels of tanks, and customer demand. Binary variables denote on–off switch operations for pumps and flow directions in pipes, and nonlinear terms originate from characteristic functions for pumps and hydraulic functions for pipes. The proposed MINLP model is verified with EPANET, which is a leading software package for water distribution system modeling. We further develop a novel global optimization algorithm for solving the non‐convex MINLP problem. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and the efficiency of the tailored global optimization algorithm, we present results of two case studies with up to 4 tanks, 5 pumps, 5 check valves, and 21 pipes. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers <jats:italic>AIChE J</jats:italic>, 62: 4277–4296, 2016</jats:p>",

Considering its lifespan of 20 to 30 years, many end-of-life systems will emerge in the near future. This is why recycling PV systems will be beneficial (and may even be detrimental) to both the environment and the economy. Through the recycling process, hazardous by-product substances such as cadmium and lead can be treated properly. Moreover, valuable materials including indium, gallium, and tellurium can be extracted and reused for manufacturing purposes. Even though many studies have dealt with issues related to the PV system and its recycling policy, they lack significant factors regarding the recycling policy. This study analyzes and compares three real cases of manufacturer’s recycling policy, including Deutsche Solar, First Solar, and PV Cycle, from the perspective of a closed-loop supply chain. Two mathematical models are developed to help PV system manufacturers establish supply chain planning and choose suitable recycling policies in consideration of different circumstances. Furthermore, an experimental example of these models will be used to validate and conclude the significance of the models. The results from this study will show that recycling CdTe PV systems is much more efficient than recycling c-Si PV systems and that, in the case of c-Si, it is better to outsource recycling end-of-life systems and dispose of all manufacturing scrap.</jats:p>"

The analysis has shown that political vulnerability has increased in Lithuania due to the closure of Ignalina NPP and an increase in energy import quantities from politically unstable countries, such as Russia. On the contrary, political vulnerabilities on the security of the energy supply have decreased in Latvia and Estonia due to the increase of consumption of indigenous energy. However, preliminary calculations show that political vulnerabilities should decrease considerably in 2015 in Lithuania due to the diversification of the natural gas supply.</jats:p>",

Coupled genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) models, which adopt a GA to optimize the SVM parameters, have been successfully applied in some research fields. In light of previous research findings, an application of a GA-SVM model for tidal estuary salinity prediction is proposed in this paper. The corresponding model is developed to predict the salinity of the Min River Estuary (MRE). By conducting an analysis of the time series of daily salinity and the results of simulation experiments, the high-tide level, runoff and previous salinity are considered as the major factors that influence salinity variation. The prediction accuracy of the GA-SVM model is satisfactory, with coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.85, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.84 and root mean square error of 119 (μS/cm). The proposed model performs significantly better than the traditional SVM model in terms of prediction accuracy and computing time. It can be concluded that the proposed model can successfully predict the salinity of MRE based on the high-tide level, runoff and previous salinity.</jats:p>",

Loading dense CS NPs onto mono-dispersive flower-like MnO2 nanostructures reduces the overlap of CS during adsorption, and thus improves the contact of functional adsorption sites on the surface of MnO2 nanoflakes with heavy metal ions. The results show that the removal efficiency of the nanoadsorbents reaches up to 93% in 3 min for Pb(II). In addition, the maximum adsorption capacity, effects of adsorbent dosage and pH value, and the reusability were investigated. The kinetic process and adsorption isotherm fit well with the pseudo-second-order model and Langmuir model, respectively. These findings provide a potential strategy to address the overlap issue of some common nanoadsorbents.</jats:p>",

Results showed no impact of extended run times (up to 25 days) on DOC or DBP precursor removal; however turbidity removal was affected beyond 15 days of operation. Backwashing biofilters at 10 vs 5 day intervals would result in a reduction of backwash water, energy consumption and amount to nearly $17,000 in savings for the utility.</jats:p>",

Their rated capacities are between 76 and 114 million liters per year (MLPY). For uninterrupted operation of these plants, a year‐round supply of corn stover needs to be secured, requiring a robust, efficient, and cost‐effective feedstock supply system. Thus, the main objective of this work is to stochastically analyze the techno‐economics of corn stover supply system for a 114 MLPY cellulosic biorefinery in the Midwest using production‐scale experimental field data collected in Iowa. This study analyzes the resources requirements (equipment, labor, fuel, and consumables) and costs of different components of the supply chain that include harvesting (windrowing and baling), in‐field bale collection and stacking at the field‐edge, handling and transportation of bales from the field‐edge to the distributed storage facilities and then to the biorefinery plant, storage, and finally the audit of nutrients removed during stover collection from the field. Additionally, this study identifies and ranks different supply chain parameters based on their relative influence on the overall resources and costs requirements. A 114 MLPY cellulosic biorefinery annually requires around 0.95 million corn stover bales supply, 250 000 hours equivalent of labor and 4.3 million L of diesel fuel. The average cost of biorefinery gate delivered corn stover is estimated to be 121.9 $‐std. t<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. This cost is identified to be the most sensitive to bale density followed by harvest rate, bale length, baler field efficiency, and annual harvest days. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

Kinetic and isotherm models studied showed that arsenite adsorption by iron-coated ZSM-5 follows a pseudo-third-order equation and well fitted with the Langmuir isotherm model. Evaluation showed that the optimized iron-coated ZSM-5 zeolite is able to remove up to 98.37% of arsenite under the best conditions in a batch reactor. For the column system, arsenite concentration range of 0.04–97.53 μg/L in output at 1–35 min interval was confirmed and the breakthrough curve showed that iron-coated ZSM-5 nano-adsorbent was saturated after 215 min whereas Fe, pH and EC measured in output solution were 0.90 mg/L, 6.65 and 148.40 μs/cm, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. A massive diatom-bloom is observed annually in the surface waters of the naturally Fe-fertilized Kerguelen Plateau (Southern Ocean). In this study, silicon isotopic signatures (δ30Si) of silicic acid (DSi) and suspended biogenic silica (BSi) were investigated in the whole water column with an unprecedented spatial resolution in this region, during the KEOPS-2 experiment (spring 2011). We use δ30Si measurements to track the silicon sources that fuel the bloom, and investigate the seasonal evolution of Si biogeochemical cycle in the iron fertilized area. We compare the results from a HNLC reference station with stations characterized by different degrees of iron enrichment and bloom conditions. Dissolved and particulate δ30Si signatures were generally highly variable in the upper 500 m, reflecting the effect of the intense silicon utilization in spring, while they were quite homogeneous in deeper waters. The Si-isotopic and mass balance identified a unique WW Si-source for the iron-fertilized area originating from the southeastern Kerguelen Plateau and spreading northward. However, when reaching a retroflection of the Polar Front (PF), the δ30Si composition of WW silicic acid pool was getting progressively heavier. This would result from sequential diapycnal mixings between these initial WW and ML water masses, highlighting the strong circulation of surface waters that defined this zone. When comparing the results from the two KEOPS expeditions, the relationship between DSi depletion, BSi production and their isotopic composition appears decoupled in the iron fertilized area. This seasonal decoupling could help to explain the low apparent fractionation factor observed here in the ML at the end of summer. Taking into account these considerations, we refined the seasonal net BSi production in the ML of the iron-fertilized area to 3.0 ± 0.3 mol Si m−2 y−1, that was exclusively sustained by surface water phytoplankton populations. These insights confirm that the isotopic composition of dissolved and particulate silicon is a promising tool to improve our understanding on the Si-biogeochemical cycle since the isotopic and mass balance allows resolving the processes involved i.e. uptake, dissolution, mixing.\n                        </jats:p>"

Their main expectation is risk avoidance and not value generation. In such a case, even “successful” SCRM programmes merely confirm such an expectation (e.g. no risk materialised or with a limited impact) and the company continues to avoid risk while limiting the resources for SCRM. It is only when the expected benefit of SCRM is not solely risk avoidance but mainly value generation that increased attention can be expected over time. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper is exploratory in nature.

These demands can disrupt the operations of companies that do not have a system for controlling logistics costs. On the other hand, customer demands can be the cause of other types of disruptions in companies that have such a system in place, stemming from an excessive focus on cost reduction. To tackle this problem, a survey was conducted on a sample of 30 Slovenian companies that operate as suppliers in the automotive industry. Its objective was to determine how different customer demands along the supply chain can affect the business processes of suppliers and the level of logistics costs. The survey revealed that companies that use a system for controlling logistics costs experience fewer disruptions in their business processes in their efforts to satisfy customer demands. These companies also display a higher level of integration of business processes and use a different approach when dealing with the various participants of the supply chain. The survey also sets clear participation guidelines for suppliers in the supply chain of the automotive industry and points out how companies can benefit from using a system for controlling logistics costs in other ways, aside from the cost controlling aspect.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, an offshore support vessel is being widely used to install an offshore structure such as a subsea equipment which is laid on its deck. The lifting operation which is one of the installation operations includes lifting off, lifting in the air, splash zone crossing, deep submerging, and finally landing of the structure with an offshore support vessel crane. There are some major considerations during this operation. Especially, when lifting off the structure, if operating conditions such as ocean environmental loads and hoisting (or lowering) speed are bad, the excess of tension of wire ropes of the crane and the collision between the offshore support vessel and the structure can be occurred due to the relative motion between them. To solve this problem, this study performs the lifting simulation while the offshore support vessel installs the structure. The simulation includes the calculation of dynamic responses of the offshore support vessel and the equipment, including the wire tension and the collision detection. To check the applicability of the simulation, it is applied to some lifting steps by varying operating conditions. As a result, it is confirmed that the conditions affect the operability of those steps. </jats:p>",

This is followed by an isolated dc–dc converter which yields multiple dc voltages required in the PCs. The front end converter is designed in discontinuous conduction mode with a single control loop to achieve both voltage control and PFC.

The design of most control systems requires the inverter small‐signal model. Two approaches for the discrete modelling of the VSI can be considered. The first is based on solving the state space equations during the switching period, which yields a discrete model that depends on the single‐edge or double‐edge type of PWM model. The second approach is the based on the continuous model of the inverter, which is derived from measurements of the real inverter and its discretisation. Both models should regard the increase in the real value of the equivalent coil series resistance and changes in the filter coil inductance with the frequency and amplitude of the magnetising current. The design of the control system requires experimental estimation of the additional delays, which are outside of the models during the measurements and modelling. Both models are validated by comparing the closed‐loop systems with the simple instantaneous controllers in the experimental model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The atmospheric cycle of phosphorus (P) is here parameterized in a global 3-D chemistry-transport model, taking into account primary emissions of total P (TP) and dissolved P (DP) associated with mineral dust, combustion particles of natural and anthropogenic sources, bioaerosols, sea-spray and volcanic aerosols. Global TP emissions are calculated to amount roughly 1.33 Tg-P yr−1 with mineral sources (about 1.10 Tg-P yr−1) contributing more than 80% to these emissions. Additionally, under acidic atmospheric conditions, for the present study we take into account the P mobilization from mineral dust, that is calculated to contribute about one third (0.14 Tg-P yr−1) to the global DP atmospheric source. The calculated global annual DP deposition flux equals to 0.43 Tg-P yr−1 (about 40 % enters the ocean), and shows a strong spatial and temporal variability. Considering that all bioaerosol P is bioavailable (BP) and accounting for all other sources of DP, a flux of 0.16 Tg-P yr−1 BP to the ocean is derived. Present day simulations of atmospheric P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared with available observations, indicating however a 50 % uncertainty of current knowledge on primary and secondary sources of P that drive its atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850) and future (2100) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios, showed a present-day increase of 75 % in the dissolution flux of P present in dust aerosol compared to the 1850 dissolution flux due to increasing atmospheric acidity over the last 150 years. Future reductions in air pollutants, due to the implementation of air-quality regulations, are expected to decrease P mobilization flux by about 30 % for the year 2100 compared to the present-day. A striking result is that more than 50% of the BP deposition flux to the ocean originates from biological particle and this contribution is found to maximize in summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the highest due to ocean stratification. These findings reveal the largely unknown but important role of terrestrial bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the ocean – with very important implications for past and future responses of ecosystems to global change. Therefore, our study provides new insights to the atmospheric P cycle by demonstrating that bioaerosols are as important carriers of bioavailable P as dust aerosol, that was up to now considered as the only large source of DP external to the open ocean.\n                        </jats:p>"

Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was the main statistical tool of data analysis and presentation. Results reveal that SC effectiveness is defined by two constructs. The first construct is SC strategy and this accounts for the highest variance (53.?%) in SC effectiveness. This construct is made up of variables relating to the general approach and strategy to supply chain management. The second construct is SC outcomes, and this accounts for 20.1% of the total variation in SC effectiveness. This construct is made up of variables relating to the end-results of SC management in an organization. For beverage firms to maximise SC effectiveness therefore, they need to focus on implementing the best SC strategy that will yield expected SC outcomes.</jats:p>"

In this paper a simulation methodology for production parameters selection and on-site energy supply management is presented. In this case, state-based models and operational strategies of manufacturing processes and on-site energy supply options are integrated to represent interdependency between production processes, technical building services and on-site energy supply system. As a result, the proposed methodology covers manufacturing system complexity without compromising the required accuracy. This is applied to a batch based manufacturing plant and the impact of particular production parameters on energy demand profile is evaluated. The results indicate the impact of production parameters on energy supply system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oil exploration in Brazil is mainly held by offshore platforms which require the supply of several products, including diesel to maintain its engines. One strategy to supply diesel to the platforms is to keep a vessel filled with diesel nearby the exploration basin. An empty boat leaves the port and goes directly to this vessel, then it is loaded with diesel. After that, it makes a trip to supply the platforms and when the boat is empty, it returns to the vessel to be reloaded with more diesel going to another trip. Based on this description, this paper proposes a mathematical model based on the Vehicle Routing Problem with Intermediate Replenishment Facilities (VRPIRF) to solve the problem. The purpose of the model is to plan the routes for the boats to meet the diesel requests of the platform. Given the fact that in the literature, papers about the VRPIRF are scarce and papers about the VRPIRF applied to offshore platforms were not found in the published papers, this paper is important to contribute with the evolution of this class of problem, bringing also a solution for a real application that is very important for the oil and gas business. The mathematical model was tested using the CPLEX 12.6. In order to assess the mathematical model, tests were done with data from the major Brazilian oil and gas company and several strategies were tested.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.4995/CIT2016.2016.2217</jats:p>"

The sharp decline from 2009 to 2010 is shown to be counter-intuitive, given the active civil society engagement right from the early stages of the Act’s making and implementation. Using information from field visits, interviews and secondary literature, I unpack the reasons for this decline, evaluating the validity of demand-side shortfalls and supply-side constraints as explanations. I demonstrate that it is primarily low capacity and low motivation of state officials that have led to the drop in MGNREGA’s performance. Further, I argue that the biggest strengths of the MGNREGA, that is, demand-based nature and provisions around transparency, have been made its most pressing shortcomings. Given the political nature of implementation of the MGNREGA, I conclude that Rajasthan needs political engagement strategies rather than merely technocratic solutions if this downturn is to be arrested. </jats:p>",

The level of supply of skilled tradesmen is attributed to the lack of high-quality basic education, the state of the economy, compulsory certification of tradesmen and an ageing workforce. It was also found that there is a significant relationship between skilled labour shortages and the requirement that labour be certified and that work output is unsatisfactory when there is no certification requirement.Practical/managerial implications: Based on these findings, the study concludes that skilled labour shortages and poor work output quality continue to be experienced in the South African construction industry when workers are unable to obtain formal certification for informal work experience acquired through years of practice on construction sites.Contribution: It is recommended that the South African government establish proactive strategies in the form of a framework for use in evaluating, certifying and grading the informal expertise acquired by workers through years of practice. This recommendation seeks to ensure that the supply of certified craftsmen capable of undertaking and producing high-quality construction work meets demand.Keywords: Artisans; Education; Experience; Expertise; Practice</jats:p>"

To quantitatively evaluate the influence of the urbanization process on IRSN, the form index system and function index system were established in this study. The form index system involved eight indexes, and the function index system included 18 indexes. We also used statistical methods to analyze the correlations between the form indexes and the function indexes of the IRSN. Multiple linear regression equations were established between the variations in the IRSN form indexes and the function indexes. Finally, we determined the threshold values of the IRSN form indexes that can meet Zhengzhou City's future development demands for water function. The threshold value for the drainage network density is between 0.32 and 0.33; the threshold value for the node connection rate is between 1.54 and 2; the threshold value for the degree of connectivity between river systems ranges from 0.55 to 0.77; and the threshold value for circuitry of the river ranges from 0.40 to 0.60.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Methionine is an indispensable amino acid that, when not incorporated into protein, is converted into the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine as entry into the methionine cycle. Following transmethylation, homocysteine is either remethylated to reform methionine or irreversibly trans-sulfurated to form cysteine. Methionine flux to transmethylation and to protein synthesis are both high in the neonate and this review focuses on the dynamics of methionine supply and demand during early development, when growth requires expansion of pools of protein and transmethylation products such as creatine and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The nutrients folate and betaine (derived from choline) donate a methyl group during remethylation, providing an endogenous supply of methionine to meet the methionine demand. During early development, variability in the dietary supply of these methionine cycle-related nutrients can affect both the supply and the demand of methionine. For example, a greater need for creatine synthesis can limit methionine availability for protein and PC synthesis, whereas increased availability of remethylation nutrients can increase protein synthesis if dietary methionine is limiting. Moreover, changes to methyl group availability early in life can lead to permanent changes in epigenetic patterns of DNA methylation, which have been implicated in the early origins of adult disease phenomena. This review aims to summarize how changes in methyl supply and demand can affect the availability of methionine for various functions and highlights the importance of variability in methionine-related nutrients in the infant diet.</jats:p>",

To achieve this goal, the social performance of five global and local food supply chains in two countries are analyzed: wild blueberry supply chains in Latvia and cultivated raspberry supply chains in Serbia. The study addresses two research questions: (1) What is the social performance of the local and global supply chains? (2) How can references to context help improve understanding of the social dimension and social performance of food supply chains? To answer these questions, two interlinked thematic sets of indicators (attributes) are used—one describing labor relations and the other describing power relations. These lists are then contextualized by examining the micro-stories of the actors involved in these supply chains. An analysis of the chosen attributes reveals that global chains perform better than local chains. However, a context-sensitive analysis from the perspective of embedded markets and communities suggests that the social performance of food chains is highly context-dependent, relational, and affected by actors’ abilities to negotiate values, norms, and the rules embedded within these chains, both global and local. The results illustrate that the empowerment of the chains’ weakest actors can lead to a redefining of the meanings that performance assessments rely on.</jats:p>"

For evaluating WRV under the changing environment in the Huai River Basin (HRB), the sixth largest river basin in China, a quantitative assessment model coupling with exposure, droughts risk, sensitivity, and adaptability of water resources system was established. In addition, the adaptive regulation of WRV under five scenarios of water demand control, water efficiency control, pollutant restriction of the water function zone, the minimum water demand control of the ecosystem and integrated control were analyzed in this study. The results indicated that the region with the greatest value of WRV was Xiaoqing River in the benchmark year (2000) and the most unfavorable scenarios in which 33% and 87% of HRB were the extreme vulnerable regions. Among all adaptive regulation scenarios, the most sensitive scenario was the integrated control, followed by the control of water function zone compliance, water use efficiency, water demand and the minimum water demand control of the ecosystem. This study will provide a scientific foundation to integrated water resources management in China.</jats:p>",

We propose a novel approach mapping geo-coded sales data against geo-coded confirmed case reports, which has the potential to reduce the time required for foodborne illness investigation. Using real grocery retail scanner data with spatial information from Germany, we have implemented a likelihood-based framework to study how such spatial data can be used to accelerate the investigation during the early stages of an outbreak. Our analysis shows that after receiving as few as 10 laboratory confirmed case reports it is possible to narrow the investigation to approximately 12 suspect products with the contaminated product included in this subset 90% of the time for approximately 80% of food products studied.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A common side effect of cross-linked global economies is that well-positioned middle class companies are acquired by institutional investors, which formulate unreasonable return expectations in many cases. As a consequence, the resulting payouts are often not in line with business operations so that even world market leaders get into trouble or close down. In this context, we consider the case of a sanitary company, which had to manage the described situation after a business takeover. In order to coordinate the annual cash outflows to the investor with intra-organizational supply chain planning and financial planning, we propose a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that is based on the flow-to-equity discounted cash flow method. The objective is to maximize the present value of equity while determining annual cash outflows to the institutional investor during his engagement. As the decisions of the investor during his engagement influence possible operations of the company after his engagement, the residual value of equity (that influences the selling price) is taken into account. The modeling is based on cash flow series, which result from supply chain operations and restructuring on the one hand, and from financial transactions on the other. Financing is characterized by interest rates depending on the time period the credit starts, the credit period, the debt limit of the company and the current total debt. As the latter is a result of the optimization, non-linearity arises. Nevertheless, both the expected demand scenario and further randomly generated demand scenarios of the sanitary company could be solved to the optimum with the commercial optimization package GAMS 23.8/SCIP 2.1.1 within acceptable computation times, if capacity profiles are assigned to the locations to depict feasible and/or preferred capacity developments.</jats:p>",

Originality/gap/relevance/implications: The prior intention was to fill an epistemological gap about green marketing. The presence of green marketing in regression decreases the magnitude of the relationship between supply chain management and performance in Brazilian construction companies. Key methodological aspects: The study was carried out using quantitative method with exploratory and descriptive purposes. An exploratory research was conducted through in-depth interviews with ten managers working in the construction business. A descriptive survey involved the application of a questionnaire answered by a sample of 133 respondents. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, linear regression and structural equation modeling. Summary of key results: Data showed that green marketing mediates, in part, the relationship between supply chain management and corporate performance. Key considerations/conclusions: As theoretical implications, the study reinforces positive correlations between the constructs used in the surveyed sector. It resorted to models previously developed that, combined, could be reproduced or falsified, in order to obtain, finally, convergent measurement models. As a practical application, it identified the involvement of employees in environmental issues, missions and visions with explicit statements on energy and water saving and green marketing initiatives to improve the corporate image, such as obtaining environmental certifications. In conclusion, it appears that the civil construction companies have room to improve the communication and image to stimulate both the supply and consumption of green products.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Advances in information technology triggered a digital revolution that holds promise of reduced costs, improved productivity, and higher quality. To ride this wave of innovation, manufacturing enterprises are changing how product definitions are communicated — from paper to models. To achieve industry’s vision of the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE), the MBE strategy must include model-based data interoperability from design to manufacturing and quality in the supply chain. The Model-Based Definition (MBD) is created by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. This information is then shared with the supplier so that they can manufacture and inspect the physical parts. Today, suppliers predominantly use Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) models for these tasks. Traditionally, the OEM has provided design data to the supplier in the form of two-dimensional (2D) drawings, but may also include a three-dimensional (3D)-shape-geometry model, often in a standards-based format such as ISO 10303-203:2011 (STEP AP203). The supplier then creates the respective CAM and CMM models and machine programs to produce and inspect the parts. In the MBE vision for model-based data exchange, the CAD model must include product-and-manufacturing information (PMI) in addition to the shape geometry. Today’s CAD tools can generate models with embedded PMI. And, with the emergence of STEP AP242, a standards-based model with embedded PMI can now be shared downstream.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The on-going research detailed in this paper seeks to investigate three concepts. First, that the ability to utilize a STEP AP242 model with embedded PMI for CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM data exchange is possible and valuable to the overall goal of a more efficient process. Second, the research identifies gaps in tools, standards, and processes that inhibit industry’s ability to cost-effectively achieve model-based-data interoperability in the pursuit of the MBE vision. Finally, it also seeks to explore the interaction between CAD and CMM processes and determine if the concept of feedback from CAM and CMM back to CAD is feasible. The main goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that model-based-data interoperability from CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM is feasible through standards-based integration. This paper presents several barriers to model-based-data interoperability. Overall, the project team demonstrated the exchange of product definition data between CAD, CAM, and CMM systems using standards-based methods. While gaps in standards coverage were identified, the gaps should not stop industry’s progress toward MBE. The results of our study provide evidence in support of an open-standards method to model-based-data interoperability, which would provide maximum value and impact to industry.</jats:p>",

However, its effect on dry matter and nutrient content often remains a concern for growers. A direct sown onion hybrid was grown under open field, rain-fed and irrigated conditions for three years, investigating the effects of air temperature and water supply on some nutritive constituents. Dry matter, storage sugar, total flavonol and total polyphenol content showed strong positive correlation with average air temperature and negative correlation with water supply. However, irrigation had a positive effect on storage sugar and dry matter content. Presumably better water supply during dry periods ensured by irrigation provided the basis for higher photosynthetic production, and hereby more dry matter partitioning and accumulation in the bulb, a storage organ. An unexpected decrease in vitamin C content was experienced in 2011 and 2012, compared to the result of 2010, which was explained by the hot and dry conditions of the pre-harvest irrigation cut-off period. Fibre and ash content was found to be the most stable nutritional characteristics, affected neither by the environmental conditions, nor by the irrigation. Irrigation has proved to be very beneficial for direct sown onion, doubling bulb yield while not affecting the nutritive quality negatively.</jats:p>"

Authorities often cite water scarcity as the cause, but we demonstrate that environmental constraints constitute only one aspect of a multi-dimensional problem. By asking what causes intermittent domestic water supply, this literature review (129 articles) identifies 47 conditions of intermittent systems and the causal-consequential pathways between them that can reinforce intermittency. These pathways span several disciplines including engineering, government administration and anthropology, and when viewed together they (1) emphasize the human drivers of intermittency; (2) suggest generalized interventions; and (3) reveal a gap in the literature in terms of meaningful categorizations of the reliability of intermittent supplies. Based on the reliability of consumers’ water access, we propose three categories of intermittency—predictable, irregular, and unreliable—to facilitate comparisons between case studies and transfers of solutions.</jats:p>"

This paper proposes three novel air supply systems in which the compressor is driven by the waste heat recovered by the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) from the stack cooling water and the exhaust gas. The influences of air supply pressure and air stoichiometric ratio on the PEM fuel cell performance and exhaust gas are investigated through the fuel cell stack model. The performance analysis of the air supply system is carried out using a thermodynamic simulation model. And the proposed three air systems are compared to an air system driven by the exhaust gas and the assisted motor. Results show that both the air pressure and air stoichiometric ratio are improved significantly. The gross output electric power and the net efficiency of the PEM fuel cells are also improved greatly because of higher operating pressure and the elimination of the compressor power consumption. Among the 3 proposed air systems, the air system which has a self-circulation to maintain the stack temperature has the best performance and is most stable in operation.</jats:p>",

Results showed that three degradation approaches followed second-order kinetics, and ozonation had the highest removal efficiency both of OXC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Reaction intermediates were evaluated by ultra performance liquid chromatography in combination with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Totals of 11, six and 10 intermediates were detected during the oxidation processes of chlorination, chlorine dioxide oxidation and ozonation, respectively. Although three oxidation approaches had similar pathways in N-heterocyclic ring cleavage and reorganization, ozonation was much more focused on attacking by hydroxyl radicals (OH•), while chlorination had significant Cl-substitution by-products. Chlorine dioxide oxidation brought about fewer degradation by-products than the other two approaches. The above-mentioned oxidation intermediates according to EPA TEST were predicted to be more toxic than OXC, especially those from chlorination. Further test results of the eco-toxicities of oxidized mixtures to the bioluminescent marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri demonstrated the chlorinated samples could lead to the accumulation of toxic transformation products, while chlorine dioxide oxidation and ozonation had detoxication impacts during these processes.</jats:p>",

A portion of purchasing cost should be spent before delivery by several predetermined equal‐sized advanced payments; shortage is permitted and will be partially back‐ordered. The total cost function includes purchasing, holding, capital, backordering, and lost sale costs. The optimal decisions are obtained after proving the convexity of the expected total cost function.

Epanet is used by the EA-WDND to evaluate whether the looped network is operating properly. Consequently, the EA-WDND obtains feasible configurations of network design.

In this situation, the inventory decisions made may not always be optimal. At the same time, with advances in technology, fashion retailers have access to the latest market information and can implement the quick response (QR) system that is very helpful to systematically deal with market disruptions. In this paper, we explore the value of QR with the consideration of a boundedly rational human manager in the fashion retailing company. We show that for both cases, with and without QR, the human retail manager's level of bounded rationality significantly hurts the expected profits of the retailer and supply chain, but it does not hurt the manufacturer's expected profit. In addition, for both cases, with and without QR, we indicate how a minimum ordering quantity (MOQ) measure can be imposed by the manufacturer on the retailer, so that the manufacturer \ncan benefit (in terms of expected profit) from the retailer's bounded rationality behavior. We further prove that if the manufacturer sets the MOQ to be the same as the retailer's theoretical optimal ordering quantity, the manufacturer will enjoy a higher profit with 50% chance, if the retailer is boundedly rational.</jats:p>",

The relationship factors mainly focus on the supply chain linkages (SCLs) created with the upstream and downstream supply chain partners. Therefore, the SCLs such as Power, Benefits, and Risk Reduction are important to any industry to enhance their SCP. This paper examines the level of impact of the Power, Benefits, and Risk Reduction on the SCP. The SCLs and the SCP are analyzed and compared using two types of industries as Apparel (AI), and Food &amp; Beverages (F&amp;BI) that established in Free Trade Zones in Western Province Sri Lanka. A total of 138 Managers in the fields of Supply Chain (SC) related activities were surveyed (88-AI, 50- F&amp;BI) through a self-administrative questionnaire. Risk Reduction and Power together demonstrate a significant influence on the SCP in manufacturing sector in Sri Lanka. Further, 'Industry type' moderates the relationships of Power to SCP and Risk Reduction to SCP but not the Benefits to SCP. In F&amp;BI, the Power, Benefits, and Risk Reduction demonstrate significant (5% level) relationships with SCP but, the Power is not showing significant (5% level) relationship with SCP in AI. In F&amp;BI, Risk Reduction and Benefits together demonstrate significant influence on SCP. But in AI, Benefits with the Power demonstrate significant influence on SCP. AI shows higher level of SCP than the F&amp;BI, when the same level of Power and Risk Reduction apply to their own Supply Chain.</jats:p>"

This study presents the results of using pressurized carbon dioxide (CO2) at less than 1.0 MPa for inactivating Escherichia coli and Enterococcus sp. in artificial seawater (3.4% salinity). The bactericidal effects of pressurized CO2 were assessed using a liquid-film-forming apparatus under various conditions of pressure, temperature, and working volume ratio (WVR). Additionally, leakage of proteins and nucleic acids from cells was measured. Cell morphology of untreated cells and cells treated with pressurized CO2 was assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pressurized CO2 treatment affected both strains; however, Enterococcus sp. exhibited higher resistance to pressurized CO2 treatment than did E. coli. Under identical treatment conditions (0.7 MPa, 20 °C, and 50% WVR), more than 5.0 log reduction in the load of E. coli and Enterococcus sp. was achieved after treatments for 5 min and 20 min, respectively. Release of intracellular contents occurred during the treatment process and SEM images of E. coli and Enterococcus sp. revealed that morphological changes had occurred after the treatment with pressurized CO2. Hence, pressurized CO2 has potential applications for inactivating pathogens in ballast water.</jats:p>",

Hyperosmotic culture conditions caused a ∼2.6‐fold increase of specific ATP formation rates together with a ∼1.7‐fold rise in cytosolic and mitochondrial ATP‐pools, thus showing increased ATP supply. mRNA expression analysis identified several genes encoding glycosylated proteins with strictly tissue related function. In addition, hyperosmotic culture conditions induced an upregulation of miR‐132‐3p, miR‐132‐5p, miR‐182, miR‐183, miR‐194, miR‐215‐3p, miR‐215‐5p which have all been related to cell cycle arrest/proliferation in cancer studies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Fresh water biodiversity is an increasing concern due to growing human impact. Herein, we report a long-term survey (ca. 90 years) of sedimentary diatoms and the modern flora from surface sediments and their biodiversity changes along a eutrophication gradient. Study was carried out in one of the most important water supply reservoirs (Guarapiranga Reservoir) of São Paulo Metropolitan Region, Brazil. Results are based on 75 core subsamples (subfossil assemblages from core) previously dated by 210Pb and 14 samples from surface sediments (modern assemblages). Overall, 84 taxa were reported, belonging to 30 genera, 71 species and eight non-typical varieties, besides five probable new taxa. Results expanded two new additions for the Brazilian diatom flora (Chamaepinnularia submuscicula and Stauroneis acidoclinata) and 30 infrageneric taxa for the state of São Paulo. 47.6% of total taxa inventoried were accounted exclusively for the subfossil assemblages indicating a significant biodiversity change over time. Access to past oligotrophic conditions and to contemporary mesotrophic regions of the Guarapiranga Reservoir accounted for these new additions representing 25% of the total diatom flora. Decline in the total species number along the trophic state gradient occurred for subfossil and modern assemblages. This pattern was even clearer when considering the changes in species richness over time.Eunotia with 21 taxa was the far most represented genera particularly in the oligotrophic phase. During the transitional period (1947-1974), richness gradually declined. With the onset (in the 1970s) and the major eutrophication period (since ca. 1990) occurred a drastic reduction in richness and the replacement of oligotrophic to eutrophic species. Human management also caused abrupt changes in richness. Marked decline occurred (1933) assotiated with hydrological impacts (water discharge increase) with the initial use of the reservoir as a public water supply. Unlike, sudden increase occurred probably associated with the application of algaecide to control cyanobacterial blooms. Present findings highlight the need for surveying the diatom assemblages in protected environments or in less degraded conditions for biodiversity assessment. Furthermore, reinforce the use of paleolimnological approach as in many cases the only tool to assess biodiversity changes encompassing time scales relevant to human-induced degradation and pre-anthropogenic impacts.</jats:p>",

Quantifying how chemical erosion rates vary with climate and tectonics is therefore vital to understanding feedbacks that have maintained Earth's environment within a habitable range over geologic time. If chemical erosion rates are strongly influenced by the availability of fresh minerals for dissolution, then there should be strong connections between climate, which is modulated by chemical erosion, and tectonic uplift, which supplies fresh minerals to Earth's surface. This condition, referred to as supply‐limited chemical erosion, implies strong tectonic control of chemical erosion rates. It differs from kinetic‐limited chemical erosion, in which dissolution kinetics and thus climatic factors are the dominant regulators of chemical erosion rates. Here we present a statistical method for determining whether chemical erosion of silicate‐rich bedrock is supply limited or kinetic limited, as an approach for revealing the relative importance of tectonics and climate in Earth's silicate weathering thermostat. We applied this method to published data sets of mineral supply rates and regolith chemical depletion and were unable to reject the null hypothesis that chemical erosion is supply limited in 8 of 16 cases. In seven of the remaining eight cases, we found behavior that is closer to supply limited than kinetic limited, suggesting that tectonics may often dominate over climate in regulating chemical erosion rates. However, statistical power analysis shows that new measurements across a wider range of supply rates are needed to help quantify feedbacks between climate and tectonics in Earth's long‐term climatic evolution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>More and more researchers have been attracted to the research of atmospheric pressure glow discharge (APGD) because of its great prospect in numerous industrial applications. Nevertheless, almost all of the industrial applications are based on achievement of stable, large-volume, and uniform APGD. In a previous study, stable filamentary APGD was obtained by applying a resonant power supply between pin-to-plate electrodes which could limit the peak value of discharge current to supress the glow-to-arc transition through a series-wound resonance principle. The filamentary APGD is centimeter-level in the length but only several millimeters in diameter. Therefore, in order to obtain large-volume and uniform APGD, it is significant to study how to diffuse filamentary APGD in radial direction. With the increasing resonant frequency of alternating current discharge, excited particles (mainly including energetic electrons and trapped ions left from the previous half-cycle discharge) in the electrodes gap increase, which benefits obtaining stable self-sustaining APGD. In this paper, mechanism and law of the influence of resonant frequency on the diffusion of filamentary APGD in ambient air were studied. By comparing the photos of discharge plasma and waveforms of the discharge voltage and current, it is found that the volume of the glow discharge plasma enlarges as the resonant frequency of the power supply increases. It is very significant and anticipating to study how to obtain stable, large-volume, and uniform APGD in ambient air by the resonant power supply.</jats:p>",

Our framework is developed for snow‐dominated river basins that demonstrate large gaps in forecast skill between seasonal and inter‐annual time horizons. We quantify and bound the contribution of seasonal and inter‐annual forecast components to optimal, adaptive reservoir operation. The framework uses an Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) approach to generate retrospective, one‐year‐long streamflow forecasts based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrology model. We determine the optimal sequence of daily release decisions using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization scheme. We then assess the forecast value by comparing system performance based on the ESP forecasts with the performances based on climatology and perfect forecasts. We distinguish among the relative contributions of the seasonal component of the forecast versus the inter‐annual component by evaluating system performance based on hybrid forecasts, which are designed to isolate the two contributions. As an illustration, we first apply the forecast‐based adaptive management framework to a specific case study, i.e., Oroville Reservoir in California, and we then modify the characteristics of the reservoir and the demand to demonstrate the transferability of the findings to other reservoir systems. Results from numerical experiments show that, on average, the overall ESP value in informing reservoir operation is 35% less than the perfect forecast value and the inter‐annual component of the ESP forecast contributes 20–60% of the total forecast value.</jats:p>",

Thus, this paper presents a comparative study of scenarios with bioethanol supply chain configurations which use different modal alternatives and renewable energy in all its mid-stages. The analysis was based on LCA (life cycle analysis) concepts and in a partial application of LCI (life cycle inventory), so that we can identify which of these scenarios is most appropriate in terms of lower total energy consumption, greater share of renewable energy use and lower CO2 emissions. Based on concepts found in the bibliographic research, the methodology used and the data collected from documental research, this paper analyzes the supply chain that begins with sugarcane plantation and bioethanol production in the south central region of Brazil with destination to export.

The former solves hedging rules based on a given poriod’s water supply weighting factor and carryover storage target, while the latter optimization model is used to optimize the weighting factor and carryover storage target based on the hedging rules. The coupling model gives the optimal poriod’s water supply weighting factor and carryover storage target to guide release. The conclusions achieved from this study as follows: (1) the water supply weighting factor and carryover storage target have a direct impact on the three elements of the hedging rule; (2) parameters can guide reservoirs to supply water reasonably after optimization of the simulation and optimization model; and (3) in order to verify the utility of the hedging rule, the Heiquan reservoir is used as a case study and particle swarm optimization algorithm with a simulation model is adopted for optimizing the parameter. The results show that the proposed hedging rule can improve the operation performances of the water supply reservoir.</jats:p>"

This paper minimizes shipping costs of a three channel distribution system comprised of plants, distribution centers, and customers. Plants manufacture several products that are delivered to distribution centers. If a distribution center is used then fixed cost is charged. Customers are replenished by an only one distribution center. To characterize the uncertainty that typically occurs in many practical decision environments, this paper considers the supply capacities, demands as Gaussian type-2 fuzzy variables. To provide a modelling framework for optimization problems with multi-fold uncertainty, different reduction methods are proposed to transform a Gaussian type-2 fuzzy variable into a type-1 fuzzy variable by mean reduction method. Then the transportation problem is reformulated as a chance-constrained expected value model enlightened by the credibility optimization method. The deterministic models are then solved using two different soft computing techniques (i) Generalized Reduced Gradient (Lingo-14.0), and (ii) modified Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO), where the position of each particle is adjusted according to its own experience and that of its neighbors. The numerical experiments illustrate the application and effectiveness of the proposed solution approaches. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The act of user-dealing has largely been explored within criminology in conjunction with the ‘drug–crime’ link or with a focus on ethnography and subculture. Whereas it is known that many users of drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine engage in small-scale supply as a way of generating revenue, less is known about the particular interplay of social context and choice that leads them to pick this income-generating activity over other potential options. Contributing to a burgeoning literature, this article explores the constrained choices of user-dealers with reference to Bourdieu’s ‘theory of practice’ (1977). Through locating stories of failure in user-dealer narratives, we utilize this novel approach in criminology, illuminating the importance of working with all of the interrelated concepts of habitus, field and capital in appreciating user-dealing as ‘practice’. It is argued that application of this framework affords the previously unharnessed opportunity to use Bourdieusian theory to understand notions of culpability when sentencing this group. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The regional Floridan aquifer system (FAS) extends from the submerged carbonate platform of the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Straits of Florida in the southeastern United States (US), throughout Florida and the coastal plain of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. This carbonate aquifer system is characterized by bedding planes, fractures, dissolution cavities, and other karst features that result in preferential flow of ground water, particularly in response to anthropogenic perturbations such as groundwater withdrawals and aquifer injections. The FAS was divided into six sub-regions for groundwater-modeling purposes in 1989, with results concluding that breaches of those groundwater divides had occurred and those breaches were attributed to large withdrawals of ground water in the US southeastern coastal plain. Those results suggest the model did not elucidate preferential flow conditions through fractures and other karst conduits. We hypothesized that incorporating fractures and sinkholes into groundwater models could improve results and predict adverse impacts to environmentally sensitive areas. We analyzed extensive fracture networks and sinkholes previously mapped throughout Florida and in Dougherty County, Georgia. Some of those fractures extend from one sub-region into an adjacent sub-region of the FAS and may be facilitating the breaching of groundwater divides described in the 1989 groundwater model for this regional aquifer system. The greater total fractures and fracture density in Dougherty County (1,225 and 141.3/100 km2, respectively) compared to 21 north-Florida counties (10-91fractures per county and 0.6-3.8/100 km2, respectively) presumably is due to the scale of fracture mapping and shorter mean lengths of mapped fractures in Dougherty County (1.2 km), compared to north Florida counties (26-118 km), rather than to orders of magnitude increases in fracture densities in that part of the FAS. The number of sinkholes identified in Dougherty County in a recent, unrelated project using 2011 Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images, was approximately an order of magnitude greater than the number of sinkholes mapped in analog form in that county and published in 1986. Extension of the dense network of those fractures that occurred within the boundaries of a Priority Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Area (PARCA) that encompassed Dougherty County covered the Elmodel Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and ASR demonstration well in Baker County, Georgia. Those extensions also passed through numerous agricultural areas with center-pivot irrigation wells in southwest Georgia; intersected other Georgia PARCAs near the Florida-Georgia state line; and clumped in two areas of dense sinkhole clusters in northwest Florida. No determination has been made regarding the contributions of pirated water from the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basins and Wakulla Springshed from the magnitude and extent of agricultural, municipal, and industrial groundwater withdrawals in Georgia’s coastal plain, that exceed groundwater withdrawals in Florida for that area of the FAS, to the increase in sinkholes in Dougherty County and the dense clusters of sinkholes in northwest Florida, via preferential flow through fractures. Similarly, the survival and recovery of at least 24 animal species in Georgia that are either federally listed or high-priority state species may be jeopardized by adverse direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from preferential flow through fractures, sinkholes, and other karst conduits in response to aquifer injections and withdrawals that have not been evaluated. Currently no regional groundwater model has been constructed to evaluate such preferential groundwater flow in the FAS. A model incorporating preferential flow via mapped fractures and sinkholes is essential to determine the magnitude and extent of environmental impacts from ASR wells and other supply and disposal wells in this regional aquifer system, such as pirated water from the ACF and other river basins, alterations in submarine groundwater discharge to Apalachicola Bay and other coastal areas, saltwater intrusion, upconing of saline ground water and resulting impacts to federally endangered and threatened species and high-priority state species.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under the combined impacts of climate change and human activities, a series of water issues, such as water shortages, have arisen all over the world. According to current studies in Science and Nature, water security has become a frontier critical topic. Water supply security (WSS), which is the state of water resources and their capacity and their capacity to meet the demand of water users by water supply systems, is an important part of water security. Currently, WSS is affected by the amount of water resources, water supply projects, water quality and water management. Water shortages have also led to water supply insecurity. WSS is now evaluated based on the balance of the supply and demand under a single water resources condition without considering the dynamics of the varying conditions of water resources each year. This paper developed an optimal allocation model for water resources that can realize the optimal allocation of regional water resources and comprehensively evaluate WSS. The objective of this model is to minimize the duration of water shortages in the long term, as characterized by the Water Supply Security Index (WSSI), which is the assessment value of WSS, a larger WSSI value indicates better results. In addition, the simulation results of the model can determine the change process and dynamic evolution of the WSS. Quanzhou, a city in China with serious water shortage problems, was selected as a case study. The allocation results of the current year and target year of planning demonstrated that the level of regional comprehensive WSS was significantly influenced by the capacity of water supply projects and the conditions of the natural water resources. The varying conditions of the water resources allocation results in the same year demonstrated that the allocation results and WSSI were significantly affected by reductions in precipitation, decreases in the water yield coefficient, and changes in the underlying surface.</jats:p>"

By then all NPPs still in operation will have to shut down in a defined sequence, according to the revisions made to the German Atomic Energy Act as a consequence of the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP. Nine out of 17 NPPs have already been shut down permanently as a consequence.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Due to the progress in science and technology, the design of the electrical power supply of German NPPs got more complex and hardened against various scenarios with time. The latest generation of NPPs built in Germany in the late 1980’s — the pressurized water reactor of type Konvoi — was designed with Defence in Depth in mind. They are connected to several voltage levels of the power grid and feature two layers of AC emergency power systems, each of which fulfills the n+2 redundancy criteria. The second of those layers is especially hardened against the influence of certain internal and external events and is part of an emergency control system which can keep the plant in a safe state autonomously for 10 hours under certain conditions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>With this being the state of science and technology at that time in Germany, most of the older NPPs in operation had been retrofitted by 2011 with systems that were designed to partially compensate for these plants’ weaker original design.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Various events such as the accident at the Chernobyl 4 NPP in 1986 and also the accident at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi NPP in 2011 led to changes in the German regulatory framework and recommendations to the NPPs for further retrofitting activities. In the regime of electrical power supply, the latest changes in requirements and corresponding retrofitting of the NPPs in operation include mobile diesel generators with corresponding, redundant feeding points, an enhanced coping capability for station blackouts with only DC-power left and measures to ensure bringing back AC-power within the available time.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this presentation the author gives an overview over the historic development of the electric design in German NPPs and discuss details of the most recently added requirements on retrofitting — e.g. in the new regulatory framework — to enhance the robustness of the electrical power supply of those NPPs.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this study, we develop a supply chain model with one manufacturer and one retailer, where the market demand might be subject to disruption and neither the manufacturer nor the retailer can perfectly predict whether this market disruption will occur <jats:italic>ex ante</jats:italic>. However, the retailer can resort to his information system to acquire more accurate disruption information than the manufacturer, and this disruption forecast information is the retailer's private information. Under this framework, we first derive the optimal outcomes of two representative categories of contract formats (i.e., the simplest but most widely used wholesale price contract, and the most sophisticated but rarely implemented menu of contracts), and then examine the impacts of the reliability of the retailer's private information about the market state (regular or disruption) on the supply chain performance. Our results demonstrate that the manufacturer's expected profit is quasi‐convex in the reliability (i.e., U‐shaped), and the retailer's expected profit is a piecewise (weakly) increasing function of the reliability. Specifically, there exists a threshold for the retailer's information reliability. Above the threshold, both manufacturer and retailer benefit from the improvement in the information reliability. This means that the manufacturer actually can profit from the exaggerated level of information asymmetry. Below the threshold, the improvement is still favorable to the retailer, but detrimental to the manufacturer due to increased information rents, and thus the manufacturer has no incentive to help the retailer to improve his forecast capability. At the threshold, the retailer's profit experiences a cliff‐like drop, while the manufacturer's profit achieves its minimum value. The result is applicable to both wholesale price contract and menu of contracts.</jats:p>",

A Stackelberg game is employed to model the lead time quote and pricing decision process between the two members under the conditional value‐at‐risk criterion. A unique equilibrium is obtained. Using the corresponding centralized mode as a benchmark, we find that a less risk‐averse supplier is better to cooperate and share risk with the retailer to improve the entire supply chain's efficiency. With a uniformly distributed realized lead time, the impact of the supplier's risk aversion on the decisions can be characterized by a few threshold values of the late delivery penalty cost. In particular, when the unit delay penalty cost exceeds a certain level, a more risk‐averse supplier will counter‐intuitively quote a shorter lead time by risking a higher delay penalty cost.

However, fish size and abundance have an ecological trade‐off within a population, thereby structuring equal‐quality isopleths expressing this trade‐off across the fishing landscape. Since expressed preferences of recreational anglers (i.e., site‐selection of high‐quality fishing opportunities among many lakes) can be analogous to optimal foraging strategies of natural predators, adopting such concepts can aid in understanding scale‐dependence in fish–angler interactions and impacts of fishing across broad landscapes. Here, we assumed a fish supply–angler demand equilibria and adapted a novel bivariate measure of fishing quality based on fish size and catch rates to assess how recreational anglers influence fishing quality among a complex inland landscape. We then applied this metric to evaluate (1) angler preferences for caught and released fish compared to harvested fish, (2) the nonlinear size–numbers trade‐off with uncertainty in both traits, and (3) the spatial‐scale of the equilibria across 62 lakes and four independent management regions in British Columbia's (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BC</jats:styled-content>) rainbow trout <jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</jats:italic> fishery. We found anglers had low preference for caught and released fish (~10% of the value compared to harvested fish), which modified anglers' perception of fishing quality. Hence, fishing quality and angler effort was not influenced simply by total fish caught, but largely by harvested fish catch rates. Fishing quality varied from <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BC</jats:styled-content>'s northern regions (larger fish and more abundant) compared to southern regions (smaller fish and less abundant) directly associated with a 2.5 times increase in annual fishing effort in southern regions, suggesting that latent fishing pressure can structure the size–numbers trade‐off in rainbow trout populations. The presence of two different equal‐quality isopleths suggests at least two effective landscapes support co‐occurring ideal free distributions of recreational fishing effort in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">BC</jats:styled-content>'s rainbow fishery. Anglers' expressed preferences among lakes interacted with density dependent growth and survival within lakes to structure a size–numbers trade‐off influencing how anglers perceive fishing quality and, ultimately, distribute across complex inland landscapes.</jats:p>",

Despite of best efforts, research for the infection of the fungus has yielded equivocal and conflicting results about where and how the infection is initiated and developed. Here we show a stepwise infection pattern and sophisticated regulation during this process. Initial infection occurred on the filaments, which prevented the production of mature pollen thus blocked the pollination. In the following days, the pathogen invaded the stigmas and styles, occasionally the ovaries. Expression analysis indicated that the fungus mimicked a successful fertilization process and enabled the continuous supply of nutrients for fungus to produce false smut balls. The stepwise infection of flower organs and mimicry of ovary fertilization unveiled in this study guided the rice plant into supplying nutrients for false smut ball development and represents a new and unique biological process of host pathogen interactions.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to (i) investigate gas exchange, (ii) measure oxidant and antioxidant compounds, and (iii) respond how B supply acts on tolerance mechanism to water deficit in young Schizolobium parahyba plants. The experiment employed a factorial that was entirely randomised, with two boron levels (25 and 250 Âµmol L-1, simulating conditions of sufficient B and high B, respectively) and two water conditions (control and water deficit). Water deficit induced negative modifications on net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and water use efficiency, while B high promoted intensification of the effects on stomatal conductance and water use efficiency. Hydrogen peroxide and electrolyte leakage of both tissues suffered non-significant increases after B high and when applied water deficit. Ascorbate levels presented increases after water deficit and B high to leaf and root. Our results suggested that the tolerance mechanism to water deficit in young Schizolobium parahyba plants is coupled to increases in total glutathione and ascorbate aiming to control the overproduction of hydrogen peroxide and alleviates the negative consequences on electrolyte leakage and gas exchange. In relation to B supply, this study proved that sufficient level promoted better responses under control and water deficit conditions.</jats:p>"

Combining MCHP units with thermal and electric storage systems can aid in decoupling supply and demand of energy. In such a combined setup, MCHP units can run for prolonged periods when they not only cover existing demand but charge storage systems for deferred consumption of energy. In the present work, we analyzed such an MCHP system, with a particular focus on integrating electrical storage systems and the resulting degree of electrical self-sufficiency achievable under realistic working conditions. We implemented a system control logic to optimize MCHP unit run time geared towards taking energy storage system charging levels into account. We demonstrate that an MCHP unit and electrical storage system can complement each other benefitting overall system performance. Separating days according to their respective degree of electrical self-sufficiency enabled us to identify supply composition characteristics that result in higher electrical load coverage by MCHP-generated electricity.</jats:p>",

Now all kinds of alternative energy technology are developing rapidly to solve such problem in China. Electricity produced by non-fossil fuel energy is continued to increase sharply in China. But it’s hard for regular alternative energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydroelectricity power, nuclear power and so on, to easily provide process heat for industry, especially high temperature steam.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>High temperature Gas-cooled Reactor (HTGR, sometimes also called HTR) is a kind of nuclear reactor, which are demonstrated very high efficiencies, safety and availability features by American and German power plant. HTR differs from water nuclear reactors by offering a high thermal efficiency for electricity generation and a high level of passive safety features. Now HTR-PM project is built in Shidao Bay of China. Moreover, HTR is the only nuclear reactor, which can provide high temperature steam comparing with other water nuclear reactors. So HTR can provide a versatile cogeneration solution for industry.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, a case was studied, how to provide heat for a refinery and petro-chemical plant with HTR. Firstly, the energy need of a typical large chemical plant in china was investigated. Steam supply diagram of an oil refinery plant, which produced 10 million tons oil products and 1 million tons ethylene in China, was calculated. Secondly, technical feasibility of energy providing by HTR cogeneration plant was discussed. Extraction steam from HTR system was designed for the chemical plant. It would meet the requirement of steam supply for chemical plant and would replace the captive power plant, where coal was burning. The balance of steam, enthalpy and temperature was calculated. At last, economic evaluation for such cogeneration plants was carried out. The steam supply cost from captive coal power plant and HTR cogeneration plant was compared. Some economical conclusion was made from the discussion.</jats:p>",
