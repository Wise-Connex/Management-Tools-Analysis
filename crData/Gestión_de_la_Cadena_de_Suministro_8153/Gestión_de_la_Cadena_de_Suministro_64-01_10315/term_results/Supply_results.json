The average area per pair varied from 11,400 to 17,884 acres, excluding country that was not used by the eagles.</jats:p><jats:p>Eagle food in these areas consists largely of Red Grouse, Ptarmigan, Mountain Hares and Rabbits, and also dead Red Deer and dead sheep.</jats:p><jats:p>The numbers and biomass of the four main species of living prey were assessed by representative counts in three main types of habitat; and of dead deer and sheep partly from counts but mainly from published data on stocking densities, mortality and weights.</jats:p><jats:p>The annual food requirement from a home range was estimated at 249 kg. of meat, calculated from data on the food consumption of eagles, allowing for known breeding success and for the presence of some immature eagles and unmated adults; and this was compared with the total food potential in the four Study Areas, allowance being made for the inedible portions of carcases.</jats:p><jats:p>The average food potential in all areas is greatly in excess of the requirements. In the three western areas living prey is very scarce, but amounts of carrion are large and the eagles in these areas depend mainly on carrion. Large differences in food potential between areas do not correspond with differences in eagle density. Two examples are cited where a drastic reduction in food supply had no effect on eagle density, which remains remarkably constant in spite of seasonal and annual fluctuations in food supply.</jats:p><jats:p>Golden Eagle nest‐sites are used over many years, and the home ranges are big enough to supply a more than adequate food supply at all times of year. Evidence is provided of territorial or home‐range defence, which generally takes the form of display flights but occasionally involves more overt aggression. The home‐range size is fixed so high that a critical food level is probably very rarely reached.</jats:p>",

Field experiments were conducted on a red brown earth at low and moderate fertility levels in wet and in dry seasons. Nitrogen fertilizer increased tillering early in the season, the greatest increase being shown by Bencubbin. In three of four experiments application of nitrogen led to earlier depletion of soil water, and high rates (60 lb an acre, 120 lb an acre of nitrogen) reduced the grain yield. Gabo was less affected than the other two varieties. On low fertility sites each fertilizer increment produced a considerable increase in grain nitrogen percentage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The results of two long-term field experiments and two 1-year experiments are reported. In three of these, severe phosphate deficiency was present initially. At high phosphate supply, the annual total yield was not significantly related to age of pasture over periods of 10–13 years. At intermediate and low supply, yields relative to high phosphate supply increased significantly with time; these increases are believed to demonstrate residual effects of phosphate. Indirect evidence for nitrogen accretion from clover under severely phosphate-deficient conditions is presented. Sward components—in the long term—responded differentially to phosphate supply. With very low phosphate, erodium (Erodium botrys (Cav.) Bertol.) and flatweed (Hypochoeris glabra L.) were dominant; whereas with high phosphate, cape-weed (Cryptostemma calendula (L.) Druce) and ripgut brome grass (Bromus rigidus Roth)—or else barley grass (Hordeum leporinum Link)—were dominant. Subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.), though present under these extremes, was relatively more plentiful at intermediate levels of supply. However, at \"steady state\" conditions, the range in clover content was fairly narrow (from c. 20 to 40%). The significance of these findings to a sheep infertility problem (\"clover disease\") of subterranean clover-dominant pastures is discussed.</jats:p>"
