Notes the reluctance, in this particular industry, to move from working with an “open‐adversarial” market into a collaborative scheme, and suggests that the inclusion of a value‐based marketing/processing element may assist in achieving a true partnership between farmers and processors.</jats:p>",

Emphasizes the vulnerability of the Canadian pork sector to increased competition from producers in other countries, and stresses the need for Canada to develop an effective supply chain in order to maximize its potential in this sector.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Like many other countries, Sweden is putting a lot of effort into the development of effective support for small firms. This has resulted in the emergence of a number of programmes intended to increase the number and quality of start-ups and to improve their chances of survival and further growth. In the development of support programmes, it is important to be aware of potential barriers on the demand side (the perceived benefit of taking part in programmes) as well as on the supply side (the support organisation’s ability to develop satisfactory programmes). This paper presents the preliminary results of a survey of 158 technology-based firms in and around Linköping, Sweden. The focus of this research was to study the dynamics of the firm’s participation in the support programmes. The firm’s attitude towards support programmes, how the gap between demand and supply occurs, as well as, how this gap could be bridged to achieve effective support activities was studied. The results showed that the supply-demand gap became apparent when the firm’s situation was compared to its participation in various programmes. The implications of the study are that the support organisations should be focused on the firms’ real needs, that they should facilitate communication between their organisation and the small firm sector and should secure a supply of good programme managers. </jats:p>",

The fixed learning cost yields a rate of return on the investment in individual specific learning and training which is increasing in its rate of utilization. Division of labor can avoid duplicated learning costs and generate economies of specialized learning. The tradeoff between economies of specialization and transaction costs can be used to explain concurrent increases in the extent of the market, aggregate demand, productivity, trade dependence, the degree of market integration, the degree of production concentration, diversity of economic structure, variety of different professions, each person's level of specialization, and the extent of endogenous comparative advantage and the emergence of international trade from domestic trade. This model explains demand and supply as two sides of the level of division of labor which is determined by a transaction cost coefficient. Hence, the demand law may not hold even for normal goods owing to complicated interdependencies between the level of specialization and demand and between the level of specialization and prices of traded goods. The extended version of this model with the CES function is used to endogenize variety of consumption in addition to the endogenization of individuals’level of specialization.</jats:p>",

Using the rhodophyte species <jats:italic>Palmaria palmata</jats:italic> (Huds.) Lamour and <jats:italic>Lomentaria articulata</jats:italic> (Huds.) Lyngb., we compared the effects of growth‐saturating constant photon flux density (PFD) (95 μmol photons · m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>· s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) to those of a dynamic light supply modeled on canopy movements in the intertidal zone (25 μmol photons · m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>· s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> background PFD plus light flecks of 350 μmol photons · m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>· s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, 0.1 Hz).

The time courses of respiration after illumination with constant and fluctuating light were significantly different for <jats:italic>P. palmata</jats:italic> but not for <jats:italic>L. articulata</jats:italic> when the total photon dose was equal. In general, gas exchange of <jats:italic>P. palmata</jats:italic> appeared to be particularly sensitive to the temporal distribution of light supply whereas that of <jats:italic>L. articulata</jats:italic> was sensitive to the amplitude of variations, being photoinhibited at high PFD.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Selenium is an essential nutrient and synthesis of selenoproteins is affected by limited selenium supply. During selenium deficiency there is a differential regulation of selenoprotein synthesis and gene expression; for example, there is a decrease in abundance of mRNA for cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (cGSH-Px) and a preservation of mRNA for phospholipid-hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGSH-Px). This difference is not due to an alteration in the rate of transcription but might reflect differences in translation. The aim of the present work was to assess the role of cGSH-Px and PHGSH-Px 3´ untranslated regions (UTRs) in the regulation of selenoprotein mRNA stability and translation by using H4-II-E-C3 cells transfected with different constructs containing a type I iodothyronine deiodinase-coding region linked to different selenoprotein mRNA 3´ UTRs. Translational efficiency results showed that the efficiency of the 3´ UTRs in permitting selenocysteine incorporation is similar in selenium-replete conditions but, when selenium is limiting, the 3´ UTR of cGSH-Px is less efficient than the 3´ UTR of PHGSH-Px. The results suggest that the 3´ UTR of these selenoprotein mRNA species influences their extent of translation when selenium levels are low. The different sensitivity of the 3´ UTRs to selenium deficiency can explain the differential effect that selenium deficiency has on cGSH-Px and PHGSH-Px activity and mRNA levels, stability and translation. This might be partly responsible for channelling selenium for synthesis of PHGSH-Px rather than cGSH-Px.</jats:p>",

Two policies, enhanced plantation rate and a ban on cutting plant from outside homestead i.e. natural forest, were incorporated in the model. The results show that if the present trend of per capita consumption of energy continues, homestead forest will be declining. But with the adopted policies natural forest depletion could be stopped and homestead forest would be increasing. An increase of 7.6 per cent per capita energy is observed in the year 2010, though a ban exists on collection of fuel wood from natural forest.

The focus is on victims of fatal trauma and assures that each family is empowered with the right to make a donation decision. In October 1993 a consensus conference was held on implementing a program to recover organs from fatal trauma victims. The participants recommended that safeguards be incorporated to assure ethical treatment of both the trauma victim and the nextof‐kin. An Office of Decedent Affairs (ODA) was then established and implemented in September 1994. The ODA is staffed by Family Advocates who are on duty continuously and respond to all trauma and death. events. Their mission is to consolidate all death events, provide support to decedent families, assure that required request mandates are fulfilled, interact with the local Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) in the consent process, and facilitate the implementation of the Rapid Organ Recovery Program (RORP).

The interacting effects of mycorrhizal inoculation, nutrient level, and Al treatment on growth and mineral nutrition of pitch pine (Pinusrigida Mill.) seedlings grown with and without the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithustinctorius (Pers.) Coker &amp; Couch were determined. The seedlings were grown for 66 days in sand irrigated with 0.1- or 0.2-strength nutrient solution (pH 3.8) containing 0, 10, or 20 mg/L Al (0, 0.37, or 0.74 mM). Across nutrient and Al levels total dry weight of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) seedlings was 75% greater than that of nonmycorrhizal (NM) seedlings. Doubling the nutrient level increased the dry weight of NM seedlings by 120%, versus 60% for ECM seedlings. Aluminum reduced root and shoot growth in NM seedlings, but had no effect on shoot growth and only a marginally significant effect on root growth of ECM seedlings. Shoot growth of NM seedlings was more sensitive to Al than root growth. Increased growth of NM seedlings by doubling the nutrient level was least at the highest Al level. Symptoms of Al toxicity in roots (dark, stunted tips) occurred at a lower Al level in NM than ECM seedlings. A strong relationship was not found between Al toxicity and concentrations of Mg and Ca in roots and needles. Enhancement of growth resulting from increased uptake of nutrients due to mycorrhizal inoculation (and) or an increased level of nutrients was the overriding factor affecting the response of pitch pine seedlings to Al. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A study of Campylobacter jejuni on a broiler chicken farm between 1989 and 1994 gave an estimated isolation rate of 27% (3,304 of 12,233) from a 0.9% sample of 1.44 million broiler chickens from six to eight sheds over 32 consecutive rearing flocks comprising 251 broiler shed flocks. During the study, C. jejuni was found in 35.5% of the 251 shed flocks but only 9.2% (23 of 251) had Campylobacter isolates in successive flocks, with 9 of those 23 sheds having the same serotype between consecutive flocks, indicating a low level of transmission between flocks. Analysis of a systematic sample of 484 of 3,304 (14.6%) C. jejuni isolates showed that 85% were of 10 serotype complexes but 58% were of 3 serotype complexes, indicating a high degree of strain similarity throughout the entire study. The three commonest types were detected in 8 of 32 flocks during the 5-year study period, suggesting an intermittent common external Campylobacter source. This hypothesis was tested by a retrospective cohort analysis of C. jejuni rates and types by reference to hatchery supplier of the 1-day-old chicks. Isolation rates of C. jejuni and frequency distribution of types were determined in 6-week-old broiler chickens identified by the hatchery supplying the original chicks. The isolation rate of C. jejuni in broilers, supplied by hatchery A, was 17.6%, compared to 42.9% (P &lt; 0.0001) for broilers reared from chicks supplied by hatchery B. In two instances, when both hatcheries were used to stock the same farm flock, Campylobacter isolates were found only in those sheds with chicks supplied by hatchery B. Thus, the frequency distribution of Campylobacter types for chickens supplied by the two hatcheries over the 5-year period showed marked dissimilarity. These findings suggest that the isolation rate and type of Campylobacter isolates in broiler chickens was associated with the hatchery supplying chicks. The lack of diversity of types and the intermittent high positivity of sheds is evidence for a common source of C. jejuni introduced by vertical transmission rather than contamination at the hatchery or during transportation.</jats:p>",

The conclusions are that much improved damping performance is achieved by the piston-ring sealed arrangement. Unlike the end-sealed arrangement it is very little adversely influenced by a reduction in the number of oil-feed holes. The damping offered by either sealing arrangement is influenced only marginally by repositioning the supply groove. </jats:p>",
