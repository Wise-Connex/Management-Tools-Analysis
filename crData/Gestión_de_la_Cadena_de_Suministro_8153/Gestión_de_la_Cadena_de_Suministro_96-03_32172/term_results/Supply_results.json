Examines the present situation in the light of recent political and economic developments. As member states assert their independence the former system has become unworkable. Many libraries are no longer willing to use the Russian (formerly Lenin) State Library as a resource for political reasons, and others cannot use it because of the new charging mechanisms which have been introduced. Use of Russian libraries by other CIS states has declined significantly, as shown by statistics. The co‐ordinating role of the Russian State Library has largely been eroded, so no central control system operates and previously agreed standards have fallen into disuse.</jats:p>",

Details the research undertaken by the Warwick Manufacturing Group’s time compression programme (TCP) on the applications of time‐based approaches with a number of partner companies. Explores the nature of time compression in relation to the fundamental principles of the supply chain and the concept of “design for logistics”. The implication is that the complexity of these two areas of related scope can be clarified using a time‐based approach so that required management actions can be clearly identified. Highlights a new tool, time‐based process mapping, which forms part of the TCP’s standard approach to time compression, as a practical way of establishing the time‐based opportunities that exist in the business process.</jats:p>",

Shows that it is a powerful methodology for predicting and prioritizing methods of re‐engineering the chain in order to achieve enhanced performance when viewed from the perspective of all “players” in the chain. Building an adequate model of an existing, or proposed, real‐life supply chain requires the use of people‐based sources, observation‐based sources, and systems‐knowledge‐based sources. Illustrates each of these approaches. Concludes with predicting the benefits expected from substantial re‐engineering of an electronics products supply chain.</jats:p>",

Documents how in fiscal year 1990, financial exigency resulted in the cancellation of 1,241 serial titles at the library for a saving of US$233,322.80. Describes how a review of the titles cancelled revealed a high percentage of international subscriptions; thus a major concern of librarians and local scholars was the potential impact that these cancellations might have on the availability of these materials for research. Shows how the SIUC interlibrary loan (ILL) staff has attempted to make the cuts reasonably transparent to the user by tapping traditional and non‐traditional sources to fill the requests produced by these cuts; such that in 1993 ILL made a commitment to integrate document delivery (UnCover, British Library Document Supply Centre, UMI and others) into its standard routines. Assesses the full impact of the cuts four years after the cancellation project. Examines the impact of the 1990 serials cancellations on ILL and the ILL response. Analyses ILL serial requests for the cancelled titles generated during a six‐month period in 1994, looking at availability through document delivery suppliers, cost of acquiring the articles, turnaround times and impact of ILL workload.</jats:p>",

Ninety‐six percent of the State Science Consultants of the 50 State Boards of Education responded to a 1992 survey to assess the supply of science teachers. This survey was modeled after Howe and Gerlovich's 1982 study to provide an assessment of changes in science teacher supply over the last 10 years. Although there were improvements in the supply of science teachers, shortages were reported in all science subjects and were particularly critical in physics, chemistry, and earth science. In addition to providing a needed update on science teacher supply, this study analyzed 45 previous studies of science teacher supply and found convincing evidence to support the hypothesis that there is a persistent but fluctuating long term shortage of science teachers. This shortage is attributed to competition with business and industry. To alleviate critical shortages of science teachers, it is recommended that salaries be raised to be more competitive with industry and a national database be established to facilitate monitoring the supply of science teachers.</jats:p>",

All treatments received nutrient solution at 9 dates during the experiment. The high-N and low-N controls received 1.96 and 0.56 g/application, respectively. In the high-low treatment the switch from the higher to the lower application rate took place 57 days after planting (DAP) and in the low high treatment the reverse switch took place 85 DAP; these 2 treatments received the same total amount of N. Plant N concentrations changed rapidly upon changes in N supply regime. When the supply rate was increased, N concentration increased in leaves that had completed their expansion. Changes in leaf growth started about 15 days after the switch in N regime. Leaves that were expanding at the switch responded by increase in area when N supply increased without a change in mass, i.e. specific leaf area increased. Leaf areas and specific leaf area of expanding leaves decreased when the N supply became smaller. The control of leaf size during initiation and expansion is discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are clearly significant social benefits to land-use planning, but there may also be significant private and social costs which need to be taken into account. In this paper we explore the relationship between land-use planning, the supply of housing land, and the supply and price of housing. It is based on two pieces of empirical research. In the first study, an investigation was conducted of the extent to which land supply, and particularly the operation of the planning system, had affected house prices in Britain during the 1980s, and how far planning had placed a constraint on land supply or simply reorganised that supply. In the follow-up study a single planning area was looked at to examine the extent to which increased land allocations in one area can compensate for constraints on land supply in another. We conclude that the planning system imposes significant costs, which include the exacerbation of price increases in periods of economic growth, but without being able to generate higher housing output during recession. In addition the planning system tends to foster a narrower range of housing types and densities than would be expected in its absence, and so restricts the choice available to consumers. </jats:p>",

The kinetics of gas exchange are affected by a warm‐up prior to exercise in humans, there being a greater aerobic contribution to high intensity exercise after warm‐up. Our hypothesis was that a warm‐up would increase aerobic energy delivery in racehorses during high intensity exercise. Thirteen fit Standardbred racehorses ran to fatigue at 115% of V̇O<jats:sub>2max</jats:sub> on a treadmill at 10% slope. Prior to acceleration, horses were exercised either for 5 min at 50%V̇O<jats:sub>2max</jats:sub> followed by 5 min walk, or walked for 2 min. Samples of expired gas were collected every 10 s during the run for determination of V̇O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and V̇CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and measurement of maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD). Blood lactate concentration was measured 5 min post exercise. We found that with a warm‐up, horses had faster kinetics of gas exchange and a greater proportion of their total energy requirement was supplied by aerobic sources. The aerobic contribution to total energy requirement with and without warm‐up was, respectively, 79.3 ± 1.0% and 72.4 ± 1.7% (P&lt;0.01). There was also a higher MAOD (P&lt; 0.01) in horses that had not been given a warm‐up (mean ± s.e.m. 34.7 ± 2.6 and 47.3 ± 2.6 ml O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> eq/kg bwt with and without a warm‐up respectively). However, there were no significant differences in total run time or estimated total energy expenditure between the 2 protocols. We concluded that during high intensity exercise to fatigue lasting 1 to 2 min, more than 70% of energy supply is from aerobic energy sources and that this contribution is even greater when the horses have received a warm‐up.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examined the contribution of phosphocreatine (PCr) and aerobic metabolism during repeated bouts of sprint exercise. Eight male subjects performed two cycle ergometer sprints separated by 4 min of recovery during two separate main trials. Sprint 1 lasted 30 s during both main trials, whereas sprint 2 lasted either 10 or 30 s. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest, immediately after the first 30-s sprint, after 3.8 min of recovery, and after the second 10- and 30-s sprints. At the end of sprint 1, PCr was 16.9 +/- 1.4% of the resting value, and muscle pH dropped to 6.69 +/- 0.02. After 3.8 min of recovery, muscle pH remained unchanged (6.80 +/- 0.03), but PCr was resynthesized to 78.7 +/- 3.3% of the resting value. PCr during sprint 2 was almost completely utilized in the first 10 s and remained unchanged thereafter. High correlations were found between the percentage of PCr resynthesis and the percentage recovery of power output and pedaling speed during the initial 10 s of sprint 2 (r = 0.84, P &lt; 0.05 and r = 0.91, P &lt; 0.01). The anaerobic ATP turnover, as calculated from changes in ATP, PCr, and lactate, was 235 +/- 9 mmol/kg dry muscle during the first sprint but was decreased to 139 +/- 7 mmol/kg dry muscle during the second 30-s sprint, mainly as a result of a approximately 45% decrease in glycolysis. Despite this approximately 41% reduction in anaerobic energy, the total work done during the second 30-s sprint was reduced by only approximately 18%. This mismatch between anaerobic energy release and power output during sprint 2 was partly compensated for by an increased contribution of aerobic metabolism, as calculated from the increase in oxygen uptake during sprint 2 (2.68 +/- 0.10 vs. 3.17 +/- 0.13 l/min; sprint 1 vs. sprint 2; P &lt; 0.01). These data suggest that aerobic metabolism provides a significant part (approximately 49%) of the energy during the second sprint, whereas PCr availability is important for high power output during the initial 10 s. </jats:p>",
