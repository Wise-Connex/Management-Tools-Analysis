This research also explores the relationship between the SC Strategy Groups and contextual factors, competitive priorities and firm performance. There are significant differences among the SC Strategy Groups for the location of the firm, the level of uncertainty, the competitiveness of the market and firm performance. Surprisingly, there is no relationship between the SC Strategy Groups and a firm's competitive priorities, indicating that firms are often not linking their SC strategy to their competitive strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This article resulted from our study of 3 manufacturing centric supply chain operations in Singapore through 4 iterations of Action Research (AR) guided by Gowin’s V (Rachan, 2007). Although, there is substantial volume of literature on the topic of Supply Chain Management, it came to our attention during the literature review stage of research process, that major concentration of literature was in SCM design and optimization or supply chain performance benchmarking. Almost all of the literature on Risk issues was found to be focused on Security matters. This study was conducted to identify the main process flows in a Supply Chain. Key characteristics were derived from these process flows. From these key characteristics of the process flow, constraints were identified as a “class” to categorize all potential threats and problems. Thus the potential threats and problems classified are actionable and within the span of control, of the member supply chain network entities. This Model for classification will enable an integrated approach to (i) problem structuring, (ii) problem solving and (iii) learning on potential threats and problem to efficient supply chain operations. In today’s intense competitive market environment, efficient supply chain operations make the difference between profit and growth vs. Loss and closure.</p>",

Supply network evolution data collected from simulated responses of the U.S. automobile industry are used in multivariate statistics and time series analysis to identify patterns of network evolution. This analysis reveals that the type of environment a supply network evolves in appears to be a major factor in determining critical timing of structural changes during the evolution of a CASN. Further, time series analysis of firm population evolution highlights how supply networks evolve due to path dependencies in the CASN system. Information about these two aspects of supply network evolution can prove useful to a decision maker in determining how to respond to supply network changes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>In recent years, simulation optimization has attracted a great deal of attention because simulation can model the real systems in fidelity and capture complex dynamics. Among numerous simulation optimization algorithms, Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm is an attractive approach because of its simplicity and efficiency. Although SPSA has been applied in several problems, it does not converge for some. This research proposes Augmented Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ASPSA) algorithm in which SPSA is augmented to include research, ordinal optimization, non-uniform gain, and line search. Performances of ASPSA are tested on complex discrete supply chain inventory optimization problems. The tests results show that ASPSA not only achieves speed up, but also improves solution quality and converges faster than SPSA. Experiments also show that ASPSA is comparable to Genetic Algorithms in solution quality (6% to 15% worse) but is much more efficient computationally (over 12x faster).</p>",

Given the open and dynamic nature of a supply chain network, information risk management is challenging and various factors must be considered. This article introduces a trust-based approach to facilitate supply chain participants to perform effective risk management. The major components of the proposed framework include supply chain member trust evaluation, data classification, and trust-based decision making. The major purpose of the framework is to control and mitigate information risks that a participant faces in a supply chain network (e.g., risks to information confidentiality, privacy, and integrity). We apply the principle of transitive trust for trust evaluation and use several decision tools for risk analysis and mitigation.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Practically all supply chains operate under conditions of uncertainty. To mitigate this uncertainty and increase performance, organizations within chains exchange information to achieve operational cohesion. However, as some researchers have noted, some supply chains benefit more from increased levels of information sharing than others (e.g. Cachon &amp; Fisher, 2000). To assist in explaining the performance differences experienced by supply chains engaged in information-sharing activities, we introduce a new perspective of information sharing within supply chains based on organizational information processing theory (Galbraith, 1973). More specifically, our work and derived conceptual model posit that individual supply chains may be examined as single information processors and that their characteristics can induce complexities in the shared information which subsequently influence how supply chains process this information. Furthermore, the degree to which supply-chain members’ information systems are compatible with each other is posited to also play a significant role in information-processing capabilities.</p>",

From a tactical viewpoint of response-based supply chains, the processing time for each stage is assumed to be a random variable since different practices exist in the selection pool of each stage under a specific lead-time requirement. The decision-maker must select suitable practices of operations for each stage to ensure that the lead time meets a desired requirement. The relationship and the trade-off between the operating costs for the selected practices and the inventory holding cost of safety stock that is in turn affected by the lead-time are discussed. A mathematical model for planning the operations from a manufacturer viewpoint is proposed. The variation in practical situation for the proposed model is also addressed. A hypothetic example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. With reference to the computational results, the effect of several parameters on the model’s optimal solutions was discussed.</p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This article presents a probabilistic security model for supply chain management systems (SCM) in which the basic goals of security (including confidentiality, integrity, availability and accountability, CIAA) are modeled and analyzed. Consequently, the weak points in system security are identified. A stochastic model using measurable values to describe the information system security of a SCM is introduced. Information security is a crucial and integral part of the network of supply chains. Each chain or driver requires a different security level according to the services it contributes to the overall SCM system. Different probabilistic weights are assigned to the four goals CIAA of security depending on the SCM driver’s mission. A Semi-Markov chain model is used to describe the probabilistic nature of different security levels for each driver in the system. A comparison of the steady-state security for a multi-driver model with different levels of attack is performed, and the results analyzed. Enhanced supply chain security could be achieved by identifying the effects of attacks on the security goals of an organization. The use of this model helps to identify weak points in supply chain system security, and offers hints on how to strengthen them. The model is tested by considering intrusion scenarios representing different levels of attack on the SCM system. An analysis of the results is performed using an interactive application.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Typically, a triad of actors is involved in any outsourcing situation: the buyer, the supplier and the buyer's customer. In manufacturing, the buyer acts as a bridge between its supplier and its customer and maintains this bridge position before, during and after the outsourcing. However, in services, the relationship structures among the three actors change before, during and after the outsourcing. Before outsourcing (i.e., during the contract negotiation stage), the buyer is the “bridge” between its supplier and its customer. During implementation, this bridge position begins to “decay” as its supplier comes in direct contact with the buyer's customer. Post‐implementation, the bridge position is intended to be “transferred” to the supplier. However, if left unmanaged, this state of transferred bridge position has serious performance implications for the buyer. The supplier is now the bridge and thus enjoys the leverage inherent in being a bridge. This point has been missed in many services outsourcing ventures by major multinational corporations. To mitigate this effect, we propose that the buyer should continue to actively interact with its customer and closely monitor the supplier in order to prevent the supplier from solidifying its bridge position.</jats:p>",

We introduce a consistency postulate for a stochastic supply function that may be satisfied even if no underlying deterministic supply function is rationalizable in terms of profit maximization.  Our consistency postulate is nonetheless equivalent to a stochastic expansion of supply inequality, which summarizes the predictive content of the traditional theory of competitive supply.  A number of key results in the deterministic theory follow as special cases from this equivalence.  In particular, it yields a probabilistic version of the law of supply, which implies the traditional specification.  Our analysis thus provides a necessary and sufficient axiomatic foundation for a de-coupling of the predictive content of the classical theory of competitive firm behavior from its a priori roots in profit maximization, while subsuming the traditional theory as a special case.</jats:p>"

Strict convexity of farm supply and wholesalers/processors' buyer power in farm markets are shown to be a main reason for asymmetries in the magnitude of farm-retail price transmission. The effect of consumer demand curvature and seller power in retail markets on farm-retail price transmission is often indeterminate and tends to be relatively small.</jats:p>"

The paper has not been peer reviewed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Because natural-gas hydrates (NGHs) can be stabilized at 253 K and are easy to handle, NGHs are expected to be an alternative natural-gas transportation medium to the currently available systems including liquefied natural gas (LNG). A joint industry and government project has been initiated to demonstrate the feasibility of natural-gas land transport and ocean transport in the form of NGH.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Since the idea of ocean transportation of natural gas in the form of NGH was advocated by J. S. Gudmundsson of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in 1996, various research on NGH ocean transportation has been performed. A test plant for NGH production has been built in the US. One company has been conducting research and development on the NGH-production process, a carrier ship, and the regasification process since 2001. A new conceptual design has been developed for a process development unit (PDU).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>NGH Process Developments</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding succeeded in producing NGH continuously at a high speed in March 2001, and in September of that year they started research and development of NGH in full scale to commercialize the NGH process. In January 2002, a continuous-production plant was completed that produced NGH pellets, and in 2003 a regasification facility was added. These facilities began operation as the first-stage PDU (Fig. 1) with a 600-kg/d NGH-pellet production capacity. This plant can produce high-purity NGH pellets at a high speed continuously. Feed gas is contacted with water, causing a reaction that generates NGH, followed by dewatering and cooling. The PDU made it possible to operate a circuit process. NGH pellets are made of the powder produced in the process and then are regasified to natural gas to recycle in the plant.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In 2005, a second-stage NGH-production plant called a bench-scale unit (BSU) (Fig. 2) was completed. Although NGH production from mixed gas had seemed difficult to realize, artificial production of NGH succeeded at the BSU. Fig. 3 shows NGH pellets produced by the BSU in the pellet-storage drum. As an experiment of NGH land transportation, NGH pellets were transported 350 km to a 2005 World Exposition.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

However UK producers perceive that food safety and welfare standards imposed on UK producers are not imposed to the same extent on livestock producers overseas, whose share of the UK market has grown steadily over the past decade. In light of these challenges this paper aims to examine the perceived role and value of farm assurance along the length of the red meat supply chain, in order to determine the potential for turning a supply chain cost into a supply chain benefit and increasing returns to UK producers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from the key supply chain stakeholders (primary producers, processors, retailers and consumers) in the red meat industry.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The research indicates that the potential benefits of price premiums and preferential market access have not been fully captured. Findings indicate that this is due to a misalignment of the perceived value of farm assurance amongst supply chain members and the fact that consumers have a limited understanding and awareness of farm assurance. However the potential for increased benefits exists as when offered the choice between farm‐assured and non‐farm assured meat, consumers express a distinct preference and willingness to pay for the former.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This research is timely as there has been little attempt to assess the perceived value of farm assurance along the length of the supply chain where the views of consumers are integrated with the rest of the value chain for red meat.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

However, with the growing consumption of electronics and IT goods in the country, the environmental threat posed by E-waste has touched an alarming level.‘E-waste’ is a collective name for discarded electronics devices that enter the waste stream from various sources that include electronic appliances such as discarded computers, televisions, VCRs, cell phones, batteries etc. In concern with the environment and its healthy living, the government has undertaken many reforms and policies to mitigate the impact of e-waste. For instance, Corporate Responsibility for Environmental Protection (CREP) 2003, Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989 etc. These reforms have brought out several impacts in the industrial sector and have a huge impact in the making of the products and their selling. Our paper portrays the impacts of the Supply Change Management techniques which led to the design of innovative steps and practices undertaken by the industries like reverse logistics, RFID tools etc to reduce the E-waste in the recent past.</jats:p>",

In conventional design, a full‐scale network system is installed initially to use groundwater resources. However, the system capacity may exceed water demand in the early stages because water demand generally increases with time. Therefore, this work proposes a novel optimal capacity expansion model capable of determining an optimal schedule to expand system capacity according to increasing water demand. The proposed algorithm hybridizes a genetic algorithm (GA) and constrained differential dynamic programming (CDDP). The chromosomes of the GA represent a possible design alternative, a groundwater network with capacity that expands with time. The CDDP algorithm is then used to compute the optimal pumping policy associated with the chromosome. Simulation results indicate that the capacity expansion model saves more total present value cost than conventional designs for the same annual interest rate and water demand. Results of this study demonstrate promise for the proposed model in facilitating a cost‐effective groundwater network design with capacity expansion for regional groundwater supply.</jats:p>",

Three partial equilibrium models are considered: the AGricultural Member states MODeling (AGMEMOD) model, the Common Agricultural Policy SIMulation (CAPSIM) model, and the European Dairy Industry Model (EDIM). This paper analyses how quota rent and supply elasticity estimates, as they are used in these models affect milk output and price projections. Sensitivity analysis is also considered in order to take into account uncertainty in quota rent and supply elasticity estimates. Taking into account the considered uncertainty our best estimate is in case of abolishing the quota the EU’s aggregate milk production will expand, with the increase being somewhere in the range between 5 and 15%.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>New technologies often lack a developed supply market, which makes it problematic to estimate future profitability. This paper develops a simple methodology to circumvent this problem based on the concepts of break-even and expected marginal rate of return. The methodology estimates ex ante a range of target threshold prices: the range of maximum prices that farmers are likely to be willing to pay. Only if the future market is able to supply the new technology within or below the threshold price range is significant adoption likely. The target threshold prices can be used to reorient technology development and delimit recommendation domains. The paper applies the methodology to the case of rock phosphate in upland rice in western Cote d'Ivoire. The paper shows that for rock phosphate to be viable for upland rice farmers its on-farm price should generally not surpass Euro cents 5.7–8.1 per kg of rock phosphate.</jats:p>",

Many communities in the country do not have coffee shops, and users under 18 years of age are not allowed to enter coffee shops. A field sample of 773 current cannabis users were interviewed in seven Dutch cities, two without any coffee shop, five varying in coffee shop density. The vast majority (n = 665; 86.0%) buy their own cannabis, and more than 70% of the cannabis is bought in licensed coffee shops. In logistic regression analyses, three variables were significantly and independently associated with buying from unlicensed suppliers: coffee shop density, age, and sex. With higher coffee shop density it was less likely to buy outside of coffee shops. Under-age buyers were more than twice as likely to buy their cannabis from unlicensed dealers. Males were more likely to buy their cannabis from unlicensed sellers than females. A substantial proportion of unlicensed suppliers sell other drugs as well, thereby increasing the risk of being offered hard drugs when buying soft drugs. This risk is greater for minors than for adults, since a higher proportion of minors use unlicensed selling points. </jats:p>",

Over a two-day period (the day of the announcement and the day before the announcement) the mean (median) stock market reaction ranges from −6.79% to −6.93% (−4.51% to −4.79%), depending on the benchmark used to estimate the market reaction. The percent of sample firms that experience negative market reaction ranges from 73% to 74%. When excess inventory is at the announcing firm's customers, the market reaction is more negative than when the excess inventory is at the announcing firm. The stock market reaction is less negative for excess inventory announcements made by larger firms but is more negative for firms with higher growth prospects and with higher debt-equity ratios. </jats:p>",

Through a detailed study of a major global apparel company and its suppliers, this article argues that this compliance model rests on misguided theoretical and empirical assumptions concerning the power of multinational corporations in global supply chains, the role information (derived from factory audits) plays in shaping the behavior of key actors (e.g., global brands, transnational activist networks, suppliers, purchasing agents, etc.) in these production networks, and the appropriate incentives required to change behavior and promote improvements in labor standards in these emergent centers of global production. The authors argue that it is precisely these faulty assumptions and the way they have come to shape various labor compliance initiatives throughout the world—even more than a lack of commitment, resources, or transparency by global brands and their suppliers to these programs—that explain why this compliance-focused model of private voluntary regulation has not succeeded. In contrast, this article documents that a more commitment-oriented approach to improving labor standards coexists and, in many of the same factories, complements the traditional compliance model. This commitment-oriented approach, based on joint problem solving, information exchange, and the diffusion of best practices, is often obscured by the debates over traditional compliance programs but exists in myriad factories throughout the world and has led to sustained improvements in working conditions and labor rights at these workplaces. </jats:p>",

The process through which buyers make decisions in the face of these risks, however, has not been explored. Despite research highlighting the importance of behavioral approaches to risk, there is limited research that applies these views of risk in the supply chain literature. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on behavioral risk theory to investigate the causal relationships amongst situation, representations of risk, and decision‐making within the purchasing domain. We operationalize and explore the relationship between three representations of supply disruption risk: magnitude of supply disruption, probability of supply disruption, and overall supply disruption risk. Additionally, we draw on exchange theories to identify product and market factors that impact buyers’ perceptions of the probability and magnitude of supply disruption. Finally, we look at how representations of risk affect the decision to seek alternative sources of supply. We test our model using data collected from 223 purchasing managers and buyers of direct materials. Our results show that both the probability and the magnitude of supply disruption are important to buyers’ overall perceptions of supply disruption risk. We also find that product and market situational factors impact perceptions of risk, but they are best understood through their impact on perceptions of probability and magnitude. Finally, we find that decisions are based on assessments of overall risk. These findings provide insight into the decision‐making process and show that all three representations of risk are necessary for fully understanding risky decision‐making with respect to supply disruptions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Greenhouse corn and wheat P uptake, and soil Mehlich‐3 P increased similarly with either fertilizer at rates equivalent to 0, 10, 20, 40, and 80 kg P ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>. In long‐term research sites, grain yield increased with P fertilization in 8 of 12 tests, and was greater with TSP than with AWP in 3 of 12 tests. Plant P uptake increased in all 12 tests, and was greater with TSP in 1 of 12 tests. In previously fertilized agricultural fields, soil Mehlich‐3 P, but not yield, increased due to P fertilization. Fertilizer source differences were infrequent and relatively minor, but possibly due to lower water soluble P content of the AWP (70% versus 78% for TSP). Evaluation of such products requires an appropriate experimental system with low P soils that may be difficult to find on typical North Carolina farms.</jats:p>",

We found that InN quality was significantly improved if a thin In coverage (about 1.8 ML) was introduced before InN growth. However, this In coverage was slowly consumed during subsequent InN growth under N-rich condition. Periodically restoring In coverage for thick InN growth was proposed to solve this consumption problem. We suggest that the effect of In surfactant is to terminate the surface N dangling bonds and form an In adlayer, under which an efficient diffusion channel for lateral N adatom transport is created.</jats:p>",

Due to certain adverse effects, however, some manufacturers and retailers are contemplating the elimination of their rebate programs. This paper sheds light on the debate about the value of rebate programs by presenting a model for evaluating the conditions under which a firm should offer rebates in a competitive environment. Specifically, we consider a two‐level supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer. Each firm makes three decisions: the regular (wholesale or retail) price, whether or not to offer rebates, and the rebate value should the firm decide to launch a rebate program. We determine the equilibrium of a vertical competition game between the manufacturer (leader) and the retailer (follower), and we provide insights about how competition affects the conditions under which a firm should offer rebates in equilibrium. </jats:p>",

The theoretical derivation and analysis are done using the theory of variational inequalities. We then apply the model to a specific case, the New England electric power supply chain, consisting of six states, five fuel types, 82 power generators, with a total of 573 generating units, and 10 demand market regions. The empirical case study demonstrates that the regional electric power prices simulated by our model match the actual electricity prices in New England very well. We also compute the electric power prices and the spark spread, an important measure of the power plant profitability, under natural gas and oil price variations. The empirical examples illustrate that in New England, the market/grid‐level fuel competition has become the major factor that affects the influence of the oil price on the natural gas price. Finally, we utilize the model to quantitatively investigate how changes in the demand for electricity influence the electric power and the fuel markets from a regional perspective.</jats:p><jats:p>The theoretical model can be applied to other regions and multiple electricity markets under deregulation to quantify the interactions in electric power/energy supply chains and their effects on flows and prices. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In such a situation, the effective absorption of wind energy production is an important issue in a relatively small and weak power system such as that of Greece, which has limited existing interconnections with neighboring countries. The curtailment of wind power is sometimes necessary in autonomous systems with large wind energy penetration. The absorption or curtailment of wind power is strongly affected by the spatial dispersion of wind power installations. In the present paper, a methodology for estimating this effect is presented and applied for the power supply system of Greece. The method is based on probability theory, and makes use of wind forecasting models to represent the wind energy potential over any candidate area for future wind farm installations in the country. Moreover, technical constraints imposed by the power supply system management, the commitment of power plants and the load dispatch strategies are taken into account to maximize the wind energy penetration levels while ensuring reliable operation of the system. Representative wind power development scenarios are studied and evaluated. Results show that the spatial dispersion of wind power plants contributes beneficially to the wind energy penetration levels that can be accepted by the power system.

The table olive industry is located in California's Central Valley, where daily high summer temperatures can be &amp;gt;35.0°C. This study investigated the effects of high temperatures (heat stress) and food conditions on the flight performance of B. oleae in laboratory flight mill tests. Flies were provided food (honey and hydrolyzed yeast) and water for a 1-wk preconditioning period and then subjected to 24-h preflight exposure to diurnal temperature regimes (low-high temperatures of 18.3–35.0°C and 18–37.8°C) and deprivation of food. Flies with the preflight stress conditions had significantly lower flight performance (1,305 m and 0.989 h at 18.3–35.0°C and 1,152 m and 0.966 h at 18.3–37.8°C) than control files that were held under no-stress preflight conditions (constant 23.9°C, food, and water) and flew 1,982 m for 1.54 h. Flight distance and duration were further reduced when no water was provided during the 24-h preflight exposure to high temperature stress. Flight distance and duration also were decreased when the preflight exposure period was increased to 2 and 3 d. When flies were deprived of food and water during the preconditioning period, there was significant adult mortality and flight performance was poor (&amp;lt;50 m and &amp;lt;2 min) after 24-h preflight exposure to either the 18.3–35.0°C or the 18.3–37.8°C temperature regime and deprivation of food. Heat stress and food deprivation also reduced postflight fecundity and adult longevity. The results are discussed with respect to the ability of B. oleae to survive summer heat and food deprivation by dispersing to refuges with food, water, and shelter.</jats:p>",

This study was conducted in the dairy supply area of the Tadla irrigation scheme in Morocco and in the oasis area in southern Tunisia where dates are grown for export. The study was based on (i) a framework conceptualizing the relationship between production/marketing of agricultural raw material and water saving and productivity and (ii) a participatory research method aimed at supporting stakeholders in solving their production problems. Analysis of the organization of the two supply chains revealed the central role of intermediate operators in aggregating raw material and providing services to farmers. A decision support approach for dairy farmers was designed and tested in the Tadla scheme. Its use is illustrated by four scenarios that simulate the impacts of changes in both forage crops and irrigation techniques on farm income and water consumption and productivity. Lessons drawn from this work concern support for stakeholders and the integration of production functions from the irrigated scheme to the agro‐processors in the whole supply chain.

Biological market theory predicts that such exchange rates fluctuate according to the law of supply and demand. Previous studies showed that primates pay more when commodities become scarcer: subordinates groomed dominants longer before being tolerated at food sites in periods of shortage; females groomed mothers longer before obtaining permission to handle their infants when there were fewer newborns and males groomed fertile females longer before obtaining their compliance when fewer such females were present. We further substantiated these results by conducting a 2-step experiment in 2 groups of free-ranging vervet monkeys in the Loskop Dam Nature Reserve, South Africa. We first allowed a single low-ranking female to repeatedly provide food to her entire group by triggering the opening of a container and measured grooming bouts involving this female in the hour after she made the reward available. We then measured the shifts in grooming patterns after we added a second food container that could be opened by another low-ranking female, the second provider. All 4 providers received more grooming, relative to the amount of grooming they provided themselves. As biological market theory predicts, the initial gain of first providers was partially lost again after the introduction of a second provider in both groups. We conclude that grooming was fine-tuned to changes in the value of these females as social partners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>According to Moore's law, the number of transistors in a chip doubles every 18 months. The increased transistor-count leads to increased power density.

A mechanism called TCMS (Threshold Control through Multiple Supply Voltages) was previously proposed for improving the power efficiency of FinFET based global interconnects. We propose a significant generalization of TCMS to the design of any logic circuit. This scheme represents a significant divergence from the conventional multiple supply voltage schemes considered in the past. It also obviates the need for voltage level-converters. We employ accurate delay and power estimates using table look-up methods based on HSPICE simulations for supply voltage and threshold voltage optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that TCMS can provide power savings of 67.6% and device area savings of 65.2% under relaxed delay constraints. Two other variants of TCMS are also proposed that yield similar benefits. We compare our scheme to extended cluster voltage scaling (ECVS), a popular dual-\n            <jats:italic>\n              V\n              <jats:sub>dd</jats:sub>\n            </jats:italic>\n            scheme presented in the literature. ECVS makes use of voltage level-converters. Even when it is assumed that these level-converters have zero delay, thus significantly favoring ECVS in time-constrained power optimization, TCMS still outperforms ECVS.\n          </jats:p>",

Proposed was a holistic usability framework to guide the analysis of DFU as well as the compilation of an evidence database composed of design documentation, post hoc evaluation, semistructured interviews, and participant observation. This research revealed a set of usability needs and coping strategies found throughout a series of systems design and redesign processes at the case company.

This paper reports on the qualitative and quantitative screening of groundwater sources for integration into the public water supply system of the Algarve, Portugal. The results are employed in a decision support system currently under development for an integrated water resources management scheme in the region. Such a scheme is crucial for several reasons, including the extreme seasonal and annual variations in rainfall, the effect of climate change on more frequent and long-lasting droughts, the continuously increasing water demand and the high risk of a single-source water supply policy. The latter was revealed during the severe drought of 2004 and 2005, when surface reservoirs were depleted and the regional water demand could not be met, despite the drilling of emergency wells.  For screening and selection, quantitative criteria are based on aquifer properties and well yields, whereas qualitative criteria are defined by water quality indices. These reflect the well's degree of violation of drinking water standards for different sets of variables, including toxicity parameters, nitrate and chloride, iron and manganese and microbiological parameters. Results indicate the current availability of at least 1100 l s−1 of high quality groundwater (55% of the regional demand), requiring only disinfection (900 l s−1) or basic treatment, prior to human consumption. These groundwater withdrawals are sustainable when compared to mean annual recharge, considering that at least 40% is preserved for ecological demands. A more accurate and comprehensive analysis of sustainability is performed with the help of steady-state and transient groundwater flow simulations, which account for aquifer geometry, boundary conditions, recharge and discharge rates, pumping activity and seasonality. They permit an advanced analysis of present and future scenarios and show that increasing water demands and decreasing rainfall will make the water supply system extremely vulnerable, with a high risk of groundwater salinization and ecosystem degradation.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The essential processes and mechanisms of the transport of contaminants from a river to a well field via a flood water retention area are presented. The transport is conceptualized as a succession of three phases: (1) contaminant entry into the retention area, (2) passage through the soil zone and (3) transport with the groundwater flow. Depending on the conditions of a given location and on the properties of the contaminants of interest, processes within each transport phase may reduce the concentration of the contaminants at the well field. For the Kastenwoert-Rappenwoert study area, the results of the described processes are shown by chemical and ecotoxicological analyses as well as by numerical modelling. Based on the results of the analyses, it is predicted that some contaminants in the study area will be completely detained along the transport path, while others will be transported as far as the well field, although in significantly reduced concentrations.\n                    </jats:p>"

When DO was below 4.13 mg/L, the growth of shrimp was depressed. Feed ingestion and feed conversion efficiency decreased with the decrease of DO. Less feed ingestion was caused by lower daily metabolic energy. Higher proportion of ingested energy lost in metabolism, exuviations, and nitrogen excretion caused lower feed conversion efficiency. More energy lost in exuviations, lower survival rate, soft carapaces of dead shrimp, and cannibalism were found in oxygen deficient groups and it implicated that hypoxia could delay the shrimp recovering from molting and cause cannibalism and higher mortality. The results indicated that hypoxia was an important factor affecting the amount and fitness of shrimp stock because it could cause a high rate of mortality and growth depression.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",
