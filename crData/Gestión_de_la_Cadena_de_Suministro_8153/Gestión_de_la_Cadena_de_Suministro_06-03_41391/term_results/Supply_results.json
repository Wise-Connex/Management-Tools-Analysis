Chinese inmates on death-row and the economically disadvantaged in India and Brazil are the often compromised co-participants in the private negotiation process, which occurs outside the legal process - or in the shadows of law. These individuals supply kidneys and other organs for Americans and other Westerners willing to shop and pay in the private process. This book contends that exclusive reliance on the present altruistic tissue and organ procurement processes in the United States is not only rife with problems, but also improvident. The author explores how the altruistic approach leads to a 'black market' of organs being harvested from Third World individuals as well as compelled donations from children and incompetent persons.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain management and information technology are two areas of research, which have attracted a lot of attention in academic and practitioner’s camps over the last decades. The discussion related to the deployment of information technology and electronic commerce in supply chain management has fostered a discussion about information technology enabled supply chains. The authors pinpoint, there is a lack of research which integrates this highly inconsistent and fragmented field. In this paper, the authors attempt to present a critical summary of the discussion of information technology enabled supply chain and supply chain management and attempt to provide a framework that helps managers and practitioners to tackle this phenomenon. It can be stated that management of information technology enabled supply chain is a complex process and that top managerial support is always welcome. Finally, we present limitations of the study and highlight some ideas for future research in this area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nKeywords: Marketing, supply chain management, information technology</jats:p>"

The present work aimed to explain the availability of\nphosphorus by determining the inorganic phosphate fractions and using ryegrass\ntest plants. Four inorganic phosphate fractions were distinguished: Fraction I,\nthe sorbed phosphates; Fraction II, the easily soluble Ca phosphates and the Al\nbound phosphates; Fraction III, the Fe phosphates; and Fraction IV, the hardly soluble\nCa phosphates. Fraction II, in which the easily soluble Ca phosphates and Al\nphosphates accumulate, was the main phosphorus source for the test plants on\nboth calcareous and non-calcareous soils. Fraction III (the iron phosphates)\nplays a greater role in non-calcareous soils, while Fraction IV (the hardly\nsoluble Ca phosphates) in calcareous soils. Both fractions are closely\nconnected with soil development, and with soil properties such as pH and CaCO\n <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\n \ncontent. The hot water percolation method reflects\nthe phosphorus supply of soil as well as that measured with ryegrass plants and\nwith the AL method. This new HWP method is in good correlation with the\nmain source of phosphate, with fraction II. For routine purposes the first\ncollected HWP fraction can possibly be used to determine the phosphorus supply\nof soil correlating well with the phosphorus uptake of test plants.</jats:p>",

However, in our recent survey about customer satisfaction, over 50% of the customers were not satisfied with tap water for drinking. One of the main reasons for the dissatisfaction was the odor or taste caused by the disinfection process. We therefore investigated the behavior of residual chlorine in the water distribution network by estimating the chlorine decay coefficients, and discussed measures to decrease the unpleasant odor while maintaining the effect of disinfection. The effective measures are shortening of retention time, replacement of aged pipes, corrosion control of distribution and service pipes, removal of organic substances in water, additional chlorination at water-supply stations, and improvement in water supply facilities with receiving tanks. By adopting these measures, and setting the target value of residual chlorine at representative water taps, we successfully controlled residual chlorine at the outlets of purification plants or water-supply stations by application of the decay coefficient of chlorine in each water distribution system.</jats:p>",

A device, which was composed of a flow meter, a pressure meter and electric conductivity sensor, was set near a faucet of the laboratory to investigate the applicability of the device. Output from the conductivity sensor showed variation suggesting the possibility of the detection of water quality change. Output from the pressure gauge showed variation caused by water level variation in the storage tank suggesting the possibility of monitoring overall water consumption rate in the building. By monitoring friction loss in the pipeline from the storage tank to the faucet, it was found possible to detect leakage from the pipe line.</jats:p>",

However data itself, without effective data management and interpretation, cannot be used to tell the story or history of the lake. Therefore, this project aims to develop a new water quality database system for a lake with systematical functions to utilize such data effectively and to satisfy both general public users and specialists. Lake Biwa was chosen as the target lake, where long-term monitoring data were available for almost one hundred years. A relational database application, Access 2002, with the help of Macro functions and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) was introduced to organize all of the data. With the systematical storing of data, valuable data could be easily accessed, filtered and powerfully utilized for researchers own interests. The filtered data can be written into basic documents (spreadsheet or text files), provided for outside requests, and again used for further basic and advanced analysis by a reading back process. The system supports multiple users, especially public users by providing user interface system and visualized result displays. The final outcomes from this systematic data utilization can be fruitfully used as the guideline for effective monitoring management program of lake water quality.</jats:p>",

The removal ratio during coagulation–sedimentation step was determined by jar test using PAC (poly-aluminium chloride). Lower coagulation pH showed better picophytoplankton removal in coagulation–sedimentation. The optimum coagulant dosage for picophytoplankton was twice or more than that for turbidity. The removal efficiency of picophytoplankton was 44–60% at lowest pH in water quality standard (5.8) and at an optimum coagulant dosage for turbidity. The removal ratio of picophytoplankton in rapid sand filtration was determined by pilot scale column experiments with sand and anthracite. The average removal percentage was 16.3% without PAC addition and chlorination before sand filtration; on the other hand it was 51.5% with PAC and chlorination. AOC increased by the chlorination of picoplankton including 6,800 cells/L of picophytoplankton was 21 μg-acetateC/L at 0.1 mg/L of residual free chlorine. The AOC was increased by the increase of residual chlorine concentration, and leveled off at 0.3 mg-Cl/L. From the result, the AOC originating from picoplankton (maximum AOC from picophytoplankton) could increase up to 155 μg-acetateC/L in this reservoir. It indicates that the removal of picoplankton (picophytoplankton) in drinking water treatment process is important from the viewpoint of AOC control.</jats:p>",

Photocatalysis often leads to complete degradation of organic pollutants without any need for chemicals. In this study, the removal of the herbicide metsulfuron–methyl (MM) by photocatalysis was studied. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was used as a catalyst in a UV reactor equipped with three lamps each with 8 watts of power. The total surface of UV lamps was 537 cm2. The capacity of the photocatalytic reactor was 1.5 L. The effects of parameters such as pH and TiO2 dose on the removal of MM were studied. The combined system of the photocatalytic reactor with powder activated carbon (PAC) adsorption was also investigated. The results indicate that the use of PAC reduced the TiO2 dose and led to very high removal efficiency. A very small dose of 0.05 g/L PAC reduced TiO2 requirement from 2 g/L to less than 0.5 g/L. A detailed molecular size distribution measurement made using high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) showed that TiO2 can degrade the MM to a small molecular weight compound of 50 daltons within a detention time of 40 minutes. This hybrid system was found to be technically and economically more efficient than the other processes used to remove herbicides and pesticides.</jats:p>",

It was observed that chlorine decay is the major factor in deteriorating the water quality after storage. Relatively high water temperature and the presence of higher organic/inorganic impurities are the main reasons that cause the large chlorine decay in Kaoshiung. Most of the microbial regrowth was observed in the samples with chlorine residuals less than 0.2 mg/L, indicating that 0.2 mg/L of chlorine residual is a suitable criterion to prevent the microbial contamination. After roof-top storage, the chlorine residual, total dissolved solids and turbidity were decreased; however, total bacteria counts and pH were increased.

Simplified cell proliferation tests using the human estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 ATCC breast cancer cells (E-SCREEN) were performed to investigate the influence of chlorination on the estrogenicity in effluents. It was found that the increase of chlorine dosages from 0 mg/L to 4 mg/L led to the decrease of total content of estrogenic activity: the 17ß-estradiol equivalent concentration (EEQ) from 22.40 to 8.35 ng/L. However, the increase of contact time from 10–30 minutes increased EEQ from 14.04 to 29.97 ng/L. Furthermore, increasing TOC level using humic acid from 5 mg/L to 15 mg/L in effluents correspondingly resulted in an increase of EEQ from 19.69–27.20 ng/L; it was thus confirmed that chlorination of humic acid could produce estrogenic by-products.</jats:p>",

Test results show that CP pretreatment enhanced coagulation is superior to prechlorination and KMnO4 preoxidation. This pretreatment process has the capability to reduce the above parameter values sharply with less coagulant compared to prechlorination. CP pretreatment will not increase chloroform in water and can effectively remove chloroform potential. The manganese dioxide produced during permanganate preoxidation also enhanced coagulation, which has special adsorption and oxidation for the organic matter, and at the same time it acts as catalyst to accelerate the reaction between the KMnO4 and organics in water.

The 1996 census micro data are used to develop rent- and price-age profiles of dwellings in each of Canada's census metropolitan areas. The analysis shows that the filtering process is both too slow and, at best, can have too small an effect to be a part of a government strategy for reducing the housing burdens of low-income people. Filtering is not helping lower-income households. The most important finding shows the reversal in the direction of filtering in all Canadian metropolitan areas since 1981. The rents and prices of older dwellings have been rising faster than those of the newer units. The steep 1971 rent- and price-age profiles for Montreal and Toronto are explained to show that government policies would not be able to induce the amount of filtering needed to have a noticeable effect on the welfare of lower-income households. The pressures that eventually find expression in gentrified neighbourhoods are affecting much of the older housing stock. Cities in other countries that are experiencing gentrification may be subject to the same pressures. </jats:p>",

Several experimental parameters including pH level, H2O2 concentration, TiO2 dosage and light intensity were investigated. The experimental results demonstrated the degradation of MTBE following a pseudo first-order reaction in both reaction systems. Faster degradation rates were observed in alkaline solution for the UV/TiO2 system, but for the H2O2-UV/TiO2 system, faster degradation rates were detected in acidic solution. More dosage of TiO2 and irradiated light intensity were beneficial for the photocatalysis of MTBE. However, a peak reaction rate was observed at a TiO2 concentration of about 500 mg/L. The experimental results also indicated that the degradation rate of MTBE was enhanced by the addition of H2O2. H2O2 could be a more efficient electron acceptor than oxygen for retarding recombination of electron–hole pairs. The degradation rate in the H2O2-UV/TiO2 system was about 2.8 times faster than that in the UV/TiO2 system for solution pH below 5, and the rate increased 30% for solution pH above 6. In addition, it is observed that the reaction rate of MTBE increased quickly with H2O2 concentration at low H2O2 dosages, but the rate was independent of H2O2 dosage when adding too much H2O2.</jats:p>",

Restricting the sample to individuals who were not considering teaching careers when they were high school seniors, I estimate the marginal effect of the availability of undergraduate teacher certification programs on the likelihood that these individuals will become teachers.

By March 2000, all water purification plants in Osaka City were equipped with advanced water treatment facilities. This new treatment system has successfully removed odours and flavor and reduced trihalomethane. GAC treatment, the last stage of the water treatment, plays a vital role in removing organic matter in water, in conjunction with ozonation. However, GAC performance changes over time. To optimize the GAC effect, it is essential to conduct proper GAC management based on a thorough grasp of the change patterns of GAC performance. To determine GAC's water treatment capability, we analyzed data on 69 water quality items; obtained from past plant tests and chemical substance addition experiments using GAC actually used in the purification plants. Analysis revealed the deterioration patterns and time of GAC performance. By considering physical properties and economic factors as well as deterioration patterns of GAC performance, it is possible to establish an optimal GAC management system. This paper describes the findings obtained from the study on GAC water treatment performance conducted by OMWW.</jats:p>",

For the mean G=60 sec−1, sample was stirred at 400 rpm (G=518 sec−1) for 10 seconds then the stirring speed was reduced to 100 rpm (G=60 s−1) and held at this value for the required time (9 minutes). In the other trial, slow stirring speeds of 130 rpm, 100 rpm and 70 rpm and 150 rpm, 100 rpm and 50 rpm for 3 minutes each were used. After slow stirring, the speed increased to 400 rpm (G=518 s−1) for 10 seconds and then reduced back to appropriate slow stirring speed as stated above. A similar approach was applied for mean G=100 s−1. For continuous tests, a laboratory scale set-up was constructed as a tapered flocculation system that consists of three chambers. Flocs formation in the first and third chambers were monitored and compared. Larger flocs that have higher reformation rate were produced with tapered flocculation.</jats:p>",

The results of a simulated manual jar-test showed that ferric sulfate can maintain a satisfactory arsenic removal efficiency (&amp;gt;95%), and be relatively independent of water conditions. Combining with effective sand filtration, 20, 30, 60 mg/L of ferric sulfate were suitable for removing &amp;lt;0.5, 0.5–1.0, 1.0–2.0 mg/L of As(V), respectively. With decanting (after settling for 8∼10 h), however, ferric sulfate of 60 or 70 mg/L was needed to remove &amp;lt;0.5 or 0.5–1.0 mg/L of As(V), respectively. The removal rates of As(III) could achieve similar levels to that of As(V) once the water samples were pre-oxidized. The javelle water was selected as site applicable oxidant for As(III), although ozone sparging, hydrogen dioxide solution and bleaching powder also showed good performances. It was noted that the stopgap coagulation protocol was readily and acceptable to be applied by the local residents. The makeshift strategy will immediately protect the health of local residents before some kinds of long term and effective ways could be applied.

Techniques including the control of stormwater runoff, increasing infiltration and providing opportunities for retention, treatment and reuse of both stormwater and wastewater, are well suited to being designed into the development rather than considered post-construction or not at all. There can be extensive capital investment by developers to implement IUWM which is often not returned in the land sales. This produces a disincentive for the developer unless the contribution is recognised and rewarded either financially or with appropriate marketing advantage. A system to rate land developments based upon IUWM has been developed that would quantifiably assess how effectively water resources would be utilised in a proposed land development. This assessment would provide a point of comparison between developments allowing property purchasers, developers, utilities and legislators to quickly compare how well the development performs in terms of IUWM, providing a mechanism for financial reward or recognition. This paper discusses the development of a model to quantifiably assess land developments for water efficient use and introduces a rating system with which land developments can be compared in terms of IUWM.</jats:p>",

The originality of the work lies with the method’s inherent capability of being able to generate multilevel and multifidelity cost relations for large volumes of parts utilizing process, supply chain costing data, and varying degrees of part design definition information. Estimates can be generated throughout the life cycle of a part using different grades of the combined information available. Considering design development for a given part, additional design definition may be used as it becomes available within the developed method to improve the quality of the resulting estimate. Via a process of analogous classification, parts are classified into groups of increasing similarity using design-based descriptors. A parametric estimating method is then applied to each subgroup of the machined part commodity in the direction of improved classification and using which, a relationship which links design variables to manufacturing cycle time may be generated. A rate cost reflective of the supply chain is then applied to the cycle time estimate for a given part to arrive at an estimate of make cost which is then totalled with the material and treatments cost components respectively to give an overall estimate of unit acquisition cost. Both the rate charge applied and the treatments cost calculated for a given procured part is derived via the use of ratio analysis. </jats:p>",

Results indicated that coagulation could remove about 20–40% of LAS in water, and there was a positive correlation between dosage and elimination effects before the maximum removal effect was reached. However, at different coagulations, the maximum elimination and the corresponding dosage were quite different. When the water quality condition was the same, iron-coagulation was much better in removing turbidity, organisms and LAS than aluminium-coagulation. A correlation between the amount of LAS and organism removed was found in our test, which was much closer than between LAS and turbidity. This indicated most LAS was combined with other organic matters in water. That was to say the removal of LAS and other organic matter was concordant, which was significant to the removal of LAS. Water temperature and pH has much effluence on the wiping off of LAS. Both lower pH and higher temperature are propitious to remove LAS.</jats:p>",

Water concentrations were estimated by use of statistical data. Assigning cancer unit risks to each substance and applying the assumption of additive toxicological effects to multiple carcinogens, total cancer risks of the waters were estimated. As a result, the geometric means of total cancer risks in raw and purified water were 1.16×10−5 and 2.18×10−5, respectively. In raw water, the contribution ratio of arsenic to total cancer risk accounted for 97%. In purified water, that of four trihalomethanes (THMs) accounted for 54%. The increase of total cancer risks in purified water was due to THMs. In regard to the geographical variation, the relationship between population size and total cancer risks were investigated. The result was that there were higher cancer risks in the big cities with the population more than a million both in raw and purified water. One plausible reason for the higher risks in purified water in the big cities is a larger chlorination dose due to the huge water supply areas. The reason for the increase in raw water remained unclear.</jats:p>",

Of these, phenol showed the highest reactivity with chlorine, yielding the most HAAFP. Even though HAAFP of the tested by-products was lower than that of phenol, it was confirmed that all by-products can act as the precursor of HAAs. Regarding the ozonation of phenol-containing water, the efficiency of ozone in controlling HAAs can be reduced by the formation of oxidation by-products. When comparing conditions for pH 7 and 3, the ozonation for pH 7 was more effective in removing the overall HAA precursors than the ozonation for pH 3. This result was attributed to complete oxidation by the production of the secondary oxidant, such as the OH radical (OH·) from ozone decay, and ionization of phenol.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Arsenic is commonly present in many groundwater sources. To remove arsenic from groundwater, several advanced techniques, including adsorption and ion exchange, are often employed in drinking water treatment processes. In this study, the transport and adsorption of arsenate within one iron-based adsorbent (Bayoxide E33 from Bayer) and one anion exchange resin (Arsenex from Purolite) is elucidated. A batch reactor with temperature control was used to determine the kinetic and equilibrium uptake of arsenate onto the two media. The experimental results revealed that the adsorption equilibrium was established within 4 to 5 hours for both E33 and Arsenex. After fitting the arsenate uptake data, the Freundlich isotherm equation was able to describe the experimental uptake data for both media. The uptake of arsenate decreased as pH increased for E33, since the surface of E33 became more negatively charged at higher pH. However, the arsenate uptake increased as pH increased due to the fact that more divalent arsenate ions formed at higher pH. A pore diffusion model, combined with the Freundlich isotherm parameters, was used to simulate the kinetic uptake data. The models conforms closely to the experimental data, and the extracted pore diffusion coefficients of arsenate were obtained. The model with the extracted diffusion coefficients was able to predict the kinetic adsorption curves for other experimental conditions, indicating that the model is appropriate for the systems tested in this study.</jats:p>",

Among the T&amp;Os causing chemicals in water, the most common and problematic ones are geosmin and 2-MIB, which are produced by blue–green algae and actinomycetes. The odors of the chemicals are characterized earthy and musty/camphorous. Since the reported odor thresholds of geosmin and 2-MIB are as low as 4.0 and 8.5 ng/L, respectively, they are not readily removed by conventional water treatment processes or by simple ozonation. Therefore, oxidation of the chemicals using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) along with ozone (O3) has been tried as an alternative. In this study, kinetics of geosmin and 2-MIB ozonation at different initial O3 doses, H2O2/O3 ratios, and temperatures were evaluated. In short, a significant promotion of geosmin and 2-MIB ozonation rate was observed at higher H2O2/O3 ratios at lower temperature; therefore, geosmin and 2-MIB could be successfully removed from water. However, when an ozonation process is designed ozone residual should be considered for satisfactory disinfection; H2O2 addition may promote O3 decomposition and may have an adverse effect on disinfection. Therefore, determination of H2O2 and O3 doses should be carefully made for achieving both disinfection and T&amp;Os removal.</jats:p>",

It was notified that new heat substations equipped with automatic heating control devices have backward impact on the technological parameters of DH networks. Modelling tools for simulation of hydraulic and thermal parameters in the network allow estimating of potential deviation of heat carrier temperature with loading variations not only during the season of the year, but also over day and night. Special technical measures can be taken to avoid unduly low heat carrier supply temperatures and violation of hot water supply quality requirements.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rejection by membrane adsorption has been observed and widely reported. However, little is known about whether membranes possess an adsorption capacity. Experimental data showed that when a hydrophobic polypropylene (PP) microfilter was used to filter a large volume of particle-free surface water containing dissolved natural organic matter (NOM), later batches of microfiltration (MF) permeate caused more flux decline to a fresh 20K-Dalton polyethersulfone (PES) ultrafilter. This suggests that membranes can have an adsorption capacity for foulants. In this research, the gradual increase in absorbance of ultraviolet (UV) light by subsequent batches of MF permeate was observed, and supports the findings from previous studies, that only a small fraction of NOM causes membrane fouling. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and energy dispersive spectroscopy of fouled PP and PES membranes suggests foulants containing amide, aromatic, ether, hydroxyl and silicate functional groups. Silicates appear to participate in membrane fouling, and its removal with the small fraction of fouling NOM can reduce the fouling potential of water. These data improve our understanding of membrane fouling by natural waters, and have implications for the design of membrane plants that filter natural waters.</jats:p>",

This is also a common forest management objective in other regions and countries. Because this economic strategy ignores basic market adjustments, it is likely to fail and to unnecessarily damage forest ecosystems. Application of basic economic principles on how markets operate significantly changes the apparent efficacy of efforts to manage local economies by managing timber supply. The emphasis on timber supply tends to ignore the dominant role that the demand for wood fiber and wood products, rather than wood‐fiber supply, plays in determining levels of harvest and production. Contemporary economics indicates that markets tend to operate to offset reductions in wood‐fiber supply. This significantly moderates the economic cost of reducing commercial timber harvest in the pursuit of environmental objectives. In addition, contemporary economic analysis indicates that the economic links between natural forests and local communities are much broader than simply the flow of commercially valuable logs to manufacturing facilities. At least in the United States, the flow of environmental services from natural forests has increasingly become an amenity that has drawn people and economic activity to forested areas. Attractive site‐specific qualities, including those supported by natural forests, can potentially support local economic development even in the face of reduced timber harvests. These market‐related adjustments partially explain the Northwest Forest Plan's overestimation of the expected regional impacts associated with reduced federal timber supply and the ineffectiveness of the plan's efforts to protect communities by stabilizing federal timber supply.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

The water produced by this artesian source is consistent even in years of drought and is of high quality, both mineralogically and microbiologically. A culture-based analysis using 30 media types and four incubation temperatures demonstrated that several metabolic types were present in the water. 16S rRNA gene fragments amplified from the DNA of pooled cultured cells and from the DNA extracted from 1 L of the source water were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The results indicated that the two DNA samples did not have similar 16S rRNA gene compositions and that several uncultured phyla were present in the community DNA sample. These results indicated that large-scale culturing did not accurately represent the structure planktonic community. 16S rRNA gene sequences from 17 different genera were obtained from the community DNA sample; the most abundant were similar to Rhodoferax, Rhodobacter, and Polaromonas species. Sequences related to the Proteo bacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Firmicutes, and Acidobacterium/Fibrobacter divisions were also detected.Key words: artesian spring, bacterial diversity, DGGE, 16S rRNA, enrichment culture.</jats:p>",

For S. malaysiensis and S. caelestis, the production of MIB and/or geosmin was increased with incubation temperature (20–30 °C) in starch–glutamate broth medium. The optimal MIB, geosmin and biomass occurred at 30 °C.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A demonstration plant consisted of ozone/granular activated carbon (GAC) was operated using sand filtered water as an influent to study the feasibility for introduction of an advanced water treatment. In ozonating the sand filtered water, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) slightly increased at an ozone dose of less than 1.0 mg O3/mg C, and the largest DOC reduction was exhibited at 1.0 mg O3/mg C. As ozone dosage increased from 1.0 to 5.0 mg O3/mg C, DOC decreased no more, whereas UV absorbance at 254 nm gradually decreased with increasing ozone dosage. The hydrophobic fraction in natural organic matter (NOM) was considered as a predominant reactant from the result of a rapid decrease in specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA). Since the specific reaction sites in the NOM molecule for haloform reaction were attacked by ozonation, the disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potentials could be reduced. The hydrophobic fraction decreased from 36.3% to 28.7% by ozonation and then decreased to 24.2% through carbon adsorption. The hydrophilic fraction changed only by 1.0% during ozonation, while it decreased by 28.3% through carbon adsorption. Therefore, ozonation followed by carbon adsorption is an acceptable process for the reduction of latent risk through selective oxidation and adsorption of different NOM fractions.</jats:p>",

From the results of analysis, PLFs and their distribution ratio derived from each category were significantly different. Filtration was the most important performance limiting factor in all DWTPs of five categories, and PLFs in filtration were backwashing velocity, media configuration, bed depth, and formation of mud-ball. The PLFs in coagulation–flocculation process were found to be coagulant dose, mixing intensity, mechanical problems, and others in the order of frequency of occurrence. Also, insufficient disinfection ability, is resulting from insufficient hydraulic detention time, improper chlorine dose and injection point, is the most significant among PLFs in a clear well. In the case of sedimentation, inappropriate baffle structure and excessive upward velocity were PLFs. In addition, the results showed that high turbid water and low alkalinity in rainy season, ferric and manganese ions, and ammonia nitrogen have contributed significantly to the performance of DWTPs.</jats:p>",

Geosmin and MIB were difficult to degrade, with a period in excess of 75 days before greater than 95% removal was achieved. A microcystin-degrading gene was detected in the biofilm from one of the filters, confirming that the biofilm possessed the ability to degrade microcystin. A Sphingomonas sp. was identified as a potential geosmin degrader based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis.

This article presents a model of patient risk related to the process of supplying oxygen at a single university hospital. One of the goals of the article is to illustrate how probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) can be used by hospitals to assess and mitigate risk and, therefore, to meet JCAHO requirements. PRA techniques are useful to 1) model the reliability of a complex system and 2) assess the cost-effectiveness of different risk mitigation measures. The authors focus on the risk estimation step, describing in detail their modeling of the oxygen supply system and analysis of the results. For the hospital that the authors study (20,000 admissions yearly), the total expected number of fatalities from oxygen system failure is 44 over a 30-year time horizon. The greatest contribution to the risk (94% of the expected number of fatalities) comes from problems that involve the supply network (e.g., damage to structure and poisoning) as opposed to incidents that occur inside patient rooms. Although the threat to patient safety is not dramatic, health care organizations should be concerned about potential failures of their oxygen system because improving this system could avoid low-probability, high-consequence failures at a low cost </jats:p>",

Certain aspects of the full-scale system design are particularly noteworthy. Whereas typical immersed membrane systems employ expensive process pumps to create the vacuum necessary to produce filtrate, the CAWW system relies on a simple siphon to produce filtrate. No permeate pumps are required and this dramatically reduces capital and operating cost through simplified design, reduced controls and minimized floor space. The land area needed for membrane filtration and related process equipment is equivalent to obtaining 180 m3/d of capacity per m2 of land area.</jats:p>",

Because western Canada receives heroin from similar source nations, but has not measurably increased enforcement practices or funding levels, we sought to examine trends in Canadian heroin‐related indices before and after the Australian heroin shortage, which began in approximately January 2001.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold> During periods before and after January 2001, we examined the number of fatal overdoses and ambulance responses to heroin‐related overdoses that required the use of naloxone in British Columbia, Canada. As an overall marker of Canadian supply reduction, we also examined the quantity of heroin seized during this period. Lastly, we examined trends in daily heroin use among injection drug users enrolled in the Vancouver Injection Drug Users Study (VIDUS).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> There was a 35% reduction in overdose deaths, from an annual average of 297 deaths during the years 1998–2000 in comparison to an average of 192 deaths during 2001–03. Similarly, use of naloxone declined 45% in the period coinciding with the Australian heroin shortage. Interestingly, the weight of Canadian heroin seized declined 64% coinciding with the Australian heroin shortage, from an average of 184 kg during 1998–2000 to 67 kg on average during 2001–03. Among 1587 VIDUS participants, the period coinciding with the Australian heroin shortage was associated independently with reduced daily injection of heroin [adjusted odds ratio: 0.55 (95% CI: 0.50–0.61); <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001].</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> Massive decreases in three independent markers of heroin use have been observed in western Canada coinciding with the Australian heroin shortage, despite no increases in funding to Canadian enforcement efforts. Markedly reduced Canadian seizure activity also coincided with the Australian heroin shortage. These findings suggest that external global heroin supply forces deserve greater investigation and credence as a potential explanation for the Australian heroin shortage.</jats:p>",

Lean, agile, and leagile strategies are illustrated by modeling their respective applications at a tier‐1 supplier to the Heating, Ventilating, and Air‐Conditioning (HVAC) industry. Simulation analyses indicate that the lean system excels in customer service performance while the leagile system results in lower enterprise‐wide inventory levels under modeled circumstances. Subsequent analysis suggests that trade‐offs exist among the systems in the base case and under varying cost conditions.</jats:p>",

Extracellular organic matter (EOM) produced during the stationary phase and death phase of P. tenue (106 cells/mL) with M-11 culture medium led to significant increase of the AOC concentration, up to 100 times as high as its initial concentration. In case of CT culture medium containing a high DOC component, the AOC concentration did not increase significantly during P. tenue culture. The formation and removal of AOC derived from EOM and intercellular organic matter (IOM) by chlorination were also examined. The AOC concentration after chlorination of EOM and IOM became maximum with 2 mg/L of chlorine dosage while it decreased with increase of chlorine dosage when the dosage was higher than 2 mg/L, suggesting that necessary chlorine dosage to not form AOC is higher than 2 mg/L.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Most of the academic works done on supply chains over the last ten years conclude that it is necessary to take into account the mix between distance and proximity to better understand their evolutions. Logistical space is in fact based on \"radialization\" practices, the hub-and-spokes pattern representing one of its best-known archetypes. For a first-tier supplier involved in a supply network operating in just-in-time, this means being situated along a structuring axis connected to a gathering then dispersal point to another structuring axis on which the recipient assembly plant is located. Here, the notion of spatial proximity disappears to the advantage of a temporal proximity in which high delivery frequencies question neither the supply chain’s productivity nor the economies of scale made by the first-tier supplier (the assembly plant benefits from these economies of scale). This paper proposes some clues in this direction. It particularly underlines the role that logistics service providers might have in the building of organizational proximity inside a \"dispersed\" logistical space.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">La plupart des travaux académiques menés depuis dix ans sur les chaînes logistiques étendues (CLÉ) concluent qu’il est aujourd’hui nécessaire de raisonner simultanément en termes d’éloignement et de proximité pour mieux en comprendre les évolutions. Les espaces logistiques sont en effet fondés sur des modèles de radialisation, dont le schéma hub-and-spokes constitue l’un des archétypes. Il signifie, pour le fournisseur de premier rang impliqué dans un réseau d’approvisionnement fonctionnant en juste-à-temps, une localisation le long d’un axe structurant, lui-même connecté à un point de regroupement, puis d’éclatement vers un autre axe structurant sur lequel se situe l’unité d’assemblage destinataire. La notion de proximité spatiale disparaît ici au profit d’une proximité de délai dans laquelle des fréquences élevées de livraison ne remettent en question ni la productivité de la CLÉ, ni les économies d’échelle réalisées par le fournisseur de premier rang (dont bénéficie l’unité d’assemblage). L’article propose quelques pistes de réflexion dans cette direction. Il souligne notamment le rôle que pourraient tenir les prestataires de services logistiques dans la construction d’une proximité organisationnelle à l’intérieur d’espaces logistiques \" éclatés \".</jats:p>"

For meeting the 10 mg/L nitrate standard, optimal operations for a heterotrophic denitrification pilot plant designed for drinking water treatment was investigated. Ethanol and phosphate were added for bacteria growing on anthracite to convert nitrate to nitrogen gas. Results showed that presence of high dissolved oxygen (around 4 mg/L) in the source water did not have a significantly negative effect on nitrogen removal. When operated under a C/N ratio of 1.88, which was recommended in the literature, nitrate removal efficiency was measured to be around 70%, sometimes up to 90%. However, the reactor often underwent severe clogging problems. When operated under C/N ratio of 1.0, denitrification efficiency decreased significantly to 30%. Finally, when operated under C/N ratio of 1.5, the nitrate content of the influent was almost completely reduced at the first one-third part of the bioreactor with an overall removal efficiency of 89–91%. Another advantage for operating with a C/N ratio of 1.5 is that only one-third of the biosolids was produced compared to a C/N value of 1.88.</jats:p>",

The probabilistic reliability analysis usually fails to address the problems of human error, subjectivity, and lack of system performance history and records. This paper explores the utility of the following fuzzy performance measures for evaluating the performance of a complex water supply system: (i) combined reliability–vulnerability, (ii) robustness, and (iii) resiliency. The regional water supply system for the City of London, Ontario, Canada, is used as the case study. The computational requirements for the implementation of the fuzzy performance measures and their sensitivity to different shapes of fuzzy membership functions are investigated. The study illustrates the capability of the fuzzy performance measures to handle uncertainty and identify critical system components. This can be of value in identifying the optimal level of improvement that will increase the overall system performance.Key words: water supply, fuzzy sets, risk, performance indicators. </jats:p>",

In many cases the health benefits will only be achieved if there is a change in behaviour. A change in behaviour does not only mean change in practical hygiene behaviour by individuals but rather a change in attitude on the part of individuals, communities and the institutions that support them. The RHSP seeks to achieve this through participatory hygiene promotion in over 200 villages, providing supporting institutions with new information and techniques for health promotion, constructing improved public sanitation facilities and training the communities themselves to monitor the water quality and condition of their water supply system. </jats:p>",

The runoff from the faecal pat was collected and different particle size fractions were collected within settling columns by exploiting the size-dependent settling velocities. Particle size and Cryptosporidium concentration distribution at 10 cm below the surface was measured at regular intervals over 24 h. Initially a large proportion of the total volume of particles belonged to the larger size classes (&amp;gt;17 μm). However, throughout the course of the experiment, there was a sequential loss of the larger size classes from the sampling depth and a predominance of smaller particles (&amp;lt;17 μm). The Cryptosporidium concentration at 10 cm depth did not change throughout the experiment. In the second experiment samples were taken from different depths within the settling column. Initially 26% of particles were in the size range 124–492 μm. However, as these large particles settled there was an enrichment at 30 cm after one hour (36.5–49.3%). There was a concomitant enrichment of smaller particles near the surface after 1 h and 24 h. For Pat 1 there was no difference in Cryptosporidium concentration with depth after 1 h and 24 h. In Pat 2 there was a difference in concentration between the surface and 30 cm after 24 h. However, this could be explained by the settling velocity of a single oocyst. The results suggested that oocysts are not associated with large particles, but exist in faecal runoff as single oocysts and hence have a low (0.1 m d−1) settling velocity. The implications of this low settling velocity on Cryptosporidium risk reduction within water supply reservoirs was investigated through the application of a three-dimensional model of oocyst fate and transport to a moderately sized reservoir (26 GL). The model indicated that the role of settling on oocyst concentration reduction within the water column is between one and three orders of magnitude less than that caused by advection and dilution, depending on the strength of hydrodynamic forcing.</jats:p>",

The potentially adverse impact of these chemicals on human health and the ecology of the natural environment are reviewed. Data for the removal of estrogenic compounds from wastewater treatment are presented, together with the comparative potencies of estrogenic compounds. The relative exposure to estrogens of women on oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and through food consumption is estimated.

This information may then be used to inform decisions about appropriate management of the water supply system. Although QMRA has been used to estimate disease burden from water supplies in developed countries, the method has not been evaluated in developing countries where relevant data may be scarce. In this paper, we describe a simplified risk assessment procedure to calculate the disease burden from three reference pathogens – pathogenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum and rotavirus – in water supplies in Kampala, Uganda. The study shows how QMRA can be used in countries with limited data, and that the outcome can provide valuable information for the management of water supplies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many rural water supplies in sub-Saharan Africa demonstrate high operational failure rates, particularly those using handpumps to extract groundwater. The supply of spare parts for pump maintenance is one of the weak links in the quest for sustainability and there are very few examples of sustainable supply chains throughout the subcontinent. There are a number of key reasons for this, which are specific to the rural African context. These include: the separation of the supply of pumps from the supply of associated spares; low pump density resulting in low profits; poverty and immobility among end-users; inflexible approaches to technology choice; and restrictive policies and maintenance systems. Field research in four African countries—Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia—indicated that the supply of handpump spare parts to rural areas is not a viable stand-alone commercial activity, despite many initiatives with this ultimate aim. There is a critical need for realism in the rural water sector and for implementers to move away from the perceived wisdom that the private-sector alone is the solution to the spare parts conundrum. Integrated service provision, appropriate technology choice and, where necessary, non-profit sector options provide a multifaceted solution that must be embraced if present and future rural water services are to be sustained. </jats:p>",

A typical intertidal flat was measured from May 2002 to August 2005 for comparison of bed levels before and after the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). There is a significant decreasing trend in riverine sediment supply since late 1960s, which is attributed mainly to the dam constructions. TGD reduced the sediment load to147 mt/yr in 2004, only 35% of the average. In response to this drastic decrease, the deltaic coast is turning from progradation to recession. We predict that the Yangtze sediment supply will further decrease and coastal erosion will be intensified in the coming decades, which poses a great challenge to coastal management.</jats:p>",

This laboratory experiment demonstrated that the nutrient influx between the sediment and the water column, in both oxic and anoxic environments, contributed substantially to the total nutrient budget and overall recycling of the biologically available nutrients in the reservoir. This study also confirmed that the bottom sediments act as a source of ammonium‐nitrogen (NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N) and filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP), but function as a sink for nitrate‐nitrogen (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N). Extrapolation of the experiment data revealed that the highest nutrient flux was obtained under a summer‐anoxic incubation, with the internal loads of FRP and NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>‐N accounting for ≈ 365% and 338% of their external annual loads, respectively. The internal loss of NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐N from the summer anoxic incubation was ≈ 7% of its external annual load. The temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration were the most important factors influencing the nutrient flux and internal loading. Denitrification was believed to be an eminent route of nitrate loss from the reservoir.</jats:p>",

The system also keeps track on the performance of the system and adjust it when a need arises. In order for the system to be fault tolerant we have to provide redundancies in the system. This is extremely important for systems, such as supply chain networks, whereby agents communicate with each other and a problem in the system can induce a ripple effect, leading to system-wide outage. Along with speed/bandwidth a need arises for this data flow to be consistent and the mechanism to be fault tolerant. The architecture is based on the concept of grid computing, but in this paper we focus mainly on developing a simulation of the process and develop components, which can monitor the simulation along with providing fault tolerance. Monitoring and fault tolerance are related to each other, as we can't provide fault tolerance without monitoring the system. </jats:p>",

Such patterns are usually inferred to result from habitat preference, but the roles of larval supply to the benthos and post‐settlement events are rarely examined for stream populations. We describe a manipulative field experiment that examined larval supply, habitat preference and post‐settlement events simultaneously for two co‐occurring species of hydropsychids.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Ten artificial channels were constructed in a natural riffle to create fast and slow flow habitats and within each channel we placed six artificial substrata whose surfaces had been modified to create three different texture treatments. We measured discharge through channels and monitored hydropsychid colonisation of substrata every 3–4 days. Half of the substrata had all hydropsychids and nets removed every 3–4 days (short‐term colonisation) whereas the remaining half were counted but nets and hydropsychids left attached (long‐term colonisation). Short‐term counts of nets and individuals were summed to allow comparison with long‐term colonisation substrata.</jats:p><jats:p>3. <jats:italic>Smicrophylax</jats:italic> sp. AV2 larvae were more abundant in fast flow channels than slow flow channels, but these differences were proportional to discharge through each of the channels, suggesting that supply of settlers can explain this pattern. <jats:italic>Smicrophylax</jats:italic> larvae were least abundant on smooth substrata, which suggests that this species selects habitats based on surface texture. Alternatively, <jats:italic>Asmicridea</jats:italic> sp. AV1 larvae were only found in fast flow channels and this most likely reflects an active habitat choice by this species, but there was no significant difference between different texture treatments.</jats:p><jats:p>4. There were no differences between summed, short‐ and long‐term counts of recruits for either species, but there were more nets than larvae, especially in slow flow channels, by the end of the experiment, suggesting that larval mortality or re‐dispersal after settlement could be considerable.</jats:p><jats:p>5. Our results indicate that supply, habitat selection at settlement and post‐settlement processes all contributed variously to the distribution of hydropsychid caddisfly larvae, but that each species was affected differentially by these factors. Larval supply and post‐settlement processes are rarely examined by stream researchers and our results demonstrate these factors deserve much more consideration. Calculating accurate larval supply rates to sites is challenging, but we suggest that such detailed information is necessary if we are to sort out what sets limits to distributions and the underlying population structure of stream invertebrate populations.</jats:p>",

Im Bereich der Identifikation und Bewertung von RFID-Einsatzpotenzialen fehlt prozess- und erfahrungsbasiertes Methoden-Know-how Unterstützende Modelle im Sinne von „Kochrezepten“ sind nur bedingt vorhanden. Strategische Aspekte, Riskobewertungen und prozessbezogene Ursache-Wirkung-Zusammenhänge spielen in vorhandenen Modellen nur eine Nebenrolle. Diese Tatsache führt dazu, dass Defizite im Prozessablauf auch mit dem Einsatz von RFID bestehen bleiben und die erwarteten Effekte nicht eintreten.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Carbon (C) dynamics and forest management have become integrated in recent years, largely due to the Kyoto Protocol stipulating that forest C changes may be accountable in an emissions framework. A C stock modeling framework for forest managers is introduced in this paper. Empirical growth and yield models are used to develop sustainable timber supply for forest companies. These models use linear programming to solve the complex mathematical problem of timing and allocation of forest harvest and silviculture interventions. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of “business as usual”forest management versus management objectives to maximize C sequestration. Goal programming was used to minimize the deviation of two goals for C forest management: maximizing C in the forest, and maximizing the return on investment (net present value of forest timber products). Species-specific wood-to-C content conversion factors were used to parameterize the amount of C in forest stands on Canadian Forces Base Gagetown forest lands in New Brunswick, Canada. Goal programming reduced the loss of revenue associated with increasing C stocks in the forest. Partial harvesting and high valued end-products tended to increase C stocks and provided a higher return on investment in the simulations. Key words: Carbon stock modeling framework, forest, goal programming, partial harvesting, timber supply </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n          <jats:p>\n            Bacterial community dynamics of a whole drinking water supply system (DWSS) were studied from source to tap. Raw water for this DWSS is provided by two reservoirs with different water characteristics in the Harz mountains of Northern Germany. Samples were taken after different steps of treatment of raw water (i.e., flocculation, sand filtration, and chlorination) and at different points along the supply system to the tap. RNA and DNA were extracted from the sampled water. The 16S rRNA or its genes were partially amplified by reverse transcription-PCR or PCR and analyzed by single-strand conformation polymorphism community fingerprints. The bacterial community structures of the raw water samples from the two reservoirs were very different, but no major changes of these structures occurred after flocculation and sand filtration. Chlorination of the processed raw water strongly affected bacterial community structure, as reflected by the RNA-based fingerprints. This effect was less pronounced for the DNA-based fingerprints. After chlorination, the bacterial community remained rather constant from the storage containers to the tap. Furthermore, the community structure of the tap water did not change substantially for several months. Community composition was assessed by sequencing of abundant bands and phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained. The taxonomic compositions of the bacterial communities from both reservoirs were very different at the species level due to their different limnologies. On the other hand, major taxonomic groups, well known to occur in freshwater, such as\n            <jats:italic>Alphaproteobacteria</jats:italic>\n            ,\n            <jats:italic>Betaproteobacteria</jats:italic>\n            , and\n            <jats:italic>Bacteroidetes</jats:italic>\n            , were found in both reservoirs. Significant differences in the detection of the major groups were observed between DNA-based and RNA-based fingerprints irrespective of the reservoir. Chlorination of the drinking water seemed to promote growth of nitrifying bacteria. Detailed analysis of the community dynamics of the whole DWSS revealed a significant influence of both source waters on the overall composition of the drinking water microflora and demonstrated the relevance of the raw water microflora for the drinking water microflora provided to the end user.\n          </jats:p>",
