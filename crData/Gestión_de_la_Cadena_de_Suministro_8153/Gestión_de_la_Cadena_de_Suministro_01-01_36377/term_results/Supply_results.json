      "abstract": "<jats:p>Between 1994 and 1998, the total inland (freshwater) aquaculture production in Israel rose 6.5% from 15,681 to 16,700 tons. This positive trend, however, reversed in 1999, as a consequence of an outburst of a new viral disease that killed 1500 tons of common carp and large quantities of orna- mental cyprinids. During the same period (1994-9), marine aquaculture production grew 688% from 350 to 2408 tons. In the future, this trend may be inhibited by environmental regulations. Because of the expected demographic growth, the local demand for edible fish will grow 16.5% from 64,910 tons in 1999 to 75,600 tons by 2005. To meet this demand, the combined supply from imports and local production will have to grow at 2.58% per year. Anything short of that will boost prices and possibly deter consumers from buying fish. In spite of industry efforts, production of local fisheries and aquaculture has not exceeded 6000 and 19,000 tons, respectively. Fish imports aver- age 63.7% of the national consumption. Most of the imports originate in marine fisheries. According to the FAO, supply from global fisheries is expected to lag behind global demand, causing prices to rise. Long-term efforts by Israeli farmers and the government to adopt aquafarms have enabled inland aquaculture to cope with increasing restrictions on water use for agriculture and maintain a slight growth in production during the last decade. If financially backed by the government, aqua-farms are expected to develop intensive closed water culture systems that will eventually enhance production in spite of the scarcity of water.</jats:p>"

The structure of the NOM and its involvement in water treatment processes requires better understanding. It seems likely that a better understanding of NOM reactions could lead to far better predictive capacity for water treatment designers and operators. Certainly the removal of NOM as a first step to the production of drinking water has many attractions. This paper provides an overview of work done by the author and many of his colleagues to advance this issue.</jats:p>",

The lack of a widely accepted definition for supply chain management and the complexity associated with overlapping supply chains make the development of supply chain metrics difficult. Despite these problems, managers continue to pursue supply chain metrics as a means to increase their “line of sight” over areas they do not directly control, but have a direct impact on their company's performance. We provide a framework for developing supply chain metrics that translates performance into shareholder value. The framework focuses on managing the interfacing customer relationship management and supplier relationship management processes at each link in the supply chain. The translation of process improvements into supplier and customer profitability provides a method for developing metrics that identify opportunities for improved profitability and align objectives across all of the firms in the supply chain.</jats:p>",

However, how many organizations in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industries really understand the components of such strategies and their power when properly deployed? Supply chain management, lean thinking, agile operations, quick response, virtual organization, time‐based competition to name but a few, currently receive extensive coverage in management literature. But, what core competencies, management activities, resources and technologies comprise an effective operational strategy in a retail logistics context? From empirical research, we demonstrate that the various elements forming an operational strategy are often part of a distinct implementation pattern that can be customized at the level of individual product and/or customer behavior and replicates the complexity of the setting. The research aims to help management better understand demand and tailor a number of operational strategies to the behavior of that demand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nThe supply of and demand for nitrogen by whole industries and individual crops\nis discussed in relation to changes in farming systems, particularly the\nrelative importance of fertiliser and biologically fixed nitrogen. The use of\nfertiliser nitrogen (N) in Australia has grown at an annual rate of 14%\nsince the early 1990s, after growing at half that rate since the 1950s. The\naccelerated growth occurred during a period when world demand has been almost\nconstant. Most of the additional demand has been for the dryland cereal and\ncanola industries of southern Australia, where crops previously obtained\nalmost all their N from mineralisation of soil organic matter and the residues\nof legume pastures. The most likely reasons for the belated increase in use of\nfertiliser N in Australia are to replace the supply from pasture residues as\nthe area of pasture decreased and to satisfy the increased demand of cereals\nfollowing break crops and of the break crops themselves, particularly canola.\nFor a dryland cereal, there is a problem of matching soil N supply with an\nunpredictable N demand. For winter cereals in Australia, crop N demand is\npoorly synchronised with soil N supply. The time of greatest demand is\nnormally during the stem-elongation phase when the crop is growing fastest.\nFor crops targeted for high-protein grain, there is an even greater demand\naround the flowering phase. The peak N demand for well-managed crops growing\nwith no water limitations exceeds the capacity of the soil to supply N from\nmineralisation at the time, so additional N is required to meet the shortfall,\neither from fertiliser or mineral N retained in the soil from earlier\nmineralisation. Predicting the optimum supply of fertiliser N at sowing is\ndifficult in cases where N demand is influenced by variable rainfall.\nTopdressing and banding fertiliser offer prospects for more closely matching N\nsupply and demand for dryland crops. The future role of legumes in supplying\nresidual N is discussed in relation to the trend towards continuous cropping.\n</jats:p>"

Increasing demands are being made upon the national blood supply as rates of blood donation are declining, in part because of the loss of blood donors as a result of enhanced screening and testing procedures. Iron-related means of expanding the blood supply include the use of blood from individuals undergoing therapeutic phlebotomy for hereditary hemochromatosis and enhancing the retention and commitment of women of childbearing age as donors by using iron supplementation to prevent iron deficiency.</jats:p><jats:p>In Section I, Dr. Klein discuss the circumstances responsible for a decline in the population of eligible donors, including public attitudes toward donation, factors influencing the retention of donors by blood centers, and the effects of increased screening and testing to maintain the safety of the blood supply.</jats:p><jats:p>In Section II, Drs. Kushner and Ajioka focus on the consequences of the decision by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to develop recommendations to permit blood centers to collect blood from patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and to distribute this blood obtained without disease labeling if all other screening and testing procedures are passed. After summarizing the pathophysiology of hereditary hemochromatosis, the use by blood centers of blood obtained from heterozygotes and homozygotes for hereditary hemochromatosis is considered.</jats:p><jats:p>In Section III, Dr. Brittenham reviews the use of low dose, short-term carbonyl iron supplementation for women donors of childbearing age. Replacing the iron lost at donation can help prevent iron deficiency in women of childbearing age and, by decreasing deferral, enhance the retention and commitment of women who give blood regularly. He emphasizes the use by blood centers of iron-related means to enhance recruitment and retention of blood donors.</jats:p>",

Based on the assumption that these soil stresses increase endogenous ethylene production in plants, changes indicating higher construction costs for roots, such as decreased specific root length, were expected. The hypothesis was found to be only partly correct. Most morphological changes of barley roots were probably a reaction to increased soil mechanical impedance. Examples of this are root width, which was increased by compaction apart from in wet soil, as well as increased width and specific volume, and a decreased specific length of roots in the deepest layer of well-aerated loose soil. However, in loose moist soil hypoxia prevented root growth, but did not change root morphology. The results suggest that severe hypoxia lessens the possibilities of roots to adapt to the hypoxic soil by reducing root growth and by preventing the formation of aerenchyma. ;</jats:p>"

The nitrogen treatments imposed were 0, 40 and 80 kg\nN/ha.year supplied in 4 equal applications (2 pre-flowering — late\nSeptember and mid-October; 1 post-flowering — mid-November; 1\npost-harvest — late February) Yields of dried vine fruit were responsive\nto both nitrogen supply and rootstock. Despite lower bud fertility, Sultana on\nRamsey rootstock out-yielded Sultana on own roots due to greater numbers of\n1-year-old canes suitable as bearers, more berries per bunch and larger\nberries. Yield of Sultana on own roots responded in a similar manner to\nincreasing nitrogen supply as yield of Sultana on Ramsey rootstock. Yield\nincreases were due to improved bearing potential (more suitable bearers) and\nmore berries per bunch when nitrogen supply increased from 0 to 40 kg\nN/ha.year. When nitrogen supply was raised from 40 to 80 kg N/ha.year,\na further yield increase was due to enhanced bud fertility and larger berries.\nThese yield components behaved differently for Sultana on own roots compared\nwith Sultana on Ramsey rootstock, but, overall, balanced out such that final\nyield was not affected by rootstock. Consequently, rootstock was not a\nsignificant factor in the dried vine fruit yield response of Sultana to\nnitrogen supply.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper focuses on the connection between product complexity and vertical integration using original empirical evidence from the auto industry. A rich literature has addressed the choice between internal production and external sourcing of components in the auto industry. More recent literature has developed the concept of product architecture as another choice variable that may be one of the important contributors to product complexity. In this paper, we connect these two important decisions and study them jointly. We use the property rights approach to argue that complexity in product design and vertical integration of production are complements: that in-house production is more attractive when product complexity is high, as firms seek to capture the benefits of their investment in the skills needed to coordinate development of complex designs. We test this hypothesis with a simultaneous equations model applied to data from the luxury-performance segment of the auto industry. We find a significant and positive relationship between product complexity and vertical integration. This has implications for optimal incentive structures within firms, as well as for interpreting firm performance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept and philosophy behind supply chain management is to integrate and optimize business processes across all partners in the entire production chain. Since these are not simple supply chains but rather complex networks, tuning these complex networks comprising supply chain/s to the needs of the market can be facilitated by data mining. Data mining is a set of techniques used to uncover previously obscure or unknown patterns and relationships in very large databases. It provides better information for achieving competitive advantage, increases operating efficiency, reduces operating costs and provides flexibility in using the data by allowing the users to pull the data they need instead of letting the system push the data. However, making sense of all this data is an enormous technological and logistical challenge. This chapter helps you understand the key concepts of data mining, its methodology and application in the context of supply chain management of complex networks.</jats:p>"

The use of new biological conversion methods and the application of compact operation technology, however, does allow us to save operation and investment costs. Currently, the focus of scientific interest is on deammonification, that is the direct conversion of ammonia into elementary nitrogen by autotrophic micro-organisms, because in contrast to conventional nitrification/denitrification this method requires considerably smaller amounts not only of carbon, but also of oxygen. Moreover, the use of compact biofilm technology makes it possible to considerably reduce the reaction tank volume. In the following we will present the operation results of both industrial plants and laboratory-scale units for the treatment of wastewater with high nitrogen loads, results which unequivocally show the favourable cost-effectiveness of the mentioned method combination and thus the economic viability inherent in the purposeful industrial utilisation of this technology.</jats:p>",

We model the contracting relationship between a supplier and a buyer. The supplier is privately informed about the outcome of his design/production investment. The buyer both appraises the supplier's component and does further processing/component production of his own. If the final product produced by the buyer exhibits decoupling and no function sharing with respect to the components (termed separable architecture), the first-best outcome is attained if both internal and external failures are contractible. When only one type of failure can be contracted on, we derive conditions under which contracting on internal failure is superior to contracting on external failure, and vice versa. If the buyer's final product has a nonseparable architecture with respect to the components, first-best cannot be achieved even if both internal and external failures are contractible. The value of contracting on internal failure alone is unaffected by the architecture design, while that of external failure declines relative to the separable setting; the net result is often to make the former the uniformly dominant performance metric. Our results highlight the interaction between the performance metrics used for contracting within the supply chain, the architecture of the product produced by the supply chain, and the incentive efficiency of the chain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Markets for Australian beef throughout the 20th century have been moulded by world wars, economic depressions, droughts, transport technology, cattle breeding, trade barriers, global competition, livestock disease eradication, human health risks, food safety, Australian Government policy, consumerism and beef quality. Major ‘shocks’ to beef marketing include the development of successful shipments of chilled carcases to Britain in the 1930s, the widespread trade disruption caused by World War II, expansion (early 1950s) and then a reduction in beef exports to Britain (1956), the introduction and then proliferation of Bos indicus derived cattle in northern Australia (1960s), licensing and upgrading of Australian abattoirs to export to USA and the consequential brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign leading to record export tonnages of Australian processing beef to USA (1960–70). In 1980, increased beef trade to Japan began, leading in the late 1980s to expansion of high-quality grain finished products into that market. By 1993, beef exports to Japan (280.5 kt) exceeded those to USA (274.4 kt), signalling the significant shift in beef exports to Asia. Commencing in about 1986, the USA recognised the value of beef exports to Asian markets pioneered by Australia. Australia’s share of the Japanese and South Korean markets has been under intense competition since that time. Another major influence on Australia’s beef market in the early 1990s was growth in live cattle exports to Asian markets in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Live exports accounted for 152000 heads in 1992 and 858000 heads in 1996. Improved management systems (e.g. fences) and consequent regulation of cattle supply even in the wet season, a by-product of the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign, were indirect drivers of the growth in live exports. Throughout the period 1940–2000, domestic consumption of beef and veal declined from 68 to 33.3 kg/head.year, reflecting competition from other foods, perceptions of health risks, price of beef, periodic food safety scares, vegetarianism, changes in lifestyle and eating habits and lack of consistency of eating quality of beef. Despite this decline, the domestic Australian beef market still consumes a significant component (37%) of total Australian beef production. In 1984–85, the reform of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation set in train a major directional change (‘New Direction’) of the beef sector in response to beef market trends. Under Dick Austen’s leadership, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation changed the industry’s culture from being ‘production-driven’ to being ‘consumer-driven’. Market research began in Australia, Japan and Korea to establish consumer preferences and attitudes to price, beef appearance and eating quality. Definite consumer requirements were identified under headings of consistency and reliability. The AusMeat carcass descriptors were introduced and a decade later traits like tenderness, meat colour, fat colour, meat texture, taste, smell, and muscle size were addressed. These historical ‘shocks’ that shaped the Australian beef markets have all been accompanied by modification to production systems, breeding programs, herd structure, processing procedures, advertising and promotion, meat retailing and end-use. The increasing importance of the food service sector and the ‘Asian merge’ influence on beef cuts usage in restaurant meals and take-away products are the most recognisable changes in the Australian food landscape. The Cooperative Research Centre¿s research portfolio was built around the changing forces influencing beef markets in the early 1990s. Australia needed to better understand the genetic and non-genetic factors affecting beef quality. One example was the poor success rate of cattle being grain-fed for the Japanese premium markets. Another was the relative contribution of pre- and post-slaughter factors to ultimate eating quality of beef. The Meat Standards Australia scheme was launched in 1997 to address this problem in more detail. The Cooperative Research Centre contributed significantly to this initiative. In the year 2001, Australia, with only 2.5% of world cattle numbers retains the position of world number one beef trader. We trade to 110 countries worldwide. The Australian beef sector is worth A$6 billion annually. The diversity of Australian environments, cattle genotypes and production systems provides us with the ability to meet diverse specifications for beef products. A new set of market forces is now emerging. Strict accreditation rules apply to Australian producers seeking access to the lucrative European Union market. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies like bovine spongiform encephalopathy and scrapie are a continuing food safety concern in Europe. This and the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Britain early in 2001 have potentially significant indirect effects on markets for Australian beef. And the sleeping giant, foot and mouth disease-free status of Latin American countries Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina continues to emerge as a major threat to Australian beef markets in Canada and Taiwan. As in the past, science and technology will play a significant role in Australia¿s response to these market forces.</jats:p>"

A pilot-scale constructed wetlands (ERRCW) system containing a free surface flow wetland (FSF) followed by a subsurface flow wetland (SSF) was set up to treat the polluted river water. The system was designed to include solids removal. A removal efficiency of suspended solids (SS) in the ERRCW system that was greater than in a control system indicates that the existence of macrophytes in wetlands could enhance solids removal. The results of this study also showed that SS were removed mainly through the SSF in the ERRCW system. The poor removal of SS, or even an increase in SS, that occurred in the FSF was found to be caused by the growth of algae. Although the macrophytes reduced the penetration of sunlight into the water in the FSF portion of the ERRCW system, the residue of nutrients in water and a low flushing rate still induced the growth of algae on some open water surfaces. From this study, it may be concluded that the roles played by macrophytes in solids removal include providing barriers for filtration, reducing sunlight penetration, supplying oxygen to enhance biodegradation of organic solids, and absorbing nutrients to limit the growth of algae.</jats:p>",

The Upper Deschutes Basin is in one of Oregon’s fastest growing regions, and the increasing population is straining regional water resources. Surface water is fully allocated and increased groundwater use will require careful management to offset seasonal or long-term declines in aquifers or the depletion of stream flow. While altered temperature and precipitation accompanying global change are both concerns, the watershed is more sensitive to changes in precipitation than in temperature. Watershed climate simulation reveals a 25 percent increase in mean monthly runoff, and extremely high monthly runoff is four times more frequent. These changes indicate an increased risk of winter floods, greater spring and summer runoff, and a shift in the occurrence of the minimum runoff month to earlier in the year. Increased potential evapotranspiration, a decrease in the amount of precipitation stored as snow, and changes in the amount and timing of runoff will constrain water development options for humans, agriculture, and regional fisheries. Water restrictions will magnify water-use conflicts in the watershed and increase the risk of regional economic discord.\n\t</jats:p>"

The enticement is a discounted price for the product. The market consists of several segments with different degrees of aversion to delays. The firm offers a price schedule under which the customers each self-select the price they pay and when their orders are to be shipped. When a customer agrees to wait, the firm gains advanced demand information that can be used to reduce its supply chain costs. This article shows how an optimal pricing-replenishment strategy that balances the costs due to discounted prices and the benefits due to advanced demand information can be determined. </jats:p>",

The removal efficiency of ammonium ion from a solution containing ammonium ion which is not complexed is varying in the range of 5–60%. On the contrary, ammonium ion forms complexes with other ions in water and wastewater removal efficiency was as high as 99% for the synthetic solution which contained a complex of iron and ammonium ion. Elmali reservoir which is one of the water sources of the Istanbul city is suffering from high ammonia content due to discharges of untreated wastewater. Application of the BW membrane to Elmali Reservoir water resulted in ammonia removal efficiency of about 95%. The permeate ammonia concentration of 0.2 mg/l was achieved. High removal ratio of ammonia ions in complex form is due to increased molecular diameters of the ammonium ion complexes. Increased pH values were observed in parallel to increase the ammonium ion concentrations when ammonium ion was not in complex form. Ammonium ion removal efficiency decreased with increasing pH. On the other hand, when the concentration of ammonium ion complexed with iron was increased, pH value was decreased. In parallel to the decreasing pH, an increase of removal efficiency was observed. Membrane types did not significantly affect the flux. No fouling problems were observed during the test runs and thus fluxes were practically constant throughout the experimental run. The total estimated cost of treatment will be in the range of $0.95 to $1.06/m3 for the investigated drinking water source.</jats:p>",

It was indicated that permanganate preoxidation enhanced both the processes of coagulation and filtration of selected surface waters, River Songhua water, Qitaihe Reservoir water and Ba Reservoir water. Permanganate preoxidation is especially effective for enhancing the coagulation of very stable surface waters with relatively high organic content. Experimental results showed that the manganese dioxide produced in situ during permanganate preoxidation played an important role in enhancing the coagulation and filtration processes. The experimental results suggested that manganese dioxide may adsorb naturally occurring organic materials through surface bonding to form bigger particulates, thus increasing the floc density and improving the removal of organic particulates and possibly the inorganic fine particles. Manganese dioxide was shown to adsorb humic acid and enhance its removal by filtration.</jats:p>",

The experimental results from these three different approaches could be explained in terms of changes in mode of particle associations which in turn could be characterized in terms of a micromechanical force model which predicts the effect of solution chemistry on the interaction force between adjacent particle surfaces. Understanding the relationship between solution and surface chemistry on the structure, mechanical strength and mechanism of erosion of cohesive sediment deposits is an important step towards developing predictive models of a number of processes including erosion of cohesive sediments in streams and estuaries, and detachment of particles from granular media during filtration and filter backwashing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The last decade of the 20<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>century has seen unprecedented change within the UK dairy industry, with consolidated of production quotas, payment schemes based on milk solids, deregulation of the milk market with the demise of the Milk Marketing Board and more recently a major downward pressure on milk prices. All of these have contributed to further intensification of a large part of the industry. However the largest change has been the introduction of improved genetics, with the accompanying increase in Holsteins (now the preferred breed) at the expense of Friesians. As a consequence individual cow yields have increased dramatically and such cows are becoming an increasing problem in respect of nutritional management, as it relates to optimisation of milk solids content and yield and maintenance of reproductive competence. This paper has attempted to examine some of these issues by first describing the changes in more detail and then from a theoretical consideration of the biochemical principles associated with milk solids production to provide information which may permit better decisions to be made in relation to the feeding of such cows. In this respect the importance of glucose is established as well as the potentially competing processes of energy use for body maintenance or milk fat synthesis. Two experimental studies from this laboratory with high genetic merit cows are used to illustrate how the overall utilisation of energy for lactation and body tissue metabolism may be affected, especially when energy intake in early lactation fails to meet whole body energy demands. Subsequently, the nutrient costs of pregnancy, an important but often forgotten part of the ‘annual’ life cycle of dairy cows, are also considered and it is concluded that increased emphasis needs to be put on the management of cows for lifetime performance rather than simply for lactational output. Finally, whilst recognising that high yielding cows represent a major challenge to all management systems, the paper concludes that existing feeding systems which rely solely on nutritional entities such as metabolisable energy will need to be abandoned in favour of those which recognise specific nutrients, if the full potential of high genetic merit cows is ever to be achieved</jats:p>"

The manufacturer, via the use of financial levers at her disposal, wishes to coordinate this decentralized chain while making a profit. We model the physical scenario as one of constant displayed inventory level (on which demand rate depends positively) and continuous replenishment. With a single retailer, we show that to coordinate the channel and make a profit the manufacturer needs to augment the wholesale price lever by another-an inventory holding costs subsidy offered to the retailer. When multiple retailers compete in that product's market, there are two ways to envision and model the demand and market split. One assumes that market demand depends on aggregate inventory displayed, and then splits according to individual display levels. The other “assigns” customers to retailers according to their display levels, and then assumes that purchases are a function of the display level at the retailer selected. We characterize retailers' Nash equilibria in these models, and we explore whether the manufacturer can coordinate such channels. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Thames Water treats approximately 2800MI/d of water originating mainly from the lowland rivers Thames and Lee for supply to over 7.3 million customers, principally in the cities of London and Oxford. Most of the river water sources are stored in bank-side, pumped, storage reservoirs prior to treatment for potable use. Storage reservoir sizes vary and typical theoretical retention times lie between a few days to several weeks or months. During storage the riverine biota is largely replaced by lacustrine taxa which can cause problems for subsequent water treatment, particularly filtration. Recent concerns about cyanobacterial toxins has heightened interest in reservoir management. This paper reviews aspects of Thames Water's research, design and operating experiences of managing eutrophic, algal rich, reservoir stored, lowland water. Areas covered include experiences of optimising reservoir water quality to both control algal productivity and to aid subsequent potable water treatment. Traditional reservoir management techniques are reviewed as is research into biomanipulation. Whilst changes in reservoir water quality using these techniques have been marked, actual retention time and quality changes have traditionally been difficult to predict. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling has been used successfully to substantially increase retention and subsequent changes to water quality. Information from CFD modelling may also be used to reduce risks from protozoan parasites such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia.</jats:p>",

We consider what can be learnt from these data concerning the energy release and transport mechanisms driving the evaporation, including thermal conduction and fast particles.

The application to treatment of anionic and cationic pollutants (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl–, SO42–, NO3–) has been investigated as a function of transmembrane pressure and recovery rate under very low pressure range (3, 4, 5, and 6 bars). Flux value increased with increasing pressure and the membrane type of TFC-S gave the highest fluxes. The rejections of ions were increased with transmembrane pressure for two types of membranes. TFC-HR membrane rejection performance was better than the TFC-S membrane for all anionic and cationic pollutants. As recovery rate rises, the rejections were decreased.</jats:p>",

Analyses of countermeasures on the supply and demand side suggest that the conventional wisdom of ‘opening up new sources and economising on the use of resources’ may not be an optimal way to deal with water scarcity in the region. Importing water in the form of grain should be taken as an additional measure. This ‘virtual water import’ option needs to be incorporated into the current regional and national agricultural development strategy in which crop structural adjustment is at the core. </jats:p>",

Invertebrate food supply\ndisplayed high month to month predictability and no marked seasonal cycle\ncorrelated with temperature. Analysis of faeces indicated that\nP. macdonnellensis is a generalist insectivore. There\nwas some discrepancy between the pattern revealed by invertebrate sampling and\nthe prey types taken but it was concluded that the invertebrates sampled\nbroadly reflected those available to P. macdonnellensis.\nIndividual females reproduced only once per year; the estimated time of mating\nwas in July–August, and births occurred in September–October. The\nmaximum litter size was six and nearly all females in each season produced a\nfull complement of young. Some males survived and showed spermatorrhea in two\nbreeding seasons and some females survived and produced young in up to three.\nThe seasonal pattern of invertebrate food supply at the study site appeared to\nbe more dependable than that found in studies carried out in arid plains\nhabitats. The difference may result from a microtopographical amelioration in\nthe rocky habitat of the effects of extreme weather conditions that in open,\narid habitats are believed to produce increased short-term unpredictability\nand pronounced, temperature-driven seasonality in food supply. The\nameliorating effect may also increase longevity in\nP. macdonnellensis by reducing density-independent\nmortality.\nThe monoestrous highly seasonal reproductive strategy in\nP. macdonnellensis differs from that displayed by most\nspecies that inhabit arid plains habitats (the latter are polyoestrous with an\nextended breeding season). The shortterm predictability in food supply\ntogether with a high longevity in P. macdonnellensis may\naccount for its reproductive strategy. The results of this study provide\nsupport for the notion that habitat-specific selective pressures in arid\nenvironments may favour divergent ecological strategies in functionally\nsimilar species.</jats:p>"

Indeed, the Japanese approach to supply chain management is now worldwide “best practice” in the automobile industry and in other strategic industrial sectors (Mitchener and Steinmetz, 1998). Close and long-term relations; high trust and mutual disclosure of information; and cospecialized investment in knowledge and other assets together comprise a supply management regime that has been much admired and copied (Womack, Jones, and Roos, 1990). In its ideal form, the Japanese model averts the Scylla of low-trust contracting and the Charybdis of full vertical integration under a corporate chain of command. Outcomes include: more and earlier supplier participation in customer designs; higher quality components; higher reliability of deliveries; and so on.</jats:p>",

A split-root nutrient solution experiment was\nset up to compare the root growth response of 2 lupin species,\nLupinus angustifolius L. (dominant tap root and primary\nlateral system) and L. pilosus Murr. (minor tap root and\nwell-developed lateral root system), to differentially supplied nitrate. These\n2 species represent the extremes of the root morphology types present across\nthe lupin germplasm.\nNutrient solution containing low (250 M) or high (750 M) nitrate was supplied\neither uniformly, or split (high and low) between the upper and lower root\nsystem. The average growth rate and total root length of\nL. pilosus was 1.7 times that of\nL. angustifolius. For both species, the increased\nproliferation of roots in a high nitrate zone was accompanied by a decrease in\nroot growth in the low nitrate zone, giving approximately the same total\ngrowth as the uniform low nitrate treatment. This correlative growth rate\nresponse was 15% larger for the first-order branches of\nL. pilosus than L. angustifolius.\nWhile few second-order branches grew for\nL. angustifolius, the second-order laterals of\nL. pilosus showed a 2-fold correlative root growth and\nbranching response to the split treatments, with no difference in growth\nbetween the uniform high and low nitrate treatments. The second-order laterals\nthus proliferated in response to the differential supply of nitrate and not\nthe absolute concentration. While the growth rate and branching of the\nsecond-order laterals of L. pilosus exhibited a typical\ncorrelative response, first-order branching was inhibited in all split\ntreatments, regardless of whether the roots were in the high or low nitrate\nzone. This response was not seen in L. angustifolius.\nThe difference in the root growth response of the 2 root system types to\ndifferentially supplied nitrate suggests a potential in the lupin germplasm\nfor developing a line capable of greater nitrate capture from the soil\nprofile.\n</jats:p>"

Ion exchange column tests using both fixed and fluidised bed were initially carried out with synthetic water composed of NH4Cl. Breakthrough curves as a function of flow rate, particle size, and initial ammonia concentration reveal that sepiolite does not have as high ion exchange capacity as clinoptilolite but maintains a steady adsorption up to higher bed volumes. The adsorption capacity was modified by using regeneration cycles at both acidic and alkaline pH. Furthermore, fluidised bed runs with clinoptilolite utilising water and air as fluidiser resulted in inferior results compared to those of fixed bed runs. This was respectively ascribed to the presence of ammonia in the circulating water and competition of exchangeable ions released in water and the ability of air to adsorb nitrogen. Tests conducted with natural raw water contaminated with sewage indicated that clinoptilolite adsorbs ammonia the same as the synthetic water. Regenerated clinoptilolite is capable of removing ammonia from both synthetic and actual raw water at a much higher rate than the untreated clinoptilolite.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Internet has changed the way in which supply chains are managed, planned and controlled. The information, decisions, and processes that form supply chain management are moving towards the web, and are breaking old paradigms of inter-organizational boundaries. While it is true this is not the whole story without proper integration of technology and people, much time and capital can be wasted. Businesses that want to succeed in this new e-commerce environment need to enhance communications and build trust among their channel partners. The aim of this paper is to explore insights on the importance of trust among channel partners in web-enabled supply chain management activities. Trust dimensions were examined in four organizations using an in-depth case study approach in the data communications and telecommunications industry. The findings indicate that the type and complexity of e-commerce applications (I OS) and channel partner relationships can affect trust. Overall, the findings contribute to the importance of channel partner trust in web-enabled supply chain management. </jats:p>",

The morphologies and positions of the summit calderas of these volcanoes, specifically the overlapping relationships between the calderas, are evidence that multiple magma reservoirs existed within them, centered on distinctly different locations at various times. The requirement that the magma in an older reservoir must have cooled below its solidus temperature in order to change the local stresses in such a way that a new reservoir grew at a different location argues for long time gaps (probably tens of Myr) during which the supply rate of magma from the mantle was much smaller than at other times. Conversely, the need to offset conductive cooling to the surface once an active magma reservoir was established implies that the magma supply rate was large, ∼1–10 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, for times of order 0.1 Myr. An initial pulse involving rates of more than 150 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> acting for at least a few weeks was needed to initiate each new reservoir. The lengths of numerous long lava flows on the flanks of the Tharsis Montes imply that lava must have been erupted at rates of ∼100–300 m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for periods of a few years to a few tens of years. The volumes of many of these flows exceed the amounts of magma that could be released from overpressured magma reservoirs of the sizes implied by the dimensions of the summit calderas with the surrounding rocks behaving elastically. A maintained high magma supply rate from the mantle (leading to buffered eruption conditions) is almost certainly required for such flows, whereas inelastic caldera collapse events (unbuffered eruption conditions) can explain the emplacement of other flows. Taken together, the various lines of evidence suggest that the Tharsis volcanoes were built episodically with active phases lasting less than 1 Myr alternating with ∼100 Myr quiet phases. We comment on the implications of these issues for the episodicity of the generation of magma in the mantle and for the mode of transport of the magma in dikes or diapirs.</jats:p>",

Is it more important to link with suppliers, customers, or both? Similarly, we know little about the connections between supplier and customer integration and improved operations performance. This paper investigated supplier and customer integration strategies in a global sample of 322 manufacturers. Scales were developed for measuring supply chain integration and five different strategies were identified in the sample. Each of these strategies is characterized by a different “arc of integration”, representing the direction (towards suppliers and/or customers) and degree of integration activity. There was consistent evidence that the widest degree of arc of integration with both suppliers and customers had the strongest association with performance improvement. The implications for our findings on future research and practice in the new millennium are considered.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In summer, remobilised nitrogen comprised approximately\n40% of the total nitrogen in leaves and stems for trees in all\ntreatments. Nitrogen uptake for trees in the HN and MN treatments continued\nduring the winter dormant period, and accounted for approximately half the\ntotal nitrogen acquired during the first cycle. Storage of nitrogen in roots\n(a deciduous characteristic), and the independence of nitrogen remobilisation\nfrom leaf senescence and significant winter uptake of nitrogen (both evergreen\ncharacteristics), suggest that the leaf phenology of\nN. fusca allows the species to maximise nitrogen\nacquisition from low fertility soils to enhance productivity.\n</jats:p>"

We used a spatially\nexplicit individual-based model, to investigate the effects of (i)\nspatio-temporal variation in postlarval supply and (ii) changes in the spatial\nstructure of the nursery habitat on lobster recruitment to the Florida Keys,\nFlorida (USA). By simulating eight different regional scenarios describing\npostlarval supply, we investigated whether differences in the spatio-temporal\ndelivery of postlarvae to the Florida Keys alters recruitment of subadult\nlobsters. Our results indicate that random geographical variation in\npostlarval supply yields the highest predicted recruitment, whereas\npersistently patchy settlement yields the lowest. Field observations of\npostlarval supply suggest that the random model is the most realistic. In\nseparate simulations, we determined the sensitivity of the model to changes in\nthe geographic arrangement of nursery habitat and the spatial resolution of\nhabitat structure. The most spatially explicit depictions of habitat structure\nyielded small, but marginally significant differences in lobster recruitment\nas compared with more generalized spatial scenarios. These differences may\nwell be magnified when more detailed depictions of postlarval settlement are\nimplemented in the model.</jats:p>"

Particular attention was paid to the removal of disinfectant by-product precursors, organics and micropollutants that could be achieved using the various types of treatment. Reductions of up to 50% trihalomethane formation potential and between 40 and 70% organic carbon and colour were obtained using enhanced coagulation, which compared favourably with the advanced treatment processes. The more sophisticated processes were especially effective in the removal of micropollutants, this generally being in excess of 70%, which was not achievable using enhanced coagulation. pH depression using acid addition allowed for increases in organics removal at lower coagulant doses and inorganic coagulants were found to be more effective than the polymeric coagulants for organic matter removal. It was shown that the advanced treatment processes became more cost effective for larger plants and as water quality deteriorates, but for smaller water works, enhanced coagulation is cheaper.</jats:p>",

Since 1993 the lake has been artificially mixed in summer by a bubble plume installation. The result is quite successful since the mass of Microcystis is up to 20 times lower than in the years before mixing and no scum is present any more. The study in Lake Nieuwe Meer showed a shift from cyanobacterial dominance (mainly Microcystis) to flagellates, green-algae and diatoms when artificial mixing was applied. Total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations did not change as a result of mixing and had apparently no effect on the shift in the phytoplankton composition. The chlorophyll-a concentration was much lower in the mixed lake as a result of dilution. The total algae biomass decreased. The transparency did not improve. The total heat energy of the lake is slightly higher than before mixing but still remains in the range of annual fluctuation. The temperature on the surface is approximately 2°C lower. In the whole water-body oxygen was always higher than 5 mg/l. Living space for fish is therefore wider.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The installation in Lake Nieuwe Meer consists of flexible pipes near the sediment, built in a way to prevent sediment erosion and transport into the water. There are no constructions in the water-body. All mechanical parts are on land. The layout of the installation is shown in Fig. 1. Installed compressor energy is 85 kW. This is equivalent to an upper middle-class motor-car. The design was made specifically for this problem. It is based on the physical data of the algae and the plant.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It would be beneficial to use this 7 year's experience for further applications e.g. elimination of toxic algae in drinking-water reservoirs.</jats:p>",

However, given that peptides will only be available in the rumen for a short time after feeding it may be necessary to match supply of peptides and energy in the rumen to maximise the stimulation in microbial activity. The objective of this study was thus to investigate if microbial protein synthesis in rumen fluid would be enhanced by a synchronous provision of peptides and energy.</jats:p>"

Consumer and retail pressure has led to calls for research to identify alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters. It is therefore appropriate to investigate the use of feed ingredients which promote growth and intestinal health for the newly weaned piglet. Piglets which receive diets containing spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) in the first week after weaning usually show improved feed intakes and growth rates when compared to piglets receiving conventional skim milk based starter diets (Toplis and Miller, 1999). The aim of this experiment was to determine whether similar improvements in piglet performance could be achieved when piglets received a soluble form of SDPP in their water supply instead of in the feed. In addition we investigated whether supplementation of the water supply of piglets already receiving a plasma containing diet further improved their post weaning performance. Although commonly used in Europe SDPP is currently excluded from piglet diets in the UK.</jats:p>"

Children who were transfused between January 1980 and November 1985 at a tertiary care paediatric hospital were contacted by letter. With this notification, HIV testing for recipients was recommended. HIV testing histories were obtained. The number tested for HIV was estimated from the questionnaire responses and from data matching with the HIV‐testing laboratory. Cases of HIV infection were identified through multiple sources. In this cohort, 11 028 children were transfused a mean of 21 units. Of the 10 220 living recipients, the estimated proportion tested for HIV was 86% to 91%. Thirty‐one cases of HIV infection were identified, representing 0.28% of the cohort but 0.34% of those expected to have been tested. The estimated HIV incidence per 1000 units transfused ranged from 0.028 [95% CI 0.0007, 0.155] in 1980 to 0.445 [95% CI 0.2592, 0.712] in 1985.

In F344 and SD rats, we were unable to demonstrate CRH-immunoreactive nerves in either the thymus or the spleen. Despite the lack of CRH-containing nerves, CRH immunoreactivity was present in pleotropic cells in the septum, cortex and medulla of the thymus, and in the red and white pulp of spleens from F344 and SD rats. In contrast, CRH+ nerves were found in thymuses and spleens from LEW rats. CRH+ nerves coursed in the interlobular septa, capsule, cortex and medulla of the LEW rat thymus. Large CRH-immunoreactive nerve bundles were present in the hilar region of the LEW rat spleen, and individual CRH+ fibers coursed in the capsule, trabeculae, red pulp, venous sinuses and marginal zone of the white pulp of the spleen. These findings indicate strain differences in neurotransmitter-specific nerves that innervate the rat spleen and thymus under basal conditions.</jats:p>"

Both a low endogenous GA concentration and a low supply of nitrate reduced the number and size of leaf cells, whereas they increased the size and number of root cortex cells. The effects of low N‐supply on the size and number of leaf and root cells did not depend on endogenous GA concentrations. The mutant's higher allocation to roots seemed to be the result of the strongly reduced growth of the shoot.</jats:p>",

In the present work, the relative growth rate (RGR), biomass partitioning and morphological parameters of wildtype (Wt) tomato (<jats:italic>Solanum lycopersicum</jats:italic> L. cv. Moneymaker) plants were compared with those of isogenic (<jats:italic>gib</jats:italic>) mutants with a reduced biosynthesis of gibberellins. GA deficiency reduced RGR and specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area per unit leaf mass) and increased the net assimilation rate (NAR, the rate of biomass increment per unit leaf area). Despite the free access to nitrogen in the rooting medium, the low‐GA mutants had a much higher root mass ratio (RMR, the root mass per unit plant biomass) than the Wt, suggesting that the mutants were disturbed in their growth response to nitrate supply. The experiment was repeated at a low exponential nitrate supply, which forced all plants to grow at the same low RGR. The persistence of the differences in RMR at low N‐supply indicated that the high RMR of the mutants was a direct effect of low GA, which was independent of nitrate supply. Because the low N‐supply increased the RMRs of all genotypes to the same extent, the response of RMR to N‐supply does not seem to depend on GA. Although many of the traits of the slow growing GA mutants were very similar to those of inherently slow growing plant species from unproductive habitats, gibberellins are unlikely to be a main determinant of a plant's potential RGR.</jats:p>",

Perfusion of drugs on the round window or through the scalae of animals using a pump system suggests that the chronic local drug treatment might also be feasible in humans. However, drug delivery systems that are currently on the market involve repeated reimplantation if they are to be used for long-term drug supply. A bone-anchored, totally implantable micro-drug delivery system (MDS) for patient-controlled drug supply has been developed [Lehner et al., 1997]. In this study, we show the first successful long-term in vivo test of the MDS micro-pump in rats. The process of implantation and first functional tests will be described. The biomaterial used to manufacture the delivery system did not cause any inflammation reaction in any of the 9 animals successfully implanted. After activation of the micro-pump, the drug reservoir and port was found to be fluid-tight. Bolus applications of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the round window induced a transient decrease of evoked brainstem responses. In 2 animals which carried the MDS for more than 8 months the proper functioning of the pumping device was examined in a 2–3 week interval over a 3 month period. The MDS can be autoclaved even after long-term implantation and can then be reused for subsequent implantations. Designed for life-long implantation in humans, the demonstration of an effective long-term drug supply to the inner ear using the MDS provides an encouraging first step towards future long-term drug treatment of the inner ear in humans.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current literature indicates that the stimulation of relative growth rate (RGR) by an elevated atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>concentration is transient.<jats:italic>Urtica urens</jats:italic>L. was exposed to an elevated atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>concentration for 26 days to better understand the factors involved in this constraint to growth. Plants were grown hydroponically without nutrient limitation in controlled‐environment cabinets. Consistent with studies of other C3 species, the initial CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>stimulation of RGR of<jats:italic>U. urens</jats:italic>was not sustained and declined in the early stages of exposure. Whilst the decline in RGR was most strongly linked to a reduction in the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>stimulation of net assimilation rate (NAR), its initial increase was constrained by an early and persistent reduction in leaf area ratio (LAR) due to a decreased specific leaf area (SLA). The decline in NAR could not be linked to any down‐regulation of photosynthetic capacity of individual leaves, despite an accumulation of soluble sugars in them. The reductions in LAR and SLA reflected an accumulation of structural weight in addition to an accumulation of total non‐structural carbohydrate (TNC). To account for the impact of ontogenetic drift on the partitioning of weight and leaf area, this study extends the usual allometric approach to include an analysis of effects on the vertical placement of regression lines (i.e. their elevations). Using this approach, we argue that CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐induced reductions in LAR and SLA cannot be explained by ontogenetic drift. By monitoring the tissue N concentration, external N supply was shown unambiguously to be non‐limiting for growth at any plant size. Nevertheless, tissue N was consistently lower in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, independent of both ontogeny and TNC accumulation, raising the possibility that the reductions in NAR, LAR and SLA are related to some internal constraint on N utilization.</jats:p>",
