Vessels were grossly dissected to the small arteriole level. The primary source of blood supply was the femoral artery and its branches which entered the joint on the caudal and medial surfaces. The superficial vasculature arose from the caudal branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery cranially and laterally, and from the saphenous and descending genicular arteries medially. The deep vasculature arose from the popliteal artery and its branches on the caudal joint surface. These 2 layers of vessels arborized to form the vascular rete which surrounded the joint and gave off branches to supply the articular capsule and the intraarticular structures. Venous drainage paralleled arterial pathways.</jats:p>",

The first uses the activities of a particular religious order or its most illustrious members to frame the foundation and growth of a missionary enterprise.

Their correspondence cites the difficulties of operating stations at great remove from the seats of Spanish power in America.

L. 96-223) have concluded that the tax will reduce the economic incentive to produce crude oil and will therefore have a negative impact on U.S. oil production.' This article disagrees with that view. Instead we show that the tax offers incentives to producers on existing properties that exceed those offered by a free market. Furthermore, based on estimates of these incentives, we conclude that the tax will1. See, for instance, Mead (1979) Wall Street Journal (1980), and Friedman (1980).

Gastric motility was recorded by the balloon method. Efferent stimulation of the cut greater splanchnic nerve, well proximal to the celiac ganglion, could either increase or decrease gastric tone. The excitatory responses called for higher stimulation intensities than the inhibitory ones but were as a rule observed at lower frequencies only (1–4 Hz). They could be abolished by atropine but were not prevented by bilateral vagotomy, hexamethonium nor guanethidine. The latter twodrugs rather reversed inhibitory responses to excitatory ones which exhibited a hyperbolic frequency‐response relationship with maximal effects already at 24 Hz. Heating of a nerve trunk selectively activates thin afferents of the delta group and C‐class. Heating of the greater splanchnic nerve caused an increase in gastric motility which, like that caused by electric stimulation, was not prevented by hexamethonium nor guanethidine; nor was it eliminated by cutting the nerve centrally, nor by vagotomy, while it was abolished by atropine. These results suggest that the excitatory gastric responses to efferent splanchnic nerve stimulation are due to antidromic activation of thin afferent fibres. Their functional significance remains obscure but their peripheral arborizations may convey ‘axon reflexes’ influencing gastrointestinal motility.</jats:p>",
