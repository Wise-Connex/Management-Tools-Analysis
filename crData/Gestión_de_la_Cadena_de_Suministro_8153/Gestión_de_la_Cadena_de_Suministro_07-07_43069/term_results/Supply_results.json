      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Water Supply and Sanitation Technology Platform (WSSTP) is an industry driven organisation aiming to strengthen the potential for technological innovation and the competitiveness of the European Water Industry. In response to global challenges and regional demands a strategy has been proposed to ensure safe, secure and sustainable water and sanitation services for the benefit of industry, the society and the environment. Integrated Water Resources Management is used as a guiding principle. Water supply, wastewater treatment (sanitation), river basin management and concerns of regulators, financing institutions and the civil society are the key elements of a system to be sustainably managed. Decision makers of the private and the public sector are to understand that investment in research, technology development and implementation of innovation is an important element in the process of securing economic prosperity, social stability and functioning of the ecological systems which we as human beings are a part of. A hierarchic, practice oriented structure is proposed to organize and govern research and technology development in Europe. Research will be organized within the framework of thematically designed pilot programmes containing a distinct number of implementation cases to execute close-to-reality research.</jats:p>",

These paradigms reflect the key drivers for restoration efforts, and the scientific expertise used to underpin intervention options. At present, however, success rates for restoration schemes are low, and concerns are growing that conventional approaches to river restoration may be fundamentally flawed. Particular issues arise in the case of urban environments, where the case for restoration intervention may otherwise be strongest. In this review, the restoration paradigms are introduced, and the requirement for increased multi-disciplinary perspectives and more comprehensive appraisal processes is outlined. Characteristics of urban rivers are also described. Some paradoxes arising from misclassification and inappropriate conceptualization of these highly fragmented systems are presented, which offer grounds for more optimistic assessments of likely restoration success.</jats:p>",

Based on their toxic mechanisms, cyanobacterial toxins are generally categorized as neurotoxins, hepatotoxins or cytotoxins. The acute oral toxicities of these toxins vary substantially, with the saxitoxins being the most toxic having an LD50 of 60 μg/kg. By comparison, the acute oral LD50 for microcystin LR (the most toxic congener) and cylindrospermopsin are approximately 5,000 to 10,000 μg/kg and 6,000 μg/kg over 5 days, respectively. There are well known adverse health issues of cyanobacterial toxin poisonings. The most serious health consequences have occurred in Brazil with the reported deaths of people from gastrointestinal symptoms associated with exposure to microcystins and cylindrospermopsin. Increased number of symptoms has also been reported via exposure to cyanobacterial toxins through water-based recreational activities. Toxins may also be present in drinking water and thus guideline values are necessary to protect the health of the population. Guideline values are available for microcystins but not for saxitoxins, cylindrospermopsin or deoxycylindrospermopsin. Considerable research is being undertaken currently on more fully understanding the mechanisms of toxicity of cylindrospermopsin to enable relevant guidelines to be established.</jats:p>",

Such strategies can not be formed from the top down. However those at the top levels of government must be involved in facilitating a bottom–up, public participatory process of helping all those who are impacted by how water is allocated and managed achieve a shared vision of how their water resource system functions. This shared vision should include the economical, ecological and social impacts of alternative management policies, and the tradeoffs among conflicting multiple purposes for which water serves and among all economic, environmental and social objectives for which water can achieve. Appropriate technology is continually being developed that helps us manage water better, but it appears the real constraints to more effective management are often institutional or social.

Reprinted with permission.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether hemodynamic and pharmacologic factors can influence the extent and severity of myocardial necrosis produced by coronary occlusion. In 48 dogs, 10 to 14 epicardial leads were recorded on the anterior surface of the left ventricle in the distribution and vicinity of the site of occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The average S-T segment elevation for each animal was determined at 5-min intervals after occlusion. This elevation was used as an index of the presence and severity of myocardial ischemic injury. Isoproterenol, ouabain, glucagon, bretylium, and tachycardia given prior to a repeated occlusion each increased the severity and extent of ischemic injury, while propranolol decreased it. Elevation of arterial pressure with methoxamine reduced the occlusion-induced S-T segment elevation, and lowering of the mean arterial pressure by hemorrhage had the opposite effect. In 19 additional experiments, propranolol, isoproterenol, and alterations in arterial pressure produced similar alterations in S-T segment elevation when these interventions were applied as long as 3 hr after ligation. Myocardial creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity determined 24 hr after coronary artery ligation correlated well with S-T segment elevation at the same sites recorded 15 min after ligation. Moreover, isoproterenol increased and propranolol decreased the area of depression of myocardial CPK activity. We conclude that the hemodynamic status and neurohumoral background at the time of coronary occlusion and for at least 3 hr thereafter can alter the extent and severity of myocardial ischemic injury and myocardial necrosis.</jats:p>",

The paper employs a numerical modeling approach, first for the Clyde Estuary in Glasgow with a rich data-set modeled with commercial 1-d and 2-d models, and then the Gambia estuary in West Africa with a very sparse data-set, modeled with a 1-d model and an idealized 3-d CFD model. The paper demonstrates different modeling techniques appropriate to each case and the very different scale of threats, vulnerability and different responses required to ensure greater sustainability in each estuary.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile, large-scale land reclamation was carried out to meet the needs of various urbanization projects. In this paper we analyzed the groundwater from a coastal aquifer system in Shenzhen and examined the evolution of groundwater chemistry over the last 20 years. The temporal changes of ionic ratios of rCa/(rHCO3 + rSO4) and the relationship between sodium and chloride in the coastal area over this period indicate that the aquifer experienced seawater intrusion in the 1980s but underwent gradual freshening in the 1990s. It is speculated that seawater intrusion was induced by excessive groundwater pumping and that the aquifer freshening was caused both by the recent reduction in groundwater pumping and by coastal reclamation which moved the interface between fresh groundwater and saline groundwater seaward.</jats:p>",

Taiwan 2000 was for the first time in Taiwan the government encouraged industries to seek a balance between economic development and environmental protection. According to the principles and visions of Agenda 21, the Government has implemented visions and strategies for national sustainable development to serve as the basic guidelines for keeping up with the development in the 21st century. Local Agenda 21 was also developed by the local city and county governments from 2003 to 2006. It has an emphasis on sustainable water environment, total emission control, eco-industrial parks, sustainable transportation, and green community promotion. In addition, a fifth program, Water Safety Plan, was developed as the “Green Blue-Print” for the development of strategies and guidelines of national sustainable water environment. It focuses on Source Water Implementation Plan Rule (SWIPR), modernization of water treatment plants, and the implementation of Integrated Performance Evaluation (IPE) Program.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We present an independent assessment of the health and water sustainability of the East River (Dongjiang) in South China, which is the source of nearly 80% of Hong Kong's water supply. Field measurements show that the water quality in the upper and middle reaches is generally good and well exceeds the drinking quality standard, with high bio-diversity. The streamflow of the East River Basin is satisfactorily simulated using both the distributed MIKE-SHE model and the lumped HSPF model. With an average streamflow of 760 m3/s, the River is able to satisfy the current water demand. Using the HSPF model, the water quality is found to have deteriorated in recent years. In addition to water supply, the River also supports a variety of needs such as hydro-power generation, waste assimilation, navigation, habitat for aquatic life, and expulsion of sea water intrusion. Using the projected need of 150 m3/s for water supply, the instream flow requirement based on hydrological and water quality simulation is estimated to be 467 m3/s in 2010. This suggests that the water sustainability of the East River requires alternative strategies, which may include integrated water resources management, provision of better wastewater treatment, and water and soil conservation.</jats:p>",

A regulation over the basin through integrating various regions was first established for enhancing the water resources management. Based on such a regulation, a public policy frame was then constructed aiming for the harmony between human activities and nature. It is hoped that, as a result, the basin's socio-economic sustainable development could be achieved. In practice, the Pearl River Water Resources Commission (PRWRC), which is the basin regulatory authority, has been focusing on various aspects of regulating water basin and conserving water resources. These aspects include the development of innovative regulations of treating water, exploration of compensation schemes for water resources prevention, investigation of the hydraulic engineering project impacts on region relocation and ecology, and establishment of marketing schemes for sustainable application of water resources. It is expected that these regulating water resources aspects would result in enhancing public participation and negotiation in the Pearl River basin management. A case study is presented on the PRWRC's effort in coordinating water discharges from a number of reservoirs to protect the safe water supply in the Pearl River basin from seawater intrusion during the dry season.</jats:p>",

Threats include hydrologic alteration, pollution, habitat destruction, overexploitation, and invasive exotic species. Global warming will cause further changes to river ecosystems, and may act synergistically with other threat factors. Significant upward or northward range adjustments by the freshwater biota will be necessary to cope with rising temperatures, but there will be significant constraints upon dispersal ability and availability of suitable habitat for many organisms. Global warming will exacerbate existing impacts of hydrologic alteration because of the adaptive human responses that will be engendered by changes in climate and runoff, particularly dams constructed for hydropower generation, flood protection, water storage, and irrigation. The consequences of further hydrologic alteration and habitat fragmentation will be profound, since almost all ecological processes, material transfers and life-cycle events in the rivers of monsoonal Asia are mediated or controlled by flow. Thus a change in the timing or amounts of flow changes everything. Collaborative research to determine the environmental allocation of water flow needed to maintain ecosystem integrity and sustain biodiversity in the human-dominated rivers of monsoonal Asia should be a priority for ecologists, engineers and water-resource managers.</jats:p>",

Who and what are they accountable to? Telemediation is fragmenting work across increasingly complex, transnational networks. Workers in these networks must negotiate through a multitude of temporal, contractual and trans-cultural milieus. This paper traces the trajectory of the work experience using case studies of telemediated work relationships in various points in the global supply chain and analyses the implications of telemediated spaces for the quality of workers' lives. Drawing on an analysis of case studies conducted by the EMERGENCE Canada project, this paper argues that telemediated work represents a shift in the scale at which many aspects of daily life unfold, and that some of the assumptions upon which workers’ lives are governed must be reconsidered.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An advanced fluid visualisation technique, particle image velocimetry, was employed to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of particles and aggregates. The experiments were conducted in a settling column filled with a suspension of fluorescent polymeric beads as flow tracers. A thin vertical section of the settling column was illuminated by a laser sheet, while the motions of particles were recorded by a high speed CCD camera. Large solid spheres, flocs of latex microspheres and aggregates of marine diatoms were characterised for their hydrodynamic properties. The trajectories of the tracer particles were tracked when a large particle or aggregate settled through the suspension of the tracers, which gave the streamlines surrounding the falling object. The streamlines demonstrate directly the curvilinear feature of the interaction between approaching particles. However, the available curvilinear model underestimates the collision frequency function of particles by one order of magnitude or two. The collision potentials of the flocs and aggregates are more than an order of magnitude greater than the similar-sized solid spheres. Algal aggregates appear to be highly porous and fractal with a fluid collection efficiency of 10–40%, which would significantly enhance the flocculation between particles and the mass transfer into the aggregates.</jats:p>",

These fractionated isolates and the raw water were disinfected by chlorine or chlorine dioxide to determine their disinfection characteristics. Results showed that apparent molecular weight of the main dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the RO isolate of water sample was less than 360 Da and this part of the DOM was mainly from anthropogenic activities and contamination of wastewater. RO fraction was the controlling factor for the raw water disinfection process according to the THMs concentrations detected.

These two primer sets were then used to measure the AOC content in 41 water samples by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results showed that P-17 and NOX cell numbers quantified by qRT-PCR using the designed primer sets were consistently higher (about 40.8% for P-17 and 54.8% for NOX measurements) than those by the traditional but time-consuming plate culture method. This proposed method not only saves the 5 days needed for plate culture, but also may detect AOC at concentrations as low as 0.3 μg-acetate-C/l and 0.6 μg-oxalate-C/l, which are lower than those measured by the plate culture and other methods. Using this new method, the water from the tap and a local reservoir were found containing 122 μg/l and 194 μg/l AOC, respectively, accounting for 5.7% and 7.8% of TOC.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The waterways of South East Queensland, Australia, represent unique and complex ecosystems that have a high conservation value and support major recreational and commercial fisheries. The agricultural districts of the region also contribute significantly to the regional economy and, together with the growing urban areas, are heavily reliant on good quality water supplies. However, the human footprint of these activities has led to significant changes in catchment hydrology and sediment delivery, declining water quality and loss of aquatic biodiversity. Predicted population increases in the region are likely to further impact on the ecological and economic health of its waterways and catchments, and there are growing community expectations to reverse the decline in water quality and ecosystem health. In response to these concerns, government, industry and community stakeholders have worked in close cooperation to develop a whole-of-government, whole-of-community approach to understanding and managing the region's waterways. This paper provides an overview of the experience gained through development of the SEQ Healthy Waterways Partnership and highlights some of the key factors we believe have contributed to its success.</jats:p>",

We show what types of coordination mechanisms allow the decentralized supply chain to generate aggregate expected profits equal to the optimal profits in a centralized system, and how the parameters of these (perfect) coordination schemes can be determined. We assume that the retailers face stochastic demand functions that may depend on all of the firms’ prices as well as a measure of their service levels, e.g., the steady-state availability of the products. We systematically compare the coordination mechanisms when retailers compete only in terms of their prices, and when they engage in simultaneous price and service competition. </jats:p>",

The model is applied to bananas in Uganda, making use of disaggregated data on variety‐specific farm‐gate banana bunch prices and attributes, while accounting for the semisubsistence nature of banana‐producing households. The article is motivated by the need to understand the attribute trade‐offs made by farmers at the farm gate in light of targeted variety improvement efforts and their impact on banana markets. Whether variety improvement will pay off at the market level requires a more detailed examination of the relative worth of banana attributes within the structure of consumer preferences and production technologies related to bananas in Uganda. The results confirm the importance of consumption and production attributes in selling behavior. Quality and bunch size are found to be complements at the farm gate. Banana bunches that capture a premium at the market will be those that provide bundles of desirable consumption and production attributes simultaneously. By revealing important price–attribute relationships, the findings provide guidance for crop improvement efforts and diversification choices, while taking into account implicit market signals for output attributes.</jats:p>",

We describe evidence for the existence of regulatory mechanisms that coordinate carbon supply and use, and the likely central role of sugar signalling. We propose the existence of both ‘acute’ and ‘acclimatory’ responses to alterations in carbon supply, the latter tuning the balance between carbon supply and demand to optimise the capacity for sustained growth. A full understanding of these responses requires new, systems‐level approaches that integrate information from transcriptomic, enzyme activity, metabolomic and growth analyses. We illustrate the complexity of acute and acclimatory responses by consideration of the control of starch synthesis and degradation in leaves. Finally, we consider how carbon balance may be linked to growth, and the importance of these linkages for sustained plant growth in a changing environment.</jats:p>",

Four field surveys were conducted in 2004 to study the geomorphologic, hydrologic and environmental features of the basin. Epilithic diatom and water samples were collected from four sites in the upper and lower reaches of the river. A total of 23 diatom genera were identified from the study sites during the two sampling periods. The diatom genus Nitzschia represented the most pollutant dependent epilithic diatoms, comprising over 38% of the overall diatom population in the polluted sites. The correlation between water quality and the Shannon diversity index (H), generic index (GI), trophic diatom index (TDI) and diatom assemblage index to organic pollution (DAIpo) was investigated in this study. The results suggested that epilithic diatom might be used as a biological indicator for the environmental health assessment of the East River.</jats:p>",

Parametric analyses suggest economic and demand responses to increased availability and alternative pricing. It also suggests potential market penetration for conservation actions, associated water savings, and subsidies to entice further adoption. We discuss new insights to size, target, and finance conservation.</jats:p>",

Remarkably, the role of outsourcing is substantial in both low‐ and high‐clockspeed settings, but limited in the intermediate group. Opposite to this, the role of vertical information systems is limited in low‐ and in high‐clockspeed industries, but substantial in medium‐clockspeed firms.

Warri an oil producing community in Delta State of Nigeria is faced with environmental oil pollution. Since open and underground water bodies are regarded as final recipients of most environmental pollutants, this study sought to provide data on the levels of the physico‐chemical parameters and contaminants in Warri metropolitan water supply. This study investigated the cadmium, lead and chromium using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, physico – chemical properties such as pH, temperature, total suspended solid TSS, total dissolved solid TDS, electrical conductivity EC, biological oxygen demand BOD, dissolved oxygen DO, chemical oxygen demand COD, and total coliform count of potable water sources in Warri. Ekpan River was found to have 1.2mg/L of cadmium, 1.0mg/L of chromium, 1.20mg/L of lead and 2.0mg/L of manganese. The heavy metals levels and the pollution parameters were lowest in the borehole water samples, except pH which is more acidic in borehole water samples and conductivity which is more in well water samples in all the sampling stations. Some of the parameters were above WHO standards.</jats:p>",

This was a notion invented by Paris technicians between 1760 and 1804 in the context of several water supply projects, notably two river diversion schemes, those of the Yvette and the Ourcq, where the concept was much discussed. Different ways of considering the question of need – such as water resources, consumption and use, whether present or future – were strongly related to engineers' or scientists' conceptions of their own work. State engineers claimed they could make objective estimates of future needs with no reference to either value judgements or political intentions, a position which made it possible to keep strong control over the decision in the name of the state. In contrast, a practically trained engineer working outside the state corps claimed that in the case of expertise about the future, estimates would depend strongly on political intentions, norms and ideals, so the government should first give an outline of its intended actions. The paper studies the differences between these two approaches to the concept of need, especially how they articulated knowledge about what <jats:italic>is</jats:italic> and knowledge about what <jats:italic>ought to be</jats:italic>, present and future. The paper ends by linking these differences to conceptions of what was supposed to be technical or political in such projects and of what role engineers intended to play in the decision-making process.</jats:p>",

In the literature, various kinds of models are appearing which have been developed by various researchers. Many performance measures have been used to assess supply chain performance. A wide range of supply chain decision variables, modeling approaches, and solution methods have been adopted by researchers.

More specifically, the proposed approach is based on a combination of a spatial downscaling method to link large-scale climate variables as provided by General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with daily extreme precipitations at a local site and a temporal downscaling procedure to describe the relationships between daily extreme precipitations with sub-daily extreme precipitations using the scaling General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The feasibility of the proposed downscaling method has been tested based on climate simulation outputs from two GCMs under the A2 scenario (HadCM3A2 and CGCM2A2) and using available AM precipitation data for durations ranging from 5 minutes to 1 day at 15 raingage stations in Quebec (Canada) for the 1961–1990 period. Results of this numerical application has indicated that it is feasible to link large-scale climate predictors for daily scale given by GCM simulation outputs with daily and sub-daily AM precipitations at a local site. Furthermore, it was found that AM precipitations at a local site downscaled from the HadCM3A2 displayed a small change in the future, while those values estimated from the CGCM2A2 indicated a large increasing trend for future periods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There exists a wide energy supply/demand gap in Nigeria. The local generation of electricity meets only 31% of the demand of 10000 MW. By contrast, only 39.6% of the total installed capacity for electricity generation is achieved, owing to aging infrastructure, etc. The energy demand/supply pattern and infrastructure critically reviewed thus suggested the need to increase the electricity generation capacity. Furthermore, Nigeria flares 77% of her associated natural gas. Apart from the environmental penalties that flaring represents, in monetary terms, over the 110 years' life of Nigeria's gas reserves, a conservative estimate of the cost of the gas so-flared was $330 billion (based on $20/barrel average price of crude). It was safely inferred that the way forward in meeting the country's energy demand should include a strong element of gas utilization. In previous publications by this group, it was established that while domestic cooking could reduce the flared gas by about 5.4%, a cohesive policy on associated gas use for electricity generation could eliminate gas flaring. </jats:p><jats:p> For domestic utilization of the associated gas, burner design and safety concerns were identified as the key challenges to overcome. The paper reports the effectiveness of odorizers in leakage detection/ prevention by the local consumers. It also discusses the issue of prevention of gas explosions.

The safety approaches proffered in the paper identified the relevant areas of research for safe delivery and consumption of natural gas in Nigeria. </jats:p>",

The model was first calibrated for the concentration of nitrobenzene in the water column with field data, and then applied to systematically expound the transportation and transformation of nitrobenzene in both water and sediment, and predict its distribution and fate in the multimedia of the River. The concentration profiles of the nitrobenzene in water column simulated the field data satisfactorily. Calculated results indicate that the spilled nitrobenzene was mostly either volatilized or biodegraded. Photolysis and sorption of nitrobenzene by suspended particles as well as benthic sediment were insignificant. Overall, results of this study suggested that the residual nitrobenzene would not seriously contaminate the River. Evaluation on the impacts of the spill was used to support the decision on risk assessment and watershed environmental management for the local government.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Located at southern coast of China, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is facing serious water problems in both quantity and quality after its rapid urbanization in the last decade. Most remarkably, the local groundwater, that was used to be the source of drinking water before the urbanization was polluted due to poor management of the septic tanks. In order to study the effects of suburban development on local groundwater flow and water quality in the PRD region, Fengcun of Guangzhou has been chosen as the study area. In Fengcun, drinking water was groundwater before the 1990s, but now piped reservoir water is used by each family because the groundwater has been polluted. This study clarifies the source and process of the groundwater pollution from septic tanks using isotopic and geochemical characteristics, especially nitrate (NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup>) concentrations. Water samples were collected from the wells and ponds in Fengcun in March and July 2005 and in July 2006. Based on the pe–pH diagram, NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> and ammonium of groundwater are from the effect of human activities, rather than from nitrification and ammonification of N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>. NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> pollution of groundwater is from point sources, and NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> concentrations decrease from northeast to southwest. Groundwater is polluted rapidly by the leakage of septic tanks. NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub><jats:sup>−</jats:sup> concentrations of pollution sources were lower than 20 mg l<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in March 2005, but had increased to about 120 mg l<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in July 2006. This implies that groundwater protection should be strengthened in rural areas of the PRD. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Samples to analyses the biotic variables were taken using a recipient with a large overture, at the subsurface and with a Van Dorn bottle at the bottom. The rainfall data were recorded and the water transparency was used to calculate the light attenuation coefficient, photic zone and the determination of trophic state index. The concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen were determined in a typical dry and rainy month. Equitability, also the, similarity and diversity indexes and the densities and correlation of total densities among depths were calculated. Forty-five taxa were identified in Chlorophyta (21spp), Cyanophyta (17spp) and Bacillariophyta (7spp), while flagellates were quantified in groups without identification. Cyanophyta presented highest diversity at both the depths and Planktothrix agardhii was the highest density species. Significant differences were not observed between subsurface and bottom densities. Results showed that the reservoir was eutrophicated and presented high densities of Cyanophyta.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The southern Bay of Biscay is a very active region in terms of hydrography due to the interannual variations of its Central Waters, the recurrence of mesoscale features such as slope currents and upwellings, and the freshwater discharges from land. This highly dynamic physical environment influences to a great extent the biogeochemical cycles of nutrients beyond the seasonal cycle typical of middle latitudes. By using a monthly time series (1993–2003) of nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and silicate consisting of three stations placed along a cross‐shelf transect, we assess the role of the physical forcing on nutrient seasonal and interannual dynamics within the upper 200 m, as well as the interactions with the biological component. The seasonal cycles of all nutrients and the stoichiometric balances (N:P and Si:N) are characterized along this coastal‐oceanic gradient. The year‐to‐year variations in the extent of the winter replenishment are analyzed in relation to the background Central Waters and presence/absence of the Iberian Poleward Current. In the long term we report decreasing linear trends of nitrate, nitrite, and silicate as well as an uncoupled nonlinear variation (i.e., cyclical) for all nutrients. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of this complex long‐term forcing on the phytoplankton: the linear trends are probably related to a decreasing primary production rate, while the nonlinear forcing may be responsible for controlling the community structure of phytoplankton.</jats:p>",

In such systems carbon is often the growth limiting nutrient. Research conducted in the Netherlands has indicated that low levels (&lt;10 μg/L) of available organic carbon in water is sufficient to maintain an actively growing population of heterotrophic, or organic carbon utilizing, bacteria in aquatic systems. However, the ability of commercially available and cost effective technologies to achieve such low concentrations of assimilable organic carbon in full-scale water systems is doubtful. Reverse osmosis (RO) systems have been used for many years to effectively remove contaminants from source waters. We challenged a water distribution system simulator (DSS) with water from a municipal system and water that was treated using an RO system under two concentrations of residual free chlorine to evaluate the effect of this disinfectant on biofilms in contact with low nutrient water. Our results showed that biofilm densities in the DSS carrying low nutrient RO treated water were lower than biofilm densities taken from the DSS when it carried water directly obtained from a municipal system.Key words: water distribution systems, reverse osmosis, biofilms, heterotrophic plate count, HPC, chlorine, assimilable organic carbon. </jats:p>",

Hydrogen storage properties of the samples were investigated. The results show that both Fe and Fe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> powder with additive Mo presented excellent catalytic activity and cyclic stability, and their hydrogen producing temperature could be surprisingly decreased. The temperature of forming hydrogen for the Fe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐Mo at the rate of 250 µmol·min<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>·Fe‐g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> could be dramatically decreased from 527 °C before addition of Mo to 283 °C after addition of Mo in the fourth cycle. The cause for it was probably related to preventing the sinter of the sample particles. In addition, hydrogen storage capacity of the Fe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐Mo can reach <jats:italic>w</jats:italic>=4.5% (72 kg H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), close to International Energy Agency (IEA) criterion. These show the value of practical application of the Fe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>‐Mo as the promising hydrogen storage material.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the development and integration of the global supply chain, manufacturing industries are rapidly adjusting their modes of operation within and between enterprises. Existing manufacturing processes are being improved to meet the requirements of lean and agile manufacturing, and suppliers are given additional responsibilities to provide parts and services dynamically. An enterprise must strategically re-engineer its operations model to face the rapid changes of the global market place. This paper identifies prevailing challenges and highlights a future vision of the global logistics management framework for the automotive industry. An integrated business and logistics hub (IBLH) model integrating information flows (via the business hub) and material flows (via the logistics hub) is presented. This research uses the case of a Taiwan automobile parts and assembly manufacturer to analyse the processes of the IBLH. The goals of the case are to shorten supply chain processes, reduce inventory costs, and ensure information transparency during material flow and product distribution. Finally, this research provides suggestions to depict the case company's current limitations and deficiencies, and presents a future plan for e-logistics services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The molecular and cellular mechanisms behind glycogen metabolism and the energy metabolite translocation between mammal neurons and astrocytes have been well studied. A similar mechanism is proposed for rapid mobilization of local energy stores to support energy-dependent transepithelial ion transport in gills of the Mozambique tilapia ( Oreochromis mossambicus). A novel gill glycogen phosphorylase isoform (tGPGG), which catalyzes the initial degradation of glycogen, was identified in branchial epithelial cells of O. mossambicus. Double in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that tGPGG mRNA and glycogen were colocalized in glycogen-rich cells (GRCs), which surround ionocytes (labeled with a Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-K<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>-ATPase antiserum) in gill epithelia. Concanavalin-A (a marker for the apical membrane) labeling indicated that GRCs and mitochondria-rich cells share the same apical opening. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that tGPGG mRNA expression levels specifically responded to environmental salinity changes. Indeed, the glycogen content, glycogen phosphorylase (GP) protein level and total activity, and the density of tGPGG-expressing cells (i.e., GRCs) in fish acclimated to seawater (SW) were significantly higher than those in freshwater controls. Short-term acclimation to SW caused an evident depletion in the glycogen content of GRCs. Taken altogether, tGPGG expression in GRCs is stimulated by hyperosmotic challenge, and this may catalyze initial glycogen degradation to provide the adjacent ionocytes with energy to carry out iono- and osmoregulatory functions.</jats:p>",
