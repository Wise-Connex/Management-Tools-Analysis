Before 1957, there was no regulation by the county of water supply systems except in the case of residential subdivisions, and this regulation consisted of only two parts. These requirements could be met without even having a system which could serve water, as nothing required the well to be connected to the water mains. It was discovered that county control of water supply systems being installed by land developers is necessary to insure an adequate supply of water for both domestic service and fire protection. An appendix to the article contains the Water Supply Requirements for Subdivisions, Planned Developments, and Trailer Parks; Technical Provisions of Resolution No. 3333, Ventura County Planning Commission, Aug. 14, 1961.</jats:p>",
