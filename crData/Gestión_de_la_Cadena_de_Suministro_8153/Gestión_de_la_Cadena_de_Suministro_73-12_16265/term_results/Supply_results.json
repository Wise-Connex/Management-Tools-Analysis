      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many regions, irrigation water is pumped from an underground aquifer that receives little or no recharge. With an exhaustible water supply, water available in year t + 1 depends on quantity of water available in year t − 1 and the quantity withdrawn in year t. As the water supply decreases, pumping costs increase and returns to water and management decline.</jats:p><jats:p>The exhaustible nature of the water supply causes an especially difficult problem for the farm operator in that he must allocate water within and among years. In addition, the farm operator is faced with irrigation investment decisions; e.g., type of irrigation distribution system to use. He must consider simultaneously, labor intensive versus capital intensive systems and effect of each system on present value and economic life of his specific water supply. To manually evaluate the alternatives, making the necessary calculations would be prohibitive in terms of both cost and time.</jats:p>",

This situation has changed. There has been a gradual but continual decrease in their percentage of market share, and a corresponding increase in that held by commercial banks and credit unions. This study seeks to explain this change in market share, to measure the effects of selected supply and demand variables which may have contributed to it, and to assess the potential ramifications for the above lenders and the borrowing public at large.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Growing rabbits were given a fluoride supplement of 0.5 and 10 mg of fluoride per kg body weight per day during 14 weeks, that is, until they were 21 weeks of age. At that time the fluoride supplement was withdrawn and the animals were followed for another 24 weeks. Cortical diaphyseal bone from femur and tibia was studied by microradiography and fluorescence microscopy after fluorochrome labelling. There were no differences in bone morphology between the group given 0.5 mg of fluoride and the control animals. In animals given 10 mg of fluoride, excessive periosteal bone formation was seen at the lateral part of the tibial cortex. This fluorotic bone was characterized by thin radiating and heavily labelled bone trabeculae and there was a considerable degree of porosity in this bone. After withdrawal of the fluoride, no further signs of trabecular bone formation were seen. With increasing time of observation the porosity gradually decreased. The findings support the view that change from a high fluoride intake to a normal diet will result in progressive normalization of bone morphology. This normalization will occur in spite of maintained fluoride contents in the bone ash.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On the basis of postmortem coronary angiography and macroscopic examination, the anatomical variations of the coronary arteries and origin of the blood supply to the sinus node and atrioventricular node was studied. Four hundred coronary angiograms were performed of which 315 could be employed. Anatomic variations of the coronary arteries were classified according to the system mentioned in Schlesinger's 1940 study. In the present study we found 70.8 per cent of the coronary systems were of the “right type” 19.7 per cent of the “balanced type” and 9.5 per cent of the “left type”. Origin of the blood supply to the sinus node (SN) was the right coronary artery in 63.8 per cent and the left coronary artery in 36.2 per cent. Corresponding figures for the origin of the blood supply to the atrioventricular node (AVN) was 90.5 per cent from the right coronary artery and 9.5 per cent from the left coronary artery. There was no statistically significant difference in sex distribution.</jats:p>",
