In the Northeast and Far West, recreational activities are usually prohibited from domestic water supply reservoirs, especially bodily contact activities; the water managers view recreation as incompatible with the production of safe potable water, and consumer opinion opposes such reservoir use. In the remainder of the country, recreational activities are not only allowed on domestic water supply reservoirs, but the water managers do not consider reservoir recreation as inimical to the hygienic and aesthetic qualities of the drinking water, and the public favors such reservoir use. From a literature review, the writer concludes that all recreational activities can be permitted on domestic water supply reservoirs without any measurable increase in the risk of water‐borne disease if the water is properly treated.</jats:p>",
