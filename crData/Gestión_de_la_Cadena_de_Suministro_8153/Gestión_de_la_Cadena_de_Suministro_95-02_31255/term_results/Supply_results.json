      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The British government appears to have pursued two conflicting policies towards the gas-supply industry. On the one hand, it privatized British Gas as a single, integrated company. In doing so, it sacrificed the opportunity to foster competition in gas supply to the pragmatic requirements of its privatization programme. On the other hand, it has consistently encouraged competition in the supply of gas to large users.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The outcome of this ambiguous policy stance provides an interesting case for studying post-privatization experiences: in early 1992, British Gas accounts for nearly 90 per cent of the contract gas market; a figure which it has agreed must fall to 40 per cent by 1995. Judged against past performance, that will be no easy feat. Whether or not the policy succeeds, there are some useful implications for policy-makers.</jats:p>",

Instrumental variables analyses suggested that coresidence with a disabled parent leads to a large, significant reduction in work hours, due primarily to withdrawal from the labor force. Although the impact of nonhousehold member caregiving was insignificant, evidence of an effect was stronger when commitment of caregiving time was greater. Projections of female labor force participation rates should account for potential increases in caregiving demand due to the aging of the U.S. population.</jats:p>",

Important elements of the\nproject were the review and comparison of scheduling performance in\nconventional MRPII environments (usually a manual activity based on\nexpediting or the use of shop floor control) with that of more recent\nfinite capacity‐based tools and a classification of scheduling\napproaches. Some clear lessons have been learned.

This paper takes the view that attaching ‘price tags’ to water supply and sanitation, as was tentatively done in Agenda 21, is a misguided approach and that what is needed is articulation of clear principles which should underpin the financing of water supply and sanitation investments. To illustrate the approach the paper focuses heavily on experiences from World Bank water supply, sanitation and urban development projects over the past 30 years. The challenge is to develop appropriate institutional and financial arrangements. The essence of such arrangements is that they ensure that societies mobilize appropriate levels of resources for providing water related environmental services and that these resources are used in the most efficient and effective way possible</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Cost factors include fixed and variable production charges, inventory charges, distribution expenses via multiple modes, taxes, duties, and duty drawback.

Mass balances indicated that only a minor amount of glucose was utilized via the TCA cycle irrespective of the glucose concentration in the feed medium. The apparent biosynthetic yield of cells from ATP was independent of the ratio between the specific glucose and glutamine consumption rate. It is concluded that the primary role of glucose is the provision of intermediates for anabolic reactions. In addition, glucose may play an indirect catabolic role in the process of glutaminolysis by providing the pyruvate for the transamination of glutamate to alanine and α‐ketoglutarate. At low glucose concentrations in the feed medium, glutamine is probably the sole energy source for this myeloma in chemostat culture. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

To determine the best way to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments (SDWA), the MWRA initiated watershed protection and pilot treatment studies. This paper summarizes the major findings of the pilot treatment study. In particular, it compares the performance of dissolved air flotation with that of inline filtration, direct filtration, and contact adsorption clarification. Each process was evaluated for turbidity removal, filter production, particle reduction, disinfection byproducts, effect of ozonation, and coagulants. As a result of the piloting, a treatment process train consisting of dissolved air flotation, ozone, biological filtration, and chloramination was recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of this paper is to compare the performance of an in-line direct filtration (no flocculation) process with a dissolved air flotation (DAF) and filtration process for drinking water treatment. Both processes were studied at the pilot scale and included biologically active dual media (GAC/sand) rapid filters. Specific attention is given to the fate of organic matter. Organic matter was analyzed by measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), assimilable organic carbon (AOC), disinfection by-product formation potential (DBPFP) and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254). In general, flotation removed a large fraction of organic matter with additional removal provided by biologically active filters. Most of the work occurred with ozonation of the raw water (pre-ozone). Ozone increased the biologically assimilable fraction of the water; filtration decreased this fraction to acceptable levels. Overall, effects of ozone on other organics are relatively small.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) of <jats:italic>Escherichia coli</jats:italic>, the sole membrane‐bound enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, participates in the aerobic electron‐transport pathway to generate energy via oxidative phosphorylation reactions. Previous studies have established that succinate dehydrogenase (SDiH) synthesis is elevated by aerobiosis and supressed during growth with glucose. To examine how the <jats:italic>sdhCDAB</jats:italic> genes that encode SDH are regulated by changes in the environment, <jats:italic>sdh–lacZ</jats:italic> fusions were constructed and analysed <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> following cell growth under a variety of alternative culture conditions. Expression of <jats:italic>sdh–lacZ</jats:italic> was highest under aerobic conditions and was decreased 10‐foid in the absence of oxygen. The <jats:italic>fnr</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>arcA</jats:italic> gene products are required for this oxygen control and each acts to repress <jats:italic>sdhC–lacZ</jats:italic> expression. Expression of <jats:italic>sdh–lacZ</jats:italic> also varied 10‐ to 14‐foid depending on the type of carbon substrate used or the medium richness. This control was shown to be independent of the <jats:italic>crp</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>fruR</jats:italic> gene products, and indicates that some other regulatory element exists in the ceil to adjust SDH enzyme levels accordingly. Iron and haem availability affected <jats:italic>sdhC–lacZ</jats:italic> expression by two‐ to threefold. Lastly, fold. Lastly, <jats:italic>sdhC–lacZ</jats:italic> expression was shown to vary with the cell growth rate during aerobic and anaerobic conditions.</jats:p>",
