The system described retrieves information on a real-time basis from a large file of technical and inventory data stored on magnetic disk memory. A feature of the system is the use of the Multi-List technique which stores an addressing index in the form of trees that provide access to the main file. The main file may be accessed by many different types of descriptors. Input to the file is via magnetic tape, console inquiry, or remote interrogation station. File and tree construction, the use of linkages between items to form lists, and the executive routine are described. </jats:p>",

At parturition some of the middle-sized oocytes develop into large oocytes and subsequently, upon fertilization, into embryos. The number of middle-sized oocytes is then replenished from a large store of small oocytes. The effect of changes in the amount of available food on these oocytes and hence on the number of offspring was explored by an experiment involving 27 female Lebistes. Rations varying from near starvation to normal were supplied over the course of three consecutive parturition periods. At the end of the third period each fish had received a different combination of the three rations. Variations in first-period rations affected the numbers of both first- and second-period offspring. Reduced numbers of offspring and reduced large and middle-sized oocyte counts were associated with reduced rations. No significant changes in the size of young or the length of the gestation period were observed. </jats:p>",
