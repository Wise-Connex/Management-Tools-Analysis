The remoteness of a site and/or the economics of the distribution system can result in power which affects equipment life and efficiency. Other installed electric devices or systems can also impact the quality of supply. The purpose of this paper is not to condemn the circumstances which lead to deficient power supply situations, but rather to address their effects and discuss practical means of correcting or minimizing their effects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Luke Malaba's overview of the history of African labour control and organization from the 1930s to the 1970s highlights some of the institutional mechanisms of labour exploitation which were at the root of the whole settler colonial system and which must soon come under review by the new government. He offers a critique of the dualist work on African migrant labour but also points to some of the limits of recent ‘radical’ writings (see <jats:italic>Bibliographic Note</jats:italic>at end) which, whilst recognizing the structural integration of the African ‘reserves’ with the settler capitalist economy, fail to break away from an overly economistic conceptualization. It is the political framework which has defined and maintained the form of migration, Malaba argues. Moreover, workers organizations themselves have divorced the political from the economic aspects of the struggle against capital. The author concludes that the consciousness of workers does not automatically result from their dialectical position in relation <jats:italic>to</jats:italic>the capital‐owning class but needs to be aroused and directed towards the struggle for complete emancipation. The relative divorce between workers organizations and the national movements he poses as a key problem for the future.</jats:p>",

Earlier anxieties, however, did not materialise since new materials have been discovered or new methods introduced to produce and process them. This study surveys the history of some three dozen materials which are new, or were ‘new’ at the time of their introduction in general use. Many of them were developed or discovered as the outcome of a need—wartime or market pressure—whilst others were the result of spontaneous and random scientific/technological push. The conclusion suggests that whilst history does not necessarily repeat itself in solving future problems of material shortages it provides basis for the hope that progress will overcome possibly emerging scarcities.</jats:p>",
