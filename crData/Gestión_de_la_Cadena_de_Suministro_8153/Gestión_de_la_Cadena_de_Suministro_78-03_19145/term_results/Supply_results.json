      "abstract": "<jats:p>Russian liberals can easily be cast as weakhearted idealists, devoted to Western notions of fair play and moderation and naively optimistic of the chances of seeing those principles brought to life in their own country. As the opposing forces of the state and the revolution build toward their climax in 1917, the liberal Hamlets often appear incapable of seizing the moment. Yet consider the efforts of the “public organizations”—the War-Industry Committees, the Union of Zemstvos, and the Union of Towns, as well as the Progressive Bloc in the Duma—to take over the practical matter of running Russia's war effort during the First World War. Prince George Lvov, head of the Provisional Government until the July Days of 1917, seems to personify this stereotype of well-meaning yet tragically ineffective liberalism on the eve of the Bolshevik Revolution, but it was this same figure who energetically directed the Union of Zemstvos during the war.</jats:p>",

Within 6 h, IAA caused a significant increase in the incorporation of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C into protein. Most of the <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C activity lost to nectar in flowers treated with IAA was recovered in the ethanol-soluble materials and protein of the flowers. Radioactivity continued to accumulate in the secretory tissue after secretion had stopped. The percentage reduction in nectar by IAA was not diminished under conditions of minimal growth and sugar transport distance. It was concluded that IAA acts on the secretory process in the nectary cells rather than on movement of sugar to the nectary.The influence of differences in sugar supply appeared mainly in the distribution of <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C activity between peduncles and nectar: as sugar supply was increased, a smaller percentage remained in the peduncles and a larger percentage was secreted. The secretory process competed strongly with floral tissues for sugar even when the latter were undersupplied. </jats:p>",
