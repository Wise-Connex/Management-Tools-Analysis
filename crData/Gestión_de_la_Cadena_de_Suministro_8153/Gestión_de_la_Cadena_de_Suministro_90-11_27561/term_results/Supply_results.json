The modulated quantum well structure comprised a 4 monolayer (ML) modulated layer and an 18 ML GaAs layer between AlAs barrier layers. The modulated layer was grown by incorporating As into a Ga and Al mixture on an AlAs surface. The main peak energy of the PL spectra at 77 K showed a growth temperature dependence; a remarkable red shfit of the main peak energy was observed for samples grown at low temperature. The red shift of the PL peak energy indicates an increase in the effective width of the GaAs well. A rearrangement model of Ga and Al atoms on the AlAs surface during growth with As incorporation into the Ga and Al mixture is proposed to explain the growth temperature dependence of the PL peak energy.</jats:p>",

Five adult minipigs with a permanent caecal ‘T’ cannula were fed on a semi-synthetic, biotin-deficient diet for 4 months. Following an 8-week adaptation period there were nine sequential 1-week infusion periods with or without oral lactulose or antibiotics. Avidin infusion during weeks 2, 5 and 8 amounted to 18 mg/d (13 U/mg). Plasma biotin concentrations were not changed by avidin infusions. There was a significant average 84% rise in faecal biotin excretion during the avidin periods. Urinary biotin output following avidin decreased by 21 %. This is taken as evidence that biotin synthesized by colonic bacteria is available for host metabolism. A rough estimate shows that under basal conditions 1.7–17% of the metabolic allowance may be covered by this metabolic route.</jats:p>",

Following their acquisition in 1816, the Elgin Marbles were added to periodically in an attempt to render the collection – at least where the Parthenon sculptures were concerned – as complete as possible. These additions include some fragments of original sculpture but, mostly, they consist of casts of sculpture found on the Acropolis following Greek independence. The activities of the Greek Archaeological Society on the Acropolis, removing later accretions and restoring the monuments, created a desire in Athens for casts of the Elgin Marbles. The story of the two-way traffic in casts between Athens and London is told here and documented from the archives of the British Museum.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mime-subtype=\"gif\" mimetype=\"image\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"S0068245400015598_inline1\" /></jats:p>",

Basal metabolism, important to maintain cellular function and integrity, is strongly inhibited. In the present study, we address the question of whether the inhibition of basal processes in hypoxia determines redevelopment of force in reoxygenation. By not stimulating the muscle during hypoxia, we try to make more ATP available for basal processes. Isometric force of papillary muscles (0.2-Hz stimulation) is measured before, during, and after 40 minutes of hypoxia. ATP formation and utilization in hypoxia are estimated from lactate production and changes in nucleotides and creatine compounds. After reoxygenation, muscles stimulated during hypoxia produce a steady-state force of 78% of the aerobic control; resting muscles recover to 94%. In contrast to expectation, lactate production in hypoxic resting muscles is only 30% of that in contracting ones. The findings indicate that basal metabolic rate of hypoxic muscles at rest is 14% of that of quiescent, well-oxygenated myocardium. We conclude that in hypoxic myocardium little ATP is available for basal metabolism, irrespective of the energy demand of the contractile system. It is therefore unlikely that the lower force found after reoxygenation in muscles stimulated during hypoxia is related to the degree of inhibition of basal processes.</jats:p>",

This result indicates that nearly complete atomic coverage is successfully proceeded in each step as a result of the termination of alkyl radicals adsorbed on the surface by hydrogen.

Chardonnay, and Carignane). In the field, leaves of vines growing on soil with low available P exhibited symptoms of Mg deficiency and had low P and Mg concentrations. The rate of photosynthesis for leaves of untreated control vines was approximately 0.7 nmol CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>s<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>. When P fertilizer was applied to the soil, Mg deficiency symptoms were eliminated, and leaf P and Mg concentrations increased to above critical levels. When Mg was applied as a foliar spray, leaf Mg increased to above critical levels, but leaf P did not change significantly. In both experiments, the rate of photosynthesis increased to greater than 1.0 nmol CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>s<jats:sup>1</jats:sup>after nutrient applications. Thus, under low soil P conditions, leaf photosynthesis was limited by leaf Mg concentrations. In glasshouse experiments in which vines were grown with and without P for three seasons, Mg accumulated in large roots of ‐ P vines to approximately twice the concentration found in roots of + P vines. Analysis of the xylem exudate from detopped plants showed that Mg concentration in xylem sap of + P vines was twice as great as that in ‐ P vines. When P was supplied to ‐ P vines, the concentration of Mg increased to the concentration of + P vines within 2 days. The results show that the translocation of Mg from roots to shoots of grapevine is dependent upon P supply to the roots and suggest that Mg translocation is more sensitive than uptake to P supply.</jats:p>",
