In this article, we have applied an analytic technique rarely used in educational research, proportional hazards modeling, to resolve these problems and to investigate the relationship between teachers' background characteristics and their career durations. We find that teacher demographic characteristics and subject specialty are important predictors of length of stay in teaching. Our results call into question several assumptions about teacher career persistence implicit in the national teacher supply and demand model. We also argue that proportional hazards modeling has wide applicability to many educational research questions. </jats:p>",

Their affiliates were among the first to arrive in the Northeast of Scotland in the early days of the development of the northern North Sea oil province. British companies, even by 1984, had made limited progress in creating a competitive presence with the leading foreign offshore oil supply firms, and they remained primarily as suppliers of locationally determined inputs. </jats:p>",

To test the hypothesis that epinephrine improves the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, myocardial adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and lactate concentrations were measured before and immediately after 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in 10 control dogs and 10 dogs given intravenous epinephrine (1-mg bolus followed by 0.2 mg/min). Left ventricular myocardial blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation was measured with radioactive microspheres and was significantly higher in the epinephrine group (48 +/- 11 vs. 21 +/- 4 ml/min/100 g, p less than 0.05). However, myocardial lactate concentration increased significantly (p less than 0.01) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in both groups and tended to increase more in epinephrine-treated animals. Myocardial ATP concentration decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) and by comparable amounts in the two groups. These findings suggest that large doses of epinephrine may fail to improve the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even when they result in a substantial increase in coronary blood flow.</jats:p>",
