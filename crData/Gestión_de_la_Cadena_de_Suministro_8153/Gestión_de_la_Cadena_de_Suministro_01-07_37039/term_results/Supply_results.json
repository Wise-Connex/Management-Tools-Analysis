The impacts of the new era will challenge supply chain managers to adjust relations with suppliers and customers, contend with transportation difficulties and amend inventory management strategies. This paper looks at the twin corporate challenges of (i) preparing to deal with the aftermath of terrorist attacks and (ii) operating under heightened security. The first challenge involves setting certain operational redundancies. The second means less reliable lead times and less certain demand scenarios. In addition, the paper looks at how companies should organize to meet those challenges efficiently and suggests a new public‐private partnership. While the paper is focused on the US, it has worldwide implications.</jats:p>",

Academic and industrial attention has also focused on the role of seamless supply chain processes in achieving and sustaining competitive advantage. This research is based on petrol retailers in the UK that have adopted logistics outsourcing strategies for implementing supply chain solutions to their convenience‐goods operations. Its aim is to identify the factors, which influence outsourcing decisions and the nature and supply chain implications of outsourcing strategies. Research findings indicate that the capability of service providers to facilitate supply chain solutions is largely influenced by four main factors, which in turn substantially determine their role in the supply chain: the strategic orientation of the outsourcing organization; its perception of service providers' role within the logistics strategy; the nature of the resultant client‐provider relationship; and, the extent to which the logistics process is outsourced.</jats:p>",

In this study executives randomly selected from a diverse array of industries were surveyed to determine the scope of processes that are being integrated across organizational borders, the extent to which they are being jointly managed, and the span in terms of the number of tiers across which they are being managed. The results indicate that a large proportion of companies that practice supply chain management are attempting to integrate logistics, marketing, and operations‐oriented processes with those of other companies in their supply chains. Also, the span of a company's supply chain management efforts significantly relates to the extent to which it jointly manages business processes with other firms.</jats:p>",

This is also a first step in developing estimates of customers' lifetime values. This exercise, however, takes on additional complexities when applied to an intermediary in a supply chain, such as a distributor, because the costs of servicing a retail customer include not only those incurred directly in servicing this customer but also those incurred by the distributor in dealing with its own vendors for goods supplied to this customer. The authors develop a general model and measurement methodology to relate customer profitability to customer characteristics in a supply chain. The authors show how heterogeneity in customer purchasing characteristics leads to important profit implications and illustrate the implementation of the methodology using data from a large distributor that supplies to grocery and other retail businesses. </jats:p>",

In ITU (1999) official waiting lists numbered about 50 million worldwide with an average waiting time of two years. More than 100 countries had not eliminated the waiting list for telephone connections and hence a supply restricted market prevailed in all of these countries. Only about 25 countries have succeeded in eradicating their waiting list for basic telephone service. In terms of the pattern of diffusion, the subscriber's flow from waiting applicants to adopters is controlled by supply restrictions adding an important dimension that needs to be addressed when modeling and forecasting demand. An empirical analysis of the diffusion of main telephones in 46 supply‐restricted countries is presented to demonstrate the usefulness of a three‐stage Bass model that has been proposed to capture the dynamics of supply restrictions. We also compare the forecasting ability of different approaches to estimation when panel data are available. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Supply chains often consist of several tiers, with different numbers of firms competing at each tier. A major determinant of the structure of supply chains is the cost structure associated with the underlying manufacturing process. In this paper, we examine the impact of fixed and variable costs on the structure and competitiveness of supply chains with a serial structure and price-sensitive linear deterministic demand. The entry stage is modeled as a simultaneous game, where the players take the outcomes of the subsequent post-entry (Cournot) competition into account in making their entry decisions. We derive expressions for prices and production quantities as functions of the number of entrants at each tier of a multitier chain. We characterize viability and stability of supply-chain structures and show, using lattice arguments, that there is always an equilibrium structure in pure strategies in the entry game. Finally, we examine the effects of vertical integration in the two-tier case. Altogether, the paper provides a framework for comparing a variety of supply-chain structures and for studying how they are affected by cost structures and by the number of entrants throughout the chain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are many materials for which the quantity needed by a firm is at best indirectly related to the quantity of final product produced by that firm, such as solvents in manufacturing processes or office supplies. For any such “indirect” materials, an inescapable incentive conflict exists: The buyer wishes to minimize consumption of these indirect materials, while the supplier's profits depend on increasing volume. Both buyer and supplier can exert effort to reduce consumption, hence making the overall supply chain more efficient. However, no supplier will voluntarily participate unless contract terms are fundamentally revised. This can be done through a variety of “shared-savings” contracts, where both parties profit from a consumption reduction. This paper analyzes several such contracts currently in use for chemicals purchasing. We show that such contracts can always increase supply-chain profits but need not lead to reduced consumption. We analyze equilibrium effort levels, consumption, and total profits, and show how these change with the contract parameters. We find that the goals of maximizing joint profits and minimizing consumption are generally not aligned. Also, surprisingly, a decrease in a cost parameter can lead to a decrease in profits; it may be necessary (but is always possible) to renegotiate the shared-savings contract to reap the benefits of a cost decrease. </jats:p>",

The project was implemented with the aim of meeting the complete energy requirements of a small isolated fishing village, while minimizing fuel consumption and C02 emissions. We focus on the decisions taken and lessons learned during configuration of the hybrid system. The project offers a working model for the application of renewable energy to an isolated community where there is no external electricity supply. We analyse nine hypotheses for the system's configuration and operation including the option of using diesel only as a base for comparison. Our results show that the hybrid systems, though employing high percentages of wind energy, were actually more expensive in terms of units of energy produced than the diesel only option. Therefore, a reduction in C02 emissions implies additional costs in the energy supply system. </jats:p>",

The supply chain concept is still nascent in India. However the need for the same, at this stage, is more than ever before because of the challenges unleashed on the competitiveness of the Indian industry by deregulation and globalisation. An essential first step in the process is to assess the current supply chain capability. The article is based on a recently concluded extensive research carried out jointly by Management Development Institute, Gurgaon and KPMG India, the first of its kind in the country, to gauge the current state of supply chain management in the Indian industry. The research concludes that a beginning has been made and large number of Indian organisations today are realising the importance of developing and implementing a comprehensive supply chain strategy - and then linking that strategy to deliver bottom-line results. </jats:p>",

Two <jats:italic>Canna edulis</jats:italic> genotypes were studied in semi‐controlled greenhouse experiments at the International Potato Centre (CIP) near Quito, Ecuador. Under conditions of low water supply, shoot dry matter (DM), leaf area and specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) all decreased, while WUE was higher and carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) decreased. The large water‐storing hypodermal cells characteristic of this plant's leaf morphology shrank, concertina‐like, the leaves became thinner, and the specific leaf area increased significantly (from 26 m<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup> kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup> to 43 m<jats:sup>‐2</jats:sup> kg<jats:sup>‐1</jats:sup>). In a second experiment, plants were grown with three different levels of nitrogen supply: from low to high N supply, shoot DM increased significantly (from 16 to 37 g), along with leaf area and SLN. At the lowest level of nitrogen supply (N0), WUE was significantly lower and Δ increased. As expected, the linear correlation between Δ and WUE was negative, but variation in Δ could only explain 49 % of the variation in WUE. If, in addition to Δ, measured root fraction (RF) and estimated values of leaf‐to‐air vapour pressure deficit (Δe) and respiratory and unproductive carbon loss were used to calculate WUE, the correlation between measured and calculated WUE was substantially improved, except for the water stress treatment. It is considered that, for root and tuber crops, RF and Δe are the major variables when Δ of single leaves is to be used for up‐scaling to plant WUE.</jats:p>",

The experiment was organized in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in three replicates. At low concentration of calcium (5 mM), sunflower growth decreased drastically with increasing concentration of NaCl in nutrient solution. On the other hand, plants grown in high concentration of NaCl experienced less damage with relatively higher concentration of calcium. At relatively higher concentration of calcium (10 mM Ca), sunflower plants absorbed and translocated relatively more potassium and less sodium, than at low concentration of calcium (5 mM Ca), demonstrating the positive role of calcium in alleviating the hazardous effects of salinity on sunflower growth.</jats:p>",
