Our recent study showed that the conventional Hubbert model with one complete production cycle is not appropriate for use in forecasting gas production trends for most gas producing countries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents our forecast for the world's supply of conventional natural gas to the year 2050. We used a multicyclic Hubbert approach to develop 53 country-specific gas supply models that enable production forecasts for virtually all of the world's gas. The multicyclic modeling approach is presented in a convenient form that makes production data exhibiting two or more cycles easier to model. These models were aggregated to the regional level and to the world level. Supply models for some organizations (e.g. OPEC, non-OPEC, OECD) were also developed and analyzed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our results indicate that the world's supply of natural gas will peak in 2014, followed by an annual depletion rate of 1%/yr. A regional analysis indicates that gas production of some regions will peak soon. North American gas production is currently (1999) at its peak. West European gas production is expected to peak in 2002. The countries of the former Soviet Union and Middle East, which comprise about 60% of world's ultimate recovery of natural gas, will be the main sources of world gas supply in the future.</jats:p>",

The “perceived quality” approach to product quality is adopted and the links between intrinsic/extrinsic cues and experience/credence attributes of a product are developed. The framework is applied to the UK meat sector by considering which attributes/cues are altered by farm assurance schemes and, hence, which type of cue is needed to signal these attributes, and what elements are necessary for effective signalling of this type of cue. It is shown that the necessary requirements for effective communication of each type of cue (intrinsic and extrinsic) vary considerably. Farm assurance schemes are shown to affect credence attributes; hence extrinsic cues must be used to signal these standards. It is concluded that the credibility of scheme standards and inspections to those standards is of crucial importance for the assurance scheme extrinsic cue (certificate/label) to be effective in predicting these credence attributes.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes the use of what are called responsibility tokens (RTs) to further facilitate that operationalization. The proposal assumes that a management information system, presumably electronic, is established to monitor inventories and shipment quantities, and to carry out transfer payments between players. As in Lee and Whang(1999), the incentives of the system are aligned, so if each player is brilliantly self-serving, the system optimal solution will result. While the system administrator need not know how the system should be managed, the most upstream player must know how to manage the system optimally for the system optimal solution to be achieved. RTs endow the system with an attractive self-correcting property: An example illustrates that upstream players are given a mechanism and the incentive to correct for downstream overordering. The downstream players who over-order are penalized, but system performance is not degraded much. Extensions and further research are also discussed. </jats:p>",

The central question in this study is whether access to piped water and a flush toilet affects the survival chance of children under five in urban areas of Eritrea. The study uses data collected by the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) project in Eritrea in 1995. The results show that while the unadjusted effect of household environment (water supply and toilet facility) is large and statistically significant during the post-neonatal and child periods, it is relatively small and statistically insignificant during the neonatal period. The effect of household environment remains substantial during the post-neonatal and child periods, even when other socioeconomic variables are held constant. However, the household environment effect totally disappears during the neonatal period when the socioeconomic factors are controlled for.</jats:p>",

Under conditions of heavy exercise it is ultimately the working skeletal muscle cells that determine the aerobic demand as over 90% of energy is spent in muscle cells. Oxygen is transported in the circulation bound to haemoglobin of erythrocytes while substrates are transported in the plasma. The supply of oxygen must be continuous because there are only minimal oxygen stores in the body of most mammalian species while substrates are stored in significant quantities both within muscle cells as also in organismic substrate stores. The pathways for oxygen and substrates ultimately converge in muscle mitochondria. In mammals, a structural limitation of carbohydrate and lipid transfer from the microvascular system to muscle cells is reached at a moderate work intensity (i.e. at less than 50% of <jats:italic>V˙</jats:italic><jats:sc>O</jats:sc><jats:sub>2max</jats:sub>). At higher work rates intracellular substrate stores must be used for oxidation. It is therefore not surprising to find larger intramyocellular carbohydrate and lipid stores in ‘athletic’ species as well as in endurance‐trained human athletes. The transfer limitations for carbohydrates and lipids presumably occur on the level of the sarcolemma. These findings imply that the design of the respiratory cascade from lungs to muscle mitochondria has to be analysed with regard to satisfying the demand for oxygen of the working muscle cells. Substrate stores are replenished at low flux rates during periods of rest and are stored intracellularly. They are therefore locally available to mitochondria for aerobic work at high intensities.</jats:p>",

From 1905 to 1920, cassava products met the additional demand for carbohydrates, which grew with purchasing power. During the interwar years, per capita food supply decreased slightly, mainly because demand shifted from staple foods to cheap manufactures. From 1943 to 1970, Indonesia experienced a drastic fall in food supply per capita due to an acceleration in population growth, restrictive regulations imposed on food markets, and the general demise of the Indonesian economy. The upward trend in per capita food supply since the 1960s was caused largely by increases in rice production, generated by government support to rice farmers. Higher incomes brought an increased demand for food, which could be met with inexpensive rice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An adequate supply of oxygen is essential for the normal function of all cells. Because skeletal muscle cells have the ability to vary their oxygen demand by over an order of magnitude on going from rest to vigorous contraction, it is important that mechanisms be in place to ensure that the supply of oxygen is maintained at sufficient levels. Microcirculation plays a critical role in this process, as the terminal branches of this intricate network of blood vessels determine the distribution of perfusion, as well as the structural framework for diffusion. The oxygen supply depends on proper functioning of both the convective and diffusive components of the transport system. Convection is responsible for the long‐range, rapid transport of oxygen by bulk flow of the blood and diffusion is the efficient mechanism for transport over the short distances between capillaries and muscle cells. Convective transport is dominated by the movement of red blood cells, as virtually all the oxygen at normal haematocrit is carried inside them, reversibly bound to haemoglobin. Over the years, specialized techniques, many of them video‐based, have been developed for use in intravital microscopy to measure the parameters needed to quantify convection and diffusion in both capillaries and the larger microvessels, arterioles and venules. Most of our knowledge of oxygen transport in the microcirculation of muscle pertains to the resting condition, because one must be able to visualize the structures of interest, such as microvessels and muscle cells, and the large tissue movements that occur during contraction preclude measurements during that time. In resting muscle it has been found that the arterioles are the primary site of the diffusion of oxygen from the circulation, where the oxygen is utilized by nearby muscle cells or diffuses directly to nearby venules or capillaries. Diffusive interactions among neighbouring capillaries have also been observed. In contracting muscles, microvessels observed immediately following the period of stimulation exhibit enhancements of both convective (increased flow of red blood cells) and diffusive (increased perfused capillary surface area) transport. The use of computational models in the interpretation of experimental studies is leading to an increased understanding of the processes that underlie the oxygen transport system in skeletal muscle.</jats:p>",

An instrumental variable approach is then used to recover the household's structural labor supply from variations in the shadow wages and income, as well as other household characteristics. The findings reveal that both male and female total labor supply are sensitive to changes in shadow wages and income. Human capital embodied in education is found to exert a significant positive effect on output, but has no statistically significant impact on total labor supply of individuals.

We asked which factors regulate macroalgal bloom intensity, distribution and species composition. In field experiments in the Baltic Sea, we analyzed the relative effects of nutrients, herbivores and algal propagule banks on population development and dominance patterns in two co‐occurring bloom‐forming macroalgae, <jats:italic>Enteromorpha \nintestinalis</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Pilayella littoralis</jats:italic>. \nBoth species were highly affected by the combined effects of a propagule \nbank, herbivory and nutrients. The magnitude of effects varied with \nseason. The propagule bank was an important overwintering mechanism for \nboth algae, and allowed for recruitment two months earlier than \nrecruitment via freshly dispersed propagules. This provided a seasonal \nescape from intense herbivory and nutrient limitation later in the year. \nFavored by massive recruitment from the propagule bank, \n<jats:italic>Enteromorpha</jats:italic> was the superior space occupier in early spring, \nthereby reducing recruitment of <jats:italic>Pilayella</jats:italic>. Elimination of the \npropagule bank and recruitment via freshly dispersed propagules favored \n<jats:italic>Pilayella</jats:italic>. Strong and selective herbivory on <jats:italic>Enteromorpha</jats:italic> \nsupported <jats:italic>Pilayella</jats:italic> in the presence, but not in the absence of the \npropagule bank. Nutrient enrichment in summer counteracted herbivore \npressure on <jats:italic>Enteromorpha</jats:italic>, thereby negatively affecting \n<jats:italic>Pilayella</jats:italic>. Herbivore and nutrient effects were more pronounced for early life stages than adult algae.  These results show that recruitment processes and forces affecting early life stages at the beginning of the vegetation period determine development and dominance patterns of macroalgal blooms. Herbivores naturally suppress blooms but increasing nutrient enrichment can override this important control mechanism. The propagule bank plays a previously unrecognized role for population and community dynamics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The volatility of commercial property markets in the United Kingdom has stimulated the development of explanatory models of ‘price’ determination. These models have tended to focus on the demand-side as the driver of change. A corollary of this is that, despite the fact that construction lags are known to exacerbate cyclical fluctuations, the supply-side adjustment mechanism has been subject to relatively little research effort. In this paper the authors develop a new model of commercial property markets in the United Kingdom. The model is adapted from Poterba's two-equation asset-market approach to modelling the housing market. The first equation is an arbitrage relationship where the return on property is made up of rent, as determined in the user market for property services, and the capital gain, which is dependent on the return on alternative assets. This can be interpreted as a ‘stock’ demand equation. The second equation explains that ‘flow’ supply is determined by real capital values. The long-run empirical generalisation of the two-equation model allows the authors to estimate two key behavioural parameters required in explaining supply-side adjustment to market change. First, the authors interpret the coefficient on the capital value variable in the supply equation as an estimate of the long-run ‘price’ elasticity of supply. Second, from the demand equation, they estimate the extent to which new supply can act as an ‘automatic stabiliser’ on property values. It is argued that although increases in demand drive up property values, new development is also initiated and will, in turn, dampen down the growth in real capital values. The equations are estimated for the office, industrial, and retail sectors. Although there are no comparable estimates of supply elasticities in the real estate economics literature, the results are generally consistent with prior knowledge. Estimates of the stabiliser effect are also plausible and, taken together, the supply-side parameters help provide insights required in understanding property market dynamics in the last twenty-five years. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>The principal supply of carbon precursors for fatty acid synthesis in leaf tissue has been a much debated topic, with some experiments suggesting a direct supply from the C3 products of photosynthetic carbon fixation and colleagues suggesting the utilization of free acetate (for which concentrations in leaves in the range of 0.05–1.4 mM have been reported). To address this issue we first reassessed the <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> rate of fatty acid synthesis using a new method, that of [<jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C]carbon dioxide labeling of intact <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic> plants with the subsequent analysis of fatty acids by gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS). This method gave an average value of 2.3 mmoles carbon atoms h<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> mg chlorophyll<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> for photosynthetic tissues. The method was extended by isotopic dilution analysis to measure the rate of fatty acid synthesis in the dark. There was negligible fatty acid synthesis (&lt; 5% of the rate in the light) in the dark. In addition, the method allowed an estimate of the absolute rate of fatty acid degradation of about 4% of the total fatty acid content per day. With the <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> rate of fatty acid synthesis in the light defined, if the bulk tissue acetate concentration available for fatty acid synthesis is 1 mM, this acetate pool can sustain fatty acid synthesis for approximately 60 min. When the leaves of <jats:italic>Arabidopsis</jats:italic>, barley and pea were given a 5 min pulse of [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]carbon dioxide, the label rapidly appeared in fatty acids with a lag phase of less than 2–3 min. Continuous labeling with [<jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C]carbon dioxide, for up to 1 h, showed a similar result. Furthermore, <jats:sup>14</jats:sup>C‐label in free acetate was less than 5% of that in fatty acids. In conclusion, these data suggest that either the bulk pool of acetate is not involved in fatty acid synthesis or the concentration of acetate must be less than 0.05 mM under strong illumination.</jats:p>",

Consequently, shifts in the earth's radiative balance are expected with accompanying alterations to the earth's climate. With these anticipated, and perhaps already observable, changes in both global and regional climate, managers of regional water resources seek insight to the possible impacts climate change may have on their present and future water supplies. The types and degrees of impacts that climate change may have on New York City's water supply system were assessed in a study of a watershed at Allaben, New York. Hypothetical scenarios of future climate and climate change projections from three General Circulation Models (GCMs) were used in conjunction with the WatBal hydrological model and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) to ascertain how runoff and soil moisture from this watershed may change in a warmer climate. For the worst case predictions, the results indicate that within the century of the 2000s, the watershed's air temperature may increase up to about 11°F, while its precipitation and runoff may decrease by about 13 and 30 percent, respectively. If this watershed is typical of the others within the New York City water supply system, the system's managers should consider implementing mitigation and adaptation strategies in preparation for the worst of these possible future conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Twenty-four multiparous ewes were used to test the hypothesis that synchronizing the hourly rate of release of energy and nitrogen in the rumen would optimize milk production. Three diets were formulated using the in situ degradability of the food ingredients, to differ in their rate of organic matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) release in the rumen. All diets contained 400 g grass silage per kg dry matter (DM) and were predicted to have a similar content of metabolizable energy (11·8 MJ/kg DM), metabolizable protein (102 g/kg DM), neutral-detergent fibre (365 g/kg DM) and daily ratio of N: OM supply to the rumen but differ in their hourly pattern of nutrient release to be either synchronous (S), asynchronous (A) or intermediate (I). The diets were offered ad libitum as a complete feed in a 3<jats:bold>×</jats:bold>3 Latin-square design consisting of three periods each of 28 days duration. Synchronizing the hourly supply of energy and N to the rumen did not significantly alter milk or milk fat yield (g/d), milk protein content (g/kg), DM intake (kg/day), total time spent eating or the number of meals per day. However, compared with ewes offered diets I or A, those offered diet S had a lower milk fat content (g/kg;<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0·05) whilst protein yield (g/day) tended to be increased (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>= 0·05). Animals offered the synchronous diet (S) had lower plasma urea concentrations throughout the day and significantly higher beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations at 14:00 and 18:00 h than those offered diets I or A. In conclusion, synchronizing dietary energy and N supply to the rumen did not have a major effect on milk production in ewes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We performed superselective angiography in 28 hips in 25 patients with Perthes’ disease in order to study the blood supply of the lateral epiphyseal arteries (LEAs). Interruption of the LEAs at their origin was observed in 19 hips (68%). Revascularisation in the form of numerous small arteries was seen in ten out of 11 hips in the initial stage of Perthes’ disease, in seven of eight in the fragmentation stage and in five of nine in the healing stage. Penetration of mature arteries into the depths of the epiphysis was seen in four of nine hips in the healing stage. Vascular penetration was absent in the weight-bearing portion of the femoral head below the acetabular roof. Interruption of the posterior column artery was seen where it passed through the capsule in seven hips when they lay either in internal rotation or in abduction with internal rotation. </jats:p><jats:p> We suggest that in Perthes’ disease the blood supply of the LEAs is impaired at their origin and that revascularisation occurs from this site by ingrowth of small vessels into the femoral epiphysis. This process may be the result of recurrent ischaemic episodes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract.</jats:bold> This study is a continuation of previous work searching for possible anatomic reasons to explain variable and usually unpredictable postoperative pain and dysfunction after the same nerve losses with similar neck dissection operations. The study consisted of dissections of 19 deceased unpreserved elderly subjects arterially injected with dyed latex. Of the 19 subjects, 14 had brain stem and cervical spinal cord dissections, and all had neck dissections. The findings suggested two possible anatomic reasons for the pain and dysfunction: (i) The intracranial anatomy of the lower four cranial nerves, the glossopharyngeal (IX), the vagus (X), the spinal accessory (XI), and the hypoglossal (XII), was just as variable as the previously reported peripheral spinal accessory nerve plexus; and (ii) Both the intracranial and neck dissections indicated that the blood supply to the lower four cranial and cervical nerves, particularly to the brachial plexus, could be impaired by atherosclerosis and/or neuroforaminal impingement or operative loss. This loss of blood supply theoretically could result in ischemia as another possible cause of postoperative pain and dysfunction. It is concluded that because of the potential importance of each nerve and vessel, often unknown at operation, it is very important to spare as many of them as possible to avoid subsequent painful impairment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the Chile triple junction (CTJ) cruise (March–April 1997), EM12 bathymetry and seismic reflection data were collected in the vicinity of the Chile triple junction (45‐480S), where an active spreading ridge is being subducted beneath the Andean continental margin. Results show a continental margin development shaped by tectonic processes spanning a spectrum from subduction‐erosion to subduction‐accretion. The Andean continental margin and the Chile trench exhibit a strong segmentation which reflects the slab segmentation and the Chile triple junction migration. Three segments were identified along the Andean continental margin: the presubduction, the synsubduction, and the postsubduction segments, from north to south. Both climate‐induced variations of the sediment supply to the trench and the tectonic reorganization at the Nazca‐Antarctica plate boundary involving postsubduction ridge jump are the two main factors that control the tectonic regime of this continental margin. Along the survey area we infer the succession of two different periods during the last glacial‐interglacial cycle: a glacial period with ice‐rafted detrital discharges restricted to the shoreline area and low river output and a warmer period during which the Andean ice cap retreat allowed the Andes to be drained off. During these warm periods, rapid increase in trench deposition caused the margin to switch from subductionerosion or nonaccretion to subduction‐accretion: (1) along the presubduction segment after the last deglaciation and (2) along the postsubduction segment after the interglacial episode at 130–117 ka. Conversely, a nonaccretion or subduction‐érosion mode characterized the presubduction and postsubduction segments during glacial maximums. The major effects of subduction of the buoyant Chile ridge include a shallow trench which diverts trench sediment supply and tectonic instabilities at the Nazca‐Antarctica plate boundary. We suggest that a postsubduction westward jump of the Chile ridge occurred during the past 780 kyr. It produced slab fragmentation and individualization of an ephemeral microplate north of the Taitao fracture zone: the Chonos microplate. In 780 kyr, two episodes of subduction‐accretion separated by an episode of subduction‐erosion occurred in relation with the Chonos microplate individualization and subduction. The current northward migration of the triple junction along the Chonos microplate‐South America plate boundary introduces a sharp change in the tectonic mode from subduction‐erosion to the north to subduction‐accretion to the south. The data collected along the Taitao ridge have revealed the complex three‐dimensional structure of an accretionary wedge which includes a midslope thrust sheet exhibiting the characteristics of an ophiolite: the Taitao Ridge ophiolite. No connection exists between the Taitao Ridge ophiolite and the Bahia Barrientos ophiolite cropping out onland in the Taitao peninsula.</jats:p>",
