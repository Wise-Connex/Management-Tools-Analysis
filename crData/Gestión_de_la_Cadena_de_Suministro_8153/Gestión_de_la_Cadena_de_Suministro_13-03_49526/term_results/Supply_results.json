      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing population is leading to water shortfalls in urban areas across the world. Shortfalls are intensified in arid and semi-arid regions under climate change through reduced and highly variable rainfall and greater frequency of droughts. Water planners are increasingly considering investments in capital infrastructure to enhance water security. Augmentation involves high capital sunk costs, and a typical challenge that arises is the need to determine whether or not, and at what scale, to invest in augmentation. Water planners face a risk of over- and under-investing in augmentation, but assessments that represent the tradeoffs involved in making augmentation decisions accurately and comprehensively are scarce. The analytical framework presented in this paper, looks retrospectively at what the insurance value of a seawater desalination plant in Adelaide would have been, had the investment been a decade earlier than it was, to illustrate assessing the risk of over- or under-investing in augmentation. The framework draws from three concepts: benefit cost analysis (BCA), probability theory, and conditional value at risk (CVaR). Results show that, at best, had the desalinisation plant been operational during the recent millennium drought, from 1998 to 2010, potential net annual cost of up to a maximum of A$170.6 m in extreme shortfall years, would have been avoided, but this would have involved incurring annual cost of up to A$149.0 m in years of no shortfalls.</jats:p>",

Physical product, information systems and financial flows are closely aligned with each other throughout the supply chain incorporating Motorola, its customers, suppliers and banks. The overall trend is towards the development of an integrated global financial supply chain in which cash flows mirror product flows. Motorola shares financial data with its suppliers as part of a cooperative strategy that generates cost savings for Motorola and its suppliers in areas such as foreign exchange and cash balances. The cooperative strategy also improves the quality of the payments process measured by six sigma techniques and produces strategic benefits such as risk reduction for the supply chain as a whole in areas such as foreign exchange and payments. A strategy of this type is only possible by taking a global perspective of the financial supply chain.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>The development of financial supply chains has not been fully addressed in the supply chain management literature.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The supply and treatment of water is a highly energy intensive process, resulting in large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions as well as incurring large economic costs. Both governments and water service providers worldwide recognise the need for more sustainable water supply systems. In recent years, the use of hydropower turbines within water supply networks has been shown as a viable option for electricity generation. Energy can be recovered in water supply networks at locations of excessively high flow or pressure without loss in the level of service to consumers. The control of pressure to prevent burst pipes and to maintain a reliable water supply service is a top priority for water service providers. This paper presents the results of an analysis of the potential of hydropower energy recovery within water distribution systems in the UK and Ireland. Pressure and flow data were analysed to determine the extent of the potential for energy recovery. The effect of flow rate variation on turbine selection and efficiency was investigated, as well as investment payback period. It was concluded that the sustainability of water supply can be improved through the implementation of small-scale hydropower turbines within water supply networks.</jats:p>",

The provision of the focal firm's IC information to partners in its supply chain significantly increases partner's trust, satisfaction and commitment towards their relationships. Thus the results suggest that relationship transparency derived from IC transparency enhances supply chain partnerships. Relationship transparency facilitates the focal firm to develop and integrate its supply chain through improved understanding pertaining to itself and its relationships with partners in its supply chain.

The CSG will be produced at very low pressures from shallow wells, gathered and compressed into two 500 km trunk-lines for delivery to a two train LNG plant, with each train sized at 4.0mtpa capacity.

The development and implementation of specific policies and regulations contributed significantly to that trend. They also work as incentives for the development of advanced technologies and businesses as well as the widespread and growing implementation of measures for decentralized rainwater management, harvesting and utilization by public and private actors. This development can generally be associated with environmental and economic concerns related with required adaptation to changes in climate, demographic structures and infrastructures as well as climate resilience including flood control and drought resistance. The addressed and supported measures can be assigned to the two focus areas ‘Decentralized rainwater harvesting and utilization’, aiming for saving of precious fresh water resources and centrally supplied drinking water, as well as ‘decentralized rainwater retention and management’, aiming for flood control and protection of existing infrastructures and ecosystems. The decentralized management of rainwater and its separation from combined sewer systems at the source is generally regarded as the state of the art and basic condition for sustainable municipal wastewater management.</jats:p>",

No-one has time to make all the mistakes, nor to learn all the lessons on their own, so it is useful to share experiences. Over the last 25 years, the author has been involved in supply chain management as a contract manager; a programme and project manager; and as a business continuity manager. Although times change, there are some fundamental principles that are absolutely critical in making sure that supply chains do what they are needed to do/ to keep business going. Supply chains are here to stay. Indeed, with today’s drive towards outsourcing, best-shoring and contracting out, they are becoming more important every year and this will only continue over time. Moreover, in the highly competitive markets in which all organisations operate, suppliers may well be carrying out operations that not all that long ago would have been considered to be part of core business. Getting the right relationship with the supply chain is more critical than ever before.1 What does this mean to business continuity professionals? They need to think not just about their own BC plans, but about the plans of their suppliers, and even those of their suppliers’ suppliers. This may seem obvious, but unlike internal BC plans written by and for an organisation, it must be considered just what a supplier’s plans are designed to achieve. What business outcomes will their plans deliver? If they recover their own business, how does that affect the business they serve? Are others’ assumptions of how they will react in line with theirs?</jats:p>"

Representing the first application of high-throughput sequencing in drinking water microbiology, the objective of this study is to evaluate pyrosequencing as a high-throughput technique for the characterization of bacterial diversity in drinking water in comparison with conventional clone library analysis. Pyrosequencing and clone library analysis were performed in parallel to study the bacterial community composition in drinking water samples following the concentration of microbial biomass in drinking water with ultrafiltration. Validated by clone library analysis, pyrosequencing was confirmed as a highly efficient deep-sequencing technique to characterize the bacterial diversity in drinking water. Sequences of Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria dominated the bacterial community in drinking water with Oxalobacteraceae and Methylobacteriaceae as the most abundant bacterial families, which is consistent with the prominent abundance of these populations frequently detected in various freshwater environments where source waters originate. Bacterial populations represented by the most abundant sequences in drinking water were closely related to cultures of metabolically versatile bacterial taxa widely distributed in the environment, suggesting a potential link between environmental distribution, metabolic characteristics, and abundance in drinking water.</jats:p>",

These may be readily implemented in new housing developments, but experience in Australia shows their uptake by established households in urban areas is low. The majority of households employ simple and temporary methods for greywater collection and use, but their behaviour has not been well documented. We characterised the greywater use practices of over 1,000 Melbourne households during a 5-year period (2007 to 2011) which included 3 years of severe drought with stringent restrictions on outdoor tap water use. Greywater was most frequently collected from the laundry and bathroom, and generally used within 24 hours. Garden watering was the most common end use, and treatment of greywater to reduce microbial contamination was very rare. Volume estimates by householders suggest that on average around 10% of tap water used in the home was being collected for reuse. When drought conditions and water restrictions eased, over 40% of user households discontinued greywater use. Widespread adoption of permanent greywater collection, treatment and storage systems by households would be required to achieve a lasting effect on urban water consumption.</jats:p>",

I show that import volatility relative to gross domestic product (GDP) increased in the 2000s and examine whether vertical specialization (VS) trade can explain this increase. I develop and calibrate a model of VS trade that generates most of the observed increase in relative import volatility from the 1960s to the 2000s. The increase is because of GDP's shift to less volatile services production. VS trade has a negligible impact. VS causes trade to fall more in recession but also increases the share of output that is traded, leaving volatility unaffected. It increases volatility by shifting trade to more volatile sectors, but this effect is quantitatively small.</jats:italic> (<jats:italic>JEL</jats:italic> E3, F1)</jats:p>",

In this research, we study a supplier's production incentives under vague or exact quality specifications. We prove that a vague specification may in fact motivate the supplier to increase its quantity provision, resulting in a higher delivery quality. Vague quality specification can therefore be advantageous for a buyer to screen potential suppliers with an initial test order, and then rely on the received quality level to set more concrete quality guidelines. There is a degree, though, to which vague quality specification can be effective, as too much vagueness may decrease the supplier's quantity provision and hence the expected delivery quality. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Compound parabolic collectors (CPCs) have been used to enhance the inactivation rate of microorganisms. In the present study, a modified CPC with a higher concentration ratio of 1.1 was employed to further speed up the process. A large number of tests were conducted with water samples collected from different naturally contaminated water sources of varying characteristics under natural sunlight. Results indicated substantial reduction in exposure time for complete inactivation of indicator organisms, total coliforms and Escherichia coli, in modified CPCs compared with that in PET bottles at different solar intensity conditions. Even with weak solar intensity conditions (average values &amp;lt;400 W/m2), complete inactivation of test organisms could be achieved in all the test waters including those with high initial concentrations (total coliforms – 1.1 × 106 MPN/100 mL and E. coli - 1.25 × 105CFU/mL) within 6 h of exposure when modified CPC was employed. No regrowth of microorganisms was observed in the modified CPC up to 48 h of storage following exposure. The study thus suggests that the use of modified solar concentrators can result in significant reduction in the exposure time required for complete inactivation of naturally occurring microorganisms.</jats:p>",

The Court held that contractual indemnification may apply to protect an indemnified party from penalties assessed under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (\"OPA'90\") but not under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"). The Court deferred ruling on whether a material breach of contract would invalidate indemnity protection.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agriculture in Gujarat has grown rapidly over the last decade, driven at least partly by diversification to high value crops and dairying. High value agriculture requires better water control and offers higher returns for irrigation. Farmers, farm communities and the state government in Gujarat have responded to this requirement by implementing large-scale water supply and demand management projects like interlinking of rivers, the world's largest popular recharge movement, electricity distribution reforms to limit use of subsidized energy for groundwater irrigation and rapid expansion of areas under micro-irrigation. Some of these programmes have already been declared successful and are being scaled up in Gujarat (like the Saurashtra recharge movement) and emulated elsewhere (like the Jyotirgram Yojana) without much critical scrutiny. Other programmes like the initiative to spread micro-irrigation have not received the attention they deserve from the research community in spite of their apparent success. This paper subjects the biggest on-going supply- and demand-side initiatives for water management in Gujarat to critical scrutiny in light of the recent data and tries to draw lessons for the state and other parts of India facing sustainable water management challenges.</jats:p>",

The recent identification of a sedoheptulose kinase indicated that free sedoheptulose is a relevant and accessible carbon source in humans. Furthermore, the bioavailability of its phosphorylated form, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, appears to function as a rheostat for carbon-flux at the interface of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. In the present paper, we review reports of sedoheptulose metabolism, compare it with glucose metabolism, and discuss the regulation of sedoheptulose kinase as mechanism to achieve bioenergetic reprogramming in cells.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High fluoride levels beyond the recommended value of 1.5 mg/L have been detected in several groundwater wells in Northern Ghana. This occurrence has led to the capping of many high yielding wells that hitherto have been major sources of drinking water for the populace in these arid areas. Most of the fluoride removal technologies applied in the area has not been versatile in effectively removing fluoride because of the varying water qualities. This study focused on screening adsorbents including high aluminium or iron containing bauxite ores, fabricated zeolite and activated Neem seeds for removal of fluoride from drinking water. The model water used was prepared by simulating the prevailing groundwater quality in Northern Ghana. The high aluminium bauxite ore (HABO) had the highest fluoride removal capacity. Within the pH range tested (5–7), the fluoride removal decreased with increasing pH. Occurrence of sulfate, chloride and nitrate in the model water reduced the fluoride removal capacity by 57, 24 and 38% respectively. The combined effect of these anions showed a 60% reduction in the fluoride removal capacity. The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms gave an adsorption capacity (K) of 0.90 mg/g for the HABO. The adsorption kinetics fitted well the pseudo second-order kinetic model. The HABO is thermally stable and has kaolinite [Al2Si2O5(OH)5] and gibbsite [Al(OH)3] as its major components. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) results showed Al, Fe, Ti, O, C and Si as the predominant elements in the HABO.</jats:p>",

In Brisbane, Australia, provision of alternative water in new homes is mandatory and to meet this requirement rainwater tanks are considered an important option. The water savings of rainwater tanks can help defer investments in supply infrastructures. An emerging concern is that there is currently no mechanism in place for making sure that the household rainwater collection systems are maintained and in a good condition. In fact, in many locations, there is growing concern about whether the condition of this asset stock is adequate. The paper presents: a synthesis of required basic water tanks maintenance tasks; a short overview of published literature on householder motivations for maintenance; a synthesis of existing information about the condition of tanks, based on literature; simulation model results identifying the relationship between frequency of inspections and the (stationary) proportion of tanks with different types of problems; and the results of a survey to identify judgements about water tank maintenance in the region by professionals and plumbers. The paper concludes that there is a need for collecting more data and that mechanisms need to be in place to ensure the ongoing condition of tanks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Right pricing is a key to water sector reforms as it would send correct signals for its use. However, water is generally viewed as a ‘social good’ rather than an ‘economic good’, and hence pricing of water is also done accordingly. This has led to over-exploitation of water resources which has a negative bearing for sustainability. Already many states are water stressed and a large section of the population does not have access to drinking water. State and city level agencies are severely resource constrained and are providing water service to consumers at prices below cost, further aggravating their financial position. Ultimately this results in lower quality of water supply, insufficient network expansion and lesser emphasis development of water projects. This article attempts to understand the existing methodology (rationale) for pricing of urban water supply in different cities in India. It examines tariff setting practices in water sector in countries which at one time faced similar challenges but which were able to successfully reform their sectors. The paper, then examines regulatory and pricing reforms in the electricity sector in India. This is pertinent as electricity is also an essential service, pricing has been for long a political/populist decision, and inefficiencies have affected quality and availability of electricity to end consumers. Regulatory reforms in the distribution segment in the electricity sector were introduced in the late 1990s and early 2000’s and therefore sufficient time has passed to understand the impact of reforms. Based on the learning from the electricity sector and based on international experience, the article recommends principles of pricing of urban retail water supply in India, including suggesting an appropriate tariff structure. It also makes recommendations on issues such as subsides, unaccounted for water and metering. </jats:p><jats:p> [Formula: see text] </jats:p>",

This is despite the fact that selective institutions typically cost them less , owing to generous financial aid, than the two-year and nonselective four-year institutions to which they actually apply. Moreover, low-income high achievers have no reason to believe they will fail at selective institutions since those who do apply are admitted and graduate at high rates. We demonstrate that low-income high achievers' application behavior differs greatly from that of their high-income counterparts with similar achievement. The latter generally follow experts' advice to apply to several \"peer,\" a few \"reach,\" and a couple of \"safety\" colleges. We separate low-income high achievers into those whose application behavior is similar to that of their high-income counterparts (\"achievement-typical\") and those who apply to no selective institutions (\"income-typical\"). We show that income-typical students are not more disadvantaged than the achievement-typical students. However, in contrast to the achievement-typical students, income-typical students come from districts too small to support selective public high schools, are not in a critical mass of fellow high achievers, and are unlikely to encounter a teacher who attended a selective college. We demonstrate that widely used policies—college admissions recruiting, campus visits, college mentoring programs—are likely to be ineffective with income-typical students. We suggest that effective policies must depend less on geographic concentration of high achievers.</jats:p>",

Therefore, water consumption per user in non-residential buildings is still a very complicated issue for engineers and designers involved in analysing water demand and water management. This is why linking water consumption and school occupancy is the goal of this paper, trying to set the basis for further design, conservation and educational interventions on this topic. This research integrates quantitative data of water consumption, through water metering and analysis, and historical data about users in buildings. We focused on consumptions for four types of schools: nurseries (0–3-year-old children), kindergartens (3–6 years), elementary schools (6–11 years) and secondary 1st grade schools (11–14 years). The results are that the rational basic demand for water is estimated as 48.8 l per pre-school student per day and 18.7 l per elementary/secondary school student per day. Therefore we found that younger children use more water on a daily basis than older ones, probably because they need more services, such as laundries and kitchens, whereas older students consume water mainly in restrooms.</jats:p>",

We consider a supplier who offers a revenue-sharing contract to two competing retailers, one of whom has private information about uncertain market potential and orders first. This order information may be leaked to the uninformed retailer by the supplier to realize higher profits. We show that the incentives of the supplier and retailers are better aligned under a revenue-sharing contract, as opposed to under a wholesale-price contract, reducing the supplier's incentive to leak. This is true for a wide range of wholesale prices and revenue-share percentages and is more likely when the revenue-share percentage is higher and when variation in demand is greater. Preventing information leakage may result in higher profits not only for the informed retailer and supplier but surprisingly even for the uninformed retailer. Our results are robust when the model is generalized along various dimensions. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper was accepted by Yossi Aviv, operations management. </jats:p>",

The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of the HRF in removing turbidity, total organic carbon (TOC), total coliform and particulate matter. The HRF was operated at filtration rates of 1.3, 1.0 and 0.7 m/hr. At 0.7 m/hr, plain HRF (PRF) reduced turbidity by 35%, TOC by 31%, coliform by 90% and particles with average diameter &amp;gt;4 μm. For coagulated roughing filtration (CRF), the optimum alum dose of 110 mg/L (L100) was determined using jar tests. In-line, CRF of the raw water using 25% (L25) and 50% (L50) of L100 reduced turbidity by 87 and 98%, respectively. TOC removal at L50 was 41% and total coliform removal up to 99%. CRF was more effective in removing particles with average diameter &amp;gt;1 μm. CRF did not only help attenuating the turbidity shock loads but also consistently produced high quality effluent of 5–10 NTU at 55 mg/L vs 176 mg/L used by the plant. Over 98% reduction in coliform and removal of most particles of &amp;gt;1 μm diameter demonstrated that CRF would also be effective in removal of protozoa such as Giardia.</jats:p>",

Three methods are presented: a non-parametric method another based on the parametric Weibull distribution, and a third based on the parametric Herz distribution. An application with actual data related to grey cast iron water mains of two large French and German water distribution networks illustrates the implementation of the theoretical methods. The paper then investigates the link between failure rate and pipe renewal, and discusses the use of observation-based service time survival functions for infrastructure asset management.</jats:p>",

Activated carbon (AC) is a well established water treatment technology, but has high cost and low selectivity in respect of arsenic. AC made from agricultural by-products is a low-cost alternative to coal-based AC. In this study, the preparation parameters of sugar-cane activated carbon (SCAC) were optimised for arsenic(V) and arsenic(III) adsorption. The effect of preparation parameters on arsenic removal was investigated with a 23 factorial experiment. SCAC was characterised by the pH of zero charge, surface area, pore width distribution, particle size distribution and imaging under scanning electron microscopy. Activation temperature (AT) has a profound effect on arsenic adsorption; arsenic(V) adsorption increased from 2.8% at an AT of 873 K to 87.6% at an AT of 1,173 K. The percentage of arsenic removal from water has a strong positive correlation with surface area, and a strong negative correlation with micropore/pore volume ratio and the percentage in volume of particles with a size of 60–2,000 μm. In conclusion, this research shows that low-cost AC can be manufactured for removal of target pollutants, such as arsenic, from water.</jats:p>",

Better tools are required to help plant operators maintain water quality. Morgan water treatment plant (WTP) operates overnight to take advantage of off-peak electricity, however the stop/start practices add an additional complication to accurate coagulant dosing. Online monitoring and feed forward prediction is ideal in these situations as it can provide information while there is still a chance to make adjustments, unlike the feedback (post-dosing) control achieved with many other methods. Using a multiport sampling arrangement, water quality was monitored at Morgan WTP for a 6 month period. Data were validated against other online parameters and laboratory measured samples. In a comparison of predicted versus actual plant dose, results showed that treatment was optimised when the plant dose was changed in response to product water quality deterioration and eventually matched the prediction, even though this was not known to the operators at the time. The software prediction demonstrated faster reaction to inlet water quality changes and can produce more stable treated water quality. The predicted dose was added to the operator's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for several months as a real-time display to provide an additional tool to aid decision making and instill confidence in the resulting water quality.</jats:p>",

We also address many of the reservations that skeptics of laboratory experiments often express including issues of realism, participant sophistication, and payoff stakes. We then provide several examples where experiments have been used to study issues relevant to logistics and supply chain management including auctions, wholesale practices in gasoline markets, inventory replenishment, liberalization of the electric power industry, and deregulation of the natural gas markets.

However, for innovative water utilization designs that consider various scenarios, including the effects of policy direction and global warming, and more strategic and efficient water use, it is absolutely essential to consider water usage divided by residential activities, such as toilet flushing, cooking, clothes washing, and bathing. We collected micro-component data by direct measurement from each household outlet, and developed small accumulative meters. Measurements were conducted at 56 households for 2 months in Hanoi, Vietnam, and the average consumption was 18.6 L/p/d for toilet, 16.2 L/p/d for laundry, 10.4 L/p/d for bath, and 15.7 L/p/d for kitchen. We then analyzed the representative values and the distribution of water consumption for every usage from social and economic perspectives. In addition, we compared the results in Hanoi with those in Chiang Mai, Thailand, where we investigated water consumption a few years ago, and their value seemed similar except for bathroom use, but the substance was different. One distinct outcome of our investigation was the recognition of the cultural and methodological challenges to end-use assessment of water consumption in modernizing Asian communities.</jats:p>",

In Sweden, current age and material distribution is neither documented on a national level, nor for many water utilities on a local level. In this study, current network age and material distribution was provided through a questionnaire sent to Swedish water and wastewater utilities and the data provided were extrapolated to cover the whole of Sweden. The data were then combined with lifetime distribution functions to provide predictions. One limitation is that for newer materials the lifetime is still uncertain. Predictions were made for different scenarios to reflect local differences and the medium scenario shows that while the Swedish rehabilitation rate is stable, investments in monetary terms need to double in the next 60 years. The rehabilitation rate is also dependent on the extent to which the network is expanded. This method can be used to calculate national investment needs, and the results can also provide a basis for estimates for Swedish utilities with data scarcity.</jats:p>",

The reactor was operated at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 5.26, 2.63, and 1.5 h and corresponding organic loading rates (OLRs) of 2.01, 1.86, and 4.43 kg COD/m3 d, respectively. The results obtained indicated that, decreasing the HRT from 5.26 to 1.5 h negatively affected the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. Average COD percentage removal values dropped from 89.3 ± 5.4 to 72.2 ± 16% respectively. Total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations were reduced by 85.5 ± 8.3, 90.4 ± 2.1, and 91.4 ± 4.9 at HRTs of 5.26, 2.63, and 1.5 h, respectively. However, the nitrification efficiency was slightly decreased from 85.2 ± 17.4 to 82 ± 11.4% by decreasing the HRT from 5.26 to 1.5 h and increasing the OLR from 2.01 to 4.43 kg COD/m3 d, respectively. Likewise, reducing the HRT from 5.26 to 1.5 h exerted a slight negative effect on the removal of the total phosphorus (TP). Based on these results it is recommended to operate such a system at a HRT of 2.63 h and OLR not exceeding 2.0 kg COD/m3 d for providing an effluent quality complying with the standards regulating the use of treated wastewater for agricultural purposes.</jats:p>",

The proposed ACRPS has been simulated in the case of the voltage fluctuation, harmonics and frequency shift with Matlab. The simulation results show that output voltage precision is controlled within 0.5% and total harmonic distribution (THD) can be limited to less than 1%.

With two suppliers, the insight— cost is the order qualifier while reliability is the order winner—derived in the literature for the case of exogenously determined price and independent suppliers, continues to hold when the suppliers' capacities are correlated. Moreover, a firm orders only from one supplier if the effective purchase cost from him, which includes the imputed cost of his unreliability, is lower than the wholesale price charged by his rival. Otherwise, the firm orders from both. Furthermore, the firm's diversification decision does not depend on the correlation between the two suppliers' random capacities. However, its order quantities do depend on the capacity correlation, and, if the firm's objective function is unimodal, the total order quantity decreases as the capacity correlation increases in the sense of the supermodular order. With more than two suppliers, the insight no longer holds. That is, when ordering from two or more suppliers, one is the lowest‐cost supplier and the others are not selected on the basis of their costs.

Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide drive accompanying changes in the marine carbonate system as carbon dioxide (CO2) enters seawater and alters its pH (termed \"ocean acidification\"). However, such changes do not occur in isolation, and other environmental factors have the potential to modulate the consequences of altered ocean chemistry. Given that physiological mechanisms used by organisms to confront acidification can be energetically costly, we explored the potential for food supply to influence the response of Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) larvae to ocean acidification. In laboratory experiments, we reared oyster larvae under a factorial combination of pCO2 and food level. High food availability offset the negative consequences of elevated pCO2 on larval shell growth and total dry weight. Low food availability, in contrast, exacerbated these impacts. In both cases, effects of food and pCO2 interacted additively rather than synergistically, indicating that they operated independently. Despite the potential for abundant resources to counteract the consequences of ocean acidification, impacts were never completely negated, suggesting that even under conditions of enhanced primary production and elevated food availability, impacts of ocean acidification may still accrue in some consumers.\n                        </jats:p>"

Therefore, selection of environmental performance measures leads to a multi-criteria decision making problem. As a result, analytical hierarchy process is selected to develop the model and is solved with Expert Choice software.

The rain water collected in both metropolitan and rural areas generally complied with the 2004 Australian Drinking Water Guidelines except for parameters such as the pH in both the metropolitan and rural rainwater tanks and the turbidity, and lead levels from the metropolitan tanks. This paper also reports the results of a laboratory and a pilot scale study with a deep bed filter (granular activated carbon, GAC) and microfiltration (MF) hollow fibre membrane filter system used to treat raw rainwater collected from a metropolitan rainwater tank. The results of the laboratory experiment and pilot scale systems focus on the non-compliant parameters of the sampling program, i.e. turbidity, lead and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). It was found that rainwater treated by the GAC filter removed the majority of the turbidity and organic substances. The treatment system reduced the concentration of turbidity, lead and DOC to below the Australian Drinking Water Guidelines limits. The pilot plant experiment demonstrated that a GAC filter system and gravity driven membrane could result in low cost and low maintenance operation.</jats:p>",

Experimental parameters such as sample volume, time and temperature of extraction, time and temperature of desorption, magnetic stirring, and addition of sodium chloride (NaCl) were studied to determine their influence on THM extraction. Furthermore, analytical parameters such as linearity and detection limit were also evaluated. High sensitivity with detection limits in the μg/L range as well as a good linearity and reproducibility were achieved.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Biofouling caused by the deposition or growth of microorganisms on the membrane surface is one of the major concerns in nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) processes. Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) has been a useful index to assess the growth potential of bacteria. In the case of drinking water, the AOC assay method has been widely applied to estimate growth or regrowth potential of bacteria in distribution and storage systems. However, studies on AOC measurement for high salinity water samples such as brackish water and seawater are rather scarce. The objective of this research is to investigate the influence of water salinity on the conventional AOC assay method. AOC samples with different salt concentrations were prepared by varying NaCl concentration from 0 to 35,000 mg/L, while the acetate concentration was held at 100 μg/L. The number of cells produced in water samples was measured by the heterotrophic plate count (HPC) method using R2A agar. The result showed that the cell production of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain P17 and Spirillum strain NOX decreased with increasing salinity. Especially, the growth of Spirillum strain NOX was noticeably influenced by water salinity. To further observe the relation between acetate concentration and cell production in high salinity water, organic-free saline water samples were prepared by spiking NaCl in deionized (DI) water. The organic-free saline water samples were enriched with acetate of which concentration was varied to be 0–1,000 μg/L (as acetate). Also, P. fluorescens strain P17 was adjusted to high total dissolved solids (TDS) condition prior to being injected into the saline water samples. The result demonstrated that the amount of microorganisms increased with increasing acetate concentration. Although AOC measurement of saline water using Spirillum strain NOX seemed unacceptable, it was suggested that P. fluorescens strain P17 has the possibility to be used in measuring AOC in saline water. Moreover, the yield factor was altered as a result of reflecting salinity impact as the growth number of P. fluorescens strain P17 was unstable with high saline condition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The yearly water main failure frequency is a central performance indicator to describe the structural quality of a water distribution network. Besides age related deterioration, events such as severe climatic conditions or intensified third party construction may cause sudden seasonal increases in failure frequency trends. For the cold regions of Canada and the dry regions of Australia, several studies exist describing the impacts of climatic failure frequencies on water main failure variations. Failure prediction modelling applied to Austrian supply systems have shown that irregularities in overall failure trends were not explainable with commonly used model covariates like material, vintage, diameter or the number of previous breaks. Analysing the monthly failure frequencies of several Austrian utilities, seasonal differences and variations in failure frequencies are recognizable. The research described in this paper therefore focused on analysing if climatic impacts are responsible for these variations. In a first step, climatic indicators, which are able to describe seasonal climatic variations in moderate climate regions, were derived. In a next step the correlation between summer and winter failure frequencies to these climatic indicators was analysed. The indicators taken into account were, e.g. the decisive freezing index (DFI), the summer rain deficit (RDs) or the amount of successive hot days (AHD). The research has shown that in all investigated climatic zones of Austria, the severity of the winter season influences failure frequencies. A dependency between winter failure frequency and the DFI was significant especially for rigid material types and for diameters up to 200 mm. So far, soil moisture effects have only shown a slight significance. Nevertheless, the indicator AHD has shown a correlation to failure frequencies in the dryer climate zones of Austria. This is of further interest as it is very likely that the AHD is going to increase due to climate change.</jats:p>",

Potable reclamation is a fixed part of the water supply and waste water has become an indispensible resource for the survival and continued growth of the city. The multi barrier concepts that were applied 40 years ago have been refined over many years. Improvements in water treatment technology have made it possible to improve the reliability and the drinking water quality of the reclamation treatment process. With the latest upgrade, which was designed 14 years ago and commissioned in 2002, a specific design philosophy was followed. This paper will assess whether the objectives of the design philosophy have been met in terms of removal efficiencies and safety of drinking water, which contains at present 25% reclaimed water. The basis and aims of the multi barrier design that was applied is discussed and with the aid of natural organic matter (NOM) and microorganism removal, the reliability of the philosophy is tested and compared with the goals set. Comparisons are drawn between the new plant and the previous plant and how the new plant is able to accommodate changes in raw water quality. It can be concluded that the water quality has been improved and the barrier principle does reduce the risk and improve the water quality.</jats:p>",

A major challenge is for firms to manage costly inventories to address demand and supply risks in emerging markets. However, emerging market penetration may offer opportunities for firms to lower inventory levels, reduce costs, and improve operating performance. Using data for 482 manufacturing firms over the 5‐year period, 2003–2007, obtained from the COMPUSTAT Industrial and Segment Databases, this article examines the relationships between emerging market penetration, inventory supply, and financial performance. Our results show that a multinational firm's sales penetration into emerging markets is associated with fewer days of inventory supply and improved financial performance. As emerging market penetration may allow firms to operate with lower inventory supply, the positive effect from emerging market penetration, such as labor cost reductions, may be enhanced due to inventory cost savings. </jats:p>",

This study estimated surface water quality in a stream within the Yazoo River Basin (YRB), Mississippi, USA, using the duration curve and recurrence interval analysis techniques. Data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) surface water monitoring station located in Deer Creek east of Leland from the YRB were selected for the analysis. Results showed that the water quality constituents, namely water temperature, specific conductivity (SC) and dissolved oxygen (DO), in this stream were found not to be the major concerns as the percentages of the time when these constituents did not meet their criteria were very low. Our results further revealed that the water temperature and SC increased as time elapsed, indicating the potential global warming and contamination impacts in this stream. In contrast, the DO and pH decreased as time elapsed, postulating a potential increase in biochemical oxygen demand and an acidic trend in this stream. Over the last decade, the average recurrence intervals when the water temperature, SC, and DO did not meet their criteria or minimum conditions were around 1 year. Using a target DO value of 429 kg d−1 proposed by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, results from this study showed that there was about 25% of the time when the DO load did not meet the target value. This study suggests that the duration curve and recurrence interval analysis techniques are useful statistical tools for water quality trend estimation.</jats:p>",

In the original plant, built in 1974, sludge blanket clarification followed by filtration was applied for floc removal. In 2008, the plant was extended with two additional treatment lines where flotation is used instead of sludge blanket clarification. Flotation-filtration proved to be very reliable. By 2018, an additional increase of the production capacity is planned. Therefore, a comparison has been made between flotation–filtration and ultrafiltration, both with respect to effluent quality and costs. Based on this comparison, flotation was selected to be the optimal floc removal process for the future treatment lines. Ongoing research focuses on the possibility of applying ion exchange as a pretreatment prior to coagulation–filtration, as this was found to have benefits with respect to both operational costs and natural organic matter (NOM) removal.</jats:p>",

However, the main disadvantage of desalination is related to energy consumption and CO2 emissions, so desalination powered by renewable energy (RE) is getting interest. In this study nanofiltration (NF) membranes have been used for drinking water quality improvement in a pilot plant (50 m3/day) powered by RE (11.0 kW). The aims of this paper are: (1) to study the viability of a hybrid RE system to improve drinking water quality, (2) to study the availability of RE for NF desalination, and (3) to improve the chemical and organoleptic quality of tap water and tap water blended with nanofiltered water. Results confirm that desalination powered by RE is an interesting option for water quality improvement. Thanks to the hybrid system of the pilot plant, operation is around 93% of time. After several blind tastings, 82% of the tasters preferred water blended with nanofiltered water rather than current tap water.</jats:p>",

In this ‘Water Quality Management’ project, a new strategy of partial process water stream treatment is presented. Based on our own investigations, a water saving potential of 10–20% of the entire water consumption is possible with regard to displacement and rinsing water. The separation of different water qualities in real time, via the water switch, is achieved by several measurement techniques and the exploration of the desired information by multivariate data analysis. In combination with the water switch, the generation of drinking water quality regarding sterility is assured by a ceramic ultra-filtration membrane. Aside from basic on and inline measurement parameters in breweries, e.g. pH-value, temperature, electrical conductivity and turbidity, modern measurement techniques, e.g. infrared sensor, which can measure several parameters, such as Brix and organic acids, are utilized. The combination of the rule-based fuzzy-logic system and expert knowledge is called a hybrid methodology. In the current study, the experimental design (DoE) techniques were applied to reduce the number of required experiments. The experimental results were then explored by the well-known projection method, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA).</jats:p>",

Shortage of health care workers, severe financial constraints, and lack of awareness are some of the major obstacles that prevent higher access. However, ineffective and poorly designed supply chains for purchasing and distributing the medicines, vaccines, and health technologies are one of the most important barriers to increasing access. We argue that the ineffectiveness of the global health supply chain can be attributed largely to: coordination problems across multiple stakeholders with widely divergent objectives, lack of careful supply chain design, and use of myopic operational objectives and metrics. The operations management research community can contribute to improving this by applying existing knowledge to the field of global health delivery and by researching new frameworks of analysis which would then become the cornerstones for policy advice to those who design, operate, or finance these supply chains. </jats:p>",

It uses customized fluid flow patterns in a curved channel to create a pair of Dean vortexes that focus particles into a concentrated band near one channel wall. A splitter at the end of the channel divides the flow into a clean effluent stream and a concentrate stream. The focusing of particles is primarily due to a combination of hydrodynamic forces (drag, virtual mass, and shear), which causes a size rather than density dependent separation. This enables separation of particles with densities identical or close to that of their surrounding fluid, allowing this technology to be especially useful in situations where traditional methods are challenged, such as removal of buoyant particulates from primary clarifiers or separation of unsettleable activated sludge in secondary clarifiers. We tested HDS-based separators with samples that include neutrally buoyant polystyrene beads, activated sludge, primary clarifier effluent and powdered activated carbon to demonstrate its efficacy. In each case, high separation efficiency was achieved which reaffirmed our commitments to evolve HDS technology into an effective pretreatment solution.</jats:p>",

In this work, this method was used to characterize the dynamics of virus removal in micromodules as a function of the membrane defect size and the transmembrane pressure (TMP). Experiments were performed at lab scale with an integer module and with modules made with the same fibres with calibrated holes (50, 100, 150 μm) made in one of the module fibres with the laser method. Results showed first that the new method allowed diagnosing a 50 μm hole on the fibre of a micromodule. It was also demonstrated that, whatever the applied TMP, removal performances are all the more better that the defect size is smaller. Moreover, whatever the hole size, a TMP step rise from 1 to 1.5 bar during tracer filtration led to no significant change in the observed removal but improved the intrinsic removal performances.</jats:p>",

Following irrigation, the soil moisture and salinity distribution around the emitters were measured every 24 h. The results showed that the accumulation of salts in the soil reduced the evaporation from the soil surface in treatments with high salinity. Therefore, in treatments with a low plant water requirement and high salinity levels, the volume of water in the soil is greater than in treatments with a high plant water requirement and low salinity levels. Although the crop yield is reduced with deficit irrigation, the saved water can be used to increase the area under cultivation, leading to increases in the overall crop yield.</jats:p>",

This paper proposes an output game model among multiple oligopolistic manufacturers under the circumstances of information asymmetry and analyzes the Nash equilibrium in the model. The manufacturers usually base their production decision making on the volume of order from distributors and the production decisions made by other manufacturers. They also suitably adjust the output. If the adjustment speed accelerates, chaos will be caused in the manufacturers' production decision. This paper analyzes the proposed model from a perspective of complex dynamics and discusses the impact of system parameter on the complexity of this discrete chaotic system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of screening contracts is a common approach to solve supply chain coordination problems under asymmetric information. One main assumption in this context is that managers without specific incentives would rather use their private information strategically than reveal it truthfully. This harms supply chain performance. This study investigates the impact of information sharing in a principal‐agent setting that is typical for many supply chain transactions. We conduct a laboratory experiment to test whether information sharing has an influence on supply chain coordination. We find that information sharing within the supply chain has two positive effects. First, information sharing reduces the inefficiencies resulting from information deficits if there is a certain amount of trust in the supply chain. Second, communication can limit out‐of‐equilibrium behavior with a small impact on the firm's own payoff, but a large impact on the supply chain partner. Furthermore, we find that both effects are amplified when communication takes place in an environment that allows the less informed supply chain party to punish or to reward the better informed party. Although our extended mechanisms substantially enhance the poor performance of the theoretically optimal coordination contract menu, we find no mechanism that implements supply chain performance superior to the theoretically predicted second‐best level. </jats:p>",

The interaction generally couples strongly the price decision of the supplier and the quantity decision of the buyer. We propose a basic model for a repeated supplier–buyer interaction, during several rounds. In each round, the supplier first quotes a price, and the buyer places an order at that price. We find conditions for existence and uniqueness of a well‐behaved subgame‐perfect equilibrium in the dynamic game. When costs are stationary and there are no holding costs, we identify some demand distributions for which these conditions are met, examine the efficiency of the equilibrium, and show that, as the number of rounds increases, the profits of the supply chain increase towards the supply chain optimum. In contrast, when costs vary over time or holding costs are present, the benefit from multi‐period interactions is reduced and after a finite number of time periods, supply chain profits stay constant even when the number of rounds increases. </jats:p>",

We propose a definition of the extensive and intensive margins corresponding respectively to the employment rate and to hours when employed. This definition is robust to the choice of the reference period and we develop a new statistical decomposition that provides bounds on changes at these margins. We focus on longer‐run labour supply changes over the period 1977 to 2007 and abstract from the shorter‐run impact of recessions. Examining secular changes over this period, we show that both margins matter in explaining changes in total hours. We then provide a detailed analysis across countries and across time by demographic type. Given the large systematic differences we uncover in the importance of these margins by age and gender, it is unlikely that a single explanation will suffice to account for the macroeconomic evolutions in the three countries.</jats:p>",

Batch experiments were conducted using calcined Mg/Al LDH at 105 °C (LDH-105), 300 °C (LDH-300), and 700 °C (LDH-700). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis showed that the specific surface area of LDH-700 was 1.7−1.8 times larger than those of LDH-105 and LDH-300. The X-ray diffractometry (XRD) analysis indicated that LDH-105 had a layered structure (Mg4Al2(OH)12CO3 · 3H2O) while LDH-300 and LDH-700 were composed of mixed metal oxides (Al8O3N6 + Mg0.44Al0.56) and magnesium oxide (MgO), respectively. Batch tests showed that the fluoride sorption capacity of LDH-700 was 1.7−2.9 times greater than those of LDH-105 and LDH-300 at initial fluoride concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/L. The kinetic data showed that fluoride sorption to LDH-700 arrived at equilibrium after 12 h. The equilibrium test demonstrated that the maximum sorption capacity of LDH-700 was 91.401 mg/g. Additional batch experiments indicated that the sorption capacity of LDH-700 decreased slightly when the solution pH was increased from 4.0 to 9.0. Moreover, fluoride sorption to LDH-700 decreased considerably in the presence of anions such as phosphate, sulfate, and carbonate in the following order: HPO42− &amp;gt; SO42− &amp;gt; CO32− &amp;gt; Cl− &amp;gt; NO3−.</jats:p>",

This article analyzes the impact of certification standards on the supplier's investment in quality, when a buyer outsources the production process. Based on our results, deterministic certification may lead to under‐investment in quality improvement technology for efficient suppliers, thereby leading to potential supply chain inefficiency. The introduction of noisy certification may alleviate this under‐investment problem, when the cost of information asymmetry is high. While allowing noisy certification always empowers the buyer to offer a menu to screen among heterogeneous suppliers, the buyer may optimally choose only a limited number of certification standards. Our analysis provides a clear‐cut prediction of the types of certifiers the buyer should use for heterogeneous suppliers, and we identify the conditions under which the supplier benefits from noisy certification. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Sci. 93: 23–33. Animal electronic identification could be exploited by farmers as an interesting opportunity to increase the efficiency of herd management and traceability. Although radio frequency identification (RFID) solutions for animal identification have already been envisaged, the integration of a RFID traceability system at farm level has to be carried out carefully, considering different aspects (farm type, number and species of animals, barn structure). The tag persistence on the animal after application, the tag-to-tag collisions in the case of many animals contemporarily present in the reading area of the same antenna and the barn layout play determinant roles in system reliability. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the RFID identification system performance and determine the best practice to apply these devices in livestock management. RFID systems were tested both in laboratory, on the farm and in slaughterhouses for the implementation of a traceability system with automatic animal data capture. For this purpose a complete system for animal identification and tracking, accomplishing regulatory compliance as well as supply chain management requirements, has been developed and is described in the paper. Results were encouraging for identification of calves both in farms and slaughterhouses, while in swine breeding, identification was critical for small piglets. In this case, the design of a RFID gate where tag-to-tag collisions are avoided should be envisaged. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a method to establish the design flow rate adopting probabilistic and possibilistic approaches to model the subjective behaviour of the users that affects strongly the duration of usage of sanitary appliances. At first, the Monte Carlo method is used to determine the instance of usage of the sanitary appliances. After that, fuzzy logic is applied to determine the duration of the shower. As a result, historical records of the use of the sanitary appliances and the flow rate during the peak period can be generated. The design flow rate obtained by the simulation is about 23% lower than that assessed by the Brazilian standard, based on deterministic approach, and closer to the values calculated by the probabilistic model. </jats:p><jats:p> Practical application: As the processing cost is extremely low, the simulation based on the proposed method is also an efficient means to obtain a quite accurate estimate of the flow rate for the sizing of water supply systems and water meters in water sub-metering systems. </jats:p>",

The SAMHD1 deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) hydrolase represents the prototype of a new antiviral strategy we referred to as “nucleotide depletion”. SAMHD1 depletes dNTP levels in myeloid cells below those required for optimal synthesis of HIV viral DNA. HIV-2 and its SIVsm and SIVmac close relatives encode a protein termed Vpx, which counteracts SAMHD1. The potentiality of IFN-α to cooperate with nucleotide depletion has been poorly investigated so far. Here we wondered whether IFN-α affects SAMHD1 expression, Vpx-induced SAMHD1 degradation, Vpx-mediated rescue of HIV-1 transduction and the dNTP supply in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs).</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>IFN-α inhibited HIV-1 transduction in monocytes and in MDMs while SAMHD1 expression was not up-regulated. Vpx triggered SAMHD1 degradation in IFN-α treated cells, and weakly restored HIV-1 transduction from the IFN-α block. Vpx helper effect towards HIV-1 transduction was gradually inhibited with increasing doses of IFN-α. dNTP levels were not significantly affected in MDMs and CD4+ primary activated T lymphocytes by IFN-α and, in correlation with SAMHD1 degradation, restoration of dNTP levels by Vpx was efficient in MDMs treated with the cytokine. In contrast, IFN-α inhibited Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation in THP-1 cells, where, accordingly, Vpx could not rescue HIV-1 transduction.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Our results suggest that the early antiviral effect of IFN-α results from a mechanism independent of nucleotide depletion in MDMs. In addition, they indicate that the macrophage-like THP-1 cell line may provide a system to characterize an IFN-α-induced cell response that inhibits Vpx-mediated SAMHD1 degradation.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This constitutes the first study to report on the use of a novel approach to determine inactivation in PUV-irradiated Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts suspended in water based on the measurement of cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration. This study also compares the efficiency of a novel ATP assay to that of using the combined in vitro HCT-8 cell culture – quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for determining the inactivation in the waterborne pathogen C. parvum after exposure to pulsed UV (PUV) treatments. Findings were compared with using the combined cell culture-qPCR approach for determining oocyst viability in similarly treated samples. PUV effectively killed C. parvum with a 5.4 log10 loss in oocyst viability after exposure to a UV dose of 8.5 μJ/cm2 as determined by the in vitro cell culture – qPCR assay. The ATP assay was shown to be significantly less effective in measuring loss of oocyst viability in similarly PUV-irradiated samples for all combination of treatment regimes studied. Measurement of cellular ATP is not suitable as an indicator of the disinfection efficiency of PUV-irradiated C. parvum oocysts. The levels of ATP present post PUV-irradiated samples suggests that significant cellular activity remained in treated oocysts that are unable to invade human HCT-8 cells. However, further studies are merited to investigate factors that might aid repair post PUV treatments in this water-borne human parasite. Use of this ATP assay offers an interesting insight into loss of infectivity in PUV-treated C. parvum. This rapid assay does not appear suitable for investigating or optimizing treatment efficiency under varying operational settings as it detects PUV-treated oocysts at levels significantly higher compared with using the in vitro cell culture-qPCR infectivity assay. Overestimation of survivors by the ATP assay may suggest that a sub-population of C. parvum oocysts may exist in a viable but non-infectious state or may require a period of resuscitation to facilitate photo-repair (if possible) that may lead to regained ability to infective human hosts.</jats:p>",

Hence, driver management is a topic of great interest to the trucking industry, logistics practitioners, and logistics researchers. Although the logistics literature does address issues relating to driver management, advice is scarce regarding how motor carriers might manage drivers to improve operational performance and thus the bottom line. Our results shed light on the processes whereby some formal controls directly influence operational performance, whereas others indirectly influence operational performance; that is, in the latter case, the influence of formal controls on operational performance is mediated by certain informal controls. According to our findings, motor carrier firms that employ a combination of formal and informal controls perform better operationally than firms that do not do so. And, thus, those employing such a combination of controls will realize a larger market share.</jats:p>",

The formation time of the DM was determined according to the critical flux. The formation process and filtration mechanisms were evaluated based on typical crossflow membrane fouling models and combinations of them. When a non-woven fabric filter was used as the support media, the formation time of the DM was 70 min at 4 cm water head drop (WHD) and 20 min at 8 cm WHD. When dacron mesh was used as the support media, the membrane formation required 100 min at 4 cm WHD and 70 min at 8 cm WHD. During DM formation on a non-woven fabric filter, the internal pore blocking plays the dominant role. But when dacron mesh is used as the support media, complete blocking and intermediate blocking dominate. After the formation of a DM, the combined models have good agreement with the experimental data compared with the typical filtration models.</jats:p>",

Flow and pressure in 361 zones in Perak were monitored for 24 h using PrimeWorks software. From the 361 zones, 30 study zones were randomly selected. The 30 study zones were geographically divided into three groups, with each group having 10 zones. Statistically, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the variations in MNF among the three groups. The data of the flow for the 30 zones were screened from 1:00 to 5:00 am for the past 4 years. The frequency of MNF occurrences was analyzed every 15 min. The results show that the majority (84.2%) of the frequencies of MNF occurrences in the 30 study areas occurred from 2:15 to 4:15 am, whereas minimum frequencies were observed at 1:00, 1:15, and 5:00 am.</jats:p>",

The project of a derivation from the stream for an hydroelectric plant could affect the water regime of the spring. So an analytical assessment of the connection existing between the stream and the spring was required. Moreover, a geological survey of the spring area was carried out, with the aim to reconstruct the geological and hydrogeological context. The large amount of groundwater in the basin is linked to a high permeability of the shallow rock mass. The concentration of supplies to the spring is due to morphological reasons and the occurrence of major fractures that carry also a part of the losses of the stream. The purposes of the study are the evaluation of: the losses (l/s) of stream feeding the spring, the percentage of water of the stream that reaches the spring and the percentage of the spring discharge supplied by the stream. The hydrogeological surveys consisted of sodium-chloride tracer tests for the measurement of the stream discharge and of the overflow of the spring, and tracer tests of the stream with fluorescent tracer. The surveys were conducted in three measurement campaigns for different flows of the stream. Findings indicate that, despite the large variation of stream discharge and stream losses, the discharge of spring remains fairly steady and scarcely supplied by the stream. The case study, besides increasing the knowledge about this area, unusual for the hydrogeological features, provides a methodological approach to the evaluation of the relationship between rivers and groundwater.</jats:p>"

The results illustrated that both as-prepared and functionalized MWCNTs showed high adsorption capacity for the NOM studied. Functionalization of MWCNT affected the surface area and introduced oxygen-containing functional groups to the surface of MWCNT which depressed the adsorption of NOM onto MWCNTs-COOH. The obtained data were studied using Freundlich, Langmuir and BET isotherms; NOM adsorption data had the best conformity to the Freundlich isotherm. Kinetic studies were performed and the adsorption kinetics successfully followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy change (ΔG°), enthalpy change (ΔH°) and entropy change (ΔS°) were determined and evaluation of them showed that the adsorption process for NOM is general spontaneous, endothermic and thermodynamically favorable.</jats:p>",

To address this problem, we subjected periphyton in laboratory streams to low (10-cm ï¿½ s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), high (30-cm ï¿½ s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), and variable (9- to 32-cm ï¿½ s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) current velocity and low- versus high-nutrient inputs. We examined how current velocity and resource supply constrained (i) the rates of species accumulation, a measure of temporal beta-diversity, and (ii) the rates of diversification of higher taxonomic categories, defined here as the rate of higher taxon richness increase with the increase of species richness. Temporal biofilm dynamics were controlled by a strong nutrient-current interaction. Nutrients accelerated the rates of accumulation of new species, when flow velocity was not too stressful. Species were more taxonomically diverse under variable than under low-flow conditions, indicating that flow heterogeneity increased the niche diversity in the high-nutrient treatments. Conversely, the lower diversification rates under high- than under low-nutrient conditions at low velocity are explained with finer resource partitioning among species, belonging to a limited number of related genera. The overall low rates of diversification in high-current treatments suggest that the ability to withstand current stress was conserved within closely related species. Temporal heterogeneity of disturbance has been shown to promote species richness, but here we further demonstrate that it also affects two other components of biodiversity, i.e., temporal beta-diversity and diversification rate. Therefore, management efforts for preserving the inherent temporal heterogeneity of natural ecosystems will have detectable positive effects on biodiversity.</jats:p>",

Degradation of dichloracetic acid (DCAA) and trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) was observed in a simulated distribution system. The results obtained showed that different parameters came into play simultaneously in the degradation of HAAs, including retention time, water temperature, biomass, composition of organic matter, and pipe diameter. Seasonal variations had a major effect on HAA degradation and biomass quantity was lower by 1 to 2 logs in the winter and spring compared with the fall. HAA removal decreased with increasingly large pipe diameters. The specific effects of each of these factors were difficult to isolate from each other owing to interactions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Water scarcity conditions over the 21st century both globally and regionally are assessed in the context of climate change, by estimating both water availability and water demand within the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a leading community integrated assessment model of energy, agriculture, climate, and water. To quantify changes in future water availability, a new gridded water-balance global hydrologic model – namely, the Global Water Availability Model (GWAM) – is developed and evaluated. Global water demands for six major demand sectors (irrigation, livestock, domestic, electricity generation, primary energy production, and manufacturing) are modeled in GCAM at the regional scale (14 geopolitical regions, 151 sub-regions) and then spatially downscaled to 0.5° × 0.5° resolution to match the scale of GWAM. Using a baseline scenario (i.e., no climate change mitigation policy) with radiative forcing reaching 8.8 W m−2 (equivalent to the SRES A1Fi emission scenario) and a global population of 14 billion by 2095, global annual water demand grows from about 9–10% of total annual renewable freshwater in 2005 to about 32–37% by 2095. This results in more than half of the world population living under extreme water scarcity by the end of the 21st century. Regionally, the demand for water exceeds the amount of water availability in two GCAM regions, the Middle East and India. Additionally, in years 2050 and 2095 36% (28%) and 44% (39%) of the global population, respectively is projected to live in grid cells (in basins) that will experience greater water demands than the amount of available water in a year (i.e., the water scarcity index (WSI) &gt; 1.0). This study implies an increasingly prominent role for water in future human decisions, and highlights the importance of including water in integrated assessment of global change.\n                        </jats:p>"

Their multifunctional use for drinking water supply, flood control, energy production, nature conservation and recreation as well as ecological constraints for the rivers downstream requires an integrative management considering and balancing between different requirements. Thus, an optimal reservoir management has to take into account scenarios of external influences and must be based on predictions of prospective raw water qualities. Furthermore, the impacts of short- and long-term changes of the raw water quality on drinking water treatment have to be considered. The problem is very complex and cannot be solved intuitively but requires the application of hydrological, ecological and process models. This approach was followed in the work presented here, as a tool to predict and evaluate the impacts of different reservoir management strategies in an integrative way is currently not available. The developed decision support procedure (DSP) allows for the estimation of the effects of different hydrological and water quantity management scenarios on raw water quality, water processing costs and ecology in the downstream river. Extreme hydrological events or changing boundary conditions (e.g. climate change) are taken into account.</jats:p>",

The objectives are to quantify for 23 cities in seven climatic regions (1) water supply provided from rainwater harvested at a residential parcel and (2) stormwater runoff reduction from a residential drainage catchment. Water‐saving efficiency is determined using a water‐balance approach applied at a daily time step for a range of rainwater cistern sizes. The results show that performance is a function of cistern size and climatic pattern. A single rain barrel (190 l [50 gal]) installed at a residential parcel is able to provide approximately 50% water‐saving efficiency for the nonpotable indoor water demand scenario in cities of the East Coast, Southeast, Midwest, and Pacific Northwest, but &lt;30% water‐saving efficiency in cities of the Mountain West, Southwest, and most of California. Stormwater management benefits are quantified using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model. The results indicate that rainwater harvesting can reduce stormwater runoff volume up to 20% in semiarid regions, and less in regions receiving greater rainfall amounts for a long‐term simulation. Overall, the results suggest that U.S. cities and individual residents can benefit from implementing rainwater harvesting as a stormwater control measure and as an alternative source of water.</jats:p>",

The goal of this study was to identify and characterize different types of fresh fruit farms with regard to farm structural and commercial strategies for a representative sample of fresh fruit growers from central-south Chile exporting to world markets. A typology of farms was constructed based on multivariate analysis, according to which five types of farms were differentiated from five distinct factors. Cluster I comprised the smallest and uncertified farms (14.3% of the sample). The remaining four clusters comprised certified farms, but with different farm structural and commercial characteristics. Cluster II (15.1%) was composed of farms located further from market connections. Cluster III (23.9%) comprised farms with the highest number of fruit species, and consequently, more diversified in fruit production. Cluster IV (8.8%) was the smallest group, and comprised the largest firms. Finally, Cluster V (37.8%) was composed of highly specialized fruit farms, with the highest proportion of hectares dedicated to the production of a single fruit species. The results show the heterogeneity among fresh fruit farms and support the need for differentiated incentives and technological transfer schemes from the public sector and fruit companies in order to successfully keep farmers within export supply chains.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The analysis and design of a small isolated power system (SIPS) with renewable energy sources (RES) and storage can be challenging, because of the large number of design options and the uncertainty in key parameters. RES add further complexity because their power output may be intermittent, seasonal and non‐dispatchable. Owing to this characteristic, reliability evaluation of a RES‐based SIPS cannot be implemented using the traditional deterministic and analytical methods. Moreover, this evaluation has to be done within a cost‐benefit framework. This study models and investigates the effect of customer worth of interrupted supply (customer damage cost) on the optimal design of SIPS with storage and increased RES penetration. The SIPS optimal design is implemented with a genetic algorithm combined with local search procedure. In addition, this study examines the effect of the forced outage rate of SIPS components on SIPS optimal design via Monte Carlo simulation. The performance of the proposed hybrid optimisation methodology is investigated for a large number of alternative scenarios via sensitivity analysis, which study the effect on the results because of the uncertainty on weather data, components efficiency and cost data. The results show that the optimal design of a RES‐based SIPS depends largely on the consideration of customer damage cost as well as the inclusion of components forced outage rate. The method and results presented in this article should be valuable in planning and operating SIPS with RES.</jats:p>",

Intact soil cores were collected from each site after snowmelt, maintained at field capacity, and incubated at 20°C for 6 weeks. Weekly assessments of soil nutrient availability along with CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions were completed. There was no difference in cumulative soil N supply between the unfertilized long‐term no‐till and native prairie soils, while annual fertilizer‐N additions of 120 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>were required to restore the N‐supplying power of the short‐term no‐till soil to that of the undisturbed native prairie soil. The estimated cumulative CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐C and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O‐N emissions among soils ranged from 231.8–474.7 g m<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>to 183.9–862.5 mg m<jats:sup>–2</jats:sup>, respectively. Highest CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>fluxes from the native prairie soil are consistent with its high organic matter content, elevated microbial activity, and contributions from root respiration. Repeated applications of ≥ 60 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>resulted in greater residual inorganic‐N levels in the long‐term no‐till soil, which supported larger N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O fluxes compared to the unfertilized control. The native prairie soil N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions were equal to those from both short‐ and long‐term no‐till soils receiving repeated fertilizer‐N applications at typical agronomic rates (<jats:italic>e.g.</jats:italic>, 90 kg N ha<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>). Eighty‐eight percent of the native soil N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O flux was emitted during the first 2 weeks and is probably characteristic of rapid denitrification rates during the dormant vegetative period after snowmelt within temperate native grasslands. There was a strong correlation (<jats:italic>R</jats:italic>&lt;?h.3&gt;<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>0.64;<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>&lt; 0.03) between measured soil Fe‐supply rate and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O flux, presumably due to anoxic microsites within soil aggregates resulting from increased microbial activity. The use of modern no‐till continuous diversified cropping systems, along with application of fertilizer N, enhances the soil N‐supplying power over the long‐term through the build‐up of mineralizable N and appears to be an effective management strategy for improving degraded soils, thus enhancing the productive capacity of agricultural ecosystems. However, accounting for N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions concomitant with repeated fertilizer‐N applications is imperative for properly assessing the net global warming potential of any land‐management system.</jats:p>",

Located in the lower part of the Amu Darya basin, Khorezm irrigation and drainage scheme is particularly vulnerable to supply–demand gaps. Promising solutions towards adaptation comprise modified strategies of land and water use towards higher efficiency and flexibility in combination with measures to lessen the constraints of the system itself, which was initially designed for the management of a few, large and uniform production units and not for many diverse and small units. Solutions consist of flexible, modeling-based approaches, re-arranging institutional settings and establishing economic incentive systems. Flexible modeling allows an integrated use of surface and groundwater resources avoiding or minimizing the impact of water stress on yield. Institutional settings strengthen the position of water users via improved participation and transparency of processes in Water Consumers Associations (WCAs). Economic measures support sustainable resource use strategies and improve the functioning of WCAs. The findings could be extrapolated to other regions of Central Asia with similar conditions and challenges.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Financial crunch in the present recession results in the non-availability of the right materials at the right time in large hospitals. However due to insufficient impetus towards systems development, situation remains dismal even when funds are galore. Cost incurred on materials account for approximately one-third of the total recurring expenditures in hospitals. Systems development for effective and efficient materials management is thus tantamount to cost-containment and sustainability. This scientific paper describes an innovative model, Hospital Revolving Fund (HRF), developed at a tertiary care research institute in Asia. the main idea behind inception of HRF was to ensure availability of all supplies in the hospital so that the quality of healthcare delivery was not affected. the model was conceptualized in the background of non-availability of consumables in the hospital leading to patient as well as staff dissatisfaction. Hospital supplies have been divided into two parts, approximately 3250 unit items and 1750 miscellaneous items. This division is based on cost, relative-utility and case-specific utilization. 0.1 Million USD, separated from non-planned budget, was initially used as seed money in 1998. HRF procures supplies from reputed firms on concessional rates (8–25%) and make them available to patients at much lesser rates vis-à-vis market rates, levying minimal maintenance charges. in 2009–10, total annual purchases of 14 Million USD were made. the balance sheet reflected 1.4 Million USD as fixed deposit investment. the minimal maintenance charges levied on the patients along with the interest income were sufficient to pay for all recurring expenses related to HRF. Even after these expenses, HRF boosted of 0.2 Million USD as cash-in-hand in financial year 2009–10. In-depth analysis of ‘balance sheet’ and ‘Income and Expenditure’ statement of the fund for last five financial years affirms that HRF is a self-sustainable and viable supply chain mechanism to ensure availability of the right materials at the right time at a reasonable cost. Thus innovations like HRF will prove robust in rendering quality healthcare at an affordable cost. </jats:p>",

Profiling of metabolic traits combined with network-based and statistical analyses allow the comparison of conditions and identification of sets of traits that predict biomass. However, it often remains unclear why a particular set of metabolites is linked with biomass and to what extent the predictive model is applicable beyond a particular growth condition. A panel of 97 genetically diverse Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions was grown in near-optimal carbon and nitrogen supply, restricted carbon supply, and restricted nitrogen supply and analyzed for biomass and 54 metabolic traits. Correlation-based metabolic networks were generated from the genotype-dependent variation in each condition to reveal sets of metabolites that show coordinated changes across accessions. The networks were largely specific for a single growth condition. Partial least squares regression from metabolic traits allowed prediction of biomass within and, slightly more weakly, across conditions (cross-validated Pearson correlations in the range of 0.27–0.58 and 0.21–0.51 and P values in the range of &amp;lt;0.001–&amp;lt;0.13 and &amp;lt;0.001–&amp;lt;0.023, respectively). Metabolic traits that correlate with growth or have a high weighting in the partial least squares regression were mainly condition specific and often related to the resource that restricts growth under that condition. Linear mixed-model analysis using the combined metabolic traits from all growth conditions as an input indicated that inclusion of random effects for the conditions improves predictions of biomass. Thus, robust prediction of biomass across a range of conditions requires condition-specific measurement of metabolic traits to take account of environment-dependent changes of the underlying networks.</jats:p>",

Thirty‐eight wild genotypes (<jats:italic>C. lanatus</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>citroide</jats:italic>) and 26 domesticated genotypes (<jats:italic>C. lanatus</jats:italic> var. <jats:italic>lanatus</jats:italic>) were cultivated hydroponically for 30 d. Shoot dry weight, shoot K concentration, K uptake, K‐use index (shoot dry weight / shoot K concentration), relative shoot dry weight (shoot dry weight under limited K / shoot dry weight under ample K), and relative shoot K concentration (shoot K concentration under limited K / shoot K concentration under ample K) were determined. Significant differences were observed among genotypes. The K efficiency was classified based on a medium‐efficiency interval which is equivalent to the 95% confidence interval of the mean relative shoot dry weight and relative shoot K concentration. Genotypic data above or below this interval were classified as either K‐efficient or K‐inefficient. We identified eight K‐efficient genotypes, of which four were wild types. Thus, wild watermelons can be used in breeding programs to improve the K efficiency of domesticated watermelons.</jats:p>",
