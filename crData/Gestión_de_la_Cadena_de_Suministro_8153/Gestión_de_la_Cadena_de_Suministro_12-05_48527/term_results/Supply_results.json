The UK government has signalled support for author mandates to publish in open access journals. However in the US – the publishers are once again attempting to block OA mandates. Patron driven acquisition has clearly arrived and is deeply embedded in the US although less so elsewhere in the world. Significant resistance to Big Deals has resulted in an excellent settlement by UK universities. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper represents a useful source for librarians and others interested in interlending and document supply as well as such related matters as resource sharing and open access.</jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>",

In the context of increasingly complex and global supply chains, the actions taken to drive down costs are likely to drive risk into the supply chain. The frequency of supply chain disruptions is high and this paper offers practical advice to help reduce the frequency and cost associated with these. There is advice to help with the understanding of how to identify critical suppliers. The reader is guided through comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation approaches and a selection of practical risk solutions and tools that you can use is described. There is a section on the ‘dos and don’ts’ relating to supplier due diligence. For those organisations facing the challenge of drawing up a business case relating to investment in improving supply chain resiliency, there is also a section outlining some of the business benefits of improving supply chain resiliency.</jats:p>"

Eco-efficiency (EE) has the potential to incorporate both environmental and economic improvement by companies of ESC, and we explore the use of EE in the design process.  It is noteworthy that it is an imperative in the current competitive market that companies must be able to manage their entire production chain taking into account environmental issues as an important factor in their decision-making processes. Therefore, it is believed that EE can integrate and strengthen a company’s functions and assist its decision-making processes as well as implement improvements within its ESC.</jats:p>"

The column matrix was equilibrated with ammonium acetate buffer and maximum protein was eluted at 0.8 M NaCl. The molecular mass of the purified protein was identified as 14 kDa and its pI value was around 9.5. The purified coagulant protein retained 90% coagulation activity even after incubation at 90 °C for 3 h. The purified protein does not release organic content to the water. This paper suggests that coagulant protein from M. concanenesis can be used in drinking water treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Natural disasters can wreak havoc on business operations. When civil unrest swept the UK in August 2011, the effect on business was stark, losing the retail sector £300m in unexpected costs and lost revenues. On the other side of the world, the natural disaster that hit Japan in early 2011 is estimated to have run up costs in the region of £189bn in repairs. Beyond this, the earthquake and its aftermath shattered supply chains, with technology companies expecting delays of up to six months before business could resume fully. It is impossible to predict incidents like these, but businesses can help mitigate disruption in the supply chain by undertaking business continuity management (BCM). A flexible supply chain is essential when it comes to BCM — whether it means being able to cope with altering transport routes at short notice, or finding or replacing a supplier at the last minute. Understanding the supply chain is critical when responding to major impacts that affect supply chains in multiple points — like IT system failures and country-wide fuel strikes. Businesses should carry out detailed business impact assessments and risk assessments right across the end-to-end supply chain and not just at key single points of failure. It is an intensive process that needs dedicated resources and ownership at the highest level. Recognising this, DHL has designed a 10-step process, which it has implemented across its global supply chain business. This paper provides an overview of what a supply chain really looks like, what can cause disruptions and how far up/down the supply chain companies need to go with their BCM planning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In August 2008 an intensive pumping experiment was carried out in order to assess the capacity of Brestovica – Klarici water supply in summer conditions, and its chemical quality. Groundwater was pumped for a period of 30 days, from three wells at the Klarici pumping station, and from well B-10/06, with a common capacity of 470 L/s. The fact that pumping caused a decrease in the water table in well B-10/06 by only 17 cm at a pumping rate of 265 L/s suggests that larger quantities of groundwater could be pumped from this well. The tracer experiment, performed at the B-10/06 temporary pipeline discharge area, showed that no pumped water was returned to the area of the exploited wells during the pumping test. Tracer uranine, which had been injected at the effluent from the pumped water from the well, was detected only at the Sardos Spring. The intensive pumping resulted in changes in the chemical and isotopic composition of oxygen in the water, due to a greater impact of the water from the intergranular SocaRiver aquifer on the karst aquifer.The chemical quality of groundwater from well B-10/06 is adequate for the purpose of drinking water supply. The presence of bacteria in groundwater is typical of karst aquifers and the water needs to be disinfected for further use.Keywords: groundwater, Classical Karst, Brestovica – Klariči aquifer, pumping test, tracer test, geochemical analysis.</jats:p>"

This study aims to solve the problem that the high content of fine sands in summer in the Chongqing section of the Yangtze River means that it can not be directly taken as the water source for a heat pump system, and also to reduce the energy consumption of the hydrocyclone through the improvement of its structure design. In this research, the RANS approach was applied to simulate the three-dimensional flow field of the hydrocyclone, a Reynolds stress model (RSM) was introduced and used to make the RANS equation close. In the modeling study of the separation mechanism of the hydrocyclone, the impacts of operating parameters and structure parameters on the hydrocyclone SE were studied using RANS methods based on the commercial software FLUENT. Consequently, a new-style hydrocyclone with inclined inlet and ramp board and central solid rod was designed to enhance the SE according to previous numerical modeling results. Under the conditions of the optimal inlet velocity of 15 m s−1 for the new structure and with a sand volume fraction of 10%, the SE of the new structure can be increased near to 60% for 0.004 mm sand particles, and the overflow production capacity can be enhanced to 20 m3 h−1. These data are required both for evaluating the potential use of the hydrocyclone for the separation of sands from water and for studying the new structure which may be important in practical applications to reduce energy consumption, and these comparisons will assist hydrocyclone designers in choosing appropriate turbulence models and structures, and benefit future modeling research.</jats:p>",

In particular, the causes and magnitude of declining runoff in the region remain unclear. This study investigated the recent climatic and hydrological trends in the TRHR. We also analyzed the influence of climate change on runoff decline. Meteorological and runoff data on the TRHR since 1961 were used. The results showed that ‘China's Water Tower’ is threatened by climate changes in several ways. The strong warming trend was the main driving factor for runoff decline. Moreover, the earlier thawing of snow and ice on frozen soil led to a significant decline in May runoff. The descending trend of the runoff coefficient suggests that basin storage and the mechanism of runoff generation may have changed appreciably. Climate warming has also caused recent degradation in the alpine wetland ecosystem and a considerable reduction in the runoff coefficient, thereby inducing a decreasing trend in river runoff. A common understanding of runoff decline due to climate change can be used in the planning and management for social, economic and cultural systems in China and surrounding countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The efficiency of the fuel cell system nonlinearly depends on operating conditions and the air flow supplied to the fuel cell system is one of the most significant factors in determining the efficiency. The conventional method of controlling the air flow is to stabilize the oxygen supply at a predetermined constant rate for the optimal efficiency. However, in practice, the optimal point can deviate from the pre-set value due to the varying operating conditions, such as the uncontrollable load. Therefore, the maximum efficiency point tracking (MEPT) controller is necessary to maintain the optimal efficiency over a broad range of operating conditions. In this paper, the MEPT controller is designed based on the extremum seeking control algorithm for searching the optimal oxygen excess ratio in real time to maximize the efficiency of the fuel cell system. Simulation was conducted in the matlab/simulink environment and the results demonstrate that the proposed control method is able to track the maximum efficiency point when variations in operating conditions occur.</jats:p>",

It is important to assess this situation because it could cause measuring and billing inaccuracies due to both non-revenue water and metering errors. MCP (multivariate case profiling) methodology summarizes IWM (intelligent water metering) information by means of categories and levels suited to distinguish different causes concurring on each individual case. We characterised a significant group of ‘Lowflow’ cases showing at the same reading period: ‘significant consumption at normal flows’ but ‘significant continuous consumption at flows lower than normal for intended uses’. We propose variables associated to the new MCP Lowflow category by analysing: (1) lowest intervals of the flow-volume histogram to assess ‘consumption at flows lower than normal’; (2) minimal mean flow in the volume-time histogram to assess ‘intended uses’. MCP yields Lowflow case classification tables, indexes and analytical tools applying those variables, the aim being to detect and assess such abnormal low flow consumptions for any case or group of cases.</jats:p>",

The PACs were assessed based on previous studies, which represented the relationships between 2-MIB adsorption capacity and surface area, pore distribution, bulk oxygen content and surface oxygen functional groups. From the results, we assumed the 2-MIB adsorption mechanism and studied relationships between 2-MIB number and ash content of PAC or pH value of PAC slurry. It was shown that the 2-MIB number correlated with the ash content and the pH value.

An umbrella organization plays a chain coordinator role in horizontal coordination. The umbrella organization leads, directs, and makes major decisions.

The coordinators’ tangible (finance, technology, and people) and intangible (leadership, extra efforts, relevant experiences and education, relationship management skills, research abilities, and performance measurement skills) assets are the key determinants of chain‐coordination success.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With machine tools evolving with the hardware and control whose dramatic advances are expanding the field, requirements for performance have grown tougher. These have made it more complicated to design, produce, and maintain machine tool systems. This has also ensured that performance evaluation and prediction technology play an increasingly important and active role in these areas. Green manufacturing technology (GM) and green supply chain management (GrSCM) are becoming increasingly important as awareness of global warming, energy security, pollution, metal shortages, etc., grow. Although sustainability has economic and social dimensions, the objective of GMand GrSCM is to enhance environmental sustainability.  IJAT published a special issue on Design and Manufacturing Toward Sustainability in January 2009. Global manufacturing networks and eco-city projects are increasingly widespread. This special issue therefore includes GrSCM, and eco-business issues, together with GM and green-product design. The focus here is on opening a scientific discussion on these topics through considering which challenges should be addressed.  This special issue covers the following proposals: 1. Key success factors and eco-business methodology  2. Efficient scheduling algorithms for production, logistics, and projects as economic improvement becomes more environmentally friendly  3. Simulation for analyzing supply chain robustness 4. Surveys summarizing conventional studies related to green supply chains  Since the proposed topics in this special issue are somewhat limited, we encourage you to new promising topics. Most conventional GrSCM and sustainable supply-chain studies, for example, cover only concepts and surveys. Efficient algorithms for logistics in factories or supply chains are not new to the academic field. We encourage young researchers to move away from already mined areas to more challenging subjects.  Another example is the socio-technical approach which needs various research fields such as economics, business, policy, and life-cycle assessment because stakeholders include governments, people and enterprises.  We would like to express our sincere appreciation to the authors for their submissions and to the reviewers for their invaluable efforts. Without these, this special issue could not have been published.  This special issue on machine tool evaluation should prove especially interesting to researchers and engineers engaged in the enhancement of accuracy, efficiency, and versatility in machine tool systems, including the important disciplines of tooling and cutting tools.  The topics that are covered in this special issue include – but are not limited to – the metrology of machine tools, the identification of kinematic errors through machine tool geometry, the evaluation of thermal deformation, the dynamic analysis of machine tools, the evaluation of spindle stiffness, and cutting-edge monitoring technology. All of these provide advanced knowledge concerning that state-of-the-art of technology required to ensure that machine tool design continues to remain innovative. I would like to close here by expressing my sincere appreciation to all those who have worked to make this issue interesting and informative. My special thanks go to the authors of the featured articles and to the reviewers whose invaluable efforts have made this publication possible.</jats:p>",

In spite of this, DCs have only scarcely been taken up in (sustainable) supply chain management (SSCM) research. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to discuss the complementarities of DCs and SSCM research; and second, to develop a framework which integrates DCs in SSCM practices. </jats:p>\n            </jats:sec>\n            <jats:sec>\n               <jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title>\n               <jats:p> – The paper is conceptual in nature and grounded in SSCM and DC theory.

Discussion on the nature of DCs is still going on, as well as on how to measure supply chain performance. The framework can only give indications and help in the theory building process.

This paper presents a methodology of life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) of a unit RWH system (hereafter RWH system) for toilet flushing in an industrial site. The life cycle cost and net present value benefits (NPVB) were estimated for the RWH system and compared with those of a conventional system. For the current system design, the analysis of the life cycle cost of the RWH system indicates negative NPVB for all plausible service lives up to 55 years, mainly because of the initial infrastructure investment costs, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, and pumping costs for the system. However, sensitivity analysis concluded that an alternative design with no pump, low O&amp;M costs (5%) and 1% tank refill volume may be economically viable given 7 years of service life. The sensitivity analysis also revealed that higher hypothetical water prices ($5/m3) may lead to positive NPVB after only 5 years of service. Full cost pricing for rainwater harvesting is important for the promotion of sustainable practices and life cycle based system design is critical to make RWH systems economically attractive.</jats:p>",

Biofilms were grown on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and stainless steel (SS) coupons under laminar (Reynolds number: 2000) and turbulent (Reynolds number: 11000) flow. The parameters analysed were the numbers of total and cultivable bacteria. The impact of different process conditions was assessed after the biofilms reached steady-state. The number of total bacteria was mostly higher than those cultivable. Biofilm steady-state was achieved in 3 days in both bioreactors with adhesion surfaces under turbulent flow. Under laminar flow it was only achieved in 6 days. The numbers of total and cultivable bacteria in turbulent flow-generated biofilms were similar in both bioreactors, regardless of the adhesion surface tested. Under laminar flow, the Propella™ bioreactor allowed the formation of steady-state biofilms with a higher number of total and cultivable bacteria than the flow cell system. Comparing the effects of the flow regime on biofilm accumulation, only turbulent flow-generated biofilms formed on the flow cell system had a higher amount of total and cultivable bacteria than those formed under laminar flow. In terms of adhesion surface effects, a higher number of total and cultivable cells were found on PVC surfaces compared to SS when biofilms were formed in the flow cell system. Biofilm formation on PVC and SS was similar in the Propella™ system for both flow regimes.</jats:p>",

By using the operational decision as a signal to influence external investors’ beliefs, the downstream firm's manager intends to maximize a convex combination of the interim share price and the terminal cash flows. We show that equity‐based incentives create a side effect. Specifically, with a universal buy‐back contract, the deadweight loss of signaling induced by equity‐based incentives could spread throughout the supply chain and cause chain‐wide damages. To mitigate such undesirable consequences, we propose a new mechanism to eliminate the inefficiency. We derive the optimal mechanism that maximizes the downstream firm's profits subject to the constraint that the supply chain efficiency is not undermined. In contrast to the full‐information benchmark, this mechanism gives positive surplus to the supplier. [Submitted: January 5, 2011. Revisions received: June 20, 2011; December 11, 2011.

The chlorine and pipe material influenced the bacterial community. Biofilms formed faster and to a greater extent in ARs with cast iron coupons (HPC 107 CFU/cm2) compared to those with polycarbonate coupons (HPC 105 CFU/cm2). Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, it was found that Gammaproteobacteria were prevalent in all cases with polycarbonate pipes, whereas with cast iron pipes microbial populations were affiliated with the phylum Proteobacteria, including the classes Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria, followed by the phyla Bacteroidetes and uncultured bacterium.</jats:p>",

Several techniques were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of these materials, including surface area, pHpzc, and Boehm titration. Results indicated that surface physical and chemical properties can influence the adsorption uptake of bromate on ACs simultaneously. Surface basicity and pHpzc were both found to influence the electrostatic interactions between the bromate ions and the surface of the carbon. A correlation was found between basic groups and the adsorption capacity for bromate. The adsorption capacity of the carbon was found to be linearly proportional to the amount of basic groups on the surface. The bromate adsorption data collected from all the samples were found to fit the Toth isotherm model, indicating that the bromate adsorption process could occur on heterogeneous surfaces.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Gnangara Groundwater System meets about 50% of all water needs for the Perth–Peel region of Western Australia (population 1.7 million). Much of the water is contained in an unconfined aquifer which occurs in coastal sand dunes and supports ecologically-important throughflow wetlands. The system has been subject to significant climate change since about 1975, although the persistent and unidirectional nature of the change was not recognised for some time. As well as climate, groundwater levels are affected by land use (e.g. plantation forestry, urbanisation) and land management (e.g. how plantations and stormwater are managed) as well as by the amount of groundwater abstraction from each of several inter-connected aquifers. Land, water and forests are managed by different government agencies with their own policy objectives. Maintaining groundwater levels within an agreed range of values to protect the wetlands requires informed and early adaptation by these agencies as well as a supportive community. Adaptation was hampered because there was little or no experience of managing groundwater for climate change and the causes of declining levels were neither clear nor agreed. Even when target water level decisions were agreed, their achievement required the cooperation of parties with different priorities. This paper examines some of the lessons learned from this experience and the current approach to manage the land, water and forest resources to meet multiple objectives in a system that is undergoing transitional change rather than reaching a new equilibrium. Climate change impacts have been progressive and the concept of a system that can respond in a resilient manner after a temporary perturbation is not an appropriate concept in this example. Climate adaptation involves significant social and institutional change as well as biophysical changes to make the most of a changing system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The dynamic stability of a typical offshore service vessel operating under stability critical operating conditions was investigated. Excessive roll motions and relative motions at the stern were studied for two loading conditions for ship speeds ranging from zero to the design speed. A linear frequency-domain seakeeping analysis was followed by nonlinear time-domain simulations of ship motions in waves. Based on results from these methods, critical scenarios were selected and simulated using finite-volume solvers of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations to understand the phenomena related to dynamically unstable ship motions and to confirm the results of the simpler analysis methods. The results revealed the possibility of excessive roll motions and water run-up on deck; countermeasures such as a ship-specific operational guidance are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The objective of this study is to assess how bioenergy costs and supply potential in Mozambique develop over time in a spatially explicit way. The land availability for energy crops was explored making use of a business‐as‐usual and progressive scenario on the development of other land‐use functions. The assessment of the costs and supply potential is based on developments in land availability, the suitability of the land that is and becomes available, the disaggregated cost breakdown of energy crop production, the transportation distance of feedstock to conversion plant, the cost of conversion, the transportation distance from plant to harbor, and the cost of international shipping. The supply chains of eucalyptus (torrefied) pellets and sugarcane ethanol are used as a case study. The results show a large spatial variation in supply chain costs, which is the result of spatial variation in feedstock production costs, primary transport costs, and secondary transport costs. Most promising areas for eucalyptus and sugarcane production are scattered in the central south, the central, and the north‐eastern part of Mozambique where agro‐ecological conditions are relatively favorable, where sufficient feedstock can grow to meet plant input requirements, and where infrastructure is available. In 2030, in the progressive scenario, the total potential for eucalyptus pellet production amounts 3200 PJ of which 2500 PJ could be exported to Europe below a market price level of 8 €/GJ; for sugarcane ethanol, the total potential amount is 850 PJ of which 500 PJ could be exported below a price level of 30 €/GJ. The location of production is the key factor for cost‐effective production. This study demonstrates an approach which enables the assessment of the development of bioenergy potential and costs over time in a spatially explicit way. As environmental and socio‐economic impacts of bioenergy supply chains are highly related to the biophysical and socio‐economic context of the production location, a spatially explicit assessment of bioenergy production potential is a suitable approach for the assessment of the sustainability of bioenergy chains. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</jats:p>",

The fuel cell stack and gas supply system were modeled for the purpose of performance analysis and controller design. And then the designed generalized predictive controller was implemented to control the hydrogen flow rate and oxygen compressor voltage. The simulation results illustrated that the proposed controller can provide better response characteristics of the pressure difference, hydrogen and oxygen supply system as compared with PID controller.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Oxygen-deficient waters in the ocean, generally referred to as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ), are expected to expand as a consequence of global climate change. Poor oxygenation is promoting microbial loss of inorganic nitrogen (N) and increasing release of sediment-bound phosphate (P) into the water column. These intermediate water masses, nutrient-loaded but with an N deficit relative to the canonical N:P Redfield ratio of 16:1, are transported via coastal upwelling into the euphotic zone. To test the impact of nutrient supply and nutrient stoichiometry on production, partitioning and elemental composition of phytoplankton-derived dissolved (DOC, DON, DOP) and particulate (POC, PON, POP) organic matter, three nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted with natural phytoplankton communities in shipboard mesocosms, during research cruises in the tropical waters of the South East Pacific and the North East Atlantic. Maximum accumulation of POC and PON was observed under high N supply conditions, indicating that primary production was controlled by N availability. The stoichiometry of photoautotrophic biomass was unaffected by nutrient N:P supply during exponential growth under nutrient saturation, while it was highly variable under conditions of nutrient limitation and closely correlated to the N:P supply ratio, although PON:POP of accumulated phytoplankton generally exceeded the supply ratio. Phytoplankton N:P composition was constrained by a general lower limit of 5:1. Channelling of assimilated P into DOP appears to be the mechanism responsible for the consistent offset of cellular stoichiometry relative to inorganic nutrient supply and nutrient drawdown, as DOP build-up was observed to intensify under decreasing N:P supply. Low nutrient N:P conditions in coastal upwelling areas overlying O2-deficient waters seem to represent a net source for DOP, which may stimulate growth of diazotrophic phytoplankton. These results demonstrate that microalgal nutrient assimilation and partitioning of phytoplankton-derived organic matter between the particulate and the dissolved phase are controlled by the N:P ratio of upwelled nutrients, implying substantial consequences for nutrient cycling and organic matter pools in the course of decreasing nutrient N:P stoichiometry.\n                        </jats:p>"

The polymer could optimally absorb As at pH 6.0–7.5, with the peak uptake at ∼6.9. When used in a continuous treatment process for the treatment of shallow groundwater containing 0.73 mg/L As, PTAPDAC could treat groundwater 93,333.3 times its weight.

Specifically, we focus on trust building in the context of a salesperson who acts as a representative of a manufacturer and shares demand forecast information with a retailer. The actions of the salesperson affect both her immediate economic gain and her future credibility as determined by retailer's trust. Our analysis reveals that, in such environments, although salespersons of widely varying types (e.g., honest, self‐serving, benevolent, loyal) lie some extent about their forecast information, they tend to be trusted in long relationships, provided their forecasting accuracy is higher than that of the retailer. Furthermore, while the presence of a salesperson can improve the profits of both the retailer and manufacturer, there are cost structures under which the manufacturer is better off without a salesperson. Finally, we make the general observation that the appropriate salesperson compensation scheme depends on her social characteristics, and the specific observation that when the salesperson cares for the retailer, the linear compensation scheme commonly suggested in the literature as the optimal compensation scheme for the salesperson is no longer optimal. </jats:p>",

In order to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks, this paper presents an energy supply system that uses a specially designed broadband piezoelectric energy harvesting technology for sustaining the operation of wireless sensor network nodes. The proposed energy supply circuit can apply an optimal control voltage to the piezoelectric element to ensure impedance matching between the vibration source and the energy supply system in nonresonance frequencies. As compared to the conventional piezoelectric energy harvesting circuit, it is shown that the efficiency has been increased 4 times. In this work, the overall system structure, the function modules design, and the performance testing analysis are illuminated in detail. Experimental results reveal that this energy supply system can significantly improve power within the wide bands by the active piezoelectric energy harvesting technology and enable wireless sensor network nodes to operate normally. </jats:p>",

The method could intensify oxygen supply through degradation of H2O2 to oxygen (O2). In shake flask testing, the xanthan gum yield reached 2.8% (improved by 39.4%) when adding 12.5 mM H2O2 after 24 h of fermentation. In fermentor testing, it was obvious that the oxygen conditions varied with the H2O2 addition time. Eventually, gum yield of 4.2% (w/w) was achieved (increased by 27.3%). Compared with the method of intense mixing and increasing the air flow rate, adding H2O2 to improve the dissolved oxygen concentration was more effective and much better. Moreover, addition of H2O2 improved the quality of xanthan gum; the pyruvate content of xanthan was 4.4% (w/w), higher than that of the control (3.2%).</jats:p>",

In this project, magnetic lamination-settlement measuring instrument, which is installed 3 ones in four sections each, is used to measure the settlement of the Xixi earth dam. Based on the analysis of monitoring data and simplified calculation, we get some useful conclusions. The magnetic lamination-settlement measuring instrument can directly measure the absolute value of deformation without the need to correct, calculate or measure benchmark. It’s more accurate than pipe type settlement instrument. In connection earth dam, conjoined mixing pile for resisting slippery has an effect of constraint and anti-seepage on the dam, which has played a good effect of controlling the dam settlement and the settlement difference between the ship lock and the connection earth dam. Vertical displacement of earth dam is very sensitive to the influence of factors such as water level. Settlement value of earth dam during operation is about 10.6%~38.7% of total settlement and settlement value of the head bay in ship lock during the operation is about 11.4% ~ 23.8% of total settlement.</jats:p>"

Hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) owning double pore paths and OD-HMS were synthesized by using cheap sodium silicate and a non-ion surfactant C16PyCl under room temperature here and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption–desorption measurement, and Fourier Transform-Infrared (FT-IR). Results indicate that 2-chlorophenol adsorption is initially rapid and the adsorption process reaches a steady state after 5 min. The adsorption isotherms are well described by the Langmuir and the Freundlich models, the former being found to provide a better fit with the experimental data. The effects of temperature, pH, ionic strength, and humic acid on the adsorption are also examined. According to the experimental results, the amount of 2-chlorophenol adsorbed decreases with increases of temperature from 288 to 308 K, and pH from 2.0 to 11.0, the amount of 2-chlorophenol adsorbed increases with an increase of ionic strength from 0.001 to 0.1 mol/L. However, the amount of 2-chlorophenol adsorbed onto octyl-modified ordered mesoporous silica material shows notable difference in the presence of humic acid. The desorption process shows a reversibility of 2-chlorophenol adsorption onto octyl-modified ordered mesoporous silica material. Thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy are calculated from the experimental data at different temperatures. Based on the results, It was found that octyl-modified ordered mesoporous silica shows significant adsorption for 2-chlorophenol. This might be due to hydrophobic interaction among the octyl functional groups and 2-chlorophenol.</jats:p>",

In these channels, sediment transport equations typically over‐predict bedload flux by several orders of magnitude because they do not account for sediment‐supply limited conditions. Thus, accurate predictions of bedload flux require an estimate of the sediment available for transport in a given event. We demonstrate through field measurements that boulder step protrusion is a proxy for sediment availability. Protrusion is also a function of the time elapsed since an extreme event and this simple relationship can be used to estimate the relative sediment availability at any given time. In addition, bedload transport predictions in a steep channel were only accurate if they included this variable protrusion. Predictions of sedimentation hazards, water quality, river restoration success, long‐term channel network evolution, and channel stability may therefore require estimates of sediment availability for transport.</jats:p>",

Due to the coastal location, the impact of saline intrusion needs to be considered. The confined Peninsula Aquifer comprises a complex fault system in a fractured rock environment. Analytical equations do not indicate any negative impact of saline intrusion. The impact of different parameters on the interaction between fresh and sea water was tested in a 2D sensitivity analysis. The hydraulic gradient and dispersivity were identified as crucial parameters. In addition, the impact of discrete fractures within a porous medium was tested. Fracture apertures in the likely range of the case study (b &amp;lt; 1 mm) showed a negligible effect. The geology of the Peninsula Aquifer was modelled as an Equivalent Porous Medium (EPM) whereby highly fractured zones around the faults were assigned high hydraulic conductivity. A maximum increase in salinity of 30 mg/l was predicted for the first 20 years of groundwater abstraction. An impact of vertical fractures with b &amp;gt; 1 mm was detected that is hardly predictable. In order to prove the gained conclusions and completely eliminate a harmful impact, further investigations are recommended.</jats:p>",

In the context of sustainable development, the effective management of supplier relationships has therefore attracted particular attention in sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). This paper investigates two SSCM strategic approaches in Germany's largest stock companies with regard to supplier management. Supplier evaluation and selection adopts a risk‐oriented strategic perspective whereas supplier development represents a business‐opportunity‐oriented approach to managing supplier chains for sustainable products. The survey‐based analysis reveals that large German stock companies mainly implement risk‐oriented SSCM strategies. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment</jats:p>",

Federal-level biofuel strategy is currently more geared to bioethanol, as nonfood oils continue to be more cost-competitive and canola seeded area is forecast to increase 10% as a new record due to strong prices and high expected yields. Increasing focus is therefore being placed on alternative oilseeds as nonfood crops for biodiesel and their ability to adapt to the semiarid conditions of the Canadian Prairies and provide benefits in nutrient and water-use efficiency when introduced into the crop rotation. Systems engineering and supply-chain modeling and optimization will have an increasingly important role in decision making for designating supply units, the linkage of processes and chains, and biorefinery system design. However, current models require further enhancement to address current challenging questions: (1) changing spatial considerations (e.g., land use and suitability for feedstocks), (2) changing temporal dynamics of supply and risk of climate extreme impacts on transportation networks (road, rail, pipeline), price volatility, changes in policy targets and subsidy regimes, process technological change, and multigenerational biorefinery systems engineering advancements.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze the value of and interaction between production postponement and information sharing, which are two distinct strategies to reduce manufacturers’ uncertainty about demand. In both single‐level and two‐level supply chains, from the manufacturer's perspective, while information sharing is always valuable, production postponement can sometimes be detrimental. Furthermore, the value of production postponement is not merely driven by savings in inventory holding cost as postponement enables the manufacturer to avoid both excess and shortfall in production. We find that production postponement and information sharing strategies may substitute, complement, or conflict with each other, depending on the extent of the increase in the unit production cost when production is postponed. In a two‐level supply chain, from the retailer's perspective, information sharing and production postponement can be beneficial or detrimental. When information sharing is beneficial to the retailer, the retailer always shares her demand information with the manufacturer voluntarily. In addition, this voluntary information sharing is truthful because inflated or deflated demand information hurts the retailer through a higher wholesale price or a stock‐out. However, the retailer never shares her demand information voluntarily if the manufacturer has already adopted production postponement because production postponement and information sharing strategies always conflict with each other. Even when the retailer does not benefit from information sharing, we show that the manufacturer can always design an incentive mechanism to induce the retailer to share the demand information, irrespective of whether the manufacturer has already implemented production postponement or not. The above findings underscore the need for a careful assessment of demand uncertainty‐reduction strategies before the supply chain players embark upon them. </jats:p>",

The duration until retirement is modeled using single and competing risk specifications, observed and unobserved heterogeneity, and flexible baseline hazards. Wealth is used as a proxy for elapsed duration to mitigate the potential selection bias stemming from conditioning on initial participation. The competing risk specification distinguishes complete multiperiod routes to retirement, such as unemployment followed by early retirement. A result on comparison of coefficients across all states is offered. The empirical results indicate a strong impact of health changes on retirement and hence a large potential for public policy measures intended to retain older workers longer in the labor force. Disability responds more to health shocks than early retirement, especially to diseases of the circulatory, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems, as well as mental and behavioral disorders. Some unemployment spells followed by early retirement appear voluntary and spurred by life style diseases. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Although mineral dissolution rates show dependences on temperature and moisture in theoretical models and laboratory experiments, effects of climate on chemical erosion rates in nature remain uncertain, in part because variations in physical erosion rates and lithology can obscure climatic signals in chemical erosion rate measurements. Here we present new estimates of millennial‐scale chemical and physical erosion rates along two altitudinal transects in the Idaho Batholith. Our measurements suggest that chemical erosion rates and the extent of regolith chemical alteration are insensitive to mean annual regolith temperature, even though the study sites span a wide range in temperatures (4.8°C–10.9°C). These data also suggest that rates of chemical erosion and the extent of regolith chemical alteration are weakly correlated with the annual duration of high regolith moisture conditions. Lastly, our measurements show that the sampled regoliths tend to grow more chemically weathered with increasing regolith residence time, implying that weathering at these sites is primarily limited by mineral dissolution kinetics rather than mineral supply rates to the regolith. The lack of strong control by mineral supply means that chemical erosion rates at these sites could potentially vary in response to climatic factors. Such climatically driven variation in chemical erosion rates is not obvious in our data, however. Instead, our measurements suggest that chemical erosion rates at these sites are insensitive to mean annual regolith temperature and only weakly dependent on the length of the wet season.</jats:p>",

Ranked among these threats are hazardous material releases from leaking or improperly managed underground storage tanks located at municipal, commercial, and industrial facilities. To reduce human health and environmental risks associated with the subsurface storage of hazardous materials, government agencies have taken a variety of legislative and regulatory actions—which date back more than 25 years and include the establishment of rigorous equipment/technology/operational requirements and facility‐by‐facility inspection and enforcement programs. Given a history of more than 470,000 underground storage tank releases nationwide, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency continues to report that 7,300 new leaks were found in federal fiscal year 2008, while nearly 103,000 old leaks remain to be cleaned up. In this article, we report on an alternate evidence‐based intervention approach for reducing potential releases from the storage of petroleum products (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, heating/fuel oil, and waste oil) in underground tanks at commercial facilities located in Rhode Island. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a new regulatory model can be used as a cost‐effective alternative to traditional facility‐by‐facility inspection and enforcement programs for underground storage tanks. We conclude that the alternative model, using an emphasis on technical assistance tools, can produce measurable improvements in compliance performance, is a cost‐effective adjunct to traditional facility‐by‐facility inspection and enforcement programs, and has the potential to allow regulatory agencies to decrease their frequency of inspections among low risk facilities without sacrificing compliance performance or increasing public health risks.</jats:p>",

The objective is simultaneous minimization of the expected annualized cost and the financial risk. The latter criterion is measured by conditional value‐at‐risk and downside risk. The model simultaneously determines the optimal network design, technology selection, capital investment, production planning, and logistics management decisions. Multicut L‐shaped method is implemented to circumvent the computational burden of solving large scale problems. The proposed modeling framework and algorithm are illustrated through four case studies of hydrocarbon biorefinery supply chain for the State of Illinois.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>1. Fish stocking is an increasingly common management tool for freshwater and marine environments and is often used to create and maintain fisheries in closed waters. The densities at which fish are stocked can have a large impact on a stocking programme’s success and sustainability. Stocking densities in impoundment sport‐fisheries, for example, are often based on social or practical factors, and ecologically based stocking models are needed to assist the selection of stocking densities that are appropriate for the environment.</jats:p><jats:p>2. In this study, stocking density is calculated with a numerical model that balances the supply of prey production with the energetic demand of stocked fish. The model aims to deliver outcomes over a range of potential management objectives, by providing specific consumption scenarios that represent the trade‐off between population abundance and individual body size in stocked fisheries.</jats:p><jats:p>3. The model uses a steady‐state population approach to calculate stocking density, which optimises population consumption by maintaining a consistent biomass distribution and encourages sustainable stocking by considering the energetic needs of all cohorts. Carrying capacity is represented by the steady‐state stocking density under a minimum consumption scenario (when fish meet only their minimum energetic needs). The comparison between a desired consumption rate and the existing level of production is used to assess the status or ‘health’ of the existing population and is used to determine whether stocking can occur and whether stocking densities can be sustainably increased. The probability of incorrectly assuming populations are achieving a given consumption level is also estimated, which is an ideal approach for interpreting multiple probability distributions.</jats:p><jats:p>4. A Monte‐Carlo analysis of uncertainty was used to provide a probability distribution of stocking density of Australian bass (<jats:italic>Macquaria novemaculeata</jats:italic>) in three Australian impoundments under various seasonal and consumption scenarios. The likely consumption rates of the existing populations were determined using historical stocking densities, which showed that the three populations were of reasonable health, although one impoundment may be overstocked. The steady‐state stocking densities depended on the desired consumption rate, and there was an eightfold difference in the stocking density aimed at providing large ‘trophy’ fish and the density required to reach carrying capacity.</jats:p><jats:p>5. Model outputs of existing abundance and biomass density agreed with empirical estimates of abundance and relative density in these impoundments, which provides support to the model’s accuracy. This supply–demand approach to estimating the range of appropriate stocking densities shows promise as a decision‐support tool for stocked impoundments and other closed fisheries.</jats:p>",

In the present study, detection of C. parvum and G. lamblia was performed by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Pairs of PCR primers were evaluated for the detection specificity to pathogenic C. parvum and G. lamblia. The recovery of the RT-PCR detection procedure was examined and high recovery rates (i.e., more than 45％ for C. parvum and more than 50％ for G. lamblia ) were achieved. The RT-PCR method was used to detect C. parvum and G. lamblia in a secondary water supply. The results indicated the potential application of the quantitative RT- PCR method in detection of C. parvum and G. lamblia in water supply.</jats:p>"

Heating load variation of a group energy apartment building according to the outdoor air temperature was predicted by a correlation obtained from calorimetry measurements of all households in the apartment building. Supply water temperature and mass flow rate were simultaneously controlled to minimize the heat loss rate through the distribution pipe line. A group heating apartment building located in Hwaseong city, Korea, which has 1473 households, was selected as the object building to test the present heat supply algorithm. Compared to the original heat supply system, the present system adopting the proposed control algorithm reduced the heat loss rate by 10.4%.</jats:p>"

The literature reveals that the informal sector is characterised by a great deal of flexibility and is exempt from formal market rigidities on the one hand, but on the other hand, this sector can constitute a trap from which it is difficult to exit for workers active in the sector with low wages. In this article, we aim to identify the main characteristics differentiating the labour supply of workers on the informal and formal market in the Philippines while estimating these two labour supplies, capturing discrete choice or changes in employment status. We use these estimates to construct a labour supply model that can serve as an input for a broader macro–microsimulation model applied to the Philippines. The results of the estimation provide relatively intuitive findings, highlighting some differences between the two markets. We also shed some light on this macro–microsimulation modelling framework that is generally opaque, in describing how to construct a microsimulation model with endogenous discrete choice model linked to a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. </jats:p><jats:p> JEL Classification: C35, O53, J24, C81, O17 </jats:p>",

To understand the genetic mechanisms controlling PH, EH and the PH/EH ratio in response to nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) supply, a set of 218 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was used to evaluate PH, EH, PH/EH ratio and grain yield (GY) and grain yield components under low N, low P and normal N and P supply (NP). A total of 100 QTLs (quantitative trait loci) were detected for the traits investigated. Several QTLs were found to be associated with PH (bin 1.06/1.07) only, both PH and EH (umc1692 at bin 5.01/5.03; umc2313‐umc1006 at bin 6.02) and the PH/EH ratio (bnlg1484‐bnlg1866 at bin 1.03; umc1164‐um1757 at bin 4.01) which was also associated with grain yield. N‐ or P‐inducible QTLs for PH, EH and the PH/EH ratio were found in both years and are sensitive to weather conditions.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Assessment of the soil N supply capacity is essential to optimize N fertilizer use. The soil N supply capacity of 102 soil samples (0–15 cm) from 25 sites collected from 2004 to 2007 across four Canadian provinces was evaluated by comparing a group of chemical N availability indices with soil mineralizable N pools and a field‐based measure of soil N supply. Soil N supply was estimated by corn (<jats:italic>Zea mays</jats:italic> L.) N uptake corrected for starter fertilizer N. Two subgroups were created based on the soil texture and were compared to the whole data set. Grouping soils provided limited benefits in predicting soil potentially mineralizable nitrogen (<jats:bold><jats:italic>N</jats:italic></jats:bold><jats:sub>0</jats:sub>), but improved the prediction of soil N supply. The <jats:bold><jats:italic>N</jats:italic></jats:bold><jats:sub>0</jats:sub> was weakly related to soil N supply for the whole data set (<jats:bold><jats:italic>r</jats:italic></jats:bold> = 0.09) and in fine‐textured soils (<jats:bold><jats:italic>r</jats:italic></jats:bold> = 0.37) but the relationship was improved (<jats:bold><jats:italic>r</jats:italic></jats:bold> = 0.68) in medium‐ to coarse‐textured soils. The <jats:bold><jats:italic>N</jats:italic></jats:bold><jats:sub>0</jats:sub> was not necessarily a good predictor of soil N supply under field conditions which emphasizes the need to also consider environmental conditions. The UV absorbance of a 0.01 M NaHCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> extract at 205 nm (NaHCO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>–205), the hot KCl extractable NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>–N (HotKCl–N) and Pool I (a labile mineralizable N pool) plus NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>–N were the most promising N availability indices because they are easy to perform and they were positively and significantly related to soil N supply in the whole data set as well as the soil texture subgroups (0.28 <jats:bold>≤ <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> ≤</jats:bold> 0.62). This study demonstrated that grouping soils based on texture can increase the proportion of variation in soil N supply explained by N availability indices when data from contrasting environmental conditions, soil types, and years are used.</jats:p>",

All strategies considered spring soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) and the labile mineralizable N pool (Pool I), and correction of the value of <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> was evaluated based on temperature (T) only, or based on both T and water content (θ). The strategies examined: (i) the depth of the soil used; (ii) the choice of <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> value used for Pool I; and (iii) the replenishment of the mineralizable N pools. Predicted SNS was compared with a field‐based estimate of plant available soil nitrogen supply (PASNS) measured as plant (vine plus tuber) N uptake plus residual nitrate at harvest in unfertilized plots. When <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> was corrected using T only, the strategies generally overestimated the PASNS. When <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> was corrected using both T and θ, predicted SNS was not significantly different from PASNS in most cases. The most promising strategy used a depth of 0 to 20 cm, the common depth for tillage, rather than 0 to 15 cm, which represents the actual depth used for soil sampling. This study demonstrated that SNS can be adequately predicted using a simple kinetic model, and that consideration of soil water content was important in predicting SNS even in humid soil moisture regimes.</jats:p>",

Robustness against variations in manufacturing tasks under undesirable situations is a crucial capability of global supply chains. Flexible and portable facilities can be shared among suppliers to increase supply chain robustness. This study proposes a system for modeling and simulating a supply chain in which portable machine tools are shared among the suppliers and relocated in order to adapt to machine tool breakdowns and manufacturing volume excesses. The system supports complex decision making in terms of the logistics of these machine tools with a view to decreasing the average completion time of manufacturing tasks without adding machine tools into the supply chain as a whole.</jats:p>",
