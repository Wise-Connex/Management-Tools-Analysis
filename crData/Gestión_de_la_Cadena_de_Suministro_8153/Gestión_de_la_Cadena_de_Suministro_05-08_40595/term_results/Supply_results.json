Most studies, however, treat buyer–supplier relationships as a single construct. Recognizing that buyer–supplier relationships are a much more complex phenomenon, this study first identifies three critical constructs including supply base reduction, communication and long‐term relationships for a broader conceptualization of buyer–supplier relationships. It then explores the effects of strategic purchasing on these three constructs, along with their impacts on dyadic quality performance. The proposed path analytical model was tested using structural equation modeling. Results provide robust support for the notion that strategic supply management improves the quality performance of both supplier and buyer firms.</jats:p>",

This research uses a multiround Delphi study of key procurement and supply management executives to better understand which procurement and supply management strategies may lead to significant improvements over the next 5–10 years. The results indicate that strategies such as increased integration, information sharing and collaboration among supply chain members are most likely to be implemented and will have the largest impact on organizations. However, this integration will not include joint investment or asset sharing, will be limited to one tier in the supply chain, and will not heavily involve e‐markets and electronic auctions.</jats:p>",

Many advantages and disadvantages have been put forward, revealing considerable divergence in opinion on the merits of portfolio models. This study addresses the question of whether or not the use of purchasing portfolio models is considered as a sign of purchasing sophistication. Using data from a broad sample of industries, it was found that purchasing sophistication is a two‐dimensional construct: purchasing's professionalism and purchasing's position within companies. Results revealed that the position and the professionalism of purchasing are both positively related to the greater use of purchasing portfolio models. Findings indicate that portfolio usage is definitely a sign of purchasing sophistication.</jats:p>",

Besides the canonical C-shaped and S-shaped curves, their mirrored reflections and also L-shaped and J-shaped forms were observed. The \"backward bend\" concept for poor households and the S-shaped LS curve concept for households with \"primary\", \"secondary\" and \"tertiary\" workers helped to find explanations for the cases. One can observe the same phenomena once found out in India and Africa.

Estimates are made of the number of wells required for the development of each prospect identifi ed by the geological assessment and the associated supply costs. A discovery process model can be used to project future discovery rates and associated costs of the basin development. Alternatively, these projections can be derived by extrapolation of trends in the historical discovery rates and supply costs with the constraint of the geologically estimated ultimate recoverable potential. Various mathematical formulae have been used to make these extrapolations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper proposes a discovery process model that provides approximate consistency with the projections of discovery rates and supply costs derived from the extrapolations of trends in the historical data. The model is estimated using the results of a detailed assessment of the wells required to develop the individual prospects given by a play-by-play geological assessment and the associated supply costs. The Canadian Energy Research Institute recently used the proposed discovery model in a study of the Canadian natural gas supply potential.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The purpose of an oil and gas supply model is to provide projections of oil and gas supplies from a basin or region for alternative market and fiscal inputs. A play-by-play geological assessment of the remaining petroleum resources and historical records for past drilling and discoveries of the basin or region provide the basic information for such a model.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A comprehensive supply model requires the simulation of the following four processes. Each of these simulations is referred to as a \"model.\"The prospect model-a simulation of the extraction process for an individual prospect identified by the geological assessment, which together comprise the remaining resources of the region. For each prospect, this simulation provides estimates of the numbers of development wells, the production, the total recovery, and the associated supply costs for the extraction of the resource from the prospect.The discovery model-a simulation of the discovery process for individual prospects identified by the geological assessment. The model relates cumulative wells drilled and supply costs for extraction to cumulative discoveries.The activity model-a simulation of the decision making process for drilling activity. The model provides an estimate of annual drilling and thereby, using the functions provided by the discovery model, determines annual reserves additions for the region and supply costs for the extraction of these resources.The production model-a simulation of the production process. The model provides a projection of future production volumes for the region.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The simulation of the discovery process is the focus of this paper.

In the single moral-hazard case, the buyer’s quality is observable, whereas in the double moral-hazard case, the buyer’s quality is not observable. The supplier’s quality is not observable in both the single and double moral-hazard cases. In each case, we examine a warranty/penalty contract between the buyer and the supplier based on information from incoming inspection and external failures. When the warranty contract is based on information from external failures in the single moral-hazard case, the first-best quality is achieved, whereas in the double moral-hazard case, the first-best quality is achieved if the supplier is not held responsible for the buyer’s defects. When the warranty contract is based on information from incoming inspection, the first-best is achieved in both the single and double moral-hazard cases, even when the incoming inspection does not identify all of the supplier’s defectives. An analysis of whether the penalty on the supplier in each case meets a fairness criterion—that is, the penalty does not exceed the manufacturer’s external failure cost—indicates that the fairness criterion is met by the warranty contract based on information from incoming inspection when the first-best incoming inspection is sufficiently high. However, if the first-best incoming inspection is low and the precision of pinpointing the supplier’s responsibility for external failure is sufficiently high, the warranty contract based on external failures could satisfy the fairness criterion. </jats:p>",

Even in basins with a highly developed infrastructure, users are subject to unreliable water supplies, incurring substantial economic losses during periods of scarcity. More flexible instruments, such as voluntary exchanges of water among users, can help users to reduce risk exposure. This article looks at the effects of spot water markets on the economic risk caused by water availability variations. Our theoretical and empirical risk analyses are based on the random profits of water users. Profit probability density functions are formally and graphically characterized for both water sellers and buyers under several possible market outcomes. We conclude from this analysis that, where water supply is stochastic, water markets unambiguously reduce both parties' risk exposure. The empirical study is conducted on an irrigation district in the Guadalquivir Valley (Southern Spain), where there is a high probability of periods of extreme water scarcity. Water demand functions for the district representative irrigators and a spatial equilibrium model are used to simulate market exchanges and equilibrium. This programming model is combined with statistical simulation techniques. We show that the profit probability distribution of a representative irrigator is modified if water exchanges are authorized, leading to risk reductions. Results also indicate that if the market were extended to several districts and users that are subject to varying hydrological risk exposure, extremely low‐profit events would be less likely to occur. In sum, we show that exchanging water in annual spot markets can reduce farmers' economic vulnerability caused by water supply variability across irrigation seasons. These results support the water policy reform carried out in Spain in 1999 to allow for voluntary water exchanges among right holders.</jats:p>",

The central question is to determine what suppliers, parts, processes, and transportation modes to select at each stage in the supply chain. There might be multiple options to supply a raw material, to manufacture or assemble the product, and to transport the product to the customer. Each of these options is differentiated by its lead time and direct cost added. Given these various choices along the supply chain, the configuration problem is to select the options that minimize the total supply chain cost. We develop a dynamic program with two state variables to solve the supply chain configuration problem for supply chains that are modeled as spanning trees. We illustrate the problem and its solution with an industrial example. We use the example to show the benefit from optimization relative to heuristics and to form hypotheses concerning the structure of optimal supply chain configurations. We conduct a computational experiment to test these hypotheses. </jats:p>",

We also perform an extensive numerical study to examine how system factors affect the benefit of information sharing and the relative values of information from each retailer. In addition, we identify cases where the cost saving due to receiving information from only one retailer captures most of the saving that can be obtained when the information is received from both retailers. Finally, we investigate the cost effectiveness of echelon-stock policies in systems with full-information sharing and introduce the “information pooling effect” as well as economies of scale with respect to information sharing. </jats:p>",

The approach defines routes among suppliers serving a large JIT assembly plant, the timing of these routes, and the frequency that they are run (implicitly defining parts quantities picked up each visit). The solutions satisfy various operational constraints at the JIT facility, including requirements for high-frequency/small-quantity deliveries and limits on space for parts storage. The solution space we consider here is restricted by an operational discipline that the industry calls common frequency routing. Under this system we only consider routing designs where each part source is being served by a single route run at a fixed daily frequency instead of designs where multiple routes visit that supplier, each potentially run at a different frequency. This dramatically reduces dimensionality of the problem and is also known to provide both management and operational advantages in practice. In solving the formulation, column generation and tabu search strategies have been developed, the latter suitable for realistic-sized problems. The utility of the approach is illustrated through a number of examples. </jats:p>",

Using apparently comparable data but different models and methods, the studies portray futures that in some aspects are quite similar and in others markedly different. This article focuses on what the differences and commonalities between the reports suggest about the key factors that help shape our views of the future of southern timber supply. What inputs and assumptions make important differences in projections of the South's timber supply future? We find that there are five major areas to watch: (i) gross land area shifts from forest to urban and from agriculture to forest (not just net timberland area change); (ii) the sensitivity of pine plantation investments to expected timber prices; (iii) the responsiveness of southern timber demand to prices; (iv) age or date of the starting inventory and the definition of timber harvest (what products are included); and (iv) the basic yield assumptions and the timing of the yield impacts from improved management and timberland area change.

The technologies used for the system design are already available in the market and, at least for the standard solutions, sufficiently mature. The innovation consists of an integration, optimization, and industrialization of this modular system, which is an electric zero-emissions generator, giving 3.5kWp as an output power. This is the only system able to produce its own fuel, guaranteeing renewable and clean energy, available where and when you want. This system is constituted by a polymer membrane electrolyzer, a metal hydrides tank (which absorbs and desorbs hydrogen), and a polymer fuel cell (PEM). The system modularity can also satisfy higher energy requirements, and the low-pressure hydrogen storage system through metal hydrides guarantees the system safety.</jats:p>",

A two‐stage economic production model is developed to examine the effects of hydrologic uncertainty and water prices on agricultural production, cropping patterns, and water and irrigation technology use. The model maximizes net expected farm profit from permanent and annual crop production with probabilistic water availability and a variety of irrigation technologies. Results demonstrate effects of water availability, price, and reliability on economic performance, annual and long‐run cropping patterns, and irrigation technology decisions. Variations in water price and availability affect the desirability of different irrigation technologies. Increased water supply reliability can raise the probability of higher economic returns and promote more effective use of water for permanent crops. Such economic benefits can be compared to costs of operational changes and programs to increase water supply reliability for agricultural areas.</jats:p>",

In this method, all the coolant supplied from the nozzle outlet can surely be directed immediately to the grinding point, because the coolant flow guided flexible sheet made of a thin sheet material is attracted to the wheel surface automatically, and confines the coolant between the wheel surface and the sheet. Therefore, the coolant can be completely prevented from deviating away from the grinding point. In fact, when the coolant flow rate of 4 l/min was supplied from the upper part of the wheel by using this method, the amount of coolant that reached the grinding point was 18 times higher than the case of only the floating nozzle method. It was clarified that this method had the effect to improve the grinding performance. Furthermore, this new method has a possibility of the wide application such as in profile grinding and cam grinding.</jats:p>"

Analysis of national RN survey data from 1977 to 2000 finds recent decreased gains and increased losses from the RN license pool, a decline in RNs working or looking for work in nursing, and RN supply shifts away from bedside nursing. Policy implications to address these trends include regulatory/legislative and incentive approaches aimed at improving education and employment. </jats:p>",

Otherwise, PCSA density of primary care physicians was unrelated to reported barriers to care, unrelated to people's satisfaction with care, and unrelated to indicators of people's use of services. Use rates of six recommended preventive health services varied in no consistent direction with physician densities. Among the elderly, only the proportion traveling over 30 minutes for care was greater in areas with lowest physician densities. Among subjects covered under Medicaid or uninsured, lower local physician densities were associated with longer travel time, difficulties with travel and reaching one's physician by phone, and two areas of dissatisfaction with care.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold>For adults as a whole in the rural South and for the elderly there, low local primary care physician densities are associated with travel inconvenience but not convincingly with other aspects of access to outpatient care.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On the basis of estimates of sediment accumulation in reservoirs, the impact of 50,000 dams on sediment supply and intertidal wetland response in the Yangtze River catchment is examined. The total storage capacity of reservoirs is 200 × 10<jats:sup>9</jats:sup>m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, or 22% of the Yangtze annual runoff. The sediment accumulation rate in reservoirs has increased from ∼0 in 1950 to &gt;850 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>t/yr in 2003. Although sediment yield has increased with broader soil erosion in the river basin, the total riverine sediment discharge rate shows a strong decreasing trend from the late 1960s to 2003, likely due to dam construction. Consequently, the total growth rate of intertidal wetlands at the delta front has decreased dramatically. A significant relationship exists between intertidal wetland growth rate and riverine sediment supply that suggests riverine sediment supply is a governing factor in the interannual to interdecadal evolution of delta wetlands. Regression analysis of intertidal wetland growth rate and sediment supply shows that intertidal wetlands at the delta front degrades when the riverine sediment discharge rate reaches a threshold level of &lt;263 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>t/yr. Owing to the construction of the Three Gorges Dam and other new dams, the sediment discharge rate of the Yangtze River will most likely decrease to below 150 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup>t/yr in the coming decades. Therefore unless current management policies are adjusted, drastic recession of Yangtze River delta intertidal wetlands can be expected to occur.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Selective browsing by cervids has persistent impacts on forest ecosystems. On Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada, introduced white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) have caused massive changes to the native boreal forest. Despite the apparent stability of the deer population over recent decades, we suspected that they were not at equilibrium with their browse supply and that further degradation of the habitat had occurred. A comparison of two browse surveys conducted 25 years apart showed a strong decline in browse availability. Although balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) P. Mill.) remained the most available browse species, it declined or disappeared from most stands (n = 13). Preferred deciduous species that were still available 25 years ago have almost disappeared. The continuous decline of the browse supply confirmed our hypothesis. This situation may be exacerbated by a subsidy from the winter litterfall, a significant and stable alternative food source. The abundance of litterfall from mature trees is independent of browsing over a long time period, which introduces a temporal uncoupling between the impact of deer browsing on balsam fir seedlings and the negative feedback from recruitment failure of mature balsam fir on the deer population. This means that the system is susceptible to being forced into an alternative regime.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Soil N supply is an important contributor of N to crop production; however, there is a lack of practical methods for routine estimation of soil N supply under field conditions. This study evaluated sampling just prior to topkill of whole potato plants that received no fertilizer N as a field bioassay of soil N supply. Three experiments were performed. In exp. 1, field trials were conducted to test if P and K fertilization, with no N fertilization, influenced plant biomass and N accumulation at topkill. In exp. 2, plant N accumulation at topkill in unfertilized plots was compared with mineral N accumulation in vegetation-free plots. In exp. 3, estimates of soil N supply were obtained from 56 sites from 1999 to 2003 using a survey approach where plant N accumulation at topkill, and soil mineral N content to 30-cm depth at planting and at tuber harvest were measured. Application of P and K fertilizer had no significant effect on plant N accumulation in two trials, and resulted in a small increase in plant N accumulation in a third trial. Zero fertilizer plots, which can be more readily established in commercial potato fields, can therefore be used instead of zero fertilizer N plots to estimate soil N supply. In exp. 2, estimates of soil N supply were generally comparable between plant N accumulation at topkill and maximum soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N accumulation in vegetation-free plots; therefore, the plant bioassay approach is a valid means of estimation of plant available soil N supply. Plant N accumulation at topkill in exp. 3 averaged 86 kg N ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, and ranged from 26 to 162 kg N ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>. Plant N accumulation was higher for sites with a preceding forage crop compared with a preceding cereal or potato crop. Plant N accumulation was generally higher in years with warmer growing season temperatures. Soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N content at harvest in exp. 3 was less than 20 kg N ha<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>, indicating that residual soil mineral N content was low at the time of plant N accumulation measurement. Soil NO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>-N content at planting was generally small relative to plant N accumulation, indicating that soil N supply in this region is controlled primarily by growing season soil N mineralization. Use of a plant bioassay approach provides a practical means to quantify climate, soil and management effects on plant available soil N supply in potato production.

Given the enduring geographic differences in the supply of general practitioners (GPs) it is timely to reconsider the impact that this increase in the provision of 'free care' will have on access to Medicare-funded GP services in rural and urban areas of Australia.

Paradoxically the modelling predicts that ceteris paribus increases in either GP supply or the bulk-billing rate appear to have perverse effects in some areas by decreasing utilisation. In the frequency of consultation model, GP density is not a predictor and increasing the bulk-billing rate will unambiguously increase the frequency of consultation across all areas. In both models, the positive impacts associated with changes in supply and cost are constrained outside the inner metropolitan area by reduced geographic accessibility to Medicare-funded GP services. The modelling also shows that people are more likely to consult a GP in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage, although socioeconomic status is not a predictor of frequency of consultation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>Bulk-billing rates and the supply of FFS GPs are important features of the Australian health care system that are, potentially, amenable to policy manipulation.

Attempting to increase bulk-billing rates in some of these areas may, in fact, reduce access to FFS GP services.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
