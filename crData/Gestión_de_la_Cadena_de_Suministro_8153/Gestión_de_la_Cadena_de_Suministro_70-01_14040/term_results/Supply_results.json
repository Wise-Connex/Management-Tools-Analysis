      "abstract": "<jats:p>Resources are the basic materials of tourism, although there are none that could be described as being intrinsically tourist in character, since it is only use that makes them so. These basic materials are still abundant. But there is a risk that, for want of foresight and adequate planning potential tourist resources will be rapidly exhausted by the booming tourist trade enjoyed by many countries. Attention must be called to this danger, threatening alike developing and industrialized countries, all of which are anxious to share in the benefits of a thriving travel industry. This presupposes a realistic identification of tourism resources focused on basic motivations of travellers, combined with a sound evaluation of the possibility of converting potential resources into resources that can actually be used. This study tackles that task by inventorizing the various types of tourism resources. The findings are followed by a series of maps showing tourist supply and proposed guidelines for a policy designed to enhance and protect tourism resource.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In extreme high noise level environments, linear filtering is not a suitable processing method and special techniques for accurately extracting sensor signal information should be considered. An interesting possibility are lock-in amplifiers (LIA), which use the phase sensitive detection technique (PSD) to take out the data signal at a specific reference frequency fo while noise signals at frequencies other than fo are rejected and do not affect significantly the measurement. Current commercial LIAs are expensive, heavy and power consuming devices, which preclude their use in portable sensing systems. Thus, this work analyses the possibility of exporting this technique to low-power low-voltage (LPLV) embedded applications. In particular, the aim is to implement a signal conditioning lock-in architecture suitable for 3V single battery-operated wireless sensor nodes. This implies to re-design all the processing elements in single supply -most reported LIAs are designed using dual power supply- and compatible with the power requirements of a wireless sensor network node. Further, looking for a compact LPLV solution, instead of a traditional sinusoidal input, a square wave input is considered, which can be directly obtained from the embedded microcontroller, thus avoiding blocks like a sinusoidal oscillator or function generator. Figure 1 shows the proposed block diagram and a photograph of the implemented device. Experimental results for signals buried in white noise, flicker noise, interference contamination and common-mode voltage contamination confirm the capability of the proposed solution to recover information from signal to noise ratios down to 24 dB with errors below 6% with an average power consumption of only 5 mW in full operation, being able to process signals with frequencies up to 43 kHz, as shown in Figure 2.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Apart from physical products, community forests (CF) in Nepal generate various ecosystemservices that could be important not only to the stakeholders at local level, but also to thestakeholders at the regional and the global levels. Water supply from CF would be one ofthe many ecosystem services whose benefits are provided to the stakeholders. Consideringthe economic importance of water supply service from CF, this study aims to assess theeconomic value of the water supply as a service from two CFs and also identify thefactors affecting an individual's willingness to pay (WTP). Contingent valuation methodwas applied to evaluate the water supply service based on the information of users' WTP.Data from 74 households (HH) in Lipindevi Thulopakho and Jarneldhara CFs in Palpadistrict (surveyed during May-June, 2008) were used. Results indicated that the meanWTP of Lipindevi Thulopakho and Jarneldhara CF users were US$ 36.62 and 25.62 HH-1 yr-1, respectively. The economic value of water supply service from Lipindevi Thulopakhoand Jarneldhara CF were US$ 93.54 ha-1 yr-1 and 134.06 ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Factorslike distance of the house from water source, daily water consumption, wealth status andcaste were associated with substantial influences on an individual's WTP. This studyconcludes that there would be a high possibility for generating extra income with thedevelopment of a payment mechanism for water supply service from CF.Key words: Community forest; contingent valuation; economic valuation; water supply;willingness to payDOI: 10.3126/banko.v20i1.3505Banko Janakari, Vol. 20, No. 1 pp.24-29</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The construction sectors in the developing countries (DCs) have recently demonstratednumerous trends towards globalisation, raising considerable concern in the field.However, the nature of the effect of demand on supply characteristics of the domesticindustry has not been sufficiently discussed with respect to what development measuresare needed in the context of constraints that originate locally to accommodate the globaltrends in DCs. This paper therefore analyses reasons for these trends and attempts toidentify the necessary industry developments to benefit from them locally. For thispurpose, the Sri Lankan construction industry has been taken as a case study and ademand and supply framework is being used to analyse the case. The analysis revealsthat while government policies contribute intrusively in stimulating demand side trends,the role of the contracting firms together with project delivery process and projectprocurement process are also subject to change as a result of these demanddeterminants. In this context, the main focus is concentrated on corporatedevelopments, while wider industry development is also necessary to support them. Asa consequence, both institutional reforms and capacity building are required to enhancefirms’ technological and managerial capacity. The necessity for these developmentmeasures reflects in partly the underdeveloped framework of the construction industry inDCs. Nevertheless, they could still foster indigenous construction capacity within thecontext of global trends.91</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose. To identify the limiting and contributing factors for the maximum realization of the genetic potential of the fodder beans productivity. Methods. Monitoring, system analysis, test sheaf method, plot collection method, variance, correlation and regression methods. Results. It is noted that the moisture supply of the growing season of fodder beans significantly influenced the features of formation of generative organs and their abortion, which was subsequently reflected in the level of their grain yield. Even in years with sufficient moisture supply (2002, 2008), the level of flower abortion was 69.1 and 74.6%, the resulting beans – 13.8 and 24.9%, while in severely dry 2015 this indicator increased: flowers – up to 84.6%, beans – up to almost 50%. The distribution of precipitation during the growing season also significantly influenced the level of abortion of fruit elements in fodder beans. The maximum level of grain yield of fodder beans (4.88 t/ha) was noted in 2002, which accounted for 81% of the realization of the genetic potential. It should be noted that obtaining a grain yield of fodder beans of more than 4.0 t/ha makes it possible to realize their genetic potential by 73-81%. The realization of the genetic potential of the grain yield level of less than 3.0 t/ha ranged from 19 to 47%. With the level of grain yield of fodder beans more than 3.0 t/ha, but less than 4.0 t/ha, the implementation was 54-65%. Conclusions. It is proved that the limiting factor in formation of a high level of fodder beans grain yield in conditions of the right-bank Forest-Steppe is moisture, which leads to its significant fluctuations from 4.88 to 1.12 t/ha. For 19 years of growing fodder beans in 6 years the grain yield was more than 4.0 t/ha, in 8 years – less than 3.0 t/ha, in 5 – more than 3.0 t/ha, but less than 4.0 t/ha. A strong positive relationship was also noted between the amount of precipitation and the level of grain yield of fodder beans (r = 0.835). However, the moisture supply of the region makes it possible to obtain the yield of fodder beans at the level of 5.00 t/ha and realize their genetic potential by 80%.</jats:p>"

The overall growth rate of area under food grain was 0.3% in 1971/72 to 2008/09. The overall food grain production growth rate is higher than population growth rate from 1971/72 to 2008/09. The own price and income elasticities of rice were -0.108 and 0.199 respectively. It was projected that upto 2021, the annual demand for food exceed the supply of food which were -0.28% for rice and -1.76% for wheat.

This process began in earnest in 2003 with the liberalization of the telecom sector as part of a strategic reform to improve efficiency in these utility sectors. So far, privatization has not improved the quality of service in these sectors. The problem has been traced to the failure of regulation. The major problem is that the regulatory regime had not matured before privatization. This immaturity manifests mostly in the failure to protect consumer interests. This article reviews regulatory deficits post-privatization. It assesses potential conflict between principles of market orthodoxy and those of constitutional governance and argues for a rule-of-law approach to regulation post-privatization that is focused on blending of promotion of market efficiency and protection of fundamental rights.Keywords: Liberalization, Privatization, Regulation, Market Efficiency, Rule of Law</jats:p>"

The protein synthesis rate observed was minimal at 4 hr after cessation of feeding, rising to a maximum 8 hr later. Protein synthesis in relation to energy supply (calculated from VFA production) was also minimal 4 hr after cessation of feeding, but did not reach a maximum until 16 hr later. Decreasing utilization of energy for protein synthesis was correlated with an increase in the polysaccharide content of the microbial cells, and a return of cellular polysaccharide levels to the pre-feeding values was accompanied by increased usage of energy for protein synthesis. The results are discussed in terms of alternative mechanisms for energy utilization at different times after feeding, and of overall microbial protein synthesis in relation to organic matter digested in the rumen.</jats:p>"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality of water used for drinking as well as household purposes in Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Eighteen water samples were collected from different rivers and canals. Among those, two samples were treated with chlorine. Physico-chemical parameters (pH, salinity, turbidity, conductivity and dissolved oxygen) were monitored during the time of sample collection using portable meters. For microbiological analysis, water samples were collected in sterile screw capped bottle. All Experiments were carried out within 24 hours after collecting the samples. All the water sources were found to be contaminated with total coliform, faecal coliform, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas spp. and Fungi except treated water samples. Several biochemical tests were performed for confirmation of suspected organisms. According to these results, huge amount of total coliform and faecal coliform were observed in every sample and these amount were very much similar for other organisms. Treated water samples were found to be microbiologically accepted than untreated water samples.

Two levels of chemical potassium-0 (K0) and 66 kg K/ha (K66) from muriate of potash (MoP)- were tested with or without straw incorporation. Results showed that the use of K either from inorganic fertilizer or from rice straw increased the plant height, panicles/m2, grain and straw yields of rice in both Boro and T. Aman seasons. However, the effect of K was more distinct in Boro season. On an average, 1.33 t/ha yield benefit of Boro rice was obtained with rice straw incorporation in K0 plot. Application of K significantly increased the total K and P uptake of rice crops. Agronomic efficiency, partial factor productivity and physiological efficiency of K decreased with the increasing K level regardless of K sources in Boro season. Potassium replenishment through chemical fertilizer was not sufficient to balance K. However, incorporation of rice straw showed a positive K balance. Positive perceptible changes in soil characteristics and soil nutrient status (N, P and K) were observed due to K fertilization either from inorganic (MoP) or from organic sources.

Information deficiencies such as incorrectness or inconsistency of data are major determinants that decrease clarity. The Data Pipeline principle has been proposed to overcome the data quality shortcomings, enhance the visibility, and improve performance of the supply chain. In a first elaboration, the Data Pipeline model named the Distributed Trust Backbone (DTB) was designed and implemented in three different countries. In order to discover the effectiveness and feasibility of the model, the visualization of the Data Pipeline’s process flow is urgently required in terms of both real-time detection of system failures and process flow representations. However, there is no process visualization feature available for the Data Pipeline. This challenge is taken up in this paper. We propose a Data Pipeline monitoring system and describe the results of performed simulation tests based on a case study of the international trade lane between Southeast Asia and Europe.</jats:p>"

The objectives of this study were to find out health care access (Supply-side effect) in the garments factory for the women workers and their relation to the productivity. A total of 300 women garment workers were included in this study. Most (60.0%) of the respondents were adolescents, unmarried and having only primary level education (5 years of school education). Their average take home monthly salary was 1791.7 taka which was spent mostly on food. They passed a tight work schedule from 6 AM to 11.30 PM without any rest. Hundred percent of female workers had no previous idea about garments nor had any formal training, but they produced on an average 1016 garment pieces a day. They did not get any vaccine, health education or health related knowledge from the garments factory. There was no provision of health care centre or doctor, treatment for fire burn (other than gas), medicine and support in chronic, severe illness for themselves or their family members. More than half (63.0%) of the respondents mentioned about loss of time due to illness. There was a strong correlation (r=0.858) between sickness and production loss, between hour loss and production loss (r=0.9283), between production loss and percentage loss (r=0.871). Though there was loss due to illness, no health access or facility for women workers in the garments factory was available.

It employs a quantitative approach to analyse a survey of owners, drivers and passengers of the tricycles, to ascertain the role of supply in the creation of the current demand. A probit regression technique was used to model and analyse the likelihood of owners supplying additional tricycles and to also assess factors that determine the choice between motor tricycles and traditional modes of urban transport in Ghana. The study found that owners of tricycles who had reliable riders were 96% more likely to acquire additional tricycles than invest in some composite commodity. Also, commuters chose the tricycle above the traditional modes of urban transport because it significantly reduced their travel time. In addition, riders of the tricycles obtained gainful employment, with monetary rewards worth more than 300% of what minimum wage earners receive in Ghana. Thus, the study validates Say’s Law at the microeconomic level. Therefore, the government of Ghana would need to formally legalize the use of the tricycles for urban transportation, and institute favourable regulations, which will sustain the demand for their services.</jats:p>"

However, absolute differences were much less at the high temperature, where concentrations were also low. The concentrations of the other isoflavones, genistein and biochanin A, were much less affected by phosphate supply than was formononetin. Effects of phosphate on isoflavone concentrations were already evident at leaf emergence; and in phosphate-deficient leaves, concentrations of isoflavones - especially formononetin - increased during the later stages of leaf growth. Isoflavone production per leaf cell seems to be dependent on the supply of carbon substrates in the form of sugars and starch.</jats:p>"
