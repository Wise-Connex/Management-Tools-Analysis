The environmental decision making tool construction is discussed and preliminary results show that it is the working life of a typical product which causes the biggest environmental impact.</jats:p>",

Wheat quality is defined by many different characteristics, which poses limitations on the effectiveness of industry grading schemes in meeting the quality needs of end‐users. Consequently, individual processors may have an incentive to segregate wheat based on their own quality specifications. The costs and benefits of wheat segregation are analysed using a simple economic model, and illustrated with a case study of supply chain management taken from the UK bread industry. Warburtons Ltd procures bread wheat varieties with specific intrinsic quality attributes from Canada using identity preserved supply contracts. The paper concludes that the benefits of wheat quality control will encourage millers and bakers to develop closer vertical linkages with wheat suppliers in the future.</jats:p>",

Only the National Library deals with international loan activity for the whole country. However, this is due less to any policy of centralization than to a legacy from the former regime, where control of all information from the West was required. Since then, the only improvement there has been is that material requested through international loan is no longer censored, but the minimal funds allotted for this service force the librarian to act in some way like a censor, deciding which customers and requests to satisfy. Despite the hard times, the International Loan Section of the National Library of Romania manages to acquire about 700 items from abroad every year.</jats:p>",

The EID system allows for increased accuracy of data loaded, comprehensive information on each animal, reliability and speed of access to data. The system set up by the Borders TAG Initiative provides a system of traceability with proven credibility through each stage of the meat chain.</jats:p>",

We have developed a microcontroller based programmable current supply, tested with superconducting magnets with inductance of 10 mH and 10 H. We achieved a resolution and noise of 4 ppm. The supply has an internal sweep with programmable ramping rate and a possibility for remote operation from a computer with either GPIB or RS232 interface. It is based on an 18-bit D/A converter. The maximum output current is ±10 A, the sweep rate can be set between 1 μA/s–140 mA/s, and the maximum output voltage is ±2.5 V. In work at ultralow temperatures, especially in superconducting quantum interference device NMR, all rf interference to the experiment should be avoided. One of the sources of this kind of unwanted input is the digital switching noise of fast logic devices. We discuss this problem in the context of our design.</jats:p>",

The owners of City of London office buildings, typically the financial institutions, are concerned with the functionality of their properties which influence the short‐ and long‐term returns of this particular type of asset.

Evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of rupture could involve the pattern of its blood supply. With use of angiographic and histological techniques, the blood supply of the Achilles tendon was investigated in 12 human cadaveric specimens. Angiography confirmed Mayer's 1916 finding that the blood supply to the tendon is from three areas: the musculotendinous and osseotendinous junctions and the paratenon, with the posterior tibial artery providing the major contribution. However, qualitative and quantitative histological analyses in this study showed that the Achilles tendon has a poor blood supply throughout its length, as determined by the small number of blood vessels per cross‐sectional area, which do not in general vary significantly along its length. In light of these findings, it is suggested that poor vascularity may prevent adequate tissue repair following trauma, leading to further weakening of the tendon.</jats:p>",

Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), first identified as the most potent stimulator of DNA synthesis in primary hepatocytes, not only stimulates liver regeneration, but also accelerates hepatic function, improves fibrosis, and protects liver cells against injury. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of preoperative portal branch ligation (PBL) (which can induce compensatory hypertrophy of the unaffected lobes) combined with a continuous HGF supply in the performance of extensive hepatectomy in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis was induced by intraperitoneal injections of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) three times per week for 3 weeks. Five days after the last injection, when 70% hepatectomy is lethal, the rats underwent portal ligation of the left lateral and median branches (corresponding to approximately 70% of the total volume of the liver). Simultaneously, they were continuously treated with either recombinant human HGF (rhHGF) or vehicle from an intraperitoneally implanted osmotic pump. Four days after the portal ligation, the occluded lobes were resected. The HGF treatment rapidly increased both the wet weight of the unoccluded lobes and the hepatocellular DNA synthesis. The blood chemical analysis indicated that HGF significantly suppressed the posthepatectomy liver dysfunction. Most importantly, the HGF treatment markedly improved the survival rate of the rats at 48 hours after the major hepatectomy. In conclusion, PBL combined with a continuous HGF supply makes extensive hepatectomy possible in cirrhotic rats, mainly by promoting the hypertrophy of the unaffected lobes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plants grown at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> often acclimate such that their photosynthetic capacities are reduced relative to ambient CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>‐grown plants. Reductions in synthesis of photosynthetic enzymes could result either from reduced photosynthetic gene expression or from reduced availability of nitrogen‐containing substrates for enzyme synthesis. Increased carbohydrate concentrations resulting from increased photosynthetic carbon fixation at elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentrations have been suggested to reduce the expression of photosynthetic genes. However, recent studies have also suggested that nitrogen uptake may be depressed by elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, or at least that it is not increased enough to keep pace with increased carbohydrate production. This response could induce a nitrogen limitation in elevated‐CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> plants that might account for the reduction in photosynthetic enzyme synthesis. If CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> acclimation were a response to limited nitrogen uptake, the effects of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and limiting nitrogen supply on photosynthesis and nitrogen allocation should be similar. To test this hypothesis we grew non‐nodulating soybeans at two levels each of nitrogen and CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration and measured leaf nitrogen contents, photosynthetic capacities and Rubisco contents. Both low nitrogen and elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reduced nitrogen as a percentage of total leaf dry mass but only low nitrogen supply produced significant decreases in nitrogen as a percentage of leaf structural dry mass. The primary effect of elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> was to increase non‐structural carbohydrate storage rather than to decrease nitrogen content. Both low nitrogen supply and elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> also decreased carboxylation capacity (<jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>cmax</jats:sub>) and Rubisco content per unit leaf area. However, when <jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>cmax</jats:sub> and Rubisco content were expressed per unit nitrogen, low nitrogen supply generally caused them to increase whereas elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> generally caused them to decrease. Finally, elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> significantly increased the ratio of RuBP regeneration capacity to <jats:italic>V</jats:italic><jats:sub>cmax</jats:sub> whereas neither nitrogen supply nor plant age had a significant effect on this parameter. We conclude that reductions in photosynthetic enzyme synthesis in elevated CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> appear not to result from limited nitrogen supply but instead may result from feedback inhibition by increased carbohydrate contents.</jats:p>",

Hegney, unpublished data, 1996). Using a Foucauldian framework for analysis of the rural nursing discourses, it presents an interpretation of the statements regarding the administration and supply of medications in rural nursing practice. In particular, it focuses on the supply and administration of medications by rural nurses working in small rural health services. It explains that there are particular issues regarding telephone medication orders and the consequent verification of these orders. It suggests that rural medical practitioners use the power of legislation with regard to the administration and supply of medications to subjugate rural nursing practice. It argues that the nursing profession itself has used, through its silence on the inadequacy of the current Poison Acts and their Regulations, disciplinary power to ensure that rural nursing practice is normalised to metropolitan nursing practice. Further, the lack of educational preparation for this rural nursing role, can be seen as a pedagogical control of rural nursing practice. This paper recommends that the Statute Law regarding the administration and supply of medications be changed to reflect the reality of rural nursing practice, and that rural nurses are prepared adequately for this aspect of rural nursing practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent studies have confirmed the relationship between iron supply and phytoplankton growth rates in all three high‐nitrate low‐chlorophyll (HNLC) oceanic provinces. However, there is little evidence, so far, of the role of iron in altering the efficiency of the biological pump via increased downward export of particulate organic carbon (POC). The NE subarctic Pacific is unique among HNLC regions in that long time series pelagic observations and deep‐moored sediment trap records exist which may provide the best opportunity thus far to test aspects of the iron hypothesis. Episodic elevated levels of chlorophyll <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (&gt; 2.0 μg L<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) were observed 6 times between 1964 and 1976 at the former site of Ocean Station Papa (OSP). In addition, between 1984 and 1990 on at least three occasions, concurrent pulses of POC and biogenic silica were recorded in deep‐moored traps at OSP. Possible explanations for these events, such as lateral advection of more productive waters, iron‐mediated blooms, or grazing by salp swarms are discussed and tested using an existing downward POC flux model. Owing to the episodic nature of such events, no available data are sufficiently comprehensive to unequivocally rule out any of these explanations. Nevertheless, from the data available, the occurrence of pelagic or deep water pulses, approximately once every 3 years, are most consistent with iron‐mediated diatom blooms, and of the sinking of POC and biogenic silica (from such a bloom) to depth, respectively. A comparison of the timing of these iron‐mediated pulses with that of the transport probabilities of atmospheric dust supply from Asia and Alaska provides an opportunity to assess the likelihood of a coupling between the atmosphere and the ocean.</jats:p>",
