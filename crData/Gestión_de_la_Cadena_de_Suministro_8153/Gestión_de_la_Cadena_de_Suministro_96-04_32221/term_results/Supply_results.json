      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern supply chains are expected to respond rapidly, effectively and efficiently to changes in the marketplace. Simultaneously there is the drive to achieve world class customer service levels coupled with minimum reasonable inventory (MRI). We thus have the classic conflict of interests between marketing, production and materials management. Marketing wants the complete product range available off‐the‐shelf; production is still, all too often, looking to manufacture in economic batch quantities so as to achieve economies of scale; and materials management is trying to minimize storage and distribution costs which, in turn, requires that a total systems MRI policy be adopted. Time compression at all stages in the chain is seen as the way to respond to these challenges. The ground rules for effective supply chain design were co‐incidentally established in 1961, when Jay Forrester showed that medium period demand amplification was a system dynamics phenomenon which could be tackled by reducing and eliminating delays and the proper design of feedback loops. In the same year, via his “five rules to avoid bankruptcy” directed at smoothing material flow, Burbidge showed that short period demand amplification was due to multi‐phased, multi‐period ordering policies. Confirms that, on the basis of industrial studies, collapsing cycle times drive the business into a more competitive scenario. This means that time compression strategies based on model simulation may be confidently used to predict improvements in supply chain performance.</jats:p>",

This paper examines the formation of price expectations by Kenyan export‐crop farmers who market their produce through a monopsonistic parastatal. The analysis allows for relaxation of the small‐country assumption within a rational expectations framework. Production behavior is consistent with expectations of future prices based on indicators of aggregate supply and of the marketing board's purchasing capacity. The finding that price forecasts may be formed using information other than previous price levels implies that marketing reforms that raise prices may not raise the relevant price expectations. To elicit a positive supply response, market reforms should be sensitive to farmers' interpretation of institutional signals as well as previous prices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reciprocating-type compressors are widely used for refrigeration systems, and an understanding of piston-ring lubrication in the compressor is vital for designers in reducing the energy losses due to friction because a substantial portion of friction in the compressors is attributable to the piston-ring assembly. This study aimed at developing a one-dimensional analysis for lubrication between the piston-ring and cylinder of refrigeration compressors considering the combined effects of supply oil quantity and surface roughness on piston-ring face and cylinder wall. In the theoretical model, the piston-ring is treated as a one-dimensional dynamically loaded bearing with combined sliding and squeezing motion. The one-dimensional modified Reynolds equation based on the average flow model by Patir and Cheng is used as a governing equation. In the analysis of the modified Reynolds equation, two-types of inlet boundary conditions, flooded condition and starvation condition, are applied at the leading edge according to the supply oil quantity, and the Reynolds boundary condition is applied at the trailing edge. A numerical procedure is then developed to estimate the cyclic variation of minimum film thickness, inlet and outlet positions of lubrication film and friction force, and the combined effects of supply oil quantity and surface roughness height are examined for a typical refrigeration compressor. It is clarified from the numerical results that the supply oil quantity and surface roughness affect significantly the friction force of the piston-ring for refrigeration compressors.</jats:p>",

Because objectives are not clear, programme strategy fails to include all the issues and activities which are necessary to achieve the maximum beneficial impact on participating communities. In the paper, target objectives, checklists of programme activities, and staffing requirements are proposed. The subject of programme impact is briefly discussed, and a realistic approach to programme evaluation is outlined.

In general, linear programming was found to be a good modelling option for generating optimized pump schedules and service reservoir releases. The analyses of water management alternatives confirmed that RMOC's water supply system was designed for maximum day water demand; however, day-to-day operations would be facilitated if present storage and (or) treatment facilities were enlarged. Economically, it would be difficult to justify construction costs from the potential energy savings obtained from this study and therefore it seems important to start managing demand.

The usefulness of C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grasses for this purpose hinges on the assumption that their photosynthetic discrimination against <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C remains constant in a wide range of environmental conditions. We tested this assumption by examining the effects of light and water stress on the carbon isotope composition of C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grasses using different biochemical subtypes (NADP‐ME, NAD‐ME, PCK) in glasshouse experiments. We grew 14 different C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grass species in four treatments: sun‐watered, sun‐drought, shade‐watered and shade‐drought. Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) rarely remained constant. In general, Δ values were lowest in sun‐watered grasses, greater for sun‐drought plants and even higher for plants of the shade‐watered treatment. The highest Δ values were generally found in the most stressed grasses, the shade‐drought plants. Grasses of the NADP‐ME subtype were the least influenced by a change in environmental variables, followed by PCK and NAD‐ME subtypes. Water availability affected the carbon isotope discrimination less than light limitation in PCK and NAD‐ME subtypes, but similarly in NADP‐ME subtypes.</jats:p><jats:p>In another experiment, we studied the effect of increasing light levels (150 to 1500 μmol photons m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) on the Δ values of 18 well‐watered C<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> grass species.

Below this light level, Δ values increased with decreasing irradiance for all biochemical subtypes. The change in A was less pronounced in NADP‐ME and PCK than in NAD‐ME grasses. Grasses grown in the field and in the glasshouse showed a similar pattern. Thus, caution should be exercised when using C4 plants under varying environmental conditions to monitor the concentration or carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 in field/glasshouse studies or climate reconstruction.</jats:p>",

We used this in vitro model to study oxygen supply and consumption as well as the response to reduced oxygenation during the earliest stages of development. EBs were found to grow equally well when cultured at 20% (normoxia) or 1% (hypoxia) oxygen during the first 5 days of differentiation. Microelectrode measurements of pericellular oxygen tension within 13- to 14-day-old EBs (diameter 510-890 micron) done at 20% oxygen revealed efficient oxygenation of the EBs' core region. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis of EBs incubated with fluorescent dyes that specifically stain living cells confirmed that the cells within an EB were viable. To determine the EBs' capability to sense low oxygen tension and to specifically respond to low ambient oxygen by modulating gene expression we quantified aldolase A and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNAs, since expression of these genes is upregulated by hypoxia in a variety of cells. Compared with the normoxic controls, we found increased aldolase A and VEGF mRNA levels after exposing 8- to 9-day-old EBs to 1% oxygen. We propose that EBs represent a powerful tool to study oxygen-regulated gene expression during the early steps of embryogenesis, where the preimplantation conceptus resides in a fluid environment with low oxygen tension until implantation and vascularization allow efficient oxygenation.</jats:p>",

IE is measured as the ratio of newly established lesions on trap plants relative to the inoculum present in a canopy, i.e. lesions artificially established on source plants, IE of the rice sheath blight pathogen, <jats:italic>Rhizoctonia solani</jats:italic>, was studied under semi‐controlled conditions in which the effects of the following factors were measured; contact frequency among host tissues, amount and location of inoculum in the canopy, leaf wetness regime, and nitrogen content of the host plant. The conduciveness of these factors to sheath blight infection was measured in terms of IE which was expressed as the ratio of the density of daughter lesions on trap rice hills to the density of mother lesions on the inoculated quadrat hills. IE generally declined with the three successive batches of trap hills used in the experiments. It was significantly higher at closer plant spacings and under interrupted leaf wetness regimes. IE was not affected by the amount, nor by the location, of inoculum (mother lesions) in the canopy, but was significantly lower in hills with high total nitrogen content.</jats:p>",

Research was conducted in a greenhouse, using 36 undisturbed foil columns (20 cm i.d. and 90 cm length) collected with a Meta-Drill vibrating core sampler from a Fox sandy loam soil at Harrow Research Centre. Corn grown in the 80-cm water-table depth had the greatest degree of water stress, as indicated by low volumetric soil water content, low stomatal conductance and transpiration rates, and elevated soil-surface and leaf-surface temperatures. There was a substantial increase in plant dry weight and grain yields as the N rates increased from 0 to 135 kg ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> with the 30- and 60-cm water-table depths. Under our experimental conditions, maximum grain yields were obtained with a 60-cm water-table depth. Grain yields were significantly reduced with the 80-cm water-table depth. With this water-table depth, grain yield was also reduced by N addition. Key words: Water-table management, Zea mays, yield, stomatal conductance, leaf temperature </jats:p>",

The amplitude of the circadian rhythm of photosynthesis was also diminished under these conditions, and the pH compensation points in a closed system were higher in the presence of blue light and during the circadian day. These observations suggest that blue light and the circadian clock regulate the activity of a carbon acquisition system in these plants. The inhibitor of external carbonic anhydrase, acetazolamide, reduced overall rates of photosynthesis by only about 30%, but ethoxyzolamide suppressed the circadian rhythm of photosynthesis almost completely and markedly reduced the duration of responses to blue light pulses. Similar patterns were obtained when photosynthesis was measured in strongly limiting DIC concentrations (0–0.5 mol m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup>). Since blue light stimulated photosynthesis under these conditions of strong carbon limitation, we suggest that blue light activates the release of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from an internal CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> store. We propose a metabolic pathway with similarities to that of CAM plants. Non‐photosynthetic fixation leads to the accumulation of a storage metabolite. The circadian clock and blue light control the mobilization of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at the site of decarboxylation of this metabolite. In the presence of continuous blue light the pathway is proposed to cycle and act as a pump for CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> into the chloroplasts. This hypothesis helps to explain a number of previously reported peculiarities of brown algal photosynthesis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>In saturating irradiances of red light, photosynthesis of <jats:italic>Laminaria saccharina</jats:italic> (L.) Lamouroux was stimulated by low irradiances of continuous blue light only when the supply of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was limiting. The degree of this stimulation was inversely proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of free CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, whether this was adjusted by varying the total DIC or the pH at a given DIC concentration. The final pH reached in a closed system was higher in blue light than in red light. Both acetazolamide and ethoxyzolamide suppressed the responses to blue light almost completely, but reduced photosynthesis in red light by only 30%. Buffering the pH of the seawater also suppressed the stimulation of photosynthesis by blue light without affecting the photosynthetic rate in red light. The transient stimulation of O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> evolution by a blue light pulse was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> consumption. These observations could be explained if, in analogy to the mechanism proposed for Ectocarpus (Schmid, Mills &amp; Dring 1996, <jats:italic>Plant Cell and Environment</jats:italic> 19,373–382, this issue, accompanying paper), photosynthesis was supported by a blue‐light‐activated release of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> from an internal store. We suggest that the store is located in the vacuoles of the cortical tissue of the blades. The main photosynthetic tissue, however, is in the overlying meristoderm, and blue‐light‐activated mobilization of the store could stimulate O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> evolution only if periplasmic carbonic anhydrase was available to facilitate CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> uptake from the cortex.</jats:p>",
